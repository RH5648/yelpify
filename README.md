## Introductrion
We are building a meal/user recommedation system based on Yelp academic databases.  
The databases we used are review, user, and business.  
Review database has the contents of review, who worte this review (UserID), and which business is this review for (business ID).  
User database covers the demographic information of the user.  
Business database includes rating of businerss and geographic information.  

## Datasets
The datasets we used is from yelp academic database:  
https://www.yelp.com/dataset   
We use three of them, they are review, user, and business.  
Review database has the contents of review, who wrote this review (user ID), which business review is for (business ID).  
Users database has the demographic information of the user.  
Business database has the rating of business and geographic information.  

## Use cases
We have two use cases:
For Yelp user, they use this system to get recommendations based on their previous reviews or demographics data.
For business owner, they use this system to find out what kind of user like their food and which feature attracts clients most.
