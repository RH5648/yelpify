## Functional Specification
### Background
Recommender systems are beneficial to both service providers and users. People have too many options to use in this age of information explosion. With overload options, people are not sure what they really need. Recommendation system reduces the decision-making time of users. It can not only accurately predict the user’s behavior, but also expand the user’s field of vision, helping users find things that they may be interested in but not so easy to find. The same recommendation system also benefits merchants, through more precise targeting of target users and gaining exposure. Using the yelp data set, we try to provide accurate meal recommendations for users on yelp, as well as businesses with user groups who appreciate their services more.
