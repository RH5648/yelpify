The entire menu - and its an extensive one - is vegetarian.  The cooking style is vietnamese which I am pretty familiar with.  I would have to say this restaurant - to date - is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA. 

Tried the Bun Bo Hue - a spicy noodle soupy dish that I always order whenever it is offered - and it was fantastic!  Had a great amount of spice and tasted pretty authentic.  It was a little low on the salt but that was easily remedied. 

My husband ordered the banh canh - soupy noodle dish - which he really enjoyed as well.

The broth to both soups was just really really good!

The cha gio or egg rolls/ fried spring rolls (?) were fantastic!!!  I like the vegetarian ones 100% better than the pork ones and the ones offered at White Lotus are exceptional.  I think there is some sort of taro filling?  And they also use rice paper to wrap the rolls instead of the egg paper that other places normally use.  

The restaurants itself is decent - spacious and clean.  It does smell like incense though ... probably a shout out to Buddha.  

Parking can be a pain.

The desserts are AWFUL.  The tricoloured dessert - che ba mau - is not edible.  They must use half a kilogram of sugar in each serving.  There are also barely any mung beans and barely any coconut milk.  I have never tasted a Che Ba Mau that was as awful as the one served here.  

The soursop shake was not that great either - kind of bland and missing the necessary tart.  

The deep fried banana was okay ... it came served with some gross icing.  Not good.

Other than the desserts, I was impressed and will be back.

The prices are fabulous too.  They can't be beat!!!!

LOVE this place!!!",2010-12-17 00:02:08

I am glad that everywhere we went before this that night had a long wait because I had been wanting to come here for a while. Our server was really nice and gave us some great recommendations. We tried the deep fried deviled eggs which I thought were really good (definitely an interesting taste, but a good one), and they were served with a really good hot sauce aioli. My boyfriend and I both got the short ribs which came highly recommended and they were AMAZING. Yummmm. So tender and great flavor, and the mashed potatoes were great as well. I got a red wine recommended by the server and it was really good too. Our friend got the osso bucco which I tried also. It was okay but I didn't like it nearly as much as the short ribs. Good ambiance and I will definitely be coming back. The patio looked really nice but it was way too hot on this particular day to sit out there.",2013-07-09 16:53:56

The transformation from a typical suburban mall to an upscale shopping destination is totally amazing.  I enjoy strolling through the mall to go window-shopping and people watching.  It is also a great place to grab al bite to eat either inside the mall or at one of the other South-Park area dining establishments (such as Cowfish).

After finding one gift for my Dad we decided to get some lunch.  Honestly, Squirrel Hill has so many great places that it's tough to decide.  We decided on getting some pizza, but which one?  Again, there are so many.

We decided upon Aiello's and called ahead to place our order.  You can eat there or take out.   We took it back to my place.  We decided upon the ""White Pie""  which is butter-garlic sauce and provolone cheese.  We got a 12-cut, 16oz pizza with tomatoes, spinach, and sausage on it.  I figured my husband could eat the leftovers for lunch.

The pizza was very good, but a little pricey here.  It was something like $25.00 for ours.  Oh and it's ""cash-only"", but they do have an on-site ATM.  For your convenience!",2009-11-23 16:43:02

The arcade is a bit dated but I like playing the big trivia game more than anything (again, you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit).

This place is made for walking around, checking out shops and grabbing something to drink and eat. I really enjoy the different shops available here, like Charming Charlie's (for something trendy) to Williams-Sonoma (for something traditional). The restaurants are generally grouped together so you can pick and choose where to eat without having to drive to the other side of The District, but it's of walking distance. There are also local events throughout the month at The District that help bring the community together and a lot of the time it is family friendly.

The restaurant managers/owners generally I think underestimate the power of mentioning a bit more details on the menu or at least a server who is knowledgeable about ingredients. In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided. 

So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.

However the food did not arrive all together and out of respect for others, all of us had to wait. Which resulted in food going cold. 

The congee and bun were as good as they can be",2017-12-11 19:22:57

Charming little restaurant with authentic Cambodian decor
Spring rolls were made just right and had the right crisp factor 
BYOB - we brought our wine and they provided a bottle opener

CONS
No host/hostess at the front door so we sat ourselves and waited for over ~10 min and another party walked in as well. Awcko taco.
The AC felt like it wasn't on and had to ask for the ceiling fan to be turned she didn't, so we turned it on ourselves.
The papaya salad was a little ""too authentic"" for me. There were little fish heads and the first bite I felt sick, it was OVERLY fishy 

The overall experience was just a little underwhelming. The noodles we had were very average they are comparable to the Chinese version of beef chow fun...this was way out of way and we won't be dining here again.",2016-07-12 19:00:26

I don't eat the food but when I go to one of these places for coffee I expect it quickly.  Last time I went they didn't even have large cups so the gave me a small and a medium.

Dumplings made fresh in house and is filled with savoury toppings and food...comes out piping hot. The stir fried udon like noodles were deliciously fresh but a bit too oily.

I've spent a decent amount of time at Le Cartet. It's a naturally-lit, airy, above street space, where solo business guys on their laptops nestle up next to brunching felines on one side and a young family with a highchair on the other.

Service can run at a snail's pace. Attempt to catch the server's eye or get ready to wait a while for an order to be taken or the bill to arrive. 

Coffees are fresh, juices are fresher. The ham and eggs breakfast is okay - a couple of pieces of thinly sliced salty ham and eggs scrambled, boiled or poached. But what makes it worth it? The duck fat fried potato wedges. They're a show stopper. I'd come back just for those!",2012-02-19 15:20:11

We were the youngest people in the place.  And I'm no spring chicken.

The decor has not been cleaned in ages.  Cool decor, but for God's sake... clean it.  Spruce it up.

The view over the creek in the back was nice.  Very nice.  Not awe inspiring.

The food.  Oh... the food.  Well, to start, they brought out a dish of olives and radishes.  I believe there was like... one of each?  Weird.  Very weird.  

The meal, although not bad, was not all that and a bad of chips.  Heck, I didn't even call my mother, much less write home about it.  

The veggies were all weirdly julienned.  LIke we were getting served nursing home food.  Very overcooked. Hmmm.

The meal. (veal marsala?  I couldn't tell... honestly.)  It was OK.  Just OK.  

Service was fine.  Very nice.  Place was quiet.  Think... morgue.  

Interestly enough, we apparently were ""lucky"" enough to sit by the one couple on the planet that just received their first cell phone.  Yes, they were THOSE type of people, loudly yelling into their phone, thinking that EVERYONE wanted to hear their insipid conversation.  If the chairs weren't so old fashioned and heavy, I might have tried swinging one at them.  Sigh.

Will I want to go back?  Maybe when I'm 80, and need overcooked, julienne veggies.  Meh.  I don't get the appeal.  Honestly.  Maybe it's from folks who just don't get out much?  Way too pricey for the quality.",2013-05-23 02:23:33
qxWuZYB3wvZCXg95b7f0yw,Nik-rm1rk2g_ZXiVP-YDaw,pCZv2GSOY8D8D-x0ZBf5uw,5,0,1,0,"From our first time playing at Bear Creek we saw a big difference from other courses we'd played.

Hubby and I have become regulars here because both courses are beautiful, well-maintained, and the entire staff is very welcoming and service-oriented... management, food services, pros, starters, cart attendants... even the grounds crew! 

The pace of play is well managed, even at the executive course with lots of families, juniors, & beginners, and we play here A LOT! Is there a crazy day occasionally, sure, but it's certainly not the norm. Most folks are laid back, relaxed and enjoying the day.

Coolers on the cart let us take plenty of bottles of water along, so no water on the course has never been a problem (& we don't like drinking from those big orange water coolers we find at other courses that are left unsupervised to general public...yeah, it's a little creepy when you think about it). 

A big table with cups, lids, ice & cold water is set up fresh every day in the restaurant for self service during the summer months & a cup of ice water is always available for the asking in other months. And if that's not enough, a bottle of water is only .50 cents or you're welcome to bring your own WATER bottles to toss in the cooler! 

This could be better explained to new folks, but I guess that's what yelp is for! ;-)

The food at the Bears Den is both reasonable AND delicious! Hubby craves the breakfast burrito and I plan tee times or practice around lunch with the freshly grilled chicken cesar salad. There's no prepackaged anything from this kitchen! 

The Friday fish fry is amazing in the spring (make a reservation cuz lots of folks come in for that), and the new Sunday brunch starts tomorrow (yes, we made a tee time around it...I saw the menu!)

Finally, I have to recognize the outstanding golf pros here! I've had regular lessons with Brian Calhoun, but I've heard multiple positive comments for Mike Barnett as well.

Six months ago I had been playing the executive course with hubby a few times each month and doing ""ok"" but not really improving. I saw that Brian had women only group lessons available and decided to give it a try. 

I had never had a pro lesson before (just lotsa well-meaning help from friends) so of course I was nervous at first, hitting almost every warm-up shot everywhere but in the middle of the range...auuugh!

Brian instantly put me at ease by observing right where I was at and explaining some foundational things in such a way that I was actually able to DO IT with immediate improvement that continues today!

I've become a regular student with Brian and a terrific group of ladies of all ages and abilities. I'm now so much more confident and relaxed even when paired up with folks I don't know or when the course is busy and pace of play is important, even playing without hubby when he can't go (Soooo much better than waiting for him to be able to play, right?!)

Golf is supposed to be more fun than frustrating, & I'm so grateful for Brian's teaching ability as I'm now able to rely on my own knowledge to make the adjustments to my shots that just seem to gradually but continuously improve. 

After we're done playing, there's a full bar at the 19th hole, and though their license doesn't permit hard liquor out on the course, they carry a wonderful wine based vodka that makes a delicious bloody mary that I think is even better than regular vodka!

In conclusion, this AFFORDABLE public golf course is a quiet gem in an ocean of courses (oh yeah, did I mention that no houses line the course and the view from the restaurant is stunning?). I almost hesitate to share all the positives of this course and keep it to ourselves, but it seems under-utilized for all the wonderful amenities.

Give it a try...we hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

The marshalls didn't do anything but drive around. It is a nice course and beautiful neighborhood, but hard to overcome the frustration.

The holes are interesting. The greens were in decent shape. It is a good drive from The Strip. It was very hot. You definitely felt like desert. The golf carts with the GPS are nice. Because of the reseeding it was cart path only. The practice area is ok. The starter Steve was by far the most helpful.

The interior is as flashy as its nondescript exterior, which is not at all, but as warned by fellow Yelpers, the case was half empty by time I arrived at around 10:00.

Fortunately, there were a few maple bacon donuts left so I went with one of those, along with a chocolate frosted cake donut and a couple of the most gigantic apple fritters that I have ever seen. The nice ""donutista"" server even tossed in a few donut holes on the house. Total damage: A modest 7 bucks. Righteous!

The fritters were had the perfect crunchy outside and soft inside. The donuts were also moist and tasty. The maple bacon consisted of a yeast ring generously topped with bacon crumbles and the donut holes were light, airy and perfectly frosted.

Good quality shrimp for tempura.  Don't remember ever ordering veggies or noodles though - we stick to sushi and protein.  Never had any issues with waitstaff or service.

Love the eel handrolls and spicy salmon handrolls.

We have tried other AYCE places to see what all the fuss is about - but this one is still the best for cooked foods and premium rolls.

Food comes super fast.  Not attentive service but definitely efficient.  They get you in and out of there fast.

We go there for dinner as well.  No hassles when we order multiple rounds of sashimi.  They now have sweet shrimp sashimi at dinner.  And have added new dessert offerings although we are not too crazy about the ginger milk dessert - very gingery but not creamy enough.

So EOS offers a lot of different variety and an open area to do some alternative style exercises which is absolutely great.

Vermicelli bowls are excellent. Noodles perfectly al dente and served slightly warm. Lots of fresh herbs, meat on top always tender and well seasoned. BBQ pork is my top pick but the beef is also very good, sweet and peppery.

Fried egg rolls are served with generous portions of fresh herbs, lettuce and pickled veg. Fun to wrap up and dip in the fish sauce.

The food came and my udon noodles were decent enough, very thick goopy sauce though. And my partner's chow mein was disgusting. They literally took egg noodles, floured them and DEEP FRIED them! OMG!

Fair warning - their small salads are actually pretty big. The large is HUGE so be aware when you order! The service is always good here and they are fast!",2018-09-08 14:07:32

It's a lovely homey Italian herbs smell that you encounter when you walk in and I was corrected by Jimmy when I made such a comment that actually it's a Sicilian smell! I had the special of the shop, which is a pepperoni roll which for me, I got some pieces of bread that tasted a wee bit raw. But it was accompanied by the most deliciously lovely marinara sauce and I grabbed a spoon and ate gobfuls!

This place is a lovely bit of local colour in the Strip District and definitely step in to check it out and get the marinara sauce! Everyone in the store is super friendly and oh also if you want to use the loo, just ask a member of staff for the key!

Had 1950 points expiring and because we aren't hardly home, we had to book somewhere close and fast. This was a good choice. Booked a 3bd penthouse for 2 nights, since that was all that was available for the time we could do it on short notice, at 4500 points. Pleasantly surprised with the decor and colors. Although, for a penthouse I was expecting a little more space, we were on the top floor with a view of the pool , and the patio was acessed from the living room, the 3rd bd, and the master. It was quite long and spacious. The dining and living areas were a little small.  If we had a full house, it might have seemed crowded. 

Good thing was 3 bathrooms, one for each bedroom. Luckily for hubby, because he uses one of the other bathrooms when the master bath only has one sink. Which this one did, and the shower stall was awkward. The other 2 bathrooms had tub showers, but there was more room, and there were towel bars right next to them, whereas in the master shower the is nowhere to hang the towel nearby. There's a lot if space, but it's just space. Each tub was jetted.  

Staff was friendly upon checkin, and service calls were answered quickly. We called because we thought the sink in the master bath wasn't draining. Come to find out, it's one of those where you push down on the plunger. Learned something new!

This location was actually where we purchased our Worldmark membership in 2012. Went up to the owners update at 830a on the day of checkout since we only stayed 2 nights. Thankfully they did away with the sales presentations.  Maybe they finally realized that it's a waste of their time and ours if we aren't interested in buying points.

They only serve breakfast and noodles in soup (with the exception of braised beef) before 11am, which is when the chef comes in. Most of their other menu pages do say that these are not served before 11am, but there are other pages that do not have time restrictions on them, and I thought these would be available. I was wrong.

Their breakfast menu is fairly limited. They also have no room for substitutions. I ordered a combo that included luncheon meat with macaroni in soup and condensed milk on toast ($4.75). This also came with a drink. I wanted instant noodles instead of macaroni, because I do not like macaroni in soup. I told my parents my order, and went to grab a few groceries. I got back just in time to see them put macaroni in soup down on our table. My parents then told me that they did not do substitutions. They couldn't just upcharge me for the noodles? I mean, they have instant noodles with other available menu items. Taste-wise, the luncheon meat and macaroni in soup was exactly what I expected. I ended up adding chili oil and ketchup. The condensed milk on toast was a bit of a shocker. I'm a sucker for condensed milk on toast. I'm also accustomed to getting two slices of bread when I order this at other places. This is a sandwich. Today, it was once slice of toast with a a small amount of condensed milk drizzled on. It was also served open-faced, but cut in half. I ended up making my own sandwich out of the two halves. The two middle bites did taste like condensed milk on toast, but the rest of it just tasted mostly like bread. Disappointing. Oh. The macaroni in soup was small too.

Four of us were at breakfast. We ended up ordering two meals. We received one spoon, one fork, one knife, and two napkins. We asked for bowls, and we were given one bowl. We then asked for another one. My macaroni meal came first. That one came with just a spoon (Yeah. Our spoon, fork, and knife were for two different meals). I can eat my macaroni and my luncheon meat with a spoon, but that's when I'm being lazy at home and I don't want to wash extra cutlery. If I'm at a restaurant and especially if I'm expected to pay tips, I would hope I get more than just a spoon to eat luncheon meat with. Mindblown.

Oh. Right. We have a VIP card. We paid for it a while back. It gets us 10% off. Apparently, breakfast does not count in this. Not cool.

I will do what I can to avoid breakfast here, especially if it's close to 11am. I'd rather wait for another restaurant to open.

Aside: Thing that happened. I do not blame the restaurant for this. There was a couple at the table next to us. The man had sausage, eggs, and hash browns. He was cutting his sausage, and a piece shot off and landed in my personal bubble. Actually in my personal bubble. It was on the floor about two inches away from my jacket.

It would be nice if they would start offering a small bowl, but I don't mind the leftovers ;)
Their pho is not the cheapest compared to AsiaTown ($10 for the deluxe pho with everything in it!), but it one of few Vietnamese options in the suburbs, so it's worth saving on gas. It helps that I don't work too far away.

For the table, we got a couple of complimentary baskets of Italian breads.  Super flaky and soft/warm on the inside.  It was sooo warm and great.

The sausage.  Oh man, the sausage was so good!  It was salty and filled with herbs.  It was really the star of the dish.  Man, so good!

As you walk in, you can see someone already making dumplings from scratch at the front. It is quite cramped, service is not exceptional, and the order sheet is entirely in Chinese (so bring a friend who can read Chinese!) so those are things to consider if you're used to a more Westernized dining style and service. 

From all the dumplings I've tried they are fantastic. What I'd recommend:
- Fried pork dumplings (wo tip)
- Green onion pancake
- Any of their steamed dumplings (I think lamb was good and also leek & pork)
- Hotpots (I got the one which is translated as Lion's Head hotpot which came with a nice healthy soup base with nappa and pork balls)

All-in-all the prices was very reasonable and the food was filling. I think dumplings range around $4-6, and the hotpot I got was $7.99. Food gave a very homey and warm feeling, great on a cold night.

I came in earlier today to give this business another chance because the favorable reviews spoke much louder than my first impression. Jina was very friendly and did not press you to add on more to the services you're requesting. I asked her to thread my eyebrows as well as my upper lip. It has been nearly 2 months since I've catered to my eyebrows and they were pretty beastly. She was very quick and the whole service was painless. She was very friendly and had a great attitude. I will continue to come to her for all my threading needs and you should too! I am so happy with the shape of my brows!!",2017-08-12 23:21:27

It is super spacious and their decor is incredibly beautiful! There were plenty of guests who actually dressed up fancy to come eat here... I guess I didn't get the memo! Haha 

They're known for the live cooking option - you get to pick what raw meat and veggies you want and bring it over to the wok section where you can choose your sauce and they'll cook it in front of you! The idea is cool, but there's only one person cooking it so the line up is very long and time consuming ... maybe they have more people cooking it during weekends? Anyway, I can clearly tell the guy did not enjoy his job... A lot of people don't like their jobs either but they still manage to fake a smile :) 

Quality wise the food is average, just like any other Chinese restaurant but I don't think it's that good of a selection ... I'm a picky eater though so maybe that's why none of the food really stood out to me. One thing I really liked though was that they had spicy mayo and seaweed salad in their sushi section!

I really like the drinks were self-serve AND included in the price! They had a few pop fountains and fridges full of water bottles! They even had one fridge turned off for room temperature water which is a really nice touch!

With drinks being self-serve, there really isn't any need for a server unless you wanted to order alcohol, tea or coffee instead and to clear up your table. It did get annoying because our plates would either be cleared too slow or it'd be cleared really fast but they'd take my drink with them so I had to constantly walk back to the buffet area and get a new drink.... 

I probably wouldn't ever initiate going back here myself, but if there was a large party or family and friends wanted to go here then I'll return.",2017-08-25 03:09:47

One of the unintended consequences of my golfing in Arizona is I spend much of my time in the desert chasing balls.  So I thought it would be a good idea to become more familiar with my surroundings - and the McDowell Sonoran Preserve was perfect for that.  We went to the Gateway trail head, simply because it was the easiest to get to, and we lucked out.  It has a very nice visitor center with restrooms, ample parking, and brochures on the various trails. It also has an interpretative trail with signs, information boards, and examples of desert flora and fauna. This trail is paved  and easy to traverse, and I would recommend it for those people that want to see and learn about the desert, but have difficulty walking.

There are a number of other trails throughout the Preserve varying in difficulty and elevation change, so a person has a number of different choices of hiking trails.  One can even hike to the top of the mountain. But one of the things I like best about the preserve is that there are a number of trails that children would enjoy and would not be to difficult for them to hike.

I understand this is part of the City of Scottsdale's Park Department, and we should be proud of the preserve.  Since our original visit to Gateway, we have tried a number of different trails and trail heads, and have enjoyed them all.  Be sure to take your camera, and be careful not to brush up against any of the cacti. My wife accidentally stepped on some when she was taking pictures, and I had to use pliers to pull the barbs out of the soles of her boots.

It's a beautiful area, and the residents of the valley are very lucky to have free access to trails of this caliber. We should all take advantage of it, whether to hike, bike, or simply stroll though the desert scenery. It's beautiful !!!",2010-03-01 02:05:14

I was even more hopeful when that mortar full of chunky, ideally lemon-tinged guacamole came out along with a batch of oily, brittle tortilla chips. 

The salsa, which I all but totally ignored, tasted to have originated from a economy-sized aluminum can pulled from a Big Lots shelf. Lifeless, it merely smacked of watery Ragu and a packet of salad seasoning. 

My burrito, properly fat, was stuffed with ground beef that apparently was ""filled out"" by ground turkey. I've had ground turkey. I know how grainy it can be. I know its flavor. It isn't nauseating by any means, but damn it...

Why I ordered churros for dessert, I can't explain. Perhaps I thought that maybe there was a chance they'd be made on the premises, but they were too uniform, too pristine, too cryogenic. I kept wondering which convenience store I could get them from, that apple filling recalling The Clown or Tiny Deborah In The Cellophane Dress. 

Each dish was plated gorgeously, however. 

Many of these Mexican places keep popping up in the suburbs of Western Pennsylvania of late, and I can't help but suspect that they are all part of a chain that's trying to hide the fact that it is a many-tentacled chain. The menus are the same. The food's the same. Only the names differ.

3. Service is hit or miss.  I can imagine the stress of being the sole Starbucks in Lakewood and being so busy, but I'd appreciate consistent, pleasant service.

It's a pretty basic restaurant in a strip mall on Kings.  They serve a buffet at lunch that has 6 - 8 options on it - they're all good, if a little bland.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the food while I'm eating it, it just doesn't blow me away.  It's as if Maharani is being a little stingy with the flavor...

I also occasionally grab take-out from here.  I like to order the Palak Paneer (creamed spinach with chunks of paneer cheese) and the chicken or shrimp tikka masala.  The naan is always hot - but again, just a little lacking in flavor.  The take-out portions are quite large - we always have leftovers if we order 2 entrees and an appetizer (for two people).

Risotto was way too al dente. The waitress came to take our order, give us food, and get us to pay the bill. No real service in between to ask if needed anything else, didn't like the food, needed water refills. The resto was moderately busy. 

The floors look nasty, Some areas do not smell great. The bathroom is comically tiny - look at the sink! 

When the plates were being picked up by another employee we told him that the risotto was undercooked. Our waitress overheard and came over finally. She offered to re make the dish but frankly that would have worked over 20min before as we were waiting to have her come to the ya me to check on us.

As soon as I stood in line with my date, we both noticed one thing. Despite having only FOUR people in front of me, the line is moving SLOW, even for the cashier register!

Once we both got to the front, there was these two dudes on the bar trying to wake this other guy up because he was passed the fuck out. 

We ordered our meals, totaling almost $25, and I gave my name so they can call the ticket.

We waited, waited, and WAITED! We got our lemonades quickly, but as I was checking the time, I realized that the order was already taking more than 25 minutes. The bitchy grandma cashier/busser was walking by, I called her over to examine our ticket and the time. She rudely replied that it isn't done yet and stormed off.

Are you serious? Reuben's are composed of thinly sliced meat that can be cooked quickly, toasted bread, thousand island sauce, sauerkraut, etc. How the hell can the line not come up with my order within TEN minutes? My companion ordered her chicken tenders and fries, which is as simple as dropping both into the frying station. 

How fucking long does it take to cook thin meat and bread on a flat top? 

Both of us work in the restaurant industry, and we went straight to the front to reseat ourselves at the bar to keep a close eye on the line and the unsold tickets sprawled out on the counter. 

By the 30 minute mark, we saw our meals piled on the counter in to-go boxes. My girl tried to get the old lady's attention since the front is EMPTY. Grandma NEVER called my name nor our order number (#270). And then the old bitch fucking ignored her!

The space is a reclaimed TTC barn and has five 'barns'  each labeled with giant steel numbers.  First is the artist live-work space, 2 is the event space where you will find the market on Saturdays in the winter and various other community events, 3 is the community theatre, 4 is The Stop greenhouse and kitchen, and 5 is the open air barn.  There is also a children's playground on the east side of the building, an open field that becomes an ice rink in the winter on the south end, an off-leash dog park at the south-west corner, beach volleyball court on the west side, and plenty of benches and picnic tables scattered throughout.

I find that their website is not as informative as it could be, perhaps because it is administered by the umbrella Artscape organization:
http://www.torontoartscape.on.ca/places-spaces/artscape-wychwood-barns

So it's better to go directly to the Stop's website to find out about the market and the many very interesting fund- and awareness-raising events they have:  http://www.thestop.org/green-barn-market

I find that being on the mailing lists for The Stop and our local city councillor Joe Mihevc (http://www.joemihevc.com) keeps me informed of upcoming events like the solar energy info session this Sunday.

Some additional notes:

** The Market **
During the cold months it is indoors and runs 8 a.m. - noon.  It gets crowded by 11 and goodies like cinnamon buns don't last until then.  Bring cash, your own bags and if you're really good, your own travel-mug for the wonderful Kurtis coffee.  Interesting vendors include the venison guy, sweet potato man, Mennonite meat lady, knife sharpening guy, tofu dude, the fungi, and the freshwater fish people.

In the warmer months it is outdoors and runs a bit later until 1 I think (it is still indoors as I write this so I'm not sure).   The vendors are spread out over the walkways under their tents.  Half the fun is stopping to chat with neighbours so check your usual Toronto sidewalk pace as you might get stuck behind a stroller and wagon jam.

There are several vegetable vendors that also sell organic and heirloom variety seeds and seedlings in the spring.  Too bad last summer was so cold and rainy - even so the purple tomatoes I planted were wonderful!

** The Dogpark **
It has weird hours and no commercial dog walkers are allowed.  It is closed everyday between noon-3 p.m. and opens later in the morning on Sunday.  I'll take a picture of the sign next time I'm there because it's confusing.  

There is a human + dog drinking fountain but the city doesn't turn on the water until mid-May so bring water for your pooches.

Best doggy party times (as with most parks I'm sure) are from 5 - 7 p.m.  There might be a morning party but I'm never up early enough to find out.",2010-04-15 05:44:12

The 13 mile road is one way, and there are places to stop, park your car, and look around.  Last time we were there, we stopped at the first stop and did some hiking on the trail plus some rock scrambling.  We've also did some hiking at a couple of other stops along the route.  One stop led to a waterfall.  Unfortunately, the waterfall was more like a trickle at the time we visited last Summer.

Or do u just stand there waiting for one of them to say I can help u? There is no signs to tell u where to go and there is no dividers or ropes to guide u. 
So I walk in stand for a few seconds and one of the service coordinator people asked if they could help, I walked up to the desk told them what I was there for and he quickly took care of me. I got in and out before my appt. He said he would give me a call when the car was ready.

Their website said to call for a quote. I did so and was told from the employee on the phone that they would charge $30 to clean my car inside and out. I was pretty surprised as I found that pretty cheap so I double checked with him to make sure I heard right. I did.  When I pulled up to the car wash, I told the guy that I was quoted for $30 and he kinda looked at me like I was crazy. He went to see a who I assume to be the owner or manager and the manager told me that to do not offer quotes over the phone and that they do not even have a $30 package. Then he accusingly said "" you probably told the guy your car was very clean didn't you"". He was bordering on rude the way he asked me.  I was never asked any questions on the phone. Then he told me that it would be $60 .  A bit surprising , but I needed to get my car washed so I did it.   As I said they guy that washed my car did a great job.

HUGE shame they didn't open with their patio ready to go, but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon.
The beers (I tried 5, yup 5) were decent - not world-class, but decent. My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde, but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all, and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian-style ales which I didn't try.
The menu looked surprisingly interesting, (I was expecting burgers and pretzels), and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad, the tuna carpaccio, the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad. All four dishes were winners, although the small plates ARE really small (which is exactly what we wanted). The entrees are MASSIVE for the price, and look like they are high quality meals, but I'm glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one!

I come here often to walk through the museum, clear my mind and admire some awesome art. There are a ton of different types of art to look through and this museum would kill a few hours.

the drinks are not too strong, but not weak. a fair balance for any thirsty sea dog. I think I got addicted to Rum Runners while here...

live band karaoke here was a ton of fun! after some friends and I ditched Tao, we came back to our hotel (TI) and went to Kahunaville, where we stormed in with a pile of the BOGO drink coupons handed out by girls in the lobby, proceeded to get more loaded, and sing. yes, we're not Billy Idol, Steve Perry, or Bryan Adams, as much as we thought we were, but we had a ton of fun and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

It's at least at the point where you can see how it will come together. The layout is still sub-optimal.

Poutine - Gravy was a bit on the salty side and although cheese were curds, they weren't squeaky.  Fries weren't all that crispy.  So good tasting, but not on par with Montreal.

Chicken - Tender, not dry, but the parts that weren't covered in sauce was a bit bland.  Luckily, they have a BBQ Sauce Bar, self-serve, and this was definitely a helpful addition!

Coleslaw & Cornbread - Both really good.  Coleslaw wasn't too heavy tasting and cornbread was just slightly sweet.

By now this establishmen is a couple months past the hype but it's only turned out so-so, three stars for me.

First, the girl who took my order was friendly, responsive, quick and attentive. After making up my mind, I got the Japanese Pan Noodles, however without protein, as the dosis of carbs fulfills more than the amount of calories I want to alot to lunch. Also, for being a fast food restaurant, a price of 10 dollars is pushing it. On that note, the pricing boards are not the clearest. You find yourself going back and forth between sections just to puzzle together how much you will be paying at the end. This all, no matter how fancy the a-la-carte coke vending machine is. My drink was a blend of strawberry-vanilla sprite zero. I love the fact that Pittsburgh has a trend of getting picked as a test or at least a first wave implementation city for new machines and products. (:-))

I was in line barely ten minutes before my order was filled, which was great, as I was in line behind about 15 people. 

I must agree with another fellow yelp-ers review, because this dish was both blan and overspiced. It was overloaded with black pepper and the noodles were scorched from the pan frying process. The carrots, mushrooms and sprouts had no flavor, not even the sweeter sauce flavoring the dish came with. But boy, was there a parsley kick. 

I was in an out within 30 minutes, and the place makes me want to come back only when I am craving my noodle comfort food. 

I'm going to get technical for a second from a customer flow perspective, but the layout of the place sucks: 

First, if you are dining in, the space is petit, laden with various size tables that may or may not be available at lunch time, including long cafeteria-like tables to accommodate more than 6 people, so if you're not at least willing to meet a new lunch companion for the day, you may be out of luck. Second, the common tables are triangular in nature to maximize space, so you may run out of room to set the bowls that are brought to you by a 'server'. This server is also responsible to clearing your dishes, to avoid spacial accomdation for waste bins. Third there is NO counter between the final food station and the customer. This makes we more than nuts because servers, food perparers, cashiers, food itself and customers are all within the same bubble. It may have been there for quick access, however it's turns into a crowd control/sanitation issue.

If you decide to take out, there is no space to accomdate you during your waiting time. If you get there during the big lunch rush, you may find yourself stepping on yourself or other people, including the 'servers' that are flowing back and forth. It's absolutely hopeless, but I don't know if there's much one can do about this.

The best advice to avoid this of course is to avoid the lunch hour, as downtown empties out after 4pm. When I pass the Noodle & Company place in the evening times, there is ample space for you to enjoy your fast noodle meal.",2012-02-15 19:49:41

Being that it is close to my house, offers curb side pickup, and their commercials look so great, with great offers, I have given them a few recent tries.  This past visit brought my review to a 1 star rating.  After seeing the commercial for the Steak and Lobster special for $14.99 and up I decided to go for it again. I ordered the 5oz. Sirloin and Grilled Lobster and a fully loaded Baked Potato. And, ended up only being about to eat the Baked Potato, which was cooked to perfection. However, the lobster was raw! Completely uncooked!!! And, the steak was one of the worst peices I have ever received.  Complete sinu?? Not sure the spelling on that.  But, I was unable to even cut the steak due to the veins and fat running though it.
So, based on my dispppointment, I made a call to the restaurant to speak with the Manager. I selected the Curb Side Pickup option, gave my name, my order, etc. and was placed on hold as they were going to get the Manager.  After 15 minutes on hold I finally hung up and tried to call back with no answer. They had my name, my order, which included my number and still no call back. Very disappointing.  I guess the price should tell me what to expect.

I put out an evite and had about 8 people confirm. I called and made a reservation and told the hostess that I didn't know who was eating or just drinking. She said there's a perfect table in the bar and we could have that. I asked if I could bring in cupcakes for my mom and she literally said this..."" no, because you guys aren't eating"". Um....what? I just said I didn't know who was eating or not. I mean..I AM bringing 8 people into your establishment. So, we show up and take our table and everyone ordered food and drinks....everyone....so I was putting candles in the cupcakes and this hostess comes over and says...Im sorry, I thought I told you that you couldn't bring those. Seriously? I said, well...we in fact DID eat and we in fact ARE drinking so maybe I need to speak to your manager so I can find out just how much we need to spend so I can give my mom a cupcake on her birthday!? She goes to get him and tells him the story and this guy doesn't even have the courtesy to come by and say anything...at all. He sends her back over (which is a mistake in my opinion as she is being extremely rude) and she says...""you're fine"", turns around and walks away.

We had fish tacos, ribs, pulled chicken sandwiches, a burger, cheese crisp, onion rings and potato skins....all were great. The food runner was awesome. He brought us plates and silverware which is key when you eat food at a restaurant. Overall, I'd say the food was great, the band was fun and we had a great time dancing etc...I'd say the hostess needs to dial her attitude down a notch or 2 and if management has an issue with a table doing something he thinks isn't appropriate, then maybe he should talk to said table.

This business needs professional guidance, and FAST.  Whatever else they do, they are incredibly bad at communicating what they sell and are probably driving potential customers away in droves. It's almost like they don't want people to do business with them. For example, if you click on the ""View Menu"" tab it refuses to let you see their menu unless you first give them your street address. That is an invasion of privacy, I do not want to have to tell them where I live before seeing what they have to offer!  So if you try to go to their website, the ONLY thing there is a full screen picture ... NO menu, NO business hours, NO address, NO phone number ... who talked them into paying for an expensive and fancy website that only shows you a close-up picture of a gyro?

THE FOOD

We had the food delivered.  For the price (about $14 per order plus delivery, etc) it is overpriced compared to many other similar Greek restaurants but the quantity of food is substantial and it was delivered hot and fresh. We had gyro platters, consisting of meat, rice, vegetables, Tzatziki sauce and a Greek salad.  The salad wasn't wilted and had Kalamata olives but the tomatoes and cucumbers were really tiny.  The rice was good and the stewed vegetables also good with a slight bite to them.  The meat (and there was plenty of it) was a bit salty but had a nice flavor and the pita was large and irregularly shaped which leads me to believe it's not from Costco. There was one ""mystery"" item on the plate that we could not identify. It looked kind of like half of a green tomato but tasted more like some kind of pepper.  We didn't know if it was decorative or meant to eat. Restaurants who do things like that should identify it in their menu, but of course Gyro House 32 is so secretive about showing us their menu ...

THE SERVICE

Since we had take-out I can't comment on the service. We ordered through one of the third-party food delivery services. There are no negatives to report.

SUMMARY

All things considered like price, quantity and quality of food, etc. compared to other similar restaurants this place is okay but not great.  It terms of doing business with them they score very low.

Started with the country pâté and the foie and duck confit gateau. The pâté was creamy and had a lot of flavor.

It was layered with duck confit on the bottom, foie mousse in the middle, topped with a blood orange gelee. Also had a blood orange gastrique on the plate, it was really, really good. It was on the Valentines Day menu. The wife's favorite dish of the night.

Second course was a potato leek soup and an endive salad. The soup was creamy and delicious. The endive salad had an awesome walnut vinaigrette that went very well with the endive and the bleu cheese. 

Entrees were phenomenol.  The wife had the steamed mussels with chorizo and fennel with a side of frites. The mussels were very fresh and the broth was very flavorful. I had the short rib Bourgogne with hand made pasta and glazed root vegetables.  It was the best short rib I have ever had.

I've eaten at Copper once before, maybe five years ago. I thought that it was mediocre and grossly overpriced, which is why I hadn't been back until last weekend even though its just a few blocks from my house. 

Given the continually positive reviews, I decided to give it another try.  What a mistake.  

I ordered a cocktail.  I don't know what the bartender had intended for this drink to be.  But it was simply horrible.  I think I could blindfold myself, reach into my liquor cabinet, dump booze and mixers into a shaker, and come up with something infinitely better.

On to the food....

We got the Crab Kundan Quorma.  Crab and curry sounded like a great combo, or at least it should have been. $27 dollars for a soupy and flavorless dish.  In no way was this dish appealing.  It was simply nasty.  

The other dish that we ordered was the Punjabi Gosht.  The curry/sauce was quite nice.  But the meat was obviously of very low quality.  My jaw got a workout trying to saw my way through it.  

The service was also mediocre at best.

Came here to celebrate a friend's bday.  This was her choice, but I was not opposed to it.

Restaurant itself is SMALL.  Only 1 table that accommodates 6ppl.  Had to wait quite some time for it to open up AND we were charged an 18% grat.  :(  A couple of my only gripes.  Another one was the pricing of their drinks.  For example, a freshly pressed pink grapefruit juice was like $8 for a small bottle.  Other juices were ~$10.  A 2L carton of grapefruit juice, non-concentrated, would cost what...maybe $4??  And that'll last a coupla weeks.  So I basically looked over the drink portion of the menu.  However, you can sample whatever you want and I took full advantage of that!  ;)

Aside from the drinks, most food items were decently priced.  I have to agree that some of the salads seem pricey - after all, it's just mixed greens and some house made dressing, but it's essentially just veg.  I must say though, that the portions themselves are HUGE.  So maybe if you share, it'll seem like it's better value?

I had the Jerusalem bowl with soba noodles (baby size - $10 + $1.50 for the noodles).  The baby portion was just right for me!  And even though it stated that there was chilli powder, it was not spicy.

Again, wait for larger table + mandatory grat for ""large groups"", even after a long wait + drink prices were my only criticisms.  Otherwise, all good and fresh, will be back!",2015-02-08 00:03:19

All of the installation art pieces are incredible. When walking through the museum, I almost felt like part of the art work. Of course you don't want to touch the actual art, but it's like you're interacting with the art. Many pieces I looked at, I didn't quite understand, then came back and said ""ahhh."" Whether or not my interpretation was what was meant by the artist, I was able to come up with my own philosophies about the work. There were many pieces that just made me stop and think. There was a piece by Sarah Oppenheimer which I believe was commentary on the idea of neighborhood and voyeurism in a post-9/11 society. It was breath-taking. Of course check out one of the infamous rooms created by Yayoi Kusama.

There were so many beautiful pieces, and the gallery attendants were eager and excited to talk about the work with you. The front desk receptionist was very friendly as well. Here is an example, and I hope you don't mind a little rant here:  After witnessing a arrogant and stingy man who wouldn't pay an entrance fee because it was technically by  ""suggested donation,"" please don't be like him and cheap out. The museum still has en electric bill too I'd guess. So the receptionist was very professional and held her tongue, but after witnessing this and asking the receptionist if that happened often, she said ""all the time."" Nothing like running a non-profit people, especially one in the arts. So please pay the suggested donation.

Alright so the museum cafe was delicious. They have a great menu of fresh items, and I even saw a few vegan options as well. It is laid out very nice right next to the gift shop. Everything was very neat and tidy. Great gift shop too.

Any guy that can make homemade ice cream in Elizabeth with limited space and still churn out (pun intended) over 40 flavors has my appreciation and undying loyalty. 

I'm not an avid ice cream goer, but whenever I get to visit EC its alway so nice to try a new flavor. There is always something you haven't tried since your last visit. Last visit, I had the mint oreo and it was fanstastic. No big chunks of cookie, nice and smooth. Versatile enough to be in a cone or a cup. 

I've had tons of other flavors in the past. Coffee, Red Bean, what seems like 50 different kinds of chocolate. All delicious and all unique in some way. Rather reasonably priced for being hand crafted and in the heart of Elizabeth, a stone's throw from Uptown and fantastic. 

Gotta love the funky interior, too. Really strange chairs. My recommendation is to head out and walk around Elizabeth Ave. If it's a pretty day, its just nice to be on the street. It's a relatively quiet avenue. 

Read the story that's on the wall in the shop. What a great little tale of a man making ice cream. Definitely will make you appreciate his craft even more. 

Definitely more unique and memorable than any other major ice cream chain. If you're in the Elizabeth area on a hot summer day or if you're not battling lactose-intolerance, you won't be sorry you stopped in.",2012-04-13 12:41:53

You will wait and wait, you will beg and ask the dishwasher to please dear God bring you your beer, but you will NOT leave disappointed in the food. 

My boyfriend and I went last night (Saturday evening) and the wait was non-existent. We were seated in a beautifully designed dining room at a large table. We waited and waited and waited on our first beer, but we were okay with that because we'd been at the bar drinking before dinner anyway. The waitress was polite enough and seemingly efficient, but then would wander away waiting on the tables around us while we fantasized about another drink. Eventually we got one more.  

I don't want to harp on the waitstaff, but when you present a beautiful place with an outstanding menu (and wow, the prices) then you expect to be waited on accordingly. No, not here. Anyway, onto the real star, the meal!

Ordered some East Coast oysters. The waiter said the oysters from the West Coast were smaller and we like our oysters to have something to bite into, so...Got the oysters and they were TINY. I don't want to know what the West Coast were like. Regardless, these were the best oysters I do believe I've ever had the pleasure of eating. There weren't enough, and in my estimation, with the way those tasted, never will be enough. I could have eaten them for days. As Rowan Jacobsen says 'at some level, it's not about taste or smell at all. Because an oyster, like a lover, first captures you by bewitching your mind.' These are those oysters. Get them.

We then ordered the 18 oz. dry aged bone-in rib eye. Wow, wow, wow. WOW. It came out cooked a little more rare than we asked (medium rare), and while usually that much red in meat makes me shy away, it was hardly relevant with this steak. It melted in my mouth. Every taste was better than the one before. I have never, ever eaten a steak that tasted this way. I was considering going full vegetarian, but after this steak there will never be a chance of that. I have eaten at Cut, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, BLT, and many, many more. None have ever come close to the steak I had at STRIPSTEAK. None. As a bonus, my BF ordered foie gras to go on top. Listen, if you asked me to trade sex for a year for all the foie gras I could eat from this restaurant, well, let's just say I'd miss my BF a lot. It was THE best thing that has ever touched my lips and I mean that with everything I have. If you don't get this you are missing out on the most divine dining experiences you could possibly have. I have to stop talking about it. Moving on...

I can't skip the sides we had with our fabulous meal. The potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish) was, as stated, a puree, and I tend to like my mashed potatoes with a little more body, but these were out of this world. The flavors were subtle and smooth, and really, now I'll never want to eat garlic mashed again. THANKS A LOT, STRIPSTEAK. We also had the truffled mac and cheese. Speechless. It was the most divine taste of truffles in any dish I've ever tried with them. The musky, earthy flavor was just enough. I ate the whole thing (sorry, honey). 

Okay, the letdown here was the dessert, but you really don't go for the dessert anyway, right? While I don't remember what they called it, we had miniature donuts with a couple of dipping sauces. While I've had this dessert elsewhere and loved it, here it fell flat and really shouldn't be on a menu as amazing as this. Avoid.

I had walked by this place for years and thought maybe we could give it a try.  The menu looked like it had a lot of fish (which I don't eat), but the owner came out when he saw us and asked if we would like to see a menu. We liked what we saw and went in. They originally seated us downstairs, in a closed in room with no windows, and maybe 4 tables. And kids. No thanks. We waited about 5 minutes for a table upstairs.

We ordered our wine and I asked about the mushroom risotto. I asked if it was made with cream and the waitress told me it was made with olive oil. I asked if I could have a little bit of cream added to it; no problem. My boyfriend got a pasta with white wine cream sauce and chicken. Our meals came (very quickly, maybe a little too quickly?) and while he was enjoying his, I took a bite of my risotto-one word-AWFUL. It had absolutely ZERO taste to it. Nothing. At the table beside us, the girl got the risotto as well, and my boyfriend asked what she thought. She thought it was ok, but her boyfriend had tried it and said the same thing, bland. I ended up ordering another meal, a pasta with chicken, asparagus, and sun dried tomato cream sauce. It was the owner who I had told about the risotto and who I gave my new order to. He asked what type of pasta I would like, and I said spaghetti. Again, my new meal came very quickly, but I got...penne...instead of pasta. Not a huge deal, but I'm not the biggest penne fan. This time I didn't mention anything and just ate it. It was ok, nothing fantastic, but ok.

Overall, it wasn't the greatest experience, and the food definitely didn't win me over. The waitress gave us a little attitude once I sent the food back. When I mentioned that I sent it back, she started to say, ""ok, but that's how you order..."" No, sorry, I asked for a little cream to be ADDED, not made only with cream, if that's what they did.

It's not everyday where you can find an excellent French restaurant in Toronto at a relatively affordable price.

Midi Bistro is a French-style bistro on McCaul Street, within walking distance of UT and OCAD. If you wanna try French food for a lower price than places like Auberge du Pommier, this place does the job well. The ambience screams French, as well as many French words inside the bistro itself.

Their lunch specials are at a maximum price of $15, so it's definitely great value for what you get. The portions are reasonable as well, so you will likely be full once you finish. I came with my dad and ordered a french onion soup, escargots, seafood pasta, and steamed mussels with tomato sauce and a side fries.

The food surprisingly came out quick (although we were the only people eating there at around 3pm on a Tuesday). The french onion soup was very cheesy and had an excellent onion flavour, however the bread didn't melt in with the soup very well as it was still a bit hard. Everything else, however, was excellent, including the escargots, seafood pasta, and the steamed mussels with tomato sauce. I didn't end up eating the fries as I was full.

Service was excellent and efficient. I definitely think despite some reviews questioning about pricing, their lunch menu is of an excellent value. I would recommend  this to those with an under $20 lunch budget, and personally I will return next time I'm back in Toronto.",2017-09-06 04:26:44

I tried the following dishes (TRIED, not had the entire dish.....There is no way I could have finished that all):

Appetizer - Roasted Beets - A great starter if you like beets. Well done and the sauce that it comes with is fantastic!

Appetizer - Sardines - I took a gamble in trying this and remember you CAN eat the bones with sardines but don't have to. Really well done and they weren't too fish either.

Primi - Butternut Squash Risotto - I was really pleased with the sizing of this dish. It was about the size of a bread plate and JUST enough. Any more and it would have been too much. The rice was a bit over done for my linking but over all it was great 

Main - Gorgonzola Gnocchi - The Gorgonzola wasn't as powerful as I thought I would be which was a good thing. The gnocchi was great but at a certain point it was a bit too saucy for me.

Main - Sea Bass - The Sea Bass was OK and needed more seasoning, but the Butternut puree that it came with was great. It was one of the evening specials and worth a shot if you are curious.

Me and my girls got chatted up by a group of dutch pilots (?!) which was sketchy (and if we hadn't been at almost the same table, they would have been easier to ignore), and the food was subpar. 

I've had my best meals when I'm tipsy and my senses are dulled, but even then I could tell that this was subpar AND expensive. Paid 13 dollars for chicken and cashews in yellow bean sauce, and got a bunch of celery in sauce with a little bit of chicken and three cashews. Everything was soggy with grease.

The quality is consistently impeccable and they never disappoint. They are also very warm and friendly and were happy to answer all the questions I had about the menu and their spice blends (which are for sale). They clearly take a great deal of pride in their food. 

I've tried their Shombo chicken wrap and their Suya chicken wrap; both times with a side of their grilled veggies (Shombo style). The Shombo wrap was saucy deliciousness. The Shombo spice is probably a low-medium heat level and it has a lovely sweet spicy profile (not too sweet, just a touch). 

My first couple bites of my Suya wrap were mild. I was worried that maybe they assumed I couldn't take the heat and barely put any spice on it. That turned out not to be the case; I must have just bitten into a piece of chicken that didn't get as much spice. It's a building heat. It's probably a med-high level of spice. The heat does not detract from the flavour at all if you're worried about that. The flavour was amazing. It's also less saucy than the jerk or Shombo wraps, so that's point in its favour if you're looking for a good wrap to eat in the car while you're driving. 

I honestly can't choose a favourite. I love the jerk, Shombo, and Suya equally. The chicken is breast meat and it's deliciously moist. The grilled veggies I always get on the side are quickly becoming my new addiction. I could probably eat a pound of those grilled veggies in one sitting.

So I went to Lee's for the first time ever. So this is my first experience/impression of it and since they messed up my order, I don't have a positive impression. 

I came in and wanted to order a BBQ pork Banh Mi. I felt like the cashier seemed a little rude but I don't think he was rude; I think it was the nature of his tone. It might be a cultural thing. I asked him which one he would recommend or what was good but he didn't really suggest anything. Oh wells.

So I wanted BBQ pork because I like it and I had it at other places. Once I paid, I wait for like 30 seconds, I hear the intercom call out numbers. I look down at my ticket and I realized my number is called. I am a little confused how they worked so quickly on my order but I just proceed and pick up my order. I didn't question it. I just took it home. Once I am home, I look at the sandwiches. There's apparently three in there, I thought they happen to split one sandwich into threes because I asked for them to cut it in half and I thought ""WOW is the bread that long?"" So I look at the ticket inside the bag, it reads grilled chicken x 3. However, I noticed in the bag, two of them are grilled chicken, one of them is something else. So this made me realize two things...

1. Not only they gave me the wrong order (although they confirmed my number when I stood up to the counter and I looked at my ticket a few times and I am like okay that's me!)...
2. But they also messed up the order that read chicken x 3 because it wasn't all chicken....

I am not even sure if the one I ate was chicken because it reminds me of pate... Anyways, it's decent. I like it. Good price. Soft/chewy bread. Sandwiches are something I'll go back for but the service I had the first time confused me and just worries me.

He had the teriyaki filet mignon and I chose the seafood tempura. His meat was so very tender and delish, but sad to say that my tempura was a disappointment.

I was expecting a light, airy tempura batter, so my choice was regrettable.

We also had the gyoza, California roll, and the tuna poke.

The side salad that came before the entree was regrettable and superfluous, though I wasn't expecting much in the first place. It was definitely pre-mixed long before we arrived, which wouldn't have been bad except they also mix in the croutons, were become gross and soggy after sitting in a bowl of salad.

My fried chicken was excellent. Perfectly crisp with a great batter, and not too salty. I had home fries on the side which were well cooked but very much under-seasoned. 

The service was rather basic and inattentive, but you can't expect much more from a place like this. All in all we enjoyed our visit and we'll be back when we need some late night comfort food.",2010-04-17 15:23:24

My friend eventually had to pull aside a busser to ask him to get a server over to us. When he did come over there was no apology for the wait which was disappointing. Since it had been a while we were all ready to order so we did so right away. They brought us tortilla chips and salsa and the chips were actually delicious, easily the best part of the meal. I ordered a glass of white sangria and it was simply not sangria. Basically white wine with lemons, limes, and cherries, no juice. For dinner I had the salmon, which was mediocre. My friend said his burrito was horrible. We all left food on our plates which is not a good sign. I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars but rounded up because I'm feeling generous.

I mainly was doing window shopping and really was there to get the meatballs. They're still good and haven't changed. The mash potatoes weren't bad.  I also tried this vegetable cake, which was good. Their apple pie, on the other hand, was just OK. The cafeteria is fairly big, airy and clean, I see they expanded on this concept, probably because of their famous meatballs.

Started with spring rolls, which were really good.  Very nice presentation too.  My mom got the Panang curry which she really liked, although it was a little spicy for her.  I ordered the pad see ew...my go to dish.  It was kind of dry, the fried tofu was really dry and it lacked flavor.  Maybe because it was dry.  Lots of dry bits of stuff on my plate.  Egg?  Not sure. The broccolli could have been cooked a bit more.  Usually I encounter overcooked broccoli.  Definitely not the best, but not the worst I've ever eaten.  The thing I didn't like was how you don't pick a dish and choose what type of protein (chicken, pork, beef, tofu) you want in it.  The dish comes a certain way, but you can substitute a different protein for no additional cost (except for seafood which is more).  The problem is if you want to order that dish off the menu that comes with shrimp and is priced accordingly, you should get the dish for less if you substitute tofu or chicken for the shrimp.  Overall though the prices were really good for the portion you receive.    Very friendly service and the owner (at least I think it was the owner) took a lot of pride in his restaurant.  He was clearly very happy to hear how much people enjoyed their meals.  I will go back as maybe the pad see ew will be less dry next time.  No alcohol either which means the BF won't go there.

It's simple: they sell rotisserie chicken and salad - that's it.  It's part of the that 'healthy food' trend- but it's not lacking in taste and flavour.

Grabbed the pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich ($8) and the steamed squash with pumpkin seeds and spicy yogurt ($4 - but no longer on the current menu, they must rotate them).  The chicken sandwich was very good - all the toppings work great together on a top-notch bun.  I actually really liked the squash side - it sounds like a bunch of bullshit health-nut nonsense - but it was very tasty and filling.

I walked inside and was greeted immediately by a sweet young lady.  I placed my order for a Combo Sandwich with cookie dough ice cream, and Heath bar pieces.  Paid the lady my money (just under $6.00), was handed my sandwich, sat down and dug in.  Here is how it was.........

Combo Sandwich- The combo sandwich includes a cookie of your choice (I chose chocolate chip) for the top, and a brownie for the bottom.  They put a massive scoop of cookie dough ice cream in the middle, and then roll it in Heath bar pieces.  Good lord, this thing was great!  The cookie was probably my least favorite part of the sandwich, but even then, it was still delicious!  The ice cream tasted great, there were tons of little Heath bar pieces, and the best part of the whole sandwich..THE BROWNIE!  They cook their brownies on a huge cookie sheet, and they are incredibly thin.  They are flat out delicious though!  These thin brownies are perfect!  Chocolaty, fudgy, crisp yet chewy.  Pretty much the perfect brownie.  Next time, I am bypassing the cookie, and just going with a brownie sandwich.  These things were awesome!

Unfortunately, my group had a waiter who was in a really bad mood.  He inherited our table when our first server left, but then he neglected us and when we had two additional arrivals who wanted to order food, he acted extremely annoyed once we flagged him down.  We were shocked and slightly amused by our server's strange behavior (glaring at us one moment, then rolling his eyes or avoiding eye contact when he walked right past our table with his nose in the air while we were trying to get his attention), but it didn't help make a good first impression.  Finally, we flagged down the manager who apologized, brought our check, and told us our server was just really busy.  

The interior is cool - nice blue water glasses and mix-matched furniture.  The menu isn't as creative as they think it is and the (first) waiter described the dishes with much more creative flare than they came out of the kitchen with.  Our table tried a little bit of everything and if you eat meat and heavy cream/sauce/oil, you might like this place's food.  I think one of the meat-eaters in my group of 7 was happy with her meal.  If you don't want your veggies fried and/or covered in cream your options are to eat lettuce or take apart a dish.  I ordered sautéed mushrooms upon the first server's recommendation, which were good, but I wouldn't go back for them, even if the company was good - there are too many other awesome restaurants.  Plus, the sangria wasn't very good (watered down red wine and sprite?) - it needs some kick.",2013-07-04 01:24:58

The Arizona Mule, recommended by the server, was great. It came in a tin cup and you guested it, it was pricey. $12+

The guy we got the shoes from and paid with was very short with us and not at all friendly. He automatically charged us the normal fee without asking if we were Nevada residents. Luckily I caught that just before we paid. He truly did not seem to enjoy his job. 
When you get shoes they keep one of your shoes to ensure you don't run off with them, which I thought was odd and something I've never experienced. It's a bit awkward when you return your shoes while standing at the counter with only one shoe on, although I can understand that they probably had issues in the past. Maybe a credit card on file would be a better option!? If you forget your socks they do have a vending machine where you can buy socks for $3 a pair. 
As for the bowling itself, we had a hard time finding bowling balls that were under 14lb. And the lightest one I could find was 10lb. I'm small and not very strong so it ruining my bowling experience a bit since I could not accurately throw a ball I can barely lift with one hand. The people next to us only had one 8lb ball that they were constantly using. As for the ambiance, the bowling alley looked quite a bit older than what the pictures make you expect and also looked nothing like the pictures. The tables were black rather than the light colored ones with orange edges in the photos. The seats were very uncomfortable, but I mean it's a bowling alley so you can't really expect much. There was a bar and a place for snacks, but you could smell the grease and artificial flavors from a distance and their selection was very limited so we didn't try anything. 
Overall I'm giving 2 stars.

This rarely happens so I wanted us to try something new. This is actually the second time I've been to Korean BBQ but I will not count the first time. The first time I went with my friend, her husband and his friends. They were all pretty quick with the chop sticks so I ended up with one asparagus and a sliver of meat. It wasn't the ideal situation. 

I was intimidated when I first came here because I read in different reviews that we may get ignored because we were not Korean. When we walked in they were very nice and attentive. They put a bunch of different items in front of us that you can use to enhance your meal. I didn't know what half of it was so I tried different things. The waitress cooked our meat (short Rib and Brisket )sprouts, and Kimchee for us. 

They started us with some Seaweed soup which was a little salty for me . I tried mostly all of the items they put in front of me except for one thing I'm curious about. They looked like wet coffee beans I wanted to try them but didn't so I'll have to try it next time. The meat was really savory and delicious! I enjoyed eating it with steamed rice, the sprouts, and Kimchee. I also ordered some Korean fried rice which is a little different from Chinese fried rice. This fried rice had seaweed and it looked like pieces of romaine lettuce it was different but still good. In order to like this dish you have to appreciate the taste of seaweed.

Samba is a pretty good Brazilian bbq, all-you-can-eat restaurant. There is a decent selection of meats and cuts, as well as a sizable salad bar. Unfortunately, the number of sides is limited to one -- the cheesy bread, which I don't have a problem with.

The funny thing is, I believe the most clutch item at Samba isn't even a meat; rather, it's the grilled cinnamon pineapple. It is absolutely delicious (and I think it helps with digestion). Take it from an avid meat-lover.

The menu was pretty typical Thai Lunch Specials for here. I noticed the BBQ Pork and that sounded good so I decided to give that a try. The soup was mostly broth but it was tasty and just the right temperature. I was surprised when they brought out the order what looked like two thin sliced pork chops on a bed of greens (Cabbage...) a pile of white rice a Spring roll and two cups of sauce. I tried the spring roll first because I am a huge fan of them. I was instantly disappointed. It was not only room temperature but it lacked much of any filling inside. The dipping sauce was ok but it would have been nice if they had some hot mustard on the table to add a bit to it. Next I cut up some of the pork and dipped it in the BBQ sauce. All was forgiven.

Great Harvest promotes for the healthy conscious with their variety of whole-grain freshly baked bread and hearty ready-made products.  Their welcoming offer of a sample of their freshly baked bread when visitors enter their bakery is their way of saying, ""Hey! Try this delicious slice of flavorful goodness!""

My gf and I decided to give GHBC a try. As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted with a smile and a generous sample of their artichoke parmesan bread and pumpkin spice loaf with butter! We munched on them while we were glancing over their custom sandwich ordering sheet.  You have your different choice of meats, breads which also have a daily special for an additional .50, cheeses, and different deli toppings.  We got our sandwich grilled (an option to choose) with the daily special bread with pastrami, basil mayo, yellow mustard, provolone, peppercinis, and lettuce!  Yuh-meehhh! :P

We took the sandwich to go so it wasn't as fresh as we'd hoped it to be, but judging from how good the sandwich still was, I can tell it'd be even better! I'm excited to try more of their sandwiches and buying some of their loaves.

EDIT: I've actually *lowered* the star rating based on the fact that they faked offering me something 'for the trouble' which in turn has made me more angry. I've called 3 times, left voicemails, and responded to the PM and I've gotten no response. Apparently this company fails in *every* department. Sad. 

It's really sad how many extra fees they will throw at you and hope you don't notice. The employees here are very nice, but it does take someone special to be able to charge all these unnecessary extra fees day in and day out. My main complaint goes out to Verizon and/or GoWireless Corporate (I learned *after* visiting here that this isn't an actual Verizon store, they are contracted with Verizon to sell their phones) since *they* are the ones forcing their employees to charge all these fees.

The associate, Brian, rings me up and says ""all together with the phone and the setup fee your total comes to $354"" (or something close to that). I ask him ""Uh, setup fee? What does that cover? What kind of setup was done? Activating it?"". He explains that for most phones, the transfer of contacts needs to be done through a machine (which apparently costs $20 to use..? Seriously?) and the iPhone is the only one where it can be done through the cloud. So I ask him why I would be charged this fee since I purchased an iPhone and he did not do this ""setup"" since I did it through iCloud myself. He said I have to be charged the fee because he is unable to take the fee off unless you purchase accessories at the store and then you get a special rate on the accessories for paying that fee and then some coupons that don't arrive for at least a month after (this in itself makes little to no sense). So not only am I not buying accessories (already bought everything I need off Amazon for 1/3 of the price), and he didn't do any 'setting up', I STILL have to pay the fee... oh, unless his manager can give him the code to take it off. Thankfully, this is what ended up being done so I appreciate that. However, if there was no setup of a phone, there should be no setup fee, plain and simple! 

Verizon definitely used to offer transferring contacts for free but now that have this weird thing where they trick you into paying the fee by offering such 'great deals' on accessories but the accessories are already overpriced to begin with!

My phone had come more quickly than expected and I had basically gotten over the hours and hours spent negotiating two days prior that I was really prepared to leave the store happy at the end of all of it. That last little fee (after already trying to deal with all the other extra fees two days prior) really just ruined my short-lived positive feelings for this place.

Personally I really like that spits of meat are brought to you and then carved, over and over again.  Beware though, one, this place is expensive (happy birthday to me) and two, better get a reservation if you want to come here on saturday or sunday, or else you'll be waiting.  

One of the perks of coming here on a friday/saturday, is that there's always live entertainment.  I guess you can kinda factor that into the cost.  We personally heard a string duo (guitar and bass) which was awesome, and then there were these carnival costume wearing dancers that decided to dance around the restaurant.  Kinda neat I guess (I found it really funny when guys would go up and take pictures with the girls).   During the other times, there was a DJ spinning so the place kinda felt like a supper club.

As for the food, depending on the cut of meat, they will usually season and broil the outside of the meat, slice and serve it up, then take it back in to repeat the process.  I found that if you want it rare (like I do), just let them know and they'll do their best.  One thing I've noticed is that they did hold back the more ""premium"" items unless you asked for it.  Personally I kinda wanted to try the suckling pig and shrimp, and I only got them when we asked for them.  So suggestion is if you want it, just ask.  They'll eventually bring it out to you.

As for the non-meat things.  I can't really comment much on the salad bar, I didn't go.  I did however LOVE their corn bread.  It's AMAZING.  I would probably eat it every day and be happy forever, it's that good.  I don't care that it leaves your hands shiny as a mirror after holding it.  That just means it's filled with goodness.  Oh, and the cheese bread balls are pretty damn good too.

As for the amount of food, I can probably say that most people will be stuffed easily (even with the 2 hour time limit).  Personally I would say it's best to come here with a smaller group, so the servers can come to you more often and you can get served a bit quicker.  We came in a group of 17 and it took really long for a server to get from one end to another.

My friend and I decided to check it out after our Valentine's Day Dinner. Good location, Cute Decor but very average Creme Brûlée. We walked in and were greeted with VERY CUTE Macarons! Probably the cutest I've ever seen. I liked that you could choose from a variety of Creme Brûlée flavors. 

We ordered a Belgium Waffle and an Original Creme Brûlée. The waffle was sitting on a tray and the guy just popped it into a toaster. We decided to top our waffle with Salted Caramel Ice-Cream. 

The Creme Brûlée had a good burnt layer but the actual creme tasted more like a pudding, it didn't really have that authentic taste. You might like it. The waffle was very chewy (probably because it wasn't fresh). The ice cream wasn't creamy but very icy.

This is not an all you can eat place, but that is more than okay.  Why?  Because you can actually take what you didn't finish home!  I was super stuffed!

My bro and I got the beef combo.  This comes with beef brisket, angus boneless short ribs, Hobak marinated skirt steak, bean paste stew, steamed, egg, and rice pop ice cream. 

The servers cook for you!  Which is great because they did a better job cooking than I usually do.  We started with the brisket on the grill.  The server brought some sushi rice with a piece of wasabi in the middle.  When the brisket was done, he took a piece of the brisket, put it on top of the sushi rice, told me to dip it with their Hobak sauce, and I had a few more of those after!  The brisket with the wasabi, sushi rice, and Hobak sauce was amazing!

After the brisket was done, our server changed our grill, and it was on to the mesh grill.  Again, I'm glad he's cooking because I wouldn't how to handle cooking on this mesh grill.  Especially when I watched him cook our food, the fire was blazing!  After he cooked both sides, he sliced the big slab of meat to many pieces.  Great with the Hobak sauce or the side of salt and sesame oil.  

The Hobak marinated skirt steak was the best!  No need for sauces for that!  We were getting stuffed at that point and had a bunch of leftovers, so we got those to go.  

Mix the steam egg with rice, and you got a great combo.  I couldn't get enough of the bean paste stew.  It was spicy and full of great flavor.

At this point I was so stuffed, but I somehow always have room for desert.  We got the rice pop green tea ice cream.  It was very easy to eat ice cream sandwich.  An ice cream sandwich where the rice pop outer layer tastes like a waffle cone.  Again I was stuffed, but it was so good, I devoured the whole thing.",2016-09-24 06:03:20

I usually rave about this coffee shop, because of the yummy matcha green tea latte & also cause the inside is super cute. BUT TODAY, I was so disappointed! We came in & apparently, the Rose lychee dessert that I've been trying to get is not served until 3pm - it was 15 minutes til. Okay, I understand that. I told them I'm in a hurry for work so I didn't bother. We ordered the blended and iced matcha tea instead and the coconut pana cota. 
As we waited for our order, I saw people getting their drinks- who ordered the same thing as us, who by the way were behind us in line. When I asked them if our order was coming out, they said they're working on ours and turned around. NO APOLOGIES NOT ANYTHING. I stated that MANY people got their orders before us who were behind us and they just looked, no apologies. We went on to wait for our order, for about 20-25 minutes. 
It makes me sad that the situation was handled so poorly. It made me not wanna come back and just not recommend this place anymore. I can get the same tasting drinks in other coffee shops. Experience? I can get a better one somewhere else. 


This place is so cute & hip! & because of that, this place can get overly packed. It's really hard to get a table especially on a Sunday. It's easy to miss the place too cause they don't have a sign outside. 

I ordered the matcha latte - very decedent and had a perfect balance of sweetness. 
We also got some cake. I know the tofu cheesecake is a big hit to everyone, but it had this unpleasant after taste to it. We also got the rainbow roll cake (really good), green tea cake & chocolate cake. The only thing I wish I tried was the Rose cake, for this I suggest you go in early because they only make a limited number and it's the first thing that gets sold out.

Getting into the parking lot can be a challenge. If you are coming from CPCC, you either have to make a left onto 3rd street and then turn right on Charlottetowne Ave or go up to Charlotttetown Ave and make a u-turn which can be challenging but unlike some other Chipotles, there is plenty of parking.  It shares its parking lot with a Vitamin World and a mattress store. 

Inside the restaurant, they have bar tables but like any chipotle I've been in, I find their restaurants to be sterile with no real character.

But I guess most people come here for the food.  I am really starting to appreciate Chipotles food.  This time I opted for a burrito bowl with chicken, sans rice and added guac, and a couple different types of salsa.  Got it to go as I was in a hurry to get home.  Great flavors.  I really enjoy their hot salsa.

Service was good here.  People were friendly.  They do not have liquor yet but there is a sign saying liquor license is pending.

Cocktails were exquisite. I had the Bees Knees. A gin concoction with lemon, honey, and lavender. It was so smooth and delicious, even my husband who normally hate gin thought it was good. We also had edamame fritters which were very good and paired nicely with our cocktails. 

For dinner I had the summer corn ramen and my husband had the Mongolian beef. The hubs was blown away by his dish. He said the steak was cooked perfectly and everything was flavorful. He raved about it for days. I thought my ramen was very good. It had a very light and creamy broth. I prefer spicier dishes and luckily they had a bottle of sriricha on the table. I will try something a little bolder next time. However I work close by and I can totally see myself ordering this for lunch when I'm feeling under the weather and need something comforting.

I guess the madness of Diamond Restaurant has somewhat slowed down a little since there was only a 20 minutes wait... but we opted to sit at the bar instead which didn't have a wait.  I remember eating at the old Diamond before, and the space was tight then, and it only got tighter now after squeezing in that bar.  It's definitely a retro feel with the booths and neon wall light... and brighter than what I remember Penguin ever was.  

The menu is a mix bag of diner & burger joint items with a dash of fish camp.  Sadly nothing jumped out too much and I ended up staring at it for a little before making my decision.  Luckily there's a bar, which had $1.50 Shocktop (sorry buddy, no orange slice for me) & Rolling Rock and $2 mexican beer.  

I finally ordered the Fried Oysters Platter and my friend got the Pimento Cheese sandwich with a side of Fried Okra.  I have to say all the fried foods were golden crispy (except the fries...).  My plate was HUGE, for $9 I think I got more than I would have at a seafood restaurant.  I did have to use salt and pepper to season it a little.  Hush puppies were the best thing on the plate; moist in the middle, just enough taste!  The Pimento Cheese sandwich was heart attack inducing... it's like a mad daddy grilled cheese 2.0, things were just goo-ing out of the bread.  

All in all, it was an ok experience.  Sitting where we were, we got to see food coming out of the kitchen, and I think I'll try their veggies next (cream squash, mac & cheese, and collard greens sound great).  The chicken salad sandwich is impossibly huge... and the BBQ fried chicken looks interesting.  So, definitely a next time, and I'm hoping Diamond will be better than what Penguin was for me...

You walk in and there's this giant visual  display of their dishes, encased in glass. Very helpful I might add! It's actually quite stunning! We were waiting for a mintue to see if we would be approached but then realized we were supposed to walk up to the counter to order.
Hint! Walk towards the right and they will greet you and help you out!
We were greeted by several people behind the counter. All very friendly. I mentioned that it was our first time there and they made a thing about it to the other workers and they all said hello in their own way.
The menu is very descriptive, with pictures (also helpful). The despcriptions of the food made them all the more enticing.
There were also alacarte items, such as tempura vegetables and some other items I wasn't too familiar with. We both had tempura asparagus and pumpkin.
The tempura is under a heat lamp and already precooked. (I would have preferred is fresh but it was still tasty)
We ordered the Nabaki Udon and the Yaki Udon.
To me The Nabaki Udon has a shrimp flavored broth. It has alot of different textures and flavors going on and I think I preferred that over the Yaki Udon.
The Yaki Udon has pork belly and cabbage and it came in this gigantic bowl!!! Make sure to come with an appetite!!
There's chopsticks, forks and spoons available in a side station for anyone and self serve beverages. 
 The fresh lemonade is amazing by the way!!!
The decor is really nice and clean and they have little Bhuddas and Anime book collections and other fun stuff. I really liked it in there.
The staff is amazing and should not go left unnoticed. One of them came by our table and asked how everything was. She explained that the udon is all made fresh daily in an old school machine. The noodles seem to go for miles!!! Lol

BUT... that hasn't stopped me from driving 35 mins from Markham, and getting dressed in my winter gear during this chilly fall weather to have some freezing cold ice cream and fresh funnel cake! Their ice cream is super smooth, not even comparable to ice cream trucks if you thought that was good. To be honest it's even better than Dairy Queen ice cream, go figure why it's Dairy ""Cream""... because it tastes real creamy & smooth! They've also got those dipped chocolate ice cream cones too.

The only downfall is that their tables are all outside of the place, no indoor seating. So nonetheless, if you're coming here during the colder seasons, be prepared to dress up in a hat and warm jacket! (Maybe gloves too ) but trust me, it's worth it.

I got there and the lady working was not very inviting at all. That rubbed me that wrong way, but I'd driven all the way out there from Tempe, so I just went ahead and bought some things. 

I decided to get a regular sized lemon raspberry cupcake, peanut butter sandwich cookie, and the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. The white chocolate macadamia cookie was...meh. It's not my favourite flavour cookie usually and this one didn't change that. It was oily and blah. The cupcake was a total disappointment. It was expensive and very small for a regular sized cupcake. There was also as much frosting as there was cake. The frosting tasted good and there was only a tiny bit of raspberry goo on the lightly lemony frosting. However, the cake itself was horrible. It tasted like it was lime flavoured, and it was acid and bitter. Just freaking horrible cake. It was kind of wet too. It just was not good cake. 

The peanut butter sandwich cookie was amazing! It wasn't too sweet and it was just DELICIOUS! 

Unfortunately, the employee just seemed really annoyed that I'd even walked into the shop and with the high prices for what you get, it's really not worth going out there for the peanut butter cookie again. There are better bakeries out here that appreciate my patronage, so I'll go to those.",2016-05-28 01:22:55

Croque Madame: what a croque indeed. Bread was overly thick which created an unbalanced ratio of ham and cheese, and the thick cut off the bread. French fries were awesome. Go to Moulin in Newport Beach -- SO much better.

The Vegetarian quiche of the night was Florentine but honestly again, the best is found right in my backyard again at Moulin. 

The fish dish was plated so disgustingly I'm not sure what they were thinking. My plate of Boudin Blanc was flavorful, and although I loved the sausage itself, I thought the accompaniments were boring.

Last time we were here it was so good, service was quick, and staff was so nice.  Today, however, none of this was the case.  Unfortunately, this restaurant is in it to take as much money from you as they can and don't care at all about customer service or their reputation.  There are so many other options in the area, choose one of them.
Last time I was in, our waiter let me start with à la carte and then switch to all you can eat later on.  Today when I asked to do this, our waitress very rudely told me that wasn't allowed.  I would completely understand if I wanted to try all you can eat and then drop down to à la carte but with this, you're getting roughly $20 out of me anyway.  This woman was incredibly rude and condescending the entire time we were there.
They were also incredibly slow.  It was Saturday afternoon around 3PM and rather empty.  My friends and I all ordered at the same time, they got their food in about 5-7 minutes but they were ready for their second roll by the time I ever got my food.  After this, we waited about 15 minutes with empty plates before she ever even looked our direction.
My rolls were so sloppy I could barely pick them up.  I got a piece of one of my rolls that was literally avocado wrapped in rice and nori.  One of my friends and I each ordered half-orders of different rolls and they put them on the same plate as if it was the same roll.

Secondly, perhaps I would be able to give a higher rating if we had had the chance to eat more than one duck bun in the 1hour and 20 minutes we sat there.   Sadly we did not, even though we had ordered our dishes shortly after sitting down.   I don't mind slow service if there is a reason for it. What I don't understand, and have little patience for, is flippant, dismissive service.        More on that later.  Let's review the one piece of food we were able to eat.   The steamed buns which are suppose to be their signature item.  

Duck Steamed Buns - have these people ever eaten a steamed a bun?  Ever? Once? In their whole lives?   My guess is no.  Steamed buns are meant to be soft and delicate.   This was more like  duck stuck between a stale pita.   To be fair, the duck had some flavour. Some.   When I asked if they had any siracha  I was told their kitchen was too busy and we would have it eventually.  (seriously? It is hot sauce)

At an hour and 20 minutes in we asked our waiter to cancel the rest of the order and bring us the bill.     She brought the bill however everything we had ordered (yet not received) was on the bill.   She then explained that she could not take the items off because they were already being prepared,  to which I almost laughed out loud.    Long saga ensued with the manager where he and I went back and forth about us paying for what we ordered vs us paying for what we received, two drinks and one app, and close to 10 minutes later I won.     

It is important to note that this dialog occurred right in the dinning room in front of other customers.    Luckily there were only a few other customers actually in the place so not very many people had to hear the crap these guys were trying to pull.    Lucky for 3030.  Not so lucky for us though, was that the fire alarm was going off all night.

So I understand Cosmic Treat's forté is definitely desserts and brunch, but they should step up their appetizer game if it's on the menu! 

The mixed root vegetable fries I had were not mixed root. Mixed root usually implies 3+ root vegetables (maybe some Taro, parsnip, rutabaga, what have you). There were only sweet potatoes and regular potatoes in these fries, and some were pretty burnt. 

Also for a vegan place I kind of expected a decent salad, but the side salad is pretty average (tomato, pepper, cucumber, salad greens, and a vinaigrette).

There were a lot of TVs and each one of them had a sporting event on display, so that fit with the name.

Pros:
Very unique pasta dishes
Food is very good
Servers are excellent

Cons:
Shio type dishes can be a bit salty

Like I stated above, Japanese and pasta are usually not two words I use in the same sentence.  So when I heard about this place, my mind was blown!!  It was obvious I would need to try this place for myself!  Shiso Tree is located in the J Town plaza on Steeles just past Woodbine.  If you don't know about J Town, you will never know about this place as well.  

As soon as you come in, the place gives off a lounge jazzy type of feel.  It's nice and quaint.  You're greeted immediately by one of their servers and seated as soon as possible.  Japanese restaurants always have excellent service.  It comes from their culture back home.  The servers are all very nice, polite and helpful.  I rarely have any problems with Japanese run establishments and this place is no different.  

Shiso Tree offers about 15 pasta dishes with a Japanese twist.  We ordered the Unagi Don and beef sukiyaki pastas (seriously, they managed to make these dishes into pastas, amazing feat in itself).  We added an order of okonomiyaki fries as well.  We asked if it was possible to order just a simple late of pasta and cream sauce for our little one.  They made it for us with no trouble at all and told us the price so there would be no surprises later.  Again, great service.

The pasta dishes were all excellent.  It's very interesting how they blend the pasta with the Japanese food but they do it well.  They don't skimp on the unagi either.  I got two big strips, for the price I paid, it was really good value as well.  The okonomiyaki fried were awesome as well.  They give you a huge plate of it as well.  Again, excellent value.

I went to 00 Gelato after a Jays game for a cooldown treat. There aren't as many flavours as other gelato places but they have interesting choices. They had a few chocolatier/rich flavours such as Ferroro, Kit Kat and Cap'n Crunch. Looked like the Cap'n Crunch was not a popular choice. Ferroro is what I got based on previous reccomendations and it was amazing. The rich chocolate flavour really came through and there were bits of crunch throughout the gelato. I would get it again in a heartbeat. It wasn't overly sweet and there was so much flavour. I also had the lemon sorbet which I would say was average. I'm not sure I love sorbets as much as gelato so maybe I'm just biased. The server was also super nice; he let us try the flavours and later on brought us napkins in the seating area. 

Pros:
Amazing Ferroro Gelato
Extremely attractive server 

Cons:
Limited seating- there is a bit of space next to the booth on the lower level of King Street Social",2016-07-10 22:06:36

I actually have only eaten at Cowboy Ciao twice... once, a while back, for dinner, and then just the other day for lunch (with Sarah G).  

I have to agree with Sarah... the lunchtime service was nothing special.  Our waitress was not overly friendly and she didn't give us much attention either.  We had to ask about several menu items including a refresher on the ingredients in the ""Stetson Chopped Salad"" as the menu doesn't say...

Luckily, the company I was with made up for the 'eh' service.  The salad (I had the Stetson Chopped) was actually really unique and the perfect size for a light lunch.  

I remember the wine menu being pretty impressive as well as that Exotic Mushroom Special, so I'm sure I'll be back to visit Cowboy Ciao eventually.

Zz-evM6gnmT6HYgzly8zJg,rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,5,1,0,0,"After hearing about this place from local chefs and finding it on my girlfriend's bookmarks we decided to check out Other Mama the other day and we arrive right at opening and just in time for happy hour.  The shopping center this place is located in is older and may seem sketchy but I find the best restaurants are usually located in places like these and I can definitely see Other Mama inspiring competitors to this lot in the future. Stepping inside it felt like I was transported to a sea side village in Maine or something and I was visiting the local tavern on a stormy day. It's a dimly lit maritime decor and that interior makes you feel right at home.

Service: Our server was great as she went introduced the menu and it's concepts as well as breaking down the Specials wall and going into detail about the more popular or in season ones. She was also on top of our waters and checked back frequently to make sure we were good. Usually at local spots I don't expect 5 star service and I mean it wasn't formal and it shouldn't be, but she definitely knocked it out of the park. I was impressed with her extensive menu knowledge and ability to give good recommendations and reasons why she'd recommend it not just for the sake of upselling. 

Starters: Spicy Tuna with Waffle Fries x White Fish Ceviche. Both of these items were on the happy hour and for I believe $6 or something like that it was an absolute steal. And these aren't even half portions, it's the full size. The Ceviche was a combination of different things and paired with some excellent sweet potato chips. The chips were crunchy but not super hard and I found myself enjoying just the chips at times and forgetting about the ceviche which was fresh and flavorful. The Spicy Tuna with Waffle Fries was probably our favorite starter though as the waffle fries were crisp and just the right size. (Before Other Mama I felt like the only place that sold Waffle Fries was Chick Fil A) Spicy Tuna was fresh as well and the portions are very generous as I found myself having enough Spicy tuna left even when the fries were almost done. Great Apps and quite filling. 

Entrees: Kobe Steak x Broiled Shrimp. The Broiled Shrimp came out with 4 pieces of jumbo shrimp split open and covered in a searing skillet of hot oil, butter, and sauce. Very Cajun. Just how I like it. The shrimp was fresh and meaty while the sauce just made it so much better. I found myself dunking my shrimp and eventually my steak in the sauce as well. The steak was alright and wasn't anything super impressive. It didn't melt in my mouth and the relish had me wishing it was chimichurri. The sides of asparagus and potatoes were hearty and I appreciated how soft but crunchy the asparagus was.  I feel like the NY Strip would have been been better especially with the bernaise and waffle fries. Will definitely try next time. 

Thoughts: This is definitely what I would consider a local gem. I love how there's more of these popping up around town as various chefs from the strip break out to pursue their own ventures.  This creates high quality food at a price point that isn't overkill. If Other Mama was on the strip our meal would have been in the upper 100s but instead our bill came out to $72 before tip. Im excited to be returning here multiple times and trying all of the potentially delicious foods that Other Mama has to offer.",2017-05-09 10:40:11

Restaurant-wise, there are plenty to choose from including Prime Bar, Dominques, Tanzy, Brio, Grimaldis and True Food (to name a few). They have a good amount of businesses at the Quarter, but I still feel like everything is a tad too cramped and it's a little confusing making your way up on alley and into the next. However, the most disappointing aspect of the Quarter is the lack of parking. There are barely any street-level parking spots which means that unless you have been graced by the parking-luck fairy, you'll be driving deep underground to find a spot in the garage. The whole process to park at the Quarter makes it nearly impossible to ""run in and out"" to make a return, grab a quick charger from the Apple store or pick up a makeup product from Sephora.

This isn't one of those fancy local's casinos like Red Rock. It isn't even one of those moderately fancy local's casinos like The Orleans or Santa Fe Station. Though it might be better than those homeless shelters that they call casinos in North Las Vegas and Downtown, Arizona Charlies is still one of the worst locals joints I can think of. 

 Whats a shame is that this place is operated by the same people who operate the Stratosphere. I love the Stratosphere. Everyone is friendly, the dealers are cool, and they generally treat me nice(except the sports book manager). Arizona Charlies is practically Stratosphere's inbreed half cousin. It has nothing that the Stratosphere offers. A great example of good customer service at Stratosphere was back in 2010, when I was insulted by a dealer. The manager was so big on customer service that he comped me a free night in a suite and gave me a free meal at Roxy's. I didn't even ask for anything. On the other hand, I had a bad experience at Charlies a few months back and the manager just told me ""thanks for letting me know"", he didn't even apologize. A world of difference as you can see. 

I use the Sports Book here a lot and notice that the locals who loiter all day at this casino are very raggedy and street urchin-like. Most of them wear those free shirts that were handed out at the club card booths back when the casinos weren't broke and actually had the money to hand out shirts that cost probably like .75 cents. Everyone here also seems to enjoy wearing gym shorts and sweat pants. You also probably won't ever see a hot chick here. You might hit a jackpot on the slots before you see any woman who isn't 200lbs.

The ventilation here is very poor and even if you are only here for a few minutes, your hair and clothes will always smell like this casino when you leave. Is management gonna do anything about it?...probably not.

For starters, we were totally ripped off on Valentine's Day, when we were told that we would be getting the ""Valentine's Day Package"". I asked if there were other alternatives, since I had the feeling Chima was trapping us into getting charged extra for this, knowing that every other restaurant in the vicinity was probably booked for Valentine's evening. We were told there was none, so with no other choice we just went with it. We ended up paying an extra $30 for an okay glass of champagne, standard cup of coffee, and a total joke of a brownie ice cream dessert, all the ingredients of which tasted as if they had come out of a box and/or store-bought mix. Total for the night was close to $90 per person, after the $30 fee for the mandatory package, which they totally skimped on, knowing that a lot of people would be coerced into getting it. Not cool.

Everything else was pretty good. The meat was good, nothing amazing. I wasn't very impressed by the meats I looked forward to trying, such as the filet mignon, but my boyfriend enjoyed his meal a lot. The buffet bar was wonderful though, with lots of gourmet options. The parmesan breads were hands down AMAZING and totally ADDICTIVE.

Overall, a very mixed experience because Chima clearly knew it was misleading a bunch of people into paying an extra $30 on Valentine's Day. They were not upfront about it at all, and the price was never posted on their website, FB page, etc before we came. Basically, we got there and were told we would be getting it, no other options available.

I had a pizza with peppers, sausage, grilled eggplant, and chili flakes. Tried some penne and tomato sauce - which was a little sweet for my liking but much better than I expected. Each dish was too large to finish and at something like 12$ it was a good deal.

This place is the BOMB! We were looking for a spot to go watch Monday Night Football and a friend suggested Sagos for the all you can eat and drink special. Okay sign me up.

Here's the DEAL: 
$10 for Ladies: All you can eat Nachos, Chicken Wings, and Hot Dogs. All you can drink Smirnoff Vodka drinks.
$25 for Gentlemen: All you can eat Nachos, Chicken Wings, and Hot Dogs. All you can drink draft beer. 
You also get raffle tickets for halftime and game end drawings for t-shirts, hats, key chains, bar glasses, and shot glasses. 

The food is served fresh to you plate by plate throughout the night, NOT a buffet like I would have expected. The nachos come without meat and topped with pico, sour cream, and jalapenos and were pretty tasty! The chicken wings come in mild, medium, hot, teriyaki, and yoni kono. I tried the yoni kono and teriyaki with ranch and they were really good with lots of sauce and good quality chicken. 

The drinks were served in short glasses for the ladies the bartender has a decent pour! The service was excellent. The girls worked together and we never had an empty glass or plate of food. 

The bar has gaming and I wandered over to play some blackjack and started chatting with a gentleman that frequents Sagos and he said they take very good care of locals with comped food and premium drinks for players. Nice to know =) Again my glass continued to be filled with delicious red wine by the polite bartender.

I have heard things from friends here and there and I like to try new sushi spots, so I decided to give this a go from that as well as Yelp reviews.  -;)

No reservations and we were still able to get a party of 8 seated in about 10 minutes at 8 PM on a Saturday night, which was fantastic.  The older Asian man in the embroidered cowboy shirt and riding boots was nice and efficient.

We ordered after much debate (and apparently a menu-stealing waitress from what a friend said) and the food came pretty fast.  That might be relative to enjoying great company with friends, I'm not 100%.

Their Homare Strawberry Nigor (strawberry sake) is $16 a bottle - not bad as Island Sushi's is $20.  I drank most of it.  (Hey, it was my birthday dinner.)

I got two staples in my sushi ordering - crunch roll and dragon roll.  Both were good but not the best I've had.  The crunch on the crunch roll was not what I'm used to - it was fairly hard and not the normal light, panko batter that I've experienced at other places.  The dragon roll had a bit too much sauce, but the eel slices on top were generous.

My friend ordered a spicy roll with a jalapeno slice on top (can't remember the name) so we sushi-swapped and hers was great!  I had to eat one roll in two bites.  They are VERY generous with the fish cuts, which is great because they are also high-quality.

The tempura I tried from my friend's Love Boat was good but slightly reminded me of my crunch roll - that harder crunch instead of the light fluff of normal panko.

Service was very friendly and they brought out a complimentary tempura ice cream with a candle.  That was very tasty - the pound cake inside was soft, fluffy, and very melt-in-your mouth - but I was pretty full by that point so I only ate half.

Plus: LOTS of cooked choices for groups that enjoy Japanese food but not sushi. (Those crazies.)

Minus: No AYCE.  I came with an AYCE-friendly group, and since they are my normal sushi crew I probably won't be back for awhile.",2014-03-09 18:08:59

Food 5/5 - I had the rice noodles and they were similar to pho noodles but a bit thicker. They were also narrower than the noodles at other wonton places such as Wonton Chai. Nevertheless it still had amazing texture and tasted great. Their shrimp wontons were very delicious, again similar to Wonton Chai's but maybe a little bit smaller. The soup base was better than anywhere I've ever had and really takes their wonton game to another level. Their chili oil was also good.

Service 5/5 - Same service you would get at any other wonton shop, within a minute of ordering I got my bowl of noodles, downed it and paid at the front.

Price 5/5 - A bowl of wonton noodles is only $6 + tax, which is very cheap. In fact I think it is cheaper than almost all other places of similar quality. The price is definitely another factor that makes it a must try as there is so little to lose.",2017-06-24 05:01:24

The restroom location is a little obscure. It's on the way to the kitchen so as you're walking through the hallway, your dodging servers and restaurant staff. 

The food is where George's let me down. It was good don't get me wrong but nothing that made me want to foodgasm. The mixed green salad was my favorite with candied pecans, pears, red onions and gasp---fried brie?? Any kind of fried cheese is welcome in my belly. The snapper was fresh and meaty but lacked flavor. The lobster under it was a nice touch and was good but it seemed a bit dry. The basmati rice both were laid on was just mush without flavor. Totally edible but no one flavor popped out at me. The apple tart was decadent and enjoyable and it seemed to come with whipper cream that tasted like it was homemade. One of the guests in my party was celebrating a birthday and they brought out a chocolate lava cake without us even asking---sweet--literally. 

All in all, I had a nice time but was hoping for more. I would go back again to give George's a second chance though. It's like the ex boyfriend I had a good time with yet go back to b/c I want to believe they have some good in them. Now if someone can explain the big bowl of oranges in the front, I would appreciate it.",2011-01-30 02:09:15

Outside it doesnt seem like much, but inside is comfy and decorated with Ethiopian items and pictures on the walls.

The BF and I shared the meat combo which comes with 2 types of beef dishes, 2 types of lamb dishes, some salad and some crumbly cheese. There was a sauteed beef with jalapenos, tomatoes and onions and the flavor was good, but it was tough. A ground beef dish that was alright. The lamb dishes were better in terms of it being more tender, both stews were decent and they gave us a bit more of one of them. 

While we were full, I feel the portions here seem a bit smaller than other places I've tried. The seasoning was good, if only it were all tender.

The guy that took our order was nice enough. 

I think it's probably a decent place, but maybe not beef dishes. Next time, I will probably get my usual - a vegetarian combination.",2013-11-04 01:49:08

Located right in the middle of Main Street Markham, in between 16th and Highway 7, this small burger and wing joint is definitely worth a visit. With only about 6 tables inside, but a large patio area, it has a full bar and open kitchen as well. 

We got a Yelp Burger for Binge Week, and was an awesome Double Cheese Burger with mozzarella and cheddar cheese. With tomato, lettuce, and pickle as well, making this a beautiful gourmet burger!

TlEMiVMfifetaURiV4SXsA,JVM2ebglqYyxyCB0hlr5sw,sLhPQEYQpSgFpc9xV4M3HQ,1,9,0,2,"Wow! What a horrible place and terrible car buying experience! I can't believe how unprofessional the salespeople are in this joint. 

I saw a used car on autotrader that I was interested in...I wanted to buy a car to start up an Uber business and wanted one that was affordable and great on gas mileage, so I decided to go with a Prius. I found a used 2010 that was priced at about $9,700...figuring I could offer a lot less since there were scratches and whatnot. Anyway, when I went to the dealer that car had sold. They did, however, have a 2013 Prius with 43k miles that they just got in that they had priced at a lofty $18,999. 

When I walked into the dealership there were salespeople standing around looking at me as I walked in...usually at these types of dealers I expect to be swarmed but in this case I wasn't. I walked up to the front desk and asked if someone could help me and that's when the receptionist paired me up with Tyler. He was cool but I'm used to a little bit more professional assistance. My current vehicle is a Lexus and they are all about class at that dealership. 

Anyway, this dealer, when you walk in is just a bunch of cubicles along the sides...kinda looks like a loan shark haven or a turn and burn type place. I sat down at Tyler's desk, which had this chair that was in pretty bad shape and was an eye sore. I don't know why this dealership doesn't invest in some nice office furniture. It just looks so bad. Anyway, he starts asking me questions and I tell him why I'm there. After he fills out the necessary forms he walks over and comes back about 5 min later to tell me that the car I was interested sold but that they have a different one in stock. We go out for a test drive and when we come back he goes into the managers office. I sit at his desk and a manager comes back with ""good news"" basically telling me that the price of the car and monthly payment is more than what I'm willing to spend. He was rather rude and unprofessional and tried cheesy sales tactics on me. He walked away never to be seen again...except when he came to grab the keys to a different car they were trying to sell me. 

Tyler and I go back and forth a little..and then the director comes out who was also kinda rude and argued with me. 

Long story short, I wound up purchasing the 2013 Prius (not anywhere near their asking price) but when I got home I noticed they put a 75 month term in there for the loan when I told them no more than 72 months. I also asked for copies of things that weren't provided. The whole experience was just horribly unprofessional and shady. In AZ there is no cooling off or rescission period so I'm basically stuck with it. I recommend avoiding this dealership at all costs.",2016-12-28 18:52:28

My companion had a hard time finding the place; in fact, he would never have found it had I not left the building to go search for him outside!  We liked the ambience; however, I did not particularly care for its narrow aisles.

Friend chose the server's favorite, Orecchiette con salsiccia (""circular, dome-shaped pasta w/ homemade sausage, braised escarole and garlic w/ pecorino cheese""), while I had one of the daily specials, Garganelli, which came with ricotta, seven herbs (basil, opal basil, chives, nepitela, sorrel, parsley, and oregano), and breadcrumbs.  My friend DID NOT care for his choice, citing distaste with the escarole's texture (I tried a bite and agreed with his appraisal).  I also didn't care for the homemade sausage... it wasn't very good, actually.  I really liked my garganelli!  Fantastic, fresh pasta texture, though I found it a little dry, however.  If only there was a little more of the cream sauce... I should've asked for more on the side.

Before we left, we did check out the restrooms, but only one at a time... he went first, while I waited at the table.  He came back with a report that he found the set-up a little strange, so of course, I had to go check it out myself.  I thought it was a bit fun...

Going into Bloordale Pantry is like stepping into the Cheers bar-Where everyone knows your name. However, they do not shout it out at you=)  Rose, the owner and all of her staff are charming and fabulous.  This is one of my favourite brunch joints in Toronto.  Located at Bloor and Lansdowne (or as I call it, the blo-downe), it is a wonderful addition and welcomed gentrification to this ""up and coming"" area.  Such a lovely attempt to offset all of the nearby nudie bars.  Bloordale pays homage to classic diners with leather booths and kitschy retro knick knacks adorning the walls.  The menu is fairly diverse for brunch-prices ranging from $8/plate to $18 per entree.  The coffee is great and they offer delicious dry sodas.  With Jason DJ-ing from his ipod/computer and taking requests, the music is always fantastic.  On weekends they have awesome specials-the best is the huevos rancheros-with vegetarian/vegan options as well.  I highly recommend the pumpkin spice pancakes with maple whip cream, the perfect autumn brunch that will fill your stomach and warm your soul.  The customer base ranges from young hipsters to new families to the elderly.  Everyone is welcome at Bloordale.
I highly recommend this establishment!

Later research showed that they were eliminated early in the competition. To be completely frank, I can see why.

When I entered the store, I noticed that there were only a few displays of cupcakes (9 different flavors I believe?) I guess I'm just used to Sprinkles cupcakes where they have a lot more variety. The employee working was nice and courteous when I asked about any recommendations. I eventually settled on a red velvet cupcake, which is what I always order when trying out a new bakery.

I noticed that the cupcakes were JUMBO. Much larger than what you'd get at other cupcakeries, which was a plus. It was $3.50 for a single and $12 for 4, which is pretty standard, but since you get a larger cupcake than usual, it is a good deal. 

The packaging was very functional. If you order one cupcake, it comes in its own individual plastic container with a Sweet Daddy Cupcakes sticker. The container also has indentations so your cupcake doesn't move around and so you can pick up your cupcake without getting frosting on your hands. Functional and convenient packaging is very important to me, clearly.

FINALLY, the cupcake itself. I was very underwhelmed. I don't know about you, but I like my frosting dense! The cream cheese frosting, which in itself had a good, light flavor, also felt like it was so whipped that I was eating cream-cheese flavored air. While that may be a plus for some people, I was sorely disappointed. The cake itself was good. It's dense and moist, which is much better than the alternative (dry and crumbly), but like other reviewers have said, it tastes like it came from a box. 

Overall, I'll have to pass on making a return trip here. At a certain point, nice decorations, good service, and being the underdog on a reality show just doesn't cut it.",2014-03-06 23:37:18

Coming in at 7pm on a rainy night it is still packed. Have to wait a few minutes for our table. Just like before, so that is a good sign.

Tried a few dishes I haven't tried before since they were on the pillar. 

Pancake with beef flank (113) for $5.99.  Personally I don't like beef flank and this was no exception. The good part is it has hoisin sauce to mask the taste of the beef. Their pancake is still good though, it is too bad you cannot get it alone. 

Stir fried chives and clam (31) for $6.99. It was a good simple tasting dish although it was a bit salty to eat alone. So we ordered the pancake with fried onion to help buffer the salty taste. 

As usual I do wish it had free wifi. However, if their restaurant is filled to capacity as a norm, I doubt they would need to do it.

Overall I don't think the food is worth the price unless you are eating and sharing with at least one person. The quality, portion size and cost levels are just in the acceptable levels. 

So in the end I would put this restaurant back to the acceptable group, but I need to retry their Shang Hai dumplings before it will go back to my default list which still has Ding Tai Fung.

The Century 16 Theaters at South Point does the trick if you just want to catch a movie and bounce, but sometimes I like a little extra and South Point really doesn't offer any of this. The theaters are fairly small, the concession stand is a little confusing and disjointed, plus they don't have ticket kiosks if you bought online. C'mon man, It's 2014!

The barn-like decor, with some farm animals, and egg people on the walls are real cute. The menu is presented different, it's printed on a newspaper type layout and there are little egg people all over that too. Cute.

My regular meal of choice: the waffles and sausage patties with an iced tea (fresh brewed). My husband usually gets an omelet (egg whites) and potatoes. I love the waffles, you get 1 large waffle, light and sweet. The Patties are good too. And there's always enough potatoes on my husband's plate, that I'm able to have some too. I like them because they've some kind of Cajun seasoning on them. 

If you need anything from the server, there's an egg shaped sign on the table and if you need assistance, you flip the black egg over so that the yellow egg is showing and a majority of the time, a server instantly shows up to assist you, whether they're your server or not.

Alas, that is not to be.  The problem is the food.  Everything else was perfect and the service was excellent but I'm sorry to say, this is some of the blandest food I've ever had.  

There were four of us at dinner and nobody liked their food.  Every dish was OK (as in edible) but nothing was particularly good. Every dish was under-seasoned and under-salted. Every single dish, from the bread to the dessert.

 A few specifics:

Chopped Salad - As someone else commented, it looked like a child threw some things on a plate. That's spot on.  And peanut brittle?  Just say no to that idea please.

Osso Buco Confit -  Dry  and completely devoid of flavor, and a rather small portion on top of it.   Accompanied by a tablespoon of (once again) under-salted spaetzle.   

Bread - Again, bland  - There were four of us and we didn't finish our small bread basket.  Everybody tried it and the reaction was, ""ehh.""

Fruit Cobbler - A ramekin of fruit in syrup with ice cream is not a ""cobbler.""  A cobbler implies either a pastry or biscuit topping.  There was none.  Very, very disappointing.

Pecan Pie.  A very poor execution of this American classic. Again, completely devoid of flavor.

The drinks were quite good and the service was excellent and friendly to a fault.  I love the idea of this place and I love the menu, but the food just did not deliver.",2011-03-06 09:34:29

   Food wise,
       We started with a Scallop Appetizer with lobster succotash, Corn, and edible flowers.  This was insanely good, and really really beautiful.  I would order this if it was on the menu. 
       Next course was a Crab and Shrimp Salad with citrus sesame dressing.  This had tomatoes, avocados, shaved asparagus, and HONEYDEW.   I actually thought it was apples instead, But either way, EVERYTHING on this dish played an amazing part.  The sesame was perfect, the creamy avocados, the shrimp cooked just right and the right size, and the honeydew added a perfect sweet bite to balance it all.  It was amazing.
    Entre Course was a Filet Oscar.  This was my least favorite item.  The quality of the filet seemed lower quality, and mine was overcooked.  My wife's was cooked better, and she enjoyed it slightly more.  I have had better Demi Glaze. and Bearnaise. 
    Dessert.  This was not great.  There was pineapple that was too hard to cut without a knife(and we didn't have knives for this course). and the tarts were overcooked(Hard) and not real flavorful.  I am guessing that none of the chefs focus on pastry.  I would recommend instead of doing 4 items mediocre, to focus on one GREAT tart, maybe a chocolate tart with raspberry sauce and some fresh quality RUM macerated fruit(Sticking with the theme!).  But just do this one item perfect!  Especially since you leave people with this last taste, it needs to shine as good, if not better than the rest of the meal.

Food-wise, My Biggest criticism is that every bite of crab I had all night, which was on the first 3 items, had shell in it, and the steak being lower quality meat.  I personally would have been happier to pay $20 more and had slightly higher quality ingredients for these few items.

Drinks- First, they start you with a Rum Drink that was awesome.. even if you don't buy any drink pairings, this is included in your meal and was really great.  Then they pair either wine or Rum drinks to your meal.  I got Rum and it was well worth it.  I liked some, didn't like other, but it was matched well and I enjoyed that aspect of the meal.

Value-I felt this meal was excellent value.  I do think I'd pay more for slightly better, but understand why some people would be turned off to pay more, so I understand there is a marketing spin there. 

Then I leave it with the people.  We met some great people and had some excellent conversation all night and till we essentially got booted out, but it was the cherry on top.  Really enjoyed our time and cannot wait to do it again!",2018-05-04 17:11:47

The good:
- not overly battered (read: greasy) fish

- service was relatively fast considering only one person was working

The bad:
- the fish to fry ratio is off. if there were two pieces of fish, this meal could easily be split for lunch

My room was ok, but just ok and WAY the hell too expensive for what I got.Though they had plenty of little soaps and extras in the room - for the price - trust me - a massage would have been needed to make up for what it did NOT have!

Every time I hit the 7th floor and got out of the elevator - I smelled a faint smell of sewer - thankfully I had a bit of extra cologne that I sprayed once in awhile - not sure what the hell it was from, but it was always a quick brisk walk from the elevator to my room.

The concierge lounge was large, but I wasn't impressed with that either. The eggs were the worst I've had at any Marriott property - they ran out of bottles water and basically the free stuff you get there because you frequent so many Marriott properties is only good because it's free! I would not be paying for that for sure!

The pool was warm and the fitness room slightly better then most though. However, the prices at the restaurant exceeded my company policy and though my steak was cooked perfectly - it still wasn't worth the very high price we paid. Additionally, the desert was just ok - my son made better apple crisp when he was 12 years old and again - not impressed. 

To be honest - I had started at a three for this place and now reflecting back - I'm dropping it to a 2! They really need to do more. It's not easy to get to if you are coming from the wrong direction as U turns are not allowed - forcing you to basically go through a maze - only to find very little parking spots close to an entrance where you want to enter!

The food is alright but the atmosphere was not preferable. 

We had the lobster poutine and roll, both of which were pretty good. 

I don't remember what the shrimp dish we ordered was called, but it was like a deep fried shrimp appetizer that we chose because we asked the server to recommend a dish we could share. In my opinion, that one was a rip-off. There were only about five or six pieces of deep fried shrimp. They were small, unlike the size of Japanese shrimp tempura. There wasn't anything special about it, so after we finished it in about 2.3 seconds, it seemed a bit overpriced at $12-14. Relative to the dish they served it on (which, IIRC, was the size of a regular circular dish), the shrimp looked even smaller as they took up about 20% of the dish's surface.

They could improve things by offering the option of reservations, and/or expanding their space and service staff. They always seem to have one too few wait staff, in my opinion.  One particularly lousy time at brunch my partner and I waited twenty minutes to get coffee and water, and then an hour for our food (which came out cold).  They did give us a gift card to compensate, which was a thoughtful and we appreciated. 

As negative as I am being, it's in part a counterpoint the glowing praises.  On the plus side, it is a very cute place, they have more vegetarian and vegan brunch options than almost anyplace in Pittsburgh (big props for the tofu scramble option for the vegans of the world!), and when the food is on point, it's pretty great. I had the three-cheese omelette one time with a few added vegggies, and it was out-of-this world tasty.

The instructor for the FIT class was also very nice and informative. She gave my friend and I tips on how to handle the heat and what to eat after the class. She said drink a gallon of water a day! Also, the rooms are soooo clean. They do not smell and the equipment is also very clean. The bathroom? also flippin queen! Whenever I had to run to the bathroom to cool off with cold water or sit down for a little bit, I didn't feel like the bathroom was really dirty at all. Also, there was a mistake with my account so I immediately called and told them, they were very nice over the phone and told me that they would let the manager know because she was out of town. I LOVE this place! I really hope that I can get used to it quicker because I don't wanna run out of class anymore! haha",2015-05-22 20:33:58

Ok, that sounds a little weirder to read that it did when it was in my head... but the point is that this salad is absolutely ""to die for.""  For salmon, that is.

Then they turned us loose.  
So we all started with thier salad bar so to speak.   This place has a unique style or play on a traditional buffet salad bar.  Fresh everything.  Homemade butters and bread, Brazilian nuts, olives, cheeses, fresh cut fruit, artichoke hearts, heart of palms, salads, tomatoes, and on and on and on.  Today's added special was pancakes, bacon, and potatoes.
Then on to the main event.  The kids flipped over the paddle to the green side and away we go.  The servers I believe they call them (goutchos), began to bring the goods.  Today they were serving honey glazed ham, parmasean cheese crusted pork medallions, tip sirloin (the favorite for most of us) , flanks steak, lamb, sausage links, and a cinnamon glazed pineapple.  Wow was this amazing.  Everyone was so impressed that they all want to go again next time they are in town.  The food was mouth watering....

This place has a great first floor design in a beautiful shopping center.  Great first impression, but we had 8 people and they took us upstairs to what we thought looked like a cafeteria.  It was loud and hot, with no circulation.  We picked up our table and moved closer the the railing at the mezzanine, but it still was not great.  I'd recommend if you go, get reservations and stipulate you are on the first floor.  We did have reservations.  I will grant they don't have lots of room on the first floor due to the booth design, but we felt like we were an afterthought up on the second floor.  For groups, over 6, I'd go elsewhere. 

The service was very friendly.  We just got a bit lonesome up in the mezzanine and had to request more drinks and water several times.  A forgotten drink order was delivered just before we left, with apologies and a ""don't worry about paying for this one"", gets them good reviews as they had a great attitude.  

Bait and switch bummer!!  Then we were excited to see they had an ""All Frozen Drinks $5 special"" on Friday night.  At the front we were told all margaritas were $5.  Great, we thought...... but no, after we ordered we found out the margaritas were $11-$12, and only on the well margaritas. The $12 margarita ""The Boss"" was definately not worth it!

The chips are made with flour tortillas.  Per my teenage niece, they were over cooked and not nearly as good as the other location.  She indicated ""the other ones are great, they kinda explode in your mouth, but not these.""  

Their caso dip was very good.  I would recommend.  Salsa was just ok.  

Food reviews were mixed.  

Mine was not worth the $ and I would not recommend.  I ordered a tequilla lime shrimp plate for $22.  I got 5 shrimp that were pretty good, but nothing special over a spoon full of over cooked tasteless veggies.  The whole wheat tortilla that came with it was terrible and turned to a mushy paste in my mouth when eaten.  The black beans were pretty good.

They have a large beer cooler in a front corner near their kitchen which is fronted by some cool brushed metal which is topped by granite.

I went with pepperoni and the slices were quite large as you would expect from a deal like this and I was impressed that two of them filled me up.  Both the sauce and the cheese on the pizza are not much to write home about although not bad either.  The real star of the pizza is the crust which was thin, crispy and mostly firm giving a nice little crunch with each bite.

They price matched the newest model, surface pro 4, which had a much faster processor than my first generation surface pro. The only thing I paid out the door was the optional 3 year warranty plan (which I recommend and is well worth the money). The exchange was simple and quick. We didn't have to wait long at all. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful in getting us a much better deal. I'm so glad that I got the warranty through Best Buy because initially, we went to the Microsoft store to see if they could troubleshoot it.

The complementary side dishes - there are usually three of them (kimchi, beansprouts and potatoes cooked in sweet sauce) are also very good.
Nowadays I don't think the lunch time menu is half the price of the dinner menu, but it's still a good value for what you pay for.

Yeah on a Friday that's not going to happen without resos so we stayed in house and went to the Pink Taco.

There was a short line to get in but another set of friends got here before we did and secured us a table so in we went. We sat down and got two baskets of chips and salsa. My biggest weakness at Mexican restaurants are freshly fried casera chips and salsa. The ones at the Pink Taco are top shelf. The salsa was outstanding.

Minor annoyance. We arrived for happy hour but according to their policy on a day there is a concert at the Hard Rock, well, there's no happy hour. Interesting. Plus our waitress failed to tell us this before our friends went to the bar for drinks so they came back to the table not happy.

For my entrée order I got the Zonkey Burrito wet with al pastor. I was shocked by how good it was. Now, the al pastor was tough enough that I would have mistaken it for carne asada but man it was overall flavorful and delicious. Inside the burrito was meaty with some pico and the red sauce was outstanding. I would definitely get this again. Our server was very cool even though someone in our party was a bit intoxicated and needed an extra bit of patience.

Had been here for Summerlicious as well - funny enough, the exact same menu. The service was pretty standard, nothing spectacular. There was one server and as it got busy he became less attentive. The service was slow. The bread that was served was cold (a pet peeve of mine) but delicious.

Midi is a very small restaurant - maximum seating capacity is probably about 25 people. 

I went with my family in tow. We ordered the escargot, Midi salad and soupe du jour (roasted red pepper) to start. 

The roasted red pepper soup was very tasty. A fiery taste from the roasted red peppers with a hint of acidic tomato flavor. A great way to warm up from the chilly weather! The escargot were very yummy basking in a mushroom cream sauce. It was not greasy which was a nice departure from the oily, rubbery escargot from other dining establishments in Toronto. The escargot were very soft, not like the usual rubbery slime you'd get.  The Midi salad was served up with mixed greens, prosciutto, walnuts and vinaigrette. I found the saltiness of the prosciutto to be too overpowering. The vinaigrette however was very nicely done.

On to main courses... We had the confit de canard and poisson du jour, which was a cod provencale.  The fish was very tender and flaked off the fork with ease. The provencale sauce kind of tasted similar to my roasted red pepper soup lol. The vegetables were really tasty. It came with green beans and another pale yellow vegetable that tasted like bamboo shoot... I should've asked what it was.  The duck was perfectly seared and had a really nice roasted taste to it. The meat did melt off the bone, but not as tender as duck confit I've had in the past. 

The desserts were a little disappointing. We ordered the profiteroles, Creme Brulee as well as Poached Pears.  When I think of poached pears, I think warm and soft. The poached pears at Midi were not poached to perfection. In fact it wasn't poached long enough. I had to fully attack it with my spoon to finally eat it. It was served with vanilla ice cream. A good poached pear should consist of a slightly warm pear that would melt the ice cream to make the flavors mesh together. The profiteroles were also a disappointment. The choux pastry was horrible. Not light and airy but hard and dry. Their profiteroles are also made with ice cream - not the soft, melt-in-your-mouth creamy centre. I would've enjoyed a frozen President's Choice one just as much. The only thing that was good about this dessert was the chocolate fudge sauce.  Finally the Creme Brulee, again disappointing. Not creamy or smooth enough for my liking, and bland. 

The coffee was pretty good. Bold and intense coffee flavor. However, they didn't have any cream left so that was a downer. All in all, good value for what you pay but that's not really saying much. Perhaps I will try the restaurant again when Winterlicious is over. Their food is great, but next time I'll go elsewhere for dessert... And coffee.",2011-02-02 03:00:18

The peking duck pizza had small shavings of duck, a sprinkle of cucumbers, and drenched in sweet paste sauce (traditional peking duck sauce). As a result, the sauce really overpowered the tastes of all the other ingredients. 

The salsaccia and toscano were really typical of other comparable pizzerias. Fresh ingredients and a solid dough mixture were definitely exemplified in each bite.

The best was the funghi. As a fan of white sauce pizza s and mushrooms, this pizza did well to satisfy both my cravings. The creamyness of the white sauce base complemented well with the different mushrooms.

Each piece of fruit actually tasted like the fruit and there was not one fruit such as pineapple overpowering all the other fruits.  The person I dined with ordered the queso carne without velveeta cheese. She said it needed a sauce and was expecting it to be thinly sliced instead of cubed meat. The sandwich was supposed to have drunken onions and there were literally three small pieces that blended in with the meat.

GQ2cPziw1YEE9qDcvF0ahQ,P2sQVHyHmy4WA0I7NI5hWg,WWqdy9PKOSyhLgHIGaNFrA,3,3,3,2,"My basis of comparison for Greek is the quality of the gyro meat, the souvlaki, and the greek fries - and how they measure up to the other establishments that offer the same.

So, the quality of the meat is just a-ok.  Nothing to write home about, nothing to complain about.  The lamb souvlaki was a great disappointment, as the skewered meat was very dry and likened the taste of a large slab of beef that has been simmering in a slow cooker for weeks.  However, the accompanying tzaziki and pesto-esque sauces helped to revive the otherise cadaverous meat.  The gyro, and I have to assume that the meat was the usual combination of lamb and beef, was easy on the palate, just the right mixture of meat and salad, doused in tzaziki, and wedged in a pita - but meat was also dry and lackluster.

Now to the fries, the sweetest after hours indulgence when you have been swilling beers and shots all night.  This heaping plate of thin and crispy pommes frites is loaded with copious amounts of feta, lemon, and olive oil.  It's missing two key ingredients which ""My Big Fat Greek"" delivers: fresh garlic and herbs!

Well, this is not a fresh kind of place at all.  It is like most Yelpers have attested.  The kind of place that is amazing at 3a when you can't even think straight, much less discern what is good and bad with not only your taste buds, but also your judgement.

Prices are a big hit, and appeal to the college crowd, as the average bite here is $5, and there appear to be rotating specials that get you a complete meal for under $10.

Staff looks to be between high school and college age.  Not overly friendly, not overly impressed with the girl at the register showing her coworkers this cool new App she found on her iphone while we are giving her our order.

Now I must say this restaurant is a major treat to come here for Summerlicious, taking into consideration the regular price. This place is a carnivore's heaven, so much meat. Some selections were a bit too salty for my liking however most of the meat choices were seasoned really well. Note: get some sides from the salad bar/ hot foods bar to accompany the meats because it may get overpowering with just slices of meat. My favourites had to be the sweet steak, the flank steak and the top sirloin. The corn bread is so good here, and it was nice and hot when we got it. Same goes for most of the other foods served, nice and hot. 

The major differences I noticed with this location and the downtown location were:
This location:
-They have awesome live music performances and live dancers and martial arts dancers at this location
-Parking is in the back you can fill out the clipboard with your car info at the front desk to get comp'd parking.
-The hot food bar was disappointing, their mac n cheese/lasagna was mush, and way too much cheese...all I tasted was cheese. 
-Can get pretty loud and hard to talk in the evening
-Service was great, no snobby workers and they made sure to check up on us/clear our plates frequently
-The meat servers made sure to let us know that they would be back and just needed to reapply the dry rub onto the meat/ come back to us

Downtown location:
-The hot food bar is better quality at this location
-No dancers/performances when I went
-Very nice interior and nice restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner
-Does not offer comp'd parking-only saw street parking.
-Service was good from what I remembered

It was Friday at 5:30pm (matinee) and for two people it was about $30 because it was a 3D movie, but I still found that to be pretty damn expensive considering a 3D matinee ticket at Cinemark is only $11.25. The place is also very outdated. I'm sure if they had better lighting inside, the place would look horrible.  I'm surprised it still exists, but it IS the only theater on the strip. As Matthew C. stated, the theater rooms don't have stadium seating, so it looks very strange when you walk in, but I actually kind of like it because it make the room look huge. This is never my go-to place for watching movies since we have so many better theaters in town, but sometimes I come because the showtimes really fit into my schedule.",2012-01-23 05:08:28

That being said...  

If you pay an extra $1 to have an item that will stop you from feeling like death for a few hours it would be nice if it your burger was between it.
Should that part be messed up  then it wouldn't just be taken away,  swapped over, and then given back now that the meats cooled and a lot of the juices/ additions were stuck to the old bread. it's not as appetizing as it sounds.

How about offering to remake it, a new fresh burger just like the one we paid for?  

The fiery Jolokia burger is nowhere near as fearsome as it should be. E.G., it's lower than a raw habanero which is not what I was looking for which is a damn same as it really tastes great  and should I ever want to blend up a burger to feed to a small child I'll keep it in mind. I'm as harsh to a company proportional to their claims of  how spicy they claim their food is. 

Overall this location gets a 2, the burnt to hell coffee that came out on the first attempt should get you a 1.

Originally I had actually wanted to go to Rockin Crawfish or Boiling Crab for Crab Legs, but both locations closed at 7 today, I wasn't upset since it's a holiday. But it would have been nice. Than this place popped up on my map. It's significantly closer to my house and was open until 9, which is great because Jacob and I knew we wouldn't be able to eat till 7:30.

When we first walked in, we noticed it wasn't busy, except there was one server; Billy. Billy is super amazing, but it got busy fast. I was determined to have Crab, and I got my Crab, spicy with their recommended seasonings, super good. Looooots of garlic. Jacob ordered the shrimp fried rice because we mainly went there to satisfy my craving for seafood. We also ordered a side of bread, the Cajun fries and Billy recommended the baked oysters as well. He really sold us on it. So we ordered that too. 

I loved my Crab. At one point I realized the sauce was being wasted on the gloves so I decided to ditch them (don't touch your eyes the same day), and digged into the deliciousness. I liked how they serve you the whole Crab. But in my opinion it's cheating. The top shell of the Crab is the heaviest, so you are losing a lot and paying for the same price, but my side of rice with the sauce filled me up. Jacob said he like the fried rice, but he said the shrimp was overdone and ""shriveled up"" as he liked to say. I know we are a bit picky since we have both worked in kitchens as cooks, but I think it would have been better if they used larger shrimps instead of the Bay shrimp. 

This next part is why we are giving 4 instead of 5 stars. Billy was super busy, and we are sorta glad this turned out this way, but we didn't get our fries or the oysters (although they still sound good and we do love oysters). We weren't charged for it, but he did seem forgetful. For good reason. About 20 minutes in, he got a good 4 more tables in. For those who don't realize how difficult it is to handle 3 news tables at once, a large party of 8 and try and get everyone's food and drinks, it's difficult. But I can't not take away one star for forgetting both of our appetizers. 

Billy is awesome. Be careful though. He is a little too good at upselling. I'm surprised he didn't try and sell me his car, he's pretty good at selling you things you didn't even think you wanted...",2017-07-05 07:12:31

The shop was so small! (1st impression). I stepped in and I asked my friend if they really bake some cakes here because I didn't smell any cakes (you know the smell of flour and butter and stuffs? - 2nd impression). After being introduced to all the cakes they have, we decided to get walnut cakes. I was shocked when I looked at the price (3rd impression). $2.25 for 6 hell yeah! So I got 2 of each (walnut with red bean, walnut with mashed potato, and almonds with mashed potato)

Service is fast, and the staff is very friendly. She introduced their products quickly and briefly. The owner is very funny. I overheard him talking to another customer. He kept saying that his business has been here for 15 years and they should trust their cakes. I  was convinced by that along with the cheap price to buy their walnut cakes. 

The walnut cakes were okay for me. I like them, just won't be a fan of them. They were filled and not very sweet. But they were a bit cold. If they gave me warmer and fresher ones, I may like those cakes better.

Interesting desserts for a good, reasonable price tho!!

We ordered their 7 course beef and famous chicken wings, as well as pho tai sach vien and drinks. The wings were good, but took quite some time for it to make it to our table. The 7 course beef was laughable as the portions were tiny. The dipping sauces were tiny as well and we asked for more, we are charged extra $$ for everything we asked. The pho was lacking.

Ritz Carlton is obviously synonymous with luxury, and it does not disappoint. Luckily, a close friend is a manager at the Ritz, so my friends and I got a tour of the facilities. The rooms are spectacular. So comfortable and luxurious with bright bathrooms and all of the special touches that makes this a five star experience. The two suites we visited had unbelievable tower views. There is a yoga studio with a full schedule of classes, and a gym with top of the line equipment.

The best part of the evening was lounging on the patio at DEQ. It is incredible. The seating is super comfortable and the space very well designed. What really impressed me was the food. The menu changes frequently, but it is high end, more casual, intelligent and seasonally inspired financial district fare. (Think Bymark) However, it was far better than any of the other lounges I have been to in Toronto. We had a Flat bread with Morales and Chevre noir, with shaved asparagus and cauliflower purée that was the star of the evening for me.  My girlfriends were losing it over the poutine which had a hint of apple jus. The onion rings were fantastic, and we spit a pana cotta for dessert. All memorable.

Large enough wine selection, at fairly reasonable prices considering the environment. We had a bottle of Malbac that was good, fairly priced and served in gorgeous glassware. There is a full Charcuterie station if that is your thing, complete with made-in-house preserves.

Fantastic service. My evening at DEQ deserves 5 stars.",2011-05-25 20:41:29

The order taker was very efficient and service was very fast; under 2 minutes and I had my food walking out the door.

I sat on the outdoor patio of 3 octagon picnic tables with umbrellas.  There are 6 bicycle poles to lock up your ride if you peddled your way here.

Now, first thing I noticed was that the 2 chicken pieces were a healthy size along with a lots of fries.  Second, fries had no salt added.  Is it only me but fries salted immediately after they exit the fryer taste different that ones that sit and then salt is added just before consuming.

The chicken was good and moist...not great.  The fries somewhat soggy (probably waiting under the warming lamps for people that thought 2 minutes out the door was a good sign).  No in this case!

The menu is fairly extensive with lots of faux-meat dishes. I ended up ordering the crispy spicy eggplant and roast pork. I will echo some other Yelpers' comments that there are a lot of deep fried foods covered in sauce, so while everything is meatless, it is not necessarily healthy.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed both of my dishes. The crispy spicy eggplant had a nice crisp, but wasn't spicy at all, and a little too sweet (perhaps too much sauce?) for me. Portions were medium, and I was full only after finishing everything. Without my Groupon, the total would have been almost $30 after tax/tips. Thus, Veggie House isn't exactly cheap.

However, service was outstanding. The employees are very friendly and have a lot of pride in their food and this restaurant. They are more than happy to answer questions or explain dishes on the menu.

The interior is pleasant and simple. The food is not bad, and great for your vegetarian/vegan friends. Even meat eaters like me had a good meal here.

I only bought two meals worth knowing I should have purchased more and I really should have. 

I never go Uptown so my first trip to Nirvana was anything but ""Nirvana"". I wasted most my lunch break roaming around uptown, now on foot looking for the restaurant. It is neatly tucked away in some building on MLK blvd, not really S Tryon, which is probably what caused all my confusion. 

But alas I made it! For my first trip I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of curried potatoes and eggplant. The Chicken was awesome, the tikka masala was very mild which was nice since the potatoes and egg plant was quite spicy. 

I went again today ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala again, the chili chicken or pepper chicken looked great but my stomach has been sensitive to spicy lately, hope that passes.The sides were Aloo Bhindi (potato/okra), Navratan Korma and I got a mango lassi. This all came out to ten dollars, I swear it was pushing five pounds of food. I should have weighed it once I got back to the office. The chicken once again was great, korma was mildly spiced and the pineapple really made it stand out. But the aloo bhindi is what I was excited about the most. I had no idea Okra was a big deal out of the south east, probably because my mid western GF had never heard of it. It was very good, almost tasted like the same spices from the eggplant/potato curry but not as spicy.

For someone who has recently discovered a love for Indian food and by recently I mean six months, I enjoyed Nirvana II. Sure it's the first Indian restaurant I have ever dined at (Woodlands I am looking at you next) but I think eight dollars, ten with the Mango Lassi for more food than I can eat in one sitting is a great deal.

Trying to maintain my manly composure, I awkwardly continued to accompany the girls. After minutes of waiting and watching the girls decide which lotion best suits their needs, we left buying something (don't really know what).

Venturing around The Eaton Centre, we shopped at J Crew and Nine West but came out empty handed. When we arrrived at Roots, we were greeted with a long lineup awaiting us. Impatient and unable to wait, we left and continue to shop.

We stumbled upon The Bay and entered for more shop/walk. Arriving at the shoe section, my brother and me sat down in nearby seats while the girls continued their shop for shoes.

Several minutes later we left without purchasing a shoe. In dire need of a drink after a long day of walking, we purchase Shaken Iced Tea from Starbucks. The drink was refreshing and iced cold. The shaken iced tea was excellent to end my shopping adventure.

Food/Coffee:
Tried Americano Misto for the first time - it's espresso and water topped with steamed milk. Personally for me, I prefer espresso (in Italy), latte anywhere, and coffee when I just need that coffee - and even $1 iced coffee at MCD with milk only and no sugar, no cream works just as well! 

Ordered a Ham & Swiss Cheese panini. Their bread was really good! Appreciated the barista asking me if I wanted it warmed up. Absolutely! This was good. I kinda wished it came with a side salad though! It's more of a snack size than meal size.

- Staff is always friendly and helpful.

Cons about this location:
- It's old! The equipment is fine, but the building needs a facelift.
- It smells awful. I know it's a gym, but really. I've been to other gyms and they don't give off the B.O. that this place emits. 
- It's small. They don't have a separate women's gym or track. The second floor is deceiving. I always thought there was a track up there, but no.
- They aren't open 24 hrs like the other locations.
- A lot of the members who frequent here are part of an older crowd who just don't have any manners. They walk around the locker room butt naked. Really though, they could at least put a towel on.
- The room where classes take place is small and classes fill up quickly.

Do I continue to to go despite being terrible? Yes
Why do I keep putting myself through this torture? -Let me try to explain why: 

I am terrible at barre because it forces me to use the muscles that I don't use with my typical cardio-intensive workout regimen. During a barre class I have to focus on my core (which is miserably week) and the other stabilizing muscles in my hips, lowerback, and inner thighs. I go to barre because I need it, even though I'm pretty miserable for most of the class. 

I prefer Xtend Barre to the other studios I've visited because the instructors are patient, the other class participants are welcoming and unpretentious, and you get one hell of a great workout. 

The facility is convenient to Uptown, Dilworth, Chantilly, Cherry, Elizabeth, Midwood, and South End. The studio has ample parking and is very clean. I also like that the studio is located in the Metropolitan, so you can sneak over to Cherry Berry for some fro-yo, go window shopping at West Elm, pick up groceries at Trader Joe's, or make a pilgrimage to Target before and after taking a class. 

I feel stronger after each class, and feel like I'm starting to learn the terminology. I return to Xtend Barre because I am starting to notice changes in the toning of my core and arm muscles and I've noticed a marked difference in my balance in yoga classes. 

If you've tried other barre classes and felt out of place, under dressed, or like you were the only non-professional ballerina in the group, try Xtend Barre -their classes are good for people of all sizes, shapes, and ability levels!",2015-12-03 17:22:41

I have always passed by this restaurant and finally decided to give it a try as I was craving for some baked porkchop rice and was curious about this place. Went there on a Sunday night and it was pretty empty other than a few tables occupied.

In essence, my porkchop rice was mediocre. First bite was decent but after a couple more it went downhill from there. The initial flavourful feeling was actually due to an intense amount of MSG - even the rice itself had an aroma and aftertaste of MSG. The porkchop was thick and plentiful but had too much batter on it. The frozen peas were overdone and had a weird texture - I had to pick them out from the rice.

On a good note, my iced lemon tea was good - plenty of tea flavour and not overly sweet. As well, I was surprised that I also had a choice of dessert which I ended up choosing the taro coconut milk sago - also quite decent but not enough to bring them up to a 3* as the main entree really fell short.",2017-03-14 01:02:22

I ordered a 18inch 2 topping pizza and 20 wings for $13.  Sounds great right?  Came out to $15 with tax.  I thought to myself, swell deal, better than any pizza place I've ordered from.

When the guy came to the door he said it was $24.  I figured he got my order wrong.  Nope, I was wrong... THERE WAS A $8 DELIVERY FEE!!!!!  What!  I called the place back and told them no one told me this and the flier left on my door step made no mention of this.  The manager told me he meant to call me back to tell me and I should just pay for it.  I told him he was crazy.  I gave the delivery guy a $5 tip and told him I'll never be calling back.

The pizza was horrible.  Tasteless!  The wings were disgusting.  

I'll never order again.  I think my point is clear.  DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!!!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!",2009-10-05 05:22:57

I came here starving and psyched for pastries. My usual ""everything is awesome"" standards were as low as they get, and I was just selectively impressed at best.

The good: nice location, great beer on tap, IF THE FRENCH TOAST WAS A RELIGION I WOULD CONVERT. There was ""a lot"" of service, but they weren't as prompt as I would've hoped and forgot my beer list. They did scrape the crumbs off our table, which I guess was a nice touch. The mixed drink we ordered was also exceptional. 

The ""bad"": most of these things weren't terrible, just completely out of place at a restaurant of this caliber: The bread. The bread was tough, unflavorful and overall mediocre. And by this I mean the Baguette, the Croissant, and even the Beignets aren't the best I've had. I expected to be awed by the bakery confections and I was not. Bobby Flay's Mesa grill is a Southwestern Restaurant, their baked goods were dramatically better. The side bacon was solid, the salad my wife got was good, just nothing worth raving about.

This visit, the person who took my order had a bad attitude. I took my family there for the first time and they were a bit confused at the process but instead of being patient she gave us a glare. 

I loved the cashier though. She was helpful, personable, and cheerful. The food got there very quick. 

As for the food, we ordered the Kake udon, beef rice, curry rice, and some sides. I liked the broth for the kake udon. The noodles were cooked well and it's good for kids who are picky. It's very simple. The beef broth had a bit to much ginger as garnish. It threw off the meal for me sadly. Lastly, the curry rice wasn't a disappointment. I loved the taste same as last time. 

**The thing that irked me this visit was that there were things on the menu that they don't serve anymore but it wasn't updated. As for rice bowls, you can't get a mini by itself anymore.

At over 100 years old, weighing in at over 600 pounds, and being VERY top-heavy, I was a bit hesitant to do it myself.  Sure - I thought about renting a dolly and trailer, and getting a few friends to help, but there would be no guarantee of us getting it moved un-damaged.
I phoned Jim, and he was very friendly.  He answered all of my questions, and addressed all of my concerns.  Jim was able to set up a move day and time within a few short minutes.  His communication with me was superb - he even sent me a text message when he was on his way the day of the move.  
The guys were right on time - not a minute late!  Jim and another gentleman (apologies for forgetting his name), moved the piano into their truck so quickly, that I was in complete shock!  They made it look easy!  A short drive later, and the piano was in our home, safe and sound.  No problems, no worries, no hassle!

I gave Cabo Wabo another chance on a recent trip.  My buddy and I wanted to chill and have a couple drinks, so we gave it another try for drinks and appetizers.

The ""Mexiyaki"" chicken wings were great.  We had a great time and ended up having ""more than couple"" margaritas along the way.   

Pricing seemed fine for drinks and appetizers in Vegas.  I think the tab with tax for chips and salsa, chicken wings, and about 8 margaritas was about $100.00

Bang for its buck? Yeah I thought it was a steal. Only downside was that the ""Deep Conditioning"" is really a shampoo/conditioner wash, which I assumed it was the deep conditioning treatment where they plaster conditioner all over my hair, throw on a shower cap, and place me underneath a hairdryer for a few minutes. Guess not. The deal should of said ""Hair wash"" instead. Just saying.  

I had Phillip as my stylist. I believe he was the owner? 
He had the demeanor that he runs the place. He seems like he has been working for a loooong time, if you know what I mean. Old fogy. 

I have long thick hair and was in need of a trim and some long layers. Simple. 
So it should not be that hard to please me. Added with the style of big curls, and it came out okay.  

Here are a few tips for 1st timers:
- If you get Phillip, DON'T ever insult his work, or he will kick you out even if the cut is not finished. (true story; made this lady ball into tears). 
- DON'T expect that he can make you look like Kim Kardashian or Victoria Beckham. 
- DON'T mention that your other stylists cuts your hair this way bc he will tell you off.
- They don't really conversate with you, so bring something to entertain yourself.

She knows my husband and my drink order (a beer and Thai iced tea), and she even reminds me if I forget! Over the course of our visits, we have tasted the Drunken Noodles, the Thai Basil, Coconut soup, wontons, and eggrolls. I would say they specialize in some dishes more than others; the Drunken Noodles were the best dish I've tasted from them so far and you can crank up the heat on spices up to level 5. We've done level 4 and thoroughly enjoyed it. Their menu is pretty diverse; I went here with a group orders ranged from whole fish to spicy papaya salad to noodle dishes.

Don't get me wrong, I love the concept, the choices & the price; however, maybe this is a case of: ""it's not you, it's me"".  

I had the shrimp, crunchy taco with cucumbers, scallions & shrimp sauce. The presentation, time to wait, price & the taco shell itself ranks high, but here are my issues: shrimp were very small, the cabbage was too much, there weren't enough scallions, I hardly tasted any cucumber, & the shrimp sauce was very light. I was pretty hungry, so I did eat all three tacos, but I had quite a pile of the cabbage mixture left.

I will definitely give them another try, but next time I want to try the hibachi (which ironically, I initially was going to order it).

This restaurant is delightful. The service was excellent. Anyone who stated the staff was overly attentive- has obviously never been to a fine dining restaurant. The servers are all very knowledge, helpful, and friendly. The specials provided during last night's service were amazing. I wish I could have ordered them all. I was fortunate to arrive at 5pm and all the tables around me ordered about the same time so I could observe the entrees and hear the reviews.

The Kobe beef steak had to be well over 1lb. It looked amazing and the gentleman that eat it stated as much. His wife has the veal osso buco, although I was a bit dubious to order this here- she loved it. I never saw such large pieces of veal shanks. She loved it and said she would eat it over the next three days. The portions were huge.

My husband and I had the grilled calamari stuffed with prosciutto. It was amazing. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and complemented the house bread well. 

I ordered the Sangria. Typically, I prefer making my own as I enjoy a nice peach mint white Sangria. However, after reading the reviews on here I trusted my fellow positive food critics that enjoyed this place. I was not let down! It was not overly dry, as many others I have tried at other establishments in the past were. I even tend to enjoy most dry wines but for whatever reason never liked the red Sangria until I drank theirs. Hints of fruit were light and appropriate. Also, the liqueur blended in, likely Brandy, was not obtuse by any means.  Just subtle and lovely. 


Then came the  house salad with a nice, spicy dressing. Something that reminds me of a French blend. Not my favorite, but the lovely mixture of greens, fresh herbs, and hearts of palm made me forget that I was n otin love with the dressing.

As i was craving fresh seafood, I splurged on the crab stuffed twin whole lobsters. Amazing. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the crab stuffing was lightly blended with cream and hints of cheese. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned-mixed with peas and carrots. Equally well, were the broccoli rabe and vegetable melody.

My husband ordered the grilled sea scallops in brandy. The scallops had a perfect sear to them, and the brandy sauce was not over powering. It was an excellent marriage. He loved this so much he has requested I make this sauce at home. I will try to do that this week =)

Compliments of the house, provided an almond after dinner liqueur-the name sadly has escaped me. Nevertheless, it was a perfect ending to a wonderful meal. I am not even a big fan of after dinner liqueurs, a bit too high in the calories. However, I don't care I will be ordering that again the next time we go!

As far as the prices, I think they are equivalent to any other fine dining establishment in the area. In fact, I think it is actually more than fair given the excellent service, free parking, and insane abundance of food. I will likely be dinning here at LEAST once a month.",2011-02-27 19:45:12

And it is not terribly far from State Route 8 and State Route 28.  The hotel was also conveniently close to several shops and restaurants.  Once again, any hotel that charges for parking will never get five stars from me.  Like I always say, just increase the price for the night and say the parking is ""free"".  However, I will say parking in the garage was nice, especially with the Wintery mix of rain and snow happening outside.  The hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful with directions.  My room was very clean as well and was very quiet, for a pretty busy area of town.  Now a couple of the downsides of the room, one was I could not get the drapes to close all the way to keep the light out of the room.  I had late meetings and wanted to sleep late, but the bright skies came shining through and it was hard to sleep.  On top of the light of day coming through the cracks the curtains didn't cover, the bed was not the most comfortable.  Despite the fact, I had medication that helps me sleep, I woke up many times uncomfortable.  The walls of the surrounding rooms were quiet, however, the hallway noise was very loud beginning at about 8am.  The hotel was convenient for where I needed to be, so odds are, I would probably stay there again, despite the issues and I thought it was a little pricey, and even the second night I stayed on points, and it was quite a lot of points for one night.  Not the worst hotel I've stayed at by far, but a long way from the best one.  Definitely not worth the price I paid, in cash or points.

Outdoor seating.  Great place for summertime/fall time drinks and dinner. 
Upstairs couch seating. I always like the comfy atmosphere. 

Food. Most selections are always really good. Burgers, hummus, spinach dip. They always have a good rotating menu with seasonal apps and entrees. One I love that used to be a regular and returns at times is the Rita Hayworth and the Pork Shank Redemption. Most delicious pork shank! 

Happy hour is good with deals on apps and drinks. Beware the frozen Cosmo. While quite delish, get a driver. I swear to you I had two one night and had to stay at a friend's house up the street. 


Things I don't love. 
My only disappointment as of late are the seasonal drink features and a lot of the cocktail prices. I had a black walnut Manhattan and while it was very good, it was not $12 good. Prices are never listed for the drinks and they should be. 

To end on a positive, my service has always been great here. It can get quite busy and snotty at times from the customers who feel entitled to their neighborhood and the hosts/hostesses take the brunt of that. They are really accommodating and very diplomatic dealing with the shittiness of some of the customers. That cannot be easy!

**Unfortunately, when I asked for a pour-over, the barista had no idea what that meant, so minus one star from the coffee snob side of me; but the rest is a solid five-stars.

Food. My friend has been building this place up for days, particularly because of its delicious homemade pastries and diverse menu. I haven't eaten here yet, but everything LOOKS yum!

Oh, and did I mention that UB recently updated their hours to remain open 24/7? They're the only cafe I'm aware of in the area that does this. Major plus if they can afford to keep it up.

Ambiance is very relaxed. Makes a good ""work off-site"" location with comfy seating, free Wi-Fi, and even an outdoor patio for those more bearable months.

Maybe they should put the sign to say 23 hours or 22 hours?? And the front door clearly indicates that the place is 24 hours. So, Here comes the tip portion of my bill. First of all, I tip 20 percent if deserved. This ape of a waitress didn't deserve anything after being so rude to all of us. I was kind enough to tip 13 percent because we didn't believe that she deserved even 15 percent. Not only that, she was standing next to me the whole time watching me put the tip.

She saw how much tip we gave her, and she told me to give her more tip. I was in so much shock that I didn't know what to say! She told me that she wanted at least 18 percent considering that she served all of us plus she gave us a ""discount."" I THINK NOT! i flat out told her that it wasn't a discount, its the menu price. You overcharged us and I asked to give us the right price, so technically thats not a discount. Oh and the place is a library atmosphere FYI. Apparently, we irritated her by talking too loud and to lower our voices. This is at midnight, and nobody is there except the waitress and a couple. What is more disturbing than ever was that after we ate, they thought that extra protein is a good thing, because we saw cockroaches on the floor as well. 

It doesn't matter if you are Korean or not, they don't discriminate on horrible service. If you want horrible service and not all the food you ordered, and loved to be pressured into giving tip, Come to this place! I know we are in a recession and going through rough times, but this place takes the recession to a whole new level!!!",2010-10-24 10:04:33

The Good:
-We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and were welcomed and seated promptly.
-Atmosphere was nice but not stuffy, eclectic collection of chairs gave it a more casual feel
-Waitress was extremely friendly and treated us well, happily accommodated us
-The Fried Goat Cheese with honey and strawberries was dreamy, so delicious. 
-Basil Tomato Fondue was delicious, ""it tastes like pizza"".
-Chocolate fondue uses dark chocolate, which makes it rich and not too sweet
-Portions were generous, especially with the goat cheese appetizer, there was so much goat cheese that we ran out of bread! Our waitress happily accommodated us and brought more warm bread.

52Z0OXBL15VBRLwW7JazOA,zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,OVczZ1qHXc3bjDprNvCKBQ,1,3,1,0,"I had a terrible experience here and it continues. Let me explain...

About two weeks ago, I was in the gym lockerroom and I dropped my belt buckle on my iPhone 6 screen. I am usually really good with phones but I guess it hit the screen just right and it shattered. Later that day, I scrubbed yelp for the best iPhone repair locations in the valley. After that, I called a handful of them to price compare and Desert Wireless had the best price so I went there. I dropped my phone off and pick it up about 90 minutes later with a new screen and a complimentary screen protector. It looked great! $86 with tax I believe. 

It only took me about an hour to realize my phone wasn't acting the same. I would try and type something and get no response from the screen. So I would lock the screen, unlock the screen, lock the screen, unlock the screen. Do that 4-5x and then I would finally get some response from the screen. I wouldn't lock the screen until I was sure I was done with the phone knowing I would have to go through a process to get it going again. Not only did the screen barely work, when I place phone calls the screen no longer turns off like it's designed to do. So when I put the phone up against my face I often put it on hold or mute or something. I knew that I would not be able to deal with this but it's very hard for me to find time to stop into the store to have it addressed.

Finally, yesterday I went into the store at about 11:30 AM. I explained to the man what my issue was. He had a bad attitude about it but I get that he wasn't happy I was essentially challenging the workmanship of his business. He told me they would call me when it's done in likely around 90 minutes. I stopped back by at 2:30 PM (3 hours later) because I had yet to hear from them. The guy told me '20 more minutes.' As I mentioned before, I have very little free time so I didn't appreciate needing to wait but I can spare 20 minutes so whatever. 45 minutes goes by and I'm still sitting there. I saw 10 people come and go in the time I was there. So I was getting pretty pissed. Once again, I asked 'how much longer?' He said '8 minutes.' About 10 minutes later he told me it was ready. 

I wanted to check to make sure that it was working while I was still standing there so I started booting up my phone. It took an unusual amount of time to boot up. Like 4x the time. That obviously made me suspicious about what they even we're doing with my phone back there that they knew a precise time such as 8 minutes... 

Anyways, it booted up and the screen sensitivity was still not like it was when it had the factory screen but it was at least manageable and doesn't require constant reboots and such. Another thing I failed to mention earlier was that the screen would think my finger was on one part of the screen when it was really on another so it would call and FaceTime people without me pressing those buttons and I would have to frantically stab around at the screen to find where it believed the end call button to be! Again, that problem seems to be fixed this time. 

However, the screen still remains on during phone calls so I will not be able to comfortably make phone calls without using an earpiece or Bluetooth device until I get a new phone (whenever the new iPhone comes out). 

If I get even decent service or a decent meal or a decent product, a place can expect 4 stars from me. But I could not with a clear conscience recommend this place to anyone after my terrible experience. 

I say find another place to get your phone repaired!",2016-05-28 15:40:48

The salon is located just off the 215/Tenaya so it's very easy to get to. When you walk in you're immediately greeted and sat down in a waiting area with a TV and offered a complimentary beverage. They have a full service bar with complimentary water, juices, mimosas, etc. I opted for water and orange juice. The salon itself is very chic and has nice decorations - very unique. It's also the most spacious salon I have ever seen. The stylist stations are spread pretty far apart so no one else is eavesdropping or breathing down your neck. 

I've had two sessions with Shantel (third appointment booked for next week) and I continue to be amazed with the results every time. She is very very knowledgable about hair care and has awesome product suggestions (OI milk is a life changer). I'll insert photos of what my hair looked like pre-first session, after the first session, and after the second session. My hair was originally very long, very damaged, and very brown. I wanted to be bright ashy white blonde. She educated me on the process it would take to get me there. Blonde doesn't happen over night (the healthy way)! 

One of my favorite parts of getting the works  (a hair transformation) is getting essential oils during the shampoo/conditioning portion. You can pick from a list of oil scents that range from peaches and cream to florals and more. Such a nice touch! 

I'm always very satisfied with the styling I receive after my cut and color. I asked for the ""sex on the beach"" style from their blowout/styling menu and it's my favorite style I've ever had! The salon is also a blow dry bar, discounts on Tuesdays! My stylist doesn't participate in the deal, bummer. 

As far as pricing is concerned you get what you pay for. If I remember correctly my first hair transformation was 4 hours long and $350 and I left Shantel a generous tip because she deserves it!!! My second color session was a bit less, around $250-275. To schedule a styling which includes shampoo and conditioning is $50 with Shantel. I have a wedding I'm attending later this month and I can't wait to see what we come up with! 

If you want a budget hair cut and a questionable color, go somewhere else. If you want a luxurious, educational, fun, relaxing hair experience come to the platinum entourage salon. You won't regret it.",2016-05-14 07:14:28

The $9.99 prime rib special drew me in but all day breakfast was available. Curious about the lobster omelet so I placed an order of that and a to-go order of an Oreo cookie shake.

The omelet included tomatoes, shallots, asparagus and a decent amount of lobster. The egg itself was so uniformly yellow, it looked unnatural.

Double Leg Chicken with Spicy Fries ($9.49)
- hmmmm, juicy dark meat... tender... and SPICY! :) 
- I love how they have different level of spiciness... and the spicy has more than spicy, with a hint of sour and garlicky flavour... went well with the flamed grilled chicken
- I ended up did not have time to eat in.. so I have it for takeout the wait was about 15 minute for my lunch to be ready to go
- Spicy fries was just MEH, too salty not spicy... Skip! Maybe I should go for Spicy rice instead.

Two other friends and I went to Thai Orchid for dinner a few nights ago. They were already seated when I arrived. I parked and approached the door, and an older gentleman was sitting out front smoking a cigarette, which immediately turned me off. He started talking to me, greeted me, and opened the door to the restaurant. Ahh ... he worked there.

Turns out he more than worked there - he was the owner. He walked past our booth and sat down in the booth behind us. The smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming. 

After a while, the odor dissipated, and our waitress took our order. I had my old standby, Pha-Nang curry with beef. Cara had the Pad Thai, and Jenny had some kind of chicken and eggplant dish. 

My dish was wonderful. We all devoured our meals and enjoyed each other's company.

Pros: My wife liked the salsa, but I say it's just okay. You get two different types, and the red salsa they give you just tastes like a mix of Hormel chili and ketchup.

-Taco; Really liked the shell; it was like you get at a street vendor, seemingly just-cooked and folded. The chicken inside also tasted ""homey,"" like chicken you boiled for hours to make a soup till it was tender. Very brothy and nice.

-Speed; our food was out in a matter of minutes. Kinda scary, actually, as one reviewer put it. Is everything frozen and reheated? Didn't seem that way, as I said my taco was pretty good. But who knows?

Cons: -Lack of spice; nothing on either of our plates had any spice. That said, I feel this place is definitely Mexican food for dumb Americans who can't handle it. Not that I'm looking to burn my mouth on every bite, but a hint of something here and there wouldn't hurt.

Most everything else about this place is unimpressive, but passable. The decor is what you'd expect, service is decent, prices okay I guess. I'm not sure why other reviewers think this place looks dumpy, seemed clean and presentable to me. I'd say ""in a pinch, it'll do,"" but with so many other Mexican places around that's meaningless and Manuel's is just a face in the crowd.

They happily sat us outside, changed the propane tank in the nearby heater to provide some warmth, and even volunteered to bring the dog a water bowl. 

The Truffled Deviled Eggs ($6) were a good choice from the snack menu. They came with three egg halves and a slice of crispy prosciutto in each one (+$1). 

Since I had eaten earlier in the night I just wanted something small so I got the tasting portion ($7) of the Lamb Bolognese Pasta. The house bucatini pasta was wonderful. The lamb sauce was flavorful and there was the perfect amount of it. Everything was topped with fresh basil and a just right amount of ricotta cheese. 

The tasting portion was really small and it serves more as a one person appetizer than what one might consider a half or small portion compared to the full size. It was just what I wanted for this visit, but next time I come if I am more hungry I would seriously consider ordering the tasting portion of all 3 of the pastas just to try them and to create my own sampler entree.

We breezed right in to our reservation with no problems and the waiters made us feel comfortable right away. I liked the feel of the place right away, too, with the high beamed ceilings, big open glass doors and cute, stylish touches scattered about. 

The cocktail menu looked to die for but I was in a beer frame of mind so I went with their peach beer, which I loved, because it reminded me of Pyramid Apricot Ale, which is one of my East Bay faves. The others got some amazing looking concoctions, though, so if I ever get back here I'll be sure to get a cocktail. I was really impressed because one of my dining companions couldn't decide what beer she wanted so asked if they could serve her a flight, and they were happy to oblige (I'm not sure how she ended up getting charged for that, but the effort was still nice). 

We got a bunch of appetizers to share. The mac and cheese is not as heavy and gooey as a lot of 'fancy' mac and cheeses that I've had, and I could not stop eating it. We also had some enchiladas with shrimp and sweet corn that was amazing. And of course, I couldn't resist the brussels sprouts - I can never resist brussels sprouts. I liked that they had shaved manchego on them but I have to say I've had better cooked and more flavorful brussels sprouts in my life. I think my least favorite app was the roasted veggie because it was a bit flavorless compared to everything else, and people didn't seem too enthused about the matzo ball soup either. 

For my entree, I shared half of the salmon dish and half of the short rib with my neighbor. They've recently re-done the salmon dish, so it's different from the way it's described on the menu. The waiter had a really quiet voice so I had to have him repeat it to me a couple of times, but basically now they grill the salmon with salt and pepper and serve it with brussels petals and cornbread panzanella, cucmbers and some sort of yummy vinaigrette. I loved it! I love my salmon super rare so I wish they had asked me how I wanted it, but everyone else was perfectly fine with it. The short rib was very good as well - we replaced the mashed potatoes with more roasted veggies, but it also comes with string beans, one of my other favorite veggies. 

The desserts were vast and impressive. Despite my loud, showy protests, I couldn't help digging my spoon into the gourmet s'mores dish, with its caramelized marshmallow and chocolate covered bacon, the creme brulee (standard but good), and my favorite, the sweet potato pie. My least favorite was the blueberry crumble, which surprised me because I was positive that it would be my favorite.

There was something vaguely familiar about having a hot dog inserted vertically that I had seen before, and I figured it out later.... this was a version of the Puka Dog from Hawaii!

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noLHDbJHyyHS8UJO4ONQTA?select=zK8gXmeVknX0anqDA06sgw

So I was wondering, did Puka Dog rip off Wurstle, or did Wurstle rip off the concept of the Puka Dog?  I tend to believe that it was probably Wurstle that most likely ripped off Puka Dog, mainly because Puka Dog has been around for quite a few years, judging from the Yelp reviews and the fact they have been showcased on the Travel Channel a few years ago.

With that said, a Living Social coupon came up for the Town Square location.  Although I enjoy going to Town Square about as much as I love getting a pelvic exam due to the high amount of trendy douche-bags that frequent there, I decided to embark on a quest to quickly run over and pick up one of these sandwiches to try.

To say that these hot dogs were pretty bland was an understatement.  While the bread was a little better than your average bun, the hot dog itself was nothing special.  And sadly, they only offered yellow mustard and ketchup as sauce condiments.  To market yourself as a gourmet sausage company and not have some sort of gourmet high-quality mustard to go with it seems like a cardinal sin to me.  And who really loves ketchup on their hot dogs other than a little kid? 

Wurstle really needs to step it up and try to use some better quality hot dogs and condiments for the prices they charge.  While the living social deal made this cheap, I can't imagine ever going here again to pay full price, especially when I can run down the street to most casinos (like South Point) that offer a better quality dog with better toppings for less than a dollar.",2011-09-08 07:48:18

This place is absolutely great for families. It kinda reminds me of a Cracker Barrel, except with more upscale and one of a kind items. 

They have fun toys for kids as well as fun gifts for adults. Lots of drink ware and such.   At first you might be a bit taken a back by the higher end prices on tiny toys but I believe they are so unique they are worth it. 

The food was delicious. We all had different items. The kids had breakfast even though it was lunch time and hubby and I had burgers. They were a bit dry.  I have to say they really needed flavor. Even on the burnt side for my pattie. I decided to stick to it since we were in a hurry and didn't want to wait for a redo. Everyone else's food was great. It will not keep me from coming back. It might have just been a fluke or an off day. Or different chef. Other than the flavor it could have been full 5 stars. 

They have a beautiful garden like outdoors and a tiny splash pad for the kids outside. You really are paying for the ambiance. The location is on the smaller side but plenty of seating outside when it's not burning hot.

Gates & Brovi has a very casual, cute interior with booth seating near the windows and large tables. It also had a sports bar feel to it as well, with a full bar and bar stools. It is surprisingly quite large outside and seems like a pretty family-friendly restaurant. Despite its location, there is a map outside the front door stating places where customers can park for free nearby which is very helpful.

The food at Gates & Brovi is good, but nothing extremely unique. I do have to say that the presentation of the food is really well-done though - it is all set up tastefully and makes the dish look a lot fancier (and more Instagrammable!) There are multiple fried seafood offerings that aren't found in a lot of other restaurants, but there is nothing in the flavor or texture that really impressed me. A few of the items we tried:

- Clam Pie: 3/5. I was really intrigued by this dish initially but it wasn't what I expected. The clams are very tiny and incorporated as a topping on a pizza. However, the pizza itself is pretty greasy and the seafood flavor is very muted. I ended up adding a lot of seasoning myself and felt that it wasn't something I really ever needed to order again.

- Crispy Shrimp Cakes: 3/5. Again, a really beautiful dish. It comes with about 6 shrimp cakes which good to share, and some remoulade sauce. The battering was really thick though and deeply fried, which masked the actual shrimp flavor as well. I think the shrimp cakes also taste better without the remoulade sauce - I normally am a huge fan of remoulade, but their recipe is very strong and overpowers the natural flavors of shrimp. I think this dish could be a hit with a few minor modifications though.

- Cheese Curds: 3/5. Super beautiful cheese curds - they are really crisp looking and has some sort of green onion or seasoning in it. Unfortunately, they also did not taste as good as they looked. I wish the cheese curds were more melty on the inside, and a little greasier on the outside. In addition, the ranch sauce was pretty weird for me in flavor - something just tasted a little off.

I think that Gates & Brovi has a great foundation, but it could be improved upon easily with improved dipping sauces and a few taste tests. The service was fantastic and while I wasn't horribly blown away by this place, it is a nice place to stop in for some decent food if you are in the area.",2017-02-17 22:14:21

I love their cold cut selections. Although it is pricey, the taste is awesome. They also have an extensive output of bird seed ranging from dried meal worms to unhulled sunflower seeds. There are bird feeders and houses for sale. 

Their natural food/health section is decent and much more economical than Rainbow's End down the street. One can find dietary supplements, gluten-free foods, all natural sugar substitutes (e.g. brown rice syrup and agave nectar), vegan ice creams (e.g. soy, rice and coconut), avocado oil potato chips, and chocolate bars made with sustainable chocolate. Sometimes they run wild sales and one can find steals on durable pet beds and outdoor furniture.

The alcohol selection's extensive for a non-liquor store, and they have some of the lowest prices for a grocery store off Vegas Blvd. One can find import and specialty beers, a broad assortment of wines and decent liquor options like tequila, whiskey, vodka and the usual suspects. They close at 1 a.m. and open at 6 a.m. so if you want to have a last call or pull an all-nighter, it can be done.

Now, onto the bad...Customer service is sketchy. It is not uncommon to catch employees slacking off at work. I have seen deli employees eating in the deli counter in front of customers. That is wrong on so many levels. When I brought this to the employee's attention, she brushed me off. I had to contact management and only he acknowledged that this was wrong. Some of my family works in the food industry and if they were caught doing that, they would be written up in no time. Besides this, customer service overall is bleh. If you can check out in peace, that's the best you can hope for. 

Smith's poultry is sometimes sold rotten judging by the rotting flesh odor that permeates some chicken packages. I have seen meat selling past the sell-by date. I had to notify the meat packer of this, and his attitude was blase. No apology, nothing. More interestingly, I have come across rotten meat that is within the sale date. This makes me wonder if temperature abuse is taking place. Before I became aware of this, I noticed that their chicken did not always sit well with us and could not pin point why. 

A word of caution: Keep an eye on Smith's prices. Sometimes their sale prices do not show up when you check out (even with the discount card) and have to tell them so.",2014-08-21 21:44:00

Family owned, super friendly feel and I loved the food. I had a shrimp dish (Gregiri??) Not sure of the spelling but it was super.  The two people with me had the gyro sandwich and gyro plate, both said it was excellent.  Our meals came with a small basket of pita and bread.  I didn't have the pita but ate the bread. It was warm, fresh, and very tasty.  Salad came with the meal as well and it was great too.

Overall the whole experience was terrific. The owner and his son were very nice and personable.  If I'm back in the area this will be a stop for sure.",2016-09-04 00:42:39
SAeYJS7HJyr_jWMogB02VA,gxVQZJVeKBUk7jEhSyqv-A,EcRL1BpBvvQ5LnzgtFr8Gw,1,10,1,4,"First of all, this has nothing to do with Tapino's food or service. It may be great. In fact, that's what we were hoping.

Secondly, we are big fans of what Chef Porter is trying to do. We have great respect for them advocating the locavore movement & using local farms & vendors. We're huge fans of local farmers markets & buy all our produce there. We're also huge fans of local independent restaurants & business and patronize them as much as possible.

So the birthday fail begins...

One more thing. Birthdays in my family are a big deal. Food is a big deal. We all grew up working in my dad's restaurant (the Glass Door) & food is hugely important to us. For birthdays, we do a fancy dinner & a family dinner. This was a family dinner. Lots of thought goes into choosing the place for each occasion. This was also my wife's birthday. Kind of a big deal for me. 

For family dinner, we all go so we need a place that isn't too hard on the budget & that suits different dietary needs (some vegetarians, some food allergies). Looked at a ton of places & figured that we should try Tapino as they had a great food/drink special & we were into what they are doing. Figured it would be a gateway meal to us coming back a great deal more. 

Ok, very last thing, kids... So we brought our kids. We've brought our kids out to eat since they were born & they know & appreciate good food. They've been places like Sea Saw, Nobu, Bouchon, etc. They know how to behave & are always expected to behave.

So to the story...

Called Tapino yesterday & spoke to the manager & asked if they could take a party of 12 for happy hour. She said they normally don't take reservations for happy hour but would be ready for us. Asked if they had 2 high chairs for the kids. She said no but they had low chairs & low tables on the patio that would work great. So we're in good shape, right?

Well today, I walk in myself (without kids) & say that we are here for the party of 12 w/kids. The hostess said no kids allowed in bar nor on patio (as they allow smoking on the patio) & they don't serve happy hour in the restaurant & just lets it sit at that. Pretty weird. Was almost as if they'd were ready for us. 

Ok, so if you don't want kids in your place...at least tell us. I dragged 12 people out & set their expectations & was excited to have the perfect place to celebrate my wife's birthday. Then we get there & you say sorry, nope?

Also, there wasn't a single person in the restaurant at this time. It was about 5:45. Not one.

I'm like in shock so I tell her I spoke with someone yesterday & she understood our situation & that we were coming in. She said that she was right there when I spoke with her manager & they don't allow kids in the bar or on the patio & they don't do happy hour in the resturant. Ok, I get it. Probably heard this 7 times when I was there.

Might as well have said go away, leave, we don't want you here.

She eventually said that the manager was there & she'd have her come talk with me.

During the wait, I asked about last night's locavore dinner & told her we were excited to be there as we'd been following them on Chowhound & the Phoenix Hound Gathering group. Also told her I'd been talking with one of the farmers that was in for the previous night's event. Basically I let her know we know what they did & were into it. Might have factored in a bit? Nope.

Eventually, the manager came out & they chatted.

The manager then came over & changed the story & said we could sit in the bar at a couple of benches but kept reiterating that the kids couldn't make any noise nor move around at all. Ok, fine. First of all, we expect the kids to behave. If she'd left it with one mention, maybe we'd have just sat down. But with repeated mentions of no noise, no moving around, it was obvious they didn't want us there. I told her I felt that way & she said that wasn't the case but it rang quite hollow.

I went outside to talk with the family & figured we'd probably go elsewhere as we really weren't wanted. Went in to tell the hostess (manager was nowhere around) & got a perfunctory sorry.

Just seems like such a customer service failure. If they'd wanted us there, they could have refrained from making us feel unwelcome. Or if they were uncomfortable with kids being in the bar or on the patio, they could have easily set us up in the empty restaurant & offered us the same food/drink.

Or they could have told us their mantra ""no kids in the bar or on the patio, no happy hour in the restaurant"" on the phone. 

Maybe it was a bad situation for them but if it were me, I would have tried a little bit harder to find a solution that wouldn't have so alienated us.

I don't know. I'm epxecting to see Chef Porter at OTFM & am friends with people who work with him & maybe we'll come back (sans kids of course) but right now it sure doesn't feel like it & it's a major bummer as Tapino seems like a place that is doing excactly what we love & we could have been huge fans.",2009-02-04 06:49:23

We were a little confused by the layout when we first walked in, and had to follow the instructional signs placed throughout the restaurant to understand the ""flow"". I'm guessing the signs were an afterthought as others were most likely just as confused as we were.

Hang with me here while I explain as the ordering process is a little odd. When you proceed to order, give your order to the first person you see who will start your order, then you recite your order again to the person at the ticket generating iPad, then let the people at the register know what you ordered to confirm against your ticket. Yes, we went through this exact bit of craziness that was the strangest ordering setup I've experienced in a while. I'm sure if we came back, we now have a better idea how this place operates and should be a slightly smoother process, aside from the order repetition to multiple folks. 

The bar is setup in an opposite corner from the food. Half the time there wasn't anyone there, and the other half the bartender working was eating a pizza at the bar in plain view of the customers. VERY unprofessional in my opinion and no reason why this should be happening. 

Complaints about the confusion in the dining room and bar aside, the food was good. The pizza used quality ingredients, and the salads were freshly tossed. The BBQ chicken pizza was actually really good, while the Margherita was a little bland without much basil. Caesar dressing tasted more like ranch than anything, but still good since I also like ranch. 

If we come back, it will be that we are in the area and craving the BBQ chicken pizza since we unfortunately won't be making a special trip out here otherwise anytime soon.",2016-06-19 05:19:54

But I'm learning if you  find a decent time to go, like I have, around 1130/12noon, it is not that busy...Most of the time, I can even find a spot in the first two rows of parking spaces.

I have been finding more and more organic and nonGMO items at Walmart..To me, this is a big step in the right direction for them.. Not all the ""organic"" stores are open 24hours a day, and sometimes, (I make my own baby food, and I'm almost positive my guy is half monkey) I need to run out and get bananas at 1130 at night..... I go through bananas like it's is going out of style.....

Organic bananas. 2.5 pounds that Walmart has for $1.88 (as of 1/9/14). That's the cheapest I've ever seen them. They also have Earth's best baby cereal, which contains no GEI (genetically engineered ingredients). Earth's best, and I believe it's called sprouts, are among some of the other natural baby food items here.

I have also been able to get organic quinoa here as well.

So, when in a bind, I go. I know that the produce can be iffy, but I've bought spoiled items before at a ""natural"" store off of Tropicana & Pecos. So, I suppose it's just bound to happen sometimes. You take it back (like I did with some berries a little while ago) and they do a no questions asked return/exchange. Just bring your receipt.

And HELLO CLEARANCE! They had an entire shelf space dedicated to hair  things that were half off. It had hair dye, Bed Head products, Organix, Loreal, and lots of others. I was able to get Not Your Mother's Heat defense spray for $2.50, it's normally $5something. The woman who I checked out with was nice, and said hello to me, and told me to have a nice day when I left.

Ordered cold noodles and some other pork bbq dish. BBQ pork dish was disappointing, not much meat and the pieces that I could find was paper thin. Seriously? pork is not even that expensive! Noodles were over cooked and they served us stale eggs on top. My friend tried eating it and had to spit it out because it was so disgusting. Right after that happened, we told them about the eggs and the server kept on saying it's fine and she went on to smell the egg my friend spit out which I found to be DISGUSTING. We asked for our bill immediately because we didn't feel like eating anymore (with half of the food still left on the table) and they just brought us the full bill. NO APOLOGY or anything.

There are an equal number of people working alone as there are happily chatting pairs, but somehow it never seems too noisy. I usually go for coffee, tea, or a pastry, but I popped in last Saturday wanting something more substantial. 

I've never had much luck with vegetarian and vegan options at restaurants. Wait, let me revise that statement: I've never had much luck with food that's advertised as being vegan and vegetarian. It seems uniquely American that we over-label food that way, doesn't it? In a lot of other cultures those terms, or other mentions of restrictions or prohibitions relating to diet, are either unstated or innately understood (Everyone knows that when you eat near a temple, nothing will be cooked with meat.  Or that you never eat meat for breakfast. Or that nothing is ever cooked with pork because one's religion prohibits it.) OK, back to Fair Trade. 

So after perusing the menu and recalling all the meat I'd eaten the previous day, I decided on the Vegan Sandwich which sells for a little under $6. Immediately after ordering it, I remembered the last ""vegan"" and ""vegetarian"" items I'd ordered from a restaurant and began to regret my decision, remembering piles of raw vegetables next to piles of grilled vegetables and dry slabs of tempeh. That was until the sandwich arrived at the end of the counter. It was good-sized and served on crisp looking French bread. I took my sandwich to a table overlooking the quaint courtyard out back (which, unfortunately, it was just a teeny bit too cold to sit in). 

After letting the sandwich cool for a few moments, still expecting something that replaced flavor with ""vegan,"" I bit into it. Amazing! The sandwich was perfectly grilled, the roasted red peppers were just pickled enough, the spinach was fresh, and the hummus spread on both sides of the bread was delightfully garlicky. The proportions of everything were just right. How many times have you ordered a veggie sandwich (or a sandwich with meat and veggies) and there was so much crammed into it that it all fell out onto your plate? With the Vegan Sandwich that wasn't a problem. I savored every bite of it and made a mental note that if I'm ever downtown and my stomach starts growling for something healthy and affordable, I should go to Fair Trade. 

What did I order? The Vegan Sandwich, ~ $6

How was it? Great!

How was the customer service? The two women working at the front counter that I spoke to were both very friendly. My sandwich was grilled and delivered promptly in spite of the coffee shop being packed.",2014-10-22 19:13:35

There was no wait on a Sunday evening in comparison to the other location where every time I went I had to wait for a table. They offer teppanyaki, but I only went for the AYCE. Their pricing for AYCE is on the more expensive side ($30/person on the weekend)

The service was great. Our server was always around and always swung by to clear the table of empty plates. The food was served in a timely manner and there were no missed orders.  

I always thought Matsuda on Steeles was one of the better AYCE places around the area, and in comparison I think the two locations are pretty close in food quality. The sushi was average. I prefer the cooked food more. Definitely try the short ribs and the sirloin. What I like about this place is the small portions they serve to prevent wasting food. It allows you to try the variety they have to offer in maki rolls without feeling obligated to finish the whole roll, or feel bad for wasting food. This place serves 3-4 pieces rather than the whole roll of 6/8 pieces. I was disappointed that they didn't actually serve some of the items that were listed on the menu, such as the tofu cheese cake dessert -the server said they never had it at the restaurant.

The main guy never put gloves on, and repeatedly wiped his mouth and nose while making the sandwiches.

When our waiter finally came over  I quickly made my order which was a warm turkey sandwich with Brie cheese, green apple, with apricot preserves on a croissant. Sounded right up my alley cause I've been on a huge Brie kick! The waiter asked if fries were OK and I said yes, assuming that's what came with it. Found out later I could have had a salad instead. I was very disappointed in my sandwich, but I was happy the apricot preserves came on the side cause they were gross. The croissant was crumbling and dry. I doubt there was any Brie on the sandwich at all. Overall I ended up ditching the croissant and just eating the meat and apples. The fries were also meh.

I actually ended up not ordering from the RW menu because the 12oz. filet from the main menu was calling my name. I started off the evening with a strawberry fizz Cosmo (I don't think that's the exact name, but it's close enough) which was deliciously refreshing. I treated my pallet to another along the way, but that's not important...

Next up was the mission fig and prosciutto salad. You should know that I'll eat anything fig and prosciutto so I might be a bit biased... But nevertheless it was amazing! Highly recommend!!

As I mentioned, my main course was the 12oz. Filet (they also have a bone-in version that, if I was to go back, would definitely be my choice.) It was perfectly cooked (medium-rare) and very tender. 12oz was waaayyyy too much for me to eat in one sitting, since my eyes are typically much larger than my stomach, but now I have some epic leftovers for the week!

Lots of reviews on here mention the broccoli mac and cheese, and don't get me wrong, it's awesome! We ordered a side to split. But I also want to recommend the jalapeño mashed potatoes. They're to DIE for if you like spicy! Don't let their green color sway you!

O&B admittedly has things pretty well figured out. Buy the best property locations, bring in an executive chef that can make moderately interesting food that is priced high enough for large profit but competitive to the demographic in that area, and then hire servers that know what their doing. From a business ownership perspective, it's hard to not respect it even if I'm not a huge fan of all of their restaurants.

I'll skip the specifics on food because their Summerlicious menu is made up all things that are not on the normal menu, so in a week from now the food suggestions will be irrelevant. But you can be sure that they did the math on food costs while taking in scale to feed the masses in a quick enough manner. And admittedly it worked pretty well, and the portions actually seemed bigger than other O&B locations I've visited in the past.

While I wasn't wow'ed by anything we ate (Donair Pizza probably the best thing I tried), it was all adequately tasty and the service was on point, so we left with full bellies and a good dining experience. And for that, 4 stars it is.",2015-07-23 14:22:00

I've been coming here for years. It always falls during my birthday and every year it is what I request to do for the day with my boyfriend and my family. Parking can be a pain, but it's Downtown- what else do you expect? Other than that, it's always a wonderful time. I'm so thankful that Pittsburgh has a festival like this. There are tons of vendors- most of them are there for a few days or even a week, and then new vendors come in. Typically, I try to make it here for both weekends, so that I can see everything from all of the vendors. This year I could only make it to one weekend, but still visited twice. Yes, a lot of the items you will find here will be expensive, but that's ok, it's still wonderful to look. I've also found a lot of great deals and it's always nice to support the artist directly, rather than paying a middle man. Some of the goodies I received this year:

A absolutely breathtaking print by Anastasia Alexandrin. $40
A beautiful rose wrap ring by Doctor Gus. $10
Pottery pieces (wish I knew the artist's name) which included: two soup bowls and two mugs. ($12 each for all)
A glass ring. $5

Live music, tons of food, amazing art- what more could you want? Even if you don't want to spend money, it's so worth it to come down and experience it. I look forward to it every single year.",2017-06-22 19:15:19

My latest stop into Alexander Michael's was to continue my quest around Charlotte to find the best reuben in the city. The classic sandwich didn't disappoint. The corned beef was OK, a little above average, and the kraut was your standard store-bought style. It was loaded up with flavorful cheese and russian, adding an unhealthy but delicious flavor. Where the reuben really stood out though was the bread - it was full of that great rye flavor you're looking for and crisped up perfectly. Additionaly, the ingredients were proportioned perfectly - something I've rarely found on my journey. When it all came together it was one of the better reubens I've tried of the approximately 30 so far.

On a whim and with little thought I purchased a ticket for an event here. A spoken word event [well technically it was a psychic/medium that has quite the following, who I never heard of]. But I am not here to get into those details. 

I pulled into the lot and noticed a sign ""$5 Parking"". WTF?! I had already paid close to $70 for the cheap seat for this event and now I am being charged for parking. Making my way to the box office to pick up my ticket I was intrigued by this round building in the hood. Walking into the ""Club"" portion of the venue I glanced at the prices. Pretty standard $5-10 depending on what your drinking. After paying $5 to park and the cost of the ticket, I had invested enough in this venture already. 
Determined to get my money's worth I did make use of the ladies room, which was relatively clean. I then stood in line waiting to get in. 

The staff I encountered were friendly. Having not been to this theater before I asked for directions and was directed there with courtesy. The seat numbers were a little confusing. luckily there were not many seats in the row and I was able to count the seats to determine which was seat 8. I was 7 rows from the stage in this small intimate venue. Not bad... 
I could see how this would be nice for a comedy show or a mellow musical performance. [After reading other reviews from Rock/Punk performances I can see how places like the Marquee and The Clubhouse would be more suitable.] 

While waiting to get in I read the reviews. Several mentioned tight seating. Now I am a big girl and that concerned me. If this is anything smaller than the width of an airplane seat, I am in trouble. Luckily it was better than expected, which doesn't mean much and I was pretty cozy until the people occupying the seats on either side of me sat down. Both ladies had ""super"" purses. You know the ones that hold EVERYTHING, unwilling to put them on the floor and swinging them around everything they would get up. And the other lady spilling her soda on me barely apologizing saying it technically wasn't her fault since they over filled her soda. WTF?! Anyway the tight space was making my patience ware thin. 

However the theater is becoming quite innovative and in tune with technology. As I waited I was handed a card that advertised the Theater's app for iPhone and Android. This app was designed to keep people in their seats and a theater usher would bring you drinks and snacks ordered directly from your phone. Someones thinkin'..... 

While I would never spend that much to go see that performer again, the crowd was more entertaining. I can say that depending on who is performing I would not hesitate to go back to Celebrity Theater.",2011-02-28 19:45:53

In my opinion, the absolute best time to stay here  is the weekend when Jimmy Buffet plays in Vegas.  He plays Vegas every year at the MGM Grand, but he has a Margaritaville restaurant/bar located at the Flamingo and it's one giant Parrothead party all weekend long.  

After we left Vegas 3 yrs ago, we make the annual pilgrimage back to Vegas for this weekend and stay here.  The rooms are cheap and not the best in town, but we are willing to trade off quality for the party atmosphere and not having to go back and forth to another hotel....it's fun!  Besides that, you can take the monorail from the Flamingo to the MGM Grand right at the Arena where he plays....easy access to the concert.

We can't wait to go back next year!

We almost missed it because one of the doors was locked and the open sign wasn't lit, but it was indeed open, just empty.  Another 5 or so people had come in by the time we left, but it was still pretty dead.  

The service was good.  We never had to ask for more water, as our cups were always being refilled.  They brought fresh naan to the table (a little burned).  There were about 12-15 items on the buffet (2 chicken dishes, several hot vegetable dishes, 2 desserts, rice, salad, chutneys, raita, samosas, etc.), and we were pleased with the food.  My husband said the tandori chicken was better than average, and I thought the saag paneer was better than most restaurants as well.  

The only negative part of our experience were the bathrooms.  The stairwell to get downstairs was absolutely filthy.  The walls are painted white and there is food or something splattered all over them.  The bathrooms themselves also are not very welcoming or particularly clean.  I was glad that I didn't go down the stairs until after we finished because it probably would have enjoyed my food less having seen the state of the stairs/bathroom.

I will go back a second time to form my final opinion.  So below will be my first impression.

I walked into to who I think my be one of the owners, there is no signage to indicate that you order at a cash register and not sit down.  (I personally think they should reconsider this format)  He starts handing me menus and telling me specials and I don't even know what I am doing.  So we walked off and sat down at a table since no one told us to order at the cash register and the giant chalk board when you walk in  has a monthly calendar versus directions with arrows that say ""seat yourself"" and ""order this way""  

Anyway, we sit down and all and there is one other table in there right next to us.  I server is talking to them so we assumed that she would help us next.  After sitting there for 5 mins we finally figured out that we are suppose to order at the register.  I don't mind this format as long as it is done efficiently.  My only suggestion is that you make sure the customer knows what to do and put the deserts and some deli/cold items BEFORE the register, along with the jams over by the sitting area.   

We order, get a number and sit down.  We ordered and split the Nosh (cheese board) and Cuban pork sandwich.  Both were very good and my only comment would be to include a jam or honey with the blue cheese.  However the sandwich was flavored perfectly and found it rather delightful.  It was delivered by a server and another girl who must be learning to be a server, they had a discussion on how to present and we had to sit there and wait to eat while we were used as training and the girl in training was clearly nervous and the girl instructing was say things like ""your going to have to learn""  it was rather uncomfortable.  I would recommend writing down what you want to say to describe the food and straight read it.  But that's me.

Anyway, overall the food was good and if they improve the flow of the restaurant and front of the house service they will crush Arcadia.  I will be back in a couple weeks to give it another try and I am looking forward to trying their dinner with some slight spins on comfort food.",2014-01-13 01:08:16

But I felt like I overpaid for a bad experience. Unfortunately due to my lack of knowledge and unfamiliarity with lashing at the time, I didn't say anything. 

I got my very first lash set from this place. I did a ton of research and reviewed a lot of Instagram photos before settling on chic sin city. I was very excited but also scared. I am, after all, paying $200+tip for something that I'm not sure of - as in, how will it turn out? How will it look? Will it be worth it? 

I guess the first problem was I booked over the phone and I explained to the girl what I liked and what I do now with my lash strips. I didn't go in for a consultation or anything. The receptionist booked me with a mixed set. It turns out what I really wanted should've been a volume fill but whatever. 

I can't remember the artist of who I got my set with but she was very sweet. After the set was doneshe gave me instructions on how to upkeep. Unfortunately she didn't gauge my eyes correct at all. I mentioned I wore falsies a lot and love the look. I love volume falsies! She gave me a really lengthy dramatic look instead of a dramatic volume.

But after the session I freaked out about about how LONG they were mostly and they just overpowered my eyes. I'm a fan of volume over length and I mentioned that prior to the set. For reference, I have fairly small eyes and thin lashes. These long lashes did not last on me. Within a day I could see them falling all over my bathroom sink and by end of the week my eyes looked naked. And yes I did abide to the 48 hour no water or steam rule.

Mortified, I haven't been back since.  As I mentioned earlier I was unfamiliar with lashes at the time but now realize that the artist put lashes that were wayyyyyy too long and therefore heavy for me. I still am a fan of this place's branding and looks, and I respect the work that they do, but that first set really put a sour taste in my mouth. Also after looking at other places I feel like the prices are a bit steep. :/

I love having lashes and now that I've had it for a bit I understand what works and what doesnt. I'm a bit salty I had to pay $200 only to lose most of it within a week due to the artist's inability to gauge the health and strength of my natural lashes. 

Pro tip: as a complete newcomer to lashes, we'd appreciate it if you gave us realistic expectations on what is doable for best retention and lash health. I know clients sometimes want what they want and that may be unrealistic (very long and voluminous lashes on short sparse thin lashes) but it's best if you educate us first so we are aware of what we're getting ourselves into. I wasn't educated at all on this until later. The girl did tell me about how lash extensions don't damage them if they're done right but... I don't think they were if they were that gigantic in my lashes! To give a reference, I currently use 12s and 13s as my max size ans what I had from my first set was like 15s according to the girl who fixed it. That was also before I started using lash serums to strengthen my thin sparse lashes damaged from everyday mascara/false lash use.",2017-11-14 08:57:52

For the former, Sarah L and I visited the newly opened location at Broadview and got slices to stay. Counter girl Paula was very friendly and cheerful, although her lack of proper implements with which to open the glass bottle Coke they now sell here was troubling. Someone get this girl a bottle opener...how is this not part of the Pizzaiolo toolset??

For the latter, online ordering was a failure. The new location isn't yet programmed into the database (somebody update the XML, mmkay?) and as such it was pulling The Beaches store as my nearest location (closed at 10pm; I was ordering at 11pm) with an estimated delivery of...14 hours later. Hmm. So I called instead. 

The person who picked up the phone answered with ""Hello?"" and I had to repeat my order a few times. She told me it'd arrive within 40 minutes, and when I asked her for the total, she said it'd be ""between $20 and $30."" WTF.

Fast forward 90 minutes later and our pizza still hadn't arrived. Actually, so much time had passed that I actually forgot I had even ordered a pizza. It was almost 1am by this point, I was hungry as fuck and the store itself was about to close. Pizza finally arrived a few minutes later - the driver didn't ring the doorbell (as I had stated in ""special delivery instructions"" when I ordered the pizza) and had been standing there for god knows how long, knocking faintly on the door.

It was like a great first date with me thinking about the experience much of today.  Chef Douglas Dick is nationally recognized with recognition in some of the national food magazines and has been recognized with an award for one of the best ""farm to table"" restaurants in the country.  He's all about the best ingredients and the menu changes daily because of that.  When you make a reservation they call you back to confirm and give advice with respect to parking and other details.  Great start!  It's located in sharpsburg which is a working class part of pittsburgh.  The restaurant is right across from the ""family dollar"" retail store and located on the same street with many ""shot and a beer"" establishments.  The space itself is, well.... not nice.  What can I say?  He must really want the focus on the food.  The lighting is bad.  The ceilings are low.  The furniture is Ikea or walmart and the bathroom is tiny.  The silverware is target and the plates are uninteresting.  The service is slightly above average, but still mostly 20somethings working till they  figure out what they really want to do.  The Maitre'd, Adam was actually very good and helpful and honored our request for a printout of the impromptu tasting menu we requested.  But, the FOOD!  OMG is the food incredible.  The food is on par with some of the better restaurants I've been to coast to coast, not the best, but this can stack up in any city.  A friend that I had lunch with suggested that we ask for a tasting menu.  We didn't even look at the menu and just asked the server to ask the chef to make us as many dishes of whatever he wanted with no restrictions.  I suggest you do the same, but Kathy said they usually won't do this on the weekends, so better to try for a weekday.  Ok, the meal started with an amouse bouche (sp?) which was a piping hot cauliflower soup.  It was pretty good, but not memorable.  The first course was amazing.  It was a perfectly caramalized dayboat scallop with a strawberry chutney and a 20 yr. aged balsamic.  This combination was the best scallop I've ever tried.  It was like the first time you had ice cream.  The next dish was a pan seared grouper with vegetables.  This dish was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully, but for me it wasn't memorable.  The seared tuna with microgreens and candied kumquats (what! as if kumquats werent' sweet enough) and toasted almonds was delicious.  The ""prime"" lamb chop came next and was the best lamb chop I ever had paired perfectly with collard greens.  The waiter then asked us if we could still keep going, we said bring it on, so finally was a kobe beef sirloin, which was rich and unlike any steak I've ever had.  The desserts were okay, but nothing special.  I actually didn't care for the lemond tart, but really liked the coconut lime sorbet.  The bread served with dinner was just out of the oven and served with this interesting cherry butter.  The pacing could have been a little faster we took about 3 hours with dinner which certainly could have been 2 1/2 hours.  Overall a great chef that we are lucky to have.  The portions were reasonable and no one felt uncomfortable after all these courses and the price was about $70 each, which is very reasonable considering the quality and the fact that is BYOB.  I can't wait to visit Bona Terra again.",2008-06-27 21:00:26

Financed by John D. Rockefeller, this magnificant 300-foot open arcade was modeled after a building in Milan, Italy.  This was a shopping mall built into the downtown fabric of the city before shopping malls had even really been conceived, and this one shows that enclosed but open public spaces can uplift rather than depress.

I once attended a rally for Walter Mondale's presidential campaign here, and with flags, bunting, and four levels and a floor of wildly angry Cleveland workers, students, and local Democrats trying to bring down the Reagan regime by cheering on old timey pol Walter Mondale, it was like being transported back to the 1890's.

Cleveland wisely chose to preserve this arcade and a couple smaller and less spectacular examples of the style in the neighborhood, and it's been redeveloped several times, most recently as the centerpiece of a Hyatt Regency, which is a bit depressing.  It's still worth a walk through to marvel at the thousands of panes of glass that make up the huge vaulted ceiling and the magnificent brass railings, and you might find a treat or treasure in the two floors of shops that remain.",2006-12-14 07:01:47

Make sure you ask for a side of the ""ancho"" sauce with your onion rings otherwise they usually just bring out ranch dressing and ketchup. They also are offering any sandwich on their menu for $6.99 seven days per week. The sandwiches come with pickle and one side item. The Dillon's Dip sandwich is my favorite. It's a french dip served with a side of au jus and a side of sour cream horseradish mixture. The meat on the sandwich is flavorful and the au jus is not too salty which can be a problem at a lot of restaurants. The pulled pork platter is great as are any of the rib dishes. Best side dishes in my opinion are the mashed potatoes with brown or cream gravy, the baked beans, or the potato salad.   They also have daily drink specials for $3.00.   The special on Tuesday's is the margarita.   They're great margarita's for only $3.00.    The atmosphere is casual.    Great food you won't be disappointed.",2010-07-25 15:17:56

The gym is mostly cardio equipment, so don't expect to do any lifting - for that head to the Lifetime Fitness down the road.  Room service is subpar as it is just typical room service fare.  If it wasn't for business, I wouldn't have ordered it.  

The River City Grille lobby restaurant is also a typical hotel restaurant, with terrible service and so-so food.  Though I must give them credit for attempting to bring a little local foods and fresh ideas with the specials menu.  Best part is the bar, as the bartenders are quite friendly and know their drinks well.  Plus for the abundance of TVs.

Good value, nice options, and portions are fairly decent depending on what you order. I find that the service seems slower when they're actually not too busy, but when they're packed (like for lunch, afternoon tea, or breakfast) they move a lot faster. Suppose its a kitchen staffing thing? But it's not a mega long wait or anything so I don't really mind. Usually I get the baked pork chop rice. I find the sauce to be quite decent here and not overly salty like other HK cafe's I've tried. The cream sauce dishes are not ones that I recommend, just because I personally don't enjoy them as much. Sometimes I taste it and it's just really weirdly watery cream sauce, and other times, it's thick like they added thickener but no seasoning to balance it back out. I just haven't really had a good experience with the cream sauces so I order tomatoe based sauces or the black pepper sauces. Noodles in soup are quite standard here so a safe choice :)

My hubby and I came here on weekday evenings and noticed the service suffered a bit even though we were the only people there. Also, the food portions decreased and prices have gone up. Prices on some of the desserts have decreased by $1 or so, but still expensive for the amount. 

The food portions need to be a bit more for the price, and the dishes can use more spiciness. I noticed that the dishes are usually overdone on one particular spice which overwhelms the overall taste.

I came here with a Groupon for a wash, treatment, cut & style. I was appointed with A. She was super nice and moved here from Ireland. She first sat me down and had a specific consultation with me about my hair and what I wanted. This is VERY important as most salons don't do this and basically tell you what they think you need to get done. I knew I had a lot of split ends and areas that needed major work and once I heard her explain what needed to be done I trusted her with my hair. She washed and placed treatment in my hair which sat for 15 minutes under heat. Her assistant washed it out and A was back to cut/stlye my hair. What a perfectionist! She kept asking me to uncross my legs, which I realized actually makes a difference when you are cutting hair. She kept going back to make sure it was perfect. I am not one to be picky with my hair cut, but she overall did a great job. My hair feels soft from the treatment, cut was good!

This year, I continued my quest for the perfect traditional turkey dinner (because my mom doesn't like or cook turkey). I saw an online ad for O&B's Thanksgiving specials so I decided to give it a try. 

Upon arrival, I was surprised that this ""Thanksgiving special"" wasn't advertised at all at the restaurant, and we had to inquire about it. Luckily, we came just in time to sweep up the last two orders available for the night. 

Their traditional roast turkey dinner included both white and dark meat, sage bread pudding, Yukon gold mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts, Northern Ontario cranberry sauce and gravy. I definitely liked the dark meat better than the white meat because it was more moist and flavourful. The sage bread pudding was a little too salty on its own, but went well with sweet cranberry sauce (I love cranberry sauce!). Altogether, I liked the combination of all the different flavours.

The Thanksgiving dessert special was Niagara apple strudel with sweet spiced pumpkin gelato. I found the strudel to be mediocre, probably because I'm not a big fan of strudels. I much prefer apple pies or apple crumbles. However, the pumpkin gelato was a refreshing delight! I wished that it had been paired with a pumpkin pie.

BOILED PEANUTS: Get in on it. Enough said. 

FOOD: The menu offers a big variety of classic Korean dishes such as Soon Dubu, Naengmyeon, GalbiTang, and Kalbi. All of which I have tried and are delicious! Then there are the Hawaiian staples: Spam Eggs & Rice, Loco Moco, & Rice Omelette. The menu is pretty big here and you can't go wrong no matter what you get. It all has that home-made Korean food flavor. The Meat Jun is spot on here and I never leave without a belly full of their Jjin Mandu (Steamed Korean Dumplings). You could opt for the fried ones but steaming gives them a more delicate flavor as well as cuts the grease. Those along with the Kim-Chi are made in-house. Portions and Value are definitely better here than at some Korean restaurants.

BAN-CHAN: There's always a bunch of little dishes which is the usual for Korean eating. Kimchi, Radish Kimchi, spinach, potato salad, etc. It seems to vary every single time I come here. But its all good. They don't have a problem refilling them either!

TEA: The type of tea they serve is some random type of Korean root tea. Its delicious. Its not the usual Barley Tea (BoRee Cha). It comes from seeping whole pieces of the root and not some store-bought tea bag.

Although the Unionville (Birchmount) location is closer, their hours are limited. Moksha Markham's classes are way more abundant and they have a wider variety of styles of classes. The instructors at both these locations are very knowledgeable. The Markham facility is bigger than Unionville's. However, it is a popular spot for hot yoga in the community, so you need to get there good and early if you want to grab a ""good"" spot. 

The change room is reasonably ok but there are only 2 shower stalls. That's not enough for a place this size and it's not like they are lacking in funds. Their classes are regularly packed. They might want to think of investing a teense to keep their membership up. 

My favourite class is the Monday 9:30-1100. Yes, 90 minutes of bliss. They usually have a pretty good intro deal available if you've never been. After that, your best bet is a 10 class pass which is good indefinitely at either Markham or the Unionville location.

We were the first customers for the evening as we promptly arrived at 6PM.  Within minutes of being seated, our server came to take down our drink orders.  I order a Limone.  Unfortunately I cannot recall what was in it but it the basil leaf in it made the drink refreshing.  It was not sugary like most cocktails or mixed drinks I've had which was different. 

We ordered the Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes and Toast to start followed by the Portuguese Squid with Sepia Arancini and Arugula Sauce and the Charcoal Grilled Chorizo with Portuguese Octopus, Marinated Peppers and Preserved Lemons.

Burrata is an Italian cheese made form mozzarella and cream.  If served alone, it would be rather bland and unsatisfying.  However, from a textural perspective it was quite creamy and resembled a poached egg.  The subtle hints of tartness and sweetness from the grapes, coupled with the richness of the olive oil and salted bread came together wonderfully with the Burrata.   I loved that the simplicity of the ingredients surprised resulted in such a surprise of flavours.


Next up was the squid.  The presentation was beautiful.  The scoring of the squid allowed the browning to add a visually appealing scalloped look to it.  It was served atop a deep-fried squid-ink risotto ball.  While the shell of the rice ball was rather bland, the squid-ink risotto was packed with flavour.  The earthiness of the arugula sauce did a good job of balancing out the saltiness of the risotto and squid. 

Last, but certainly not least came the octopus.  Now that I think back on our meal, I wonder why we decided to order two seemingly similar items instead of venturing out and trying other things.  Oh well... its water under the bridge.  The octopus was not quite as delicate as the squid because of the texture of the suction cups found in its tentacles.  The octopus was served with roasted red peppers, polenta and a spicy chorizo sausage.  It was seared perfectly - not rubbery or tough.  The subtle twang from the roasted red peppers did a good job of foiling the salty octopus.  The extra heat added from the chorizo sausage was also mellowed out by the peppers.  I quite enjoyed the polenta cake as it was crisp on the outside like a hash brown and added to the dimensions of the dish by incorporating a hearty carb of sorts to give you the feeling of gratification.

Verdict:

I would recommend coming to Campagnolo with company in order to sample their menu items.  Their menu is printed daily and although the menu is not extensive, all the items on the menu are carefully picked and tasty.  The space itself is quite airy, with lots of natural lighting coming in through the windows and a great view of the kitchen and bar no matter where you are seated in the restaurant.  The food is fairly priced and the servers are all very friendly.  For a Wednesday night, the restaurant was at about 90% capacity, which only goes to prove the reputation it has acquired for their good food and trendy ambiance.",2011-05-07 14:50:53

This chain has expanded many of its existing stores and added refrigerated and frozen foods.  Granted, I don't usually buy the food items, since most of them are brands that I've never heard of.  

Tonight I wanted to get a bottle of Palmolive dishwashing liquid.  It may not be a real deal, since it's only a 14 oz. bottle, but that'll last for the next two or three years, so why buy a bigger one - for more money - at the supermarket?  True to form, it wasn't the only thing I ended up getting, but I did make it out alive and having spent only seven bucks.

One of the best deals at Dollar Tree is being able to get really nice greeting cards for 50 cents each, though they've recently added a line of even nicer cards for a buck each.  I've been to trade shows that supply the dollar store market and have seen first hand how cheap greeting cards can be for the vendor.  Dollar Tree is still making a tidy profit on that fifty-cent card, but I'm not complaining.  And big, fancy gift shopping bags for a dollar?  Why would anyone buy one anywhere else?

Dollar Tree is not franchised; each store is corporate-owned, and that's how they are able to maximize their investment;  most of the items in the store are made specifically for Dollar Tree, aka Greenbrier International.  Good for the consumer in one way, by offering a vast selection of items for a small price.  But the larger price is that what's good for the consumer is bad for our country.  Everything's made in China.

I popped in on a sunny Friday around 3, just before the weekend beautification rush began.  I was seated immediately after choosing my polish, and the girl set down to work. 
The feet looked great....the hands?  Not so much.  Just as I was moved to the mani station, another 5 people walked in for treatments.  Even though I don't speak Chinese, it was clear to me that they were told by the owner/boss to hurry up.  She literally managed to do all my cuticles in less than 30 seconds...for both hands.  Then she passed me off to some random teenage guy to do the polish.  
He really did take his time, but it was reminiscent of a person doing a tough math problem - tedious, time consuming, and frustrating.  
He placed me under the dryer, and no more than 2 minutes later I was quite literally pushed out of my chair.  Even though I explained I had only just sat down, she said ""no, no, quick dry!  no problem!""
So I paid, denting the fresh polish, and left.  Within an hour the air bubbles started to appear in the polish.

My partner ordered their drink special which was eggnog with Kraken. It came fashioned with a cinnamon stick and went down smooth.  Our mains were equally as good. The oxtails were braised to perfection and fell off the bone.  The gravy was rich and savory. The salad with it was fresh and refreshing.  My partners fish and chips were excellent. The fish was thick cut and lightly coated in a malty crispy batter.  With it were hand cut fries that were nicely seasoned.  We took our perogies to go as we were pretty stuffed.  Once reheated later we wish we had ordered two portions.  The bacon used was smokey and fried to a perfect crisp.  Hands down the best perogies we have had.

Like all the other reviews say, this soup is out of this world, but the salad was awesome too.  Very acidic, the tomatoes were fresh.  I loved it but if you do not like vinegar, pass on the salad.

By day they have a varieties of soups and sandwiches, as well as baked goods. Sandwiches are on luscious slices of thick bread and the soups come with crunchy salads. I especially like the grilled sandwiches, which are laced with creamy butter and lightly browned meat. Portions are quite large and one sandwich could probably be shared easily among two adults. Sometimes I forget this and end up making two meals out of one sandwich.

During lunch hours this place is quite crowded, but by late afternoon it becomes serene. Soft green light floods in from the skylight and during the winter you can sit the fire with a baguette and a glass of wine.  

As regards to the review that mentioned rudeness about adding protein to things, I've heard that happen many times during lunch and now they let you have your meat, but charge a lot for it. They have this bizarre policy because they ""don't want people making their own sandwiches with the bread that comes with the entree."" Nice one. 

At night it becomes more formal, with candlelight, fondue, and more upscale entrees. The balsamic potatoes that come with the entrees are perfect. I like the fondue, but it's a little too much for me...even the small pot can be shared by two. Last time I was there I tried the tapas and the yellowfin tuna and the lamb were delicious, but I was less than enthusiastic about the duck mousse, which had a bland sickly sweet flavor. The greens that came with the tapas were also pretty inexcusable. When I go to a good restaurant I expect more than just some shredded romaine, especially when field greens are still in season.

Note: They don't have PPV sports here. So if you're looking for fight night, it aint here...but you can watch porn though.

Both bathrooms offers this super cool shower heads. Very modern and sophisticated. And for whatever reason, this hotel doesn't have ""hard water"" like other hotels. It was great actually.

You can pretty much walk inside this air conditioned area without the hot and dryness of Vegas Blvd for awhile.

Habib has done special work for me on a Prada bag I have after contacting Prada at Bellagio and not hearing anything back. While not something he usually does, the strap loophole he fixed turned out perfect. Weeks after it was done, Prada returned my email quoting me $60+ to ""possibly"" fix it due to the location of the tear.

Habib also did work on my wedding reception dress. It was a handmade silk  dress with thousands of hand sewn crystals made for me while my friend's parents were in Pakistan. 

I wouldn't trust anyone else to do tailoring on a garment that's so #1 delicate #2 so cost prohibitive that you'd never be able to afford it in the west. Habib changed the sleeves for me, hand sewed in a keyhole back and expanded the waist on the underskirt that was way too small without needing extra fabric. It fit perfectly afterwards!

The tailor in Dallas I used for my wedding gown charged me $487 (Almost had a heart attack at the price because they forgot to do some of the work I had requested!!!) just to make the top smaller and add straps. Habib did all this work on a more delicate wedding dress for less than $80. From experience, Habib is the real deal.",2016-10-08 18:58:04

When I think of Caribbean food, I don't really think ""vegetarian-friendly"" but Kaya does a really great job of blasting that misconception to smithereens.

I very much enjoyed the veggie Cuban sandwich - I have had sauteed mushrooms and cheese on bread many times in my life, but never has it been so delicious! The black bean spread is super flavorful and it makes for a wonderful sandwich experience. The chips are great too, and the cilantro-lime dressing from the salad makes the perfect dipping sauce for everything.

The salad itself is a little plain - basically just mixed greens and pepitas. But man, that dressing is good! The other lackluster item was the veggie paella. It was less flavorful overall, and there was hardly any pineapple. Due to time in transit, the rice had clumped up quite a bit. It also lacked the crispy crust I expect on a paella.

Looking at Kaya's menu, I'm intrigued to go check it out in person, but I'll have to save it for a special occasion (it's pretty pricey). I wish the veggie cuban was on their regular menu - it's sooooo good!",2016-02-04 16:11:00

I have to say that the drinks really weren't anything special. It tasted like cool (not cold), watered down tea. After overdosing on simple syrup, I still couldn't taste much difference. The free mint water they were giving out had more taste.

I can see people usually go here for the lattes and not really for iced tea so I'm just going to say that if you're looking for iced tea, don't go here.",2015-07-10 04:06:59

Whomever is their purchaser should be awarded a badge of merit for always finding items that we can't seem to live without. I don't know how many times I've gone into this store and seen an item and thought to myself ""How have I gotten through the day without having THIS?""

This is THE place to buy books....much cheaper than Chapters/Indigo. Meat department is fantastic (we hired a chef to cater a dinner one night (through Deal of the Day..so it was not expensive at all) and he recommended Costco for meats stating the quality cannot be beat). Gas prices defy logic...how do they keep their prices at least $.05 cheaper than the competition? And who doesn't love starting their Christmas shopping in August?  Their seasonal Garden Centre cannot be beat for prices.

Staff are very friendly and seem to like working there. Their banter throughout the store is a welcome relief to the robotic service some stores have.

One minor complaint and that is that it is always busy and finding parking can be an issue. Once inside it can be a little roller derby-ish as you try to maneuver through the aisles. Cashier lines move quickly inside although backlogs can occur as you're trying to exit the building.

Their no questions asked return policy is fantastic (I had a friend return market umbrellas purchased years earlier that were damaged by a windstorm and they took them back!)

9l2MWWMdSjbBSNYMVJSJpA,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,luPvNx4XSxaM7pka8EifuA,4,3,0,1,"Montreal is a happy hour haven. The 5 à 7 is a true institution of our fair city which really ramps up once the weather warms up and the terrasses get going. One of the few downsides of my actual job is that it doesn't really allow me to enjoy downtown happy hours because I work in the West Island and my hours often go past happy hours. A few weeks ago, taking advantage of my family all being downtown for a change on a weeknight and me not being at work late, we met up in Quartier des Spectacles and decided to try Taverne F, the little brother to Cafe Ferrera.

Taverne F is a Portuguese brasserie so its focus is on smaller plates to share as a group while you enjoy some wine or a cocktail. The shipping container-shaped space, located just beside Place des Arts, has a very modern and clean decor although the general narrowness of the space isn't ideal. It causes problems at the entrance of the restaurant when you have patrons waiting for a table and the lack of a atrium causes those people to spill into the bar space right in front and then you can barely move out of your bar stool... which was a problem since we were sitting at the bar. When the beautiful terrasse is available, I suspect it really helps to open up the room and ease this issue.

First dish I tried was Mama Rosa's pork confit. Deliciously fatty pork that just fell apart with a fork. Mama Rosa's spice mixture (whatever it was...) didn't really come out all that much but it succeeded in getting such a great texture through the curing that it didn't matter to me. A nice dish to share.... if you can pull yourself away from the dish in the first place which I wasn't able to do in this instance.

The second dish was the taverne poutine - a Portuguese play on a poutine with salted cod and wild oregano on top of the usual cheese curds and fries. Reading the description of the dish got me very intrigued. I love poutine and salted cod separately and the notice of combining them had never struck me before. In this case, the combination worked very well. The inherent saltiness of the cod plays very well with fries and its flakiness allowed the fish to blend well with the gooey cheese and sauce. The fries were nice and crispy as well (well... at least before the sauce got to them). This was a all-around solid dish and a nice twist on the poutine.

Finally, I could not leave without getting a dessert especially when Taverne F has pastel de Natas on the menu - those delicious little custard egg tarts that I love so much. Flaky and rich with a nice hint of vanilla, Natas are desserts that I could eat everyday and Taverne F's version was no exception. In this case, the pastel de Natas were served with Maria biscuit ice cream, not that we knew that when we ordered them. The ice cream was nice and smooth but the 3 of us could not for the life of us place the subtle sweet flavour of the ice cream in context until our waiter told us - which makes sense because none of us had ever had those cookies before. A solid end to a late happy hour.

Taverne F, due to its location and format, really works well for a quick bite and drink before or after a concert or show. All of the different festivals that occur around it makes this place a happening all throughout the summer... as I have noticed when I have gone by the past few years. The food is solid and the drink options are plentiful. It is a Cafe Ferrera joint so it is not a cheap stop but a worthwhile one if you are in the surroundings, and with festival season around the corner, most of you most certainly will be close by.

Cheers!",2014-06-02 14:46:28

We were pleasantly surprised that this restaurant is in one half of the Spectators bar at Flamingo and Durango, which means it's close to work! We were seated immediately and greeted by chef Bobby. The menu is still under construction, he advised, but still had plenty to offer. We ordered the fried pickle appetizer and ice teas. Not only do they have unsweetened tea but they also serve sweet tea!!! Yeah, I'm a southerner and I miss my sweet tea. The fried pickles were wonderful! The crispy breading combined with the salty pickles made for a tasty appetizer. So tasty in fact that the 3 of us finished them in record time. I ordered the shrimp and grits appetizer and the wedge salad. My friends' ordered the beef brisket sandwich and the chicken fingers. All of it was delicious! The shrimp were the perfect texture (not overcooked) and seasoned with a Cajun spice mixture. The grits were cheese polenta and they complemented the flavorful shrimp exquisitely. The wedge salad was made up of lettuce, blue cheese crumbles and bacon served in a little glass jar. For $2 it was a deal! I sampled the chicken fingers which were nice and crunchy with some sort of panko breading batter. The brisket I didn't sample but was told it was moist with a nice smoky flavor.

I have to tell you, the staff seemed practically excited to see us! After hours! It was a nice change from the usual huffing and puffing I've gotten from similar trips to other restaurants. They were very welcoming and chatty, asking about our night and offering suggestions for our feast, even delivering some items straight to our tables. Service at its best, honestly wonderful.
  I've always really enjoyed Ted's dogs, last night I got two regular dogs, one with chili, cheese, and onions, the dog was grilled perfectly with a little snap to it and the chili was slightly sweet with a perfect kick to it, and the other had just their signature hot sauce (a spicy relish) and was just wonderful, I don't even like relish but it was sweet and spicy and tangy... just great.

We had a friend invite us to lunch and recommended Tommy Bahama.  Neither my wife nor I had eaten there, so we gave it a shot.  Very glad we did.  We arrived at 11:30 and there were only a couple of tables.  Nearly an hour later the place was 75% full, and this was a Tuesday.  This is typically a good sign.    

To start, I had the crab bisque.  This was textbook bisque to me.  Velvety smooth with the cream, and the sherry flavor came through.  It had crab throughout, even a couple of chunks.  A couple of grinds of black pepper and this was excellent.  I would definitely order this soup again.

I had the chicken sandwich with French fries, rather than the yucca fries it is usually served with.  This sandwich was enormous, I was surprised how large it was.  The chicken was grilled perfectly, they pulled it at just the right time so it retained its maximum juices.  It has lots of fried onions, which are always welcome, as well as jack cheese, garlic mayo, and a jerk sauce.  I could have used more sauce, as it provided a well needed kick.  The soft bun kept it all together.  The sandwich was fantastic, but the fries were not.  They were void of seasoning, and tasted like they have been sitting at room temperature for at least 10 minutes.  Some were nearly cold, and none were hot.  This is the only reason I can't give Tommy Bahama 5 stars.

The wife had the special, a grilled cheese sandwich with everything under the sun and tomato soup with some sort of chiles.  We can't recall, it may have been poblanos.  Whatever it was, it was good.  The grilled cheese had blue cheese, bacon, and some sort of jam.  It was on the requisite crispy bread and was fantastic when dipped in the soup, which had a bit of heat from the chiles.  This was a fantastic version of a classic (and overdone) dish, one I hope they add to the menu.

For dessert, we ordered the side dish of fried plantains.  This comes with a yogurt sauce with bits of pineapple that was fantastic.  It was a great way to end the meal, a dessert that was unique but not that sweet.  Like the rest of the meal, I would order this again.

Growing up on the Chesapeake Bay, I developed a taste for fresh, raw oysters.  I was extremely skeptical when I saw some of the Virginia and Maryland varieties that I love on the menu at Kings.  When they arrived at the table they appeared amazingly fresh and tasted even better.  I also love Copper River Sockeye Salmon season and the blackened filet that the kitchen prepared for me today was out of this world.

They have a cool menu for the kids and my daughter loves her plastic cum with mermaids on it.  My wife really enjoyed the creme brulee that was served for dessert.

My little sister was visiting for the weekend and we fancied brunch in the 'hood. Seems like a few places in the vicinity don't want to put on their happy morning faces until 11am or 11.30am so Cafe la Gaffe won partly based on being open. The menu was the most enticing thing, however. It's pretty extensive with something for most tastes-a mix of breakfast, brunch and lunch foods.

Our welcome was warm and we were placed at the window table which is a tiny 2-seater. It was a little tight but adorable. We basked in the winter sun and tried to figure out what to eat. The menu is large to begin with but they also add specials and it was really difficult to choose. In the end, I went with a chorizo omelette served with salad and home fries and she went with the sausage breakfast.

My meal wasn't piping hot but was very tasty and came with fresh fruit on the side. So filling! I felt envious of my sister's sausage breakfast, however. The sausages were delicious and it also came with some very tasty toast that I just had to sample. For Yelp, of course. I think I'll get that the next time. Or maybe the french toast. Too much choice!

Service was excellent. I felt sorry for the server, unfortunately. She was so sweet but she was trying to run the place all by herself. It was too much. She was very attentive despite this-I think I had around 10 cups of coffee because she refilled my cup every time I got about half way down. She never lost her smile and pleasant demeanour regardless of  the number of tables either.

He has his sons helping them out on their off time, which makes it that much better knowing you are getting a quality meal from a family owned place than a chain that half the time, doesn't give a shit.

Growing up in the area, I can't remember a time before Tony's.  Established in 1915, it has been dishing out ice cream to beat the band.  I remember eating their black cherry ice cream, stuffed with sweet, juicy orbs tucked in cold creaminess and exploding with flavor.  Once, Tony's was part of my 10th birthday as a surprise, along with a picnic at Rankin Lake and a visit to the zoo.  That was before parents invested in bounce houses and magical clowns.
I appreciate that Tony's still operates in their original building.  The interior still has the red booths and yellow tile on the walls.  Such a pleasant quality when the current trend is to tear it all down and make it shiny and new.  
My husband ordered a cup of chocolate ripple ice cream in a cup, despite my hinting about black cherry in a cone.  He shared a few bites with me, and it conjured up memories of a special treat.  So, why didn't I order a cone of black cherry?  The portion size is humongous, and I wasn't hungry.  Besides, sadly (or gladly), I have lost my taste for ice cream.

Liked:
+The wine list which was predictably extensive and expensive. Look closer and there are ""some"" decent values like a French Cremant at $10/glass for a generous pour
+My steak was very tender and flavorful. Even the ""petite"" filet is 8oz which ended up being quite large.

Indifferent To:
~I honestly thought the Butter Cake was ""meh"" - it was just too....unctuous I guess. I should expect that given the name but it just wasn't my jam. I was the exception because my party demolished that thing.
~The service is professional, with requisite white ""steakhouse waiter"" jackets. I could do without the clearly rehearsed patter though and I don't need to be reminded that medium on a steak is a ""warm red center"".

Disliked:
-Attendants in the restroom. I don't always bring my handbag with me and it's just awkward all the way around. No.
-Tables are way, way, way too close together. I shouldn't have to ask the person next to me to slide out so I can get up.

First off, the concept of this place is cool with very hip and comtempo decor. It is basically a big ""cafeteria"" with food booths, a bar, and a coffee/ice cream place. I ate at the Torta place and had the half and half combo of the tortilla soup and the chicken milanese combo. I honestly thought $12 was a bit pricey for a soup and sandwich combo (that does no include your drink) at a place that is cafeteria style-food and service. The torta was actually pretty tasty and the tortilla soup had nice presentation with some spice, but the chicken in the soup tasted a little off and one piece had a bone in it, so I could not finish eating it as I was turned off it. That was my only experience with the food portion. The place looked pretty deserted when I got there, but I am attributing that to it being a weekday in DTwn Vegas and the hotel it is attached to, the Downtown Grand, having just opened in November. However, the staff that took the order didn't really seem to know what was going on and it was a bit weird trying to figure the place out. Since nobody was there, they just kinda said ""hey, your food's ready"" even though they had given me a pager that was supposed to light up when the food was ready for pick up. The soda fountain is also self-serve, so honestly, I was confused as to the was the ""tip"" line on my receipt was for. I don't tip when I go into a Taco Bell or McD's and that's pretty much the level of service you're getting here. So, two stars for this portion of the experience. Hopefully, they can sort out the kinks and find what works and what doesn't because this IS a cool concept.

Now on to the Bar. Totally different experience here. From the moment I sat down, Jesus greeted me and you could just tell he had a good energy. He was engaging and funny and won me over when he let me sample a beer to see if I would like it. The other awesome guy of the evening was Michael, the Manager. He really did an excellent job of ""putting the customer first"" and really went out of his way to make my experience here awesome! They had an amazing beer selection and the beer flights they offered were well selected and priced. There was a flight called the Beer Belly that had some quality beers on it (5) for only $13. I was originally told they were not serving it because they didn't have the glassware yet, but Michael did me a solid and made it happen. I was in beer HEAVEN! They also have a great selection of Dia de Los Muertos beers from Mexico. I had the Hefe and it was great! The bottles are also worth collecting! Michael said they will also be having specialty tequila flights soon, which would just add to the fantastic cocktail and beer selections they already have. They made my night even better by letting me use the 20% off coupon I got in my welcome packet on my beer flight. So all in all a fun experience and exceptional customer service at the Bar. 5-stars across the board!

I would usually split the diff on the stars, but I had such a good time at the Bar, it compensated for the bad food experience. I definitely need to check the Coffee/Ice Cream place out next time I am in town as it looked delish! But, either way, I will def be back to the Bar!",2014-02-15 05:52:25

Sure, assuming it was late at night, they might have been understaffed but those bathrooms were pretty filthy. Too bad we already ordered.

The food was OK. I couldn't say it made up for the sight in the bathrooms. Broth was not as tasteful as other Pho places I've tried. The egg rolls were just fine.

They kept jacking up the price to where it is now almost $30 per person and that doesn't include drink. Below is my latest review on each category:

Food: It wasn't fresh during the last two visits and some of the seafood were actually kind of smelly. 

Service: So bad. They seemed to have only one person up front beside the host/cashier. This lady seemed to do everything, ranging from getting utensils, remove dirty plates from the tables, getting drinks, getting soups, etc...What made it worse was she did everything so slow and because of that, every single table always seemed to have tall dirty stack of plates/trash.

Cleanliness: Nasty!!! While eating, I observed that this ""waitress"" wore the same disposable gloves throughout the entire time I was there. She picked up dirty ""with raw meat/seafood"" dishes with that gloves, she brought out utensils with the same gloves, she brought drinks to the table with the same gloves. Talk about food poisoning waiting to happen. Ewwwww.

Price: $30 for bad food, bad service, and dirty place, no thanks!!!! 

Unless they fix all the problems I listed above, this place will go the way of ""Woo Che"", which I predicted correctly that they will have to close their business soon.

Old School: you almost got 2 stars from me but your Mac&Cheese and bartender earned you an extra star... If the service and BBQ had been better that would be 4 or 5 stars!

We got there on a beautiful Saturday night and the patio was packed so we decided to grab a table inside since hubby planned to order a bunch of different sides and we could use the extra table space.

We were seated right away but it took at least 10 minutes to have a waiter take our drink order and then another 10 minutes for those drinks to arrive.

Finally we could place our order.

I ordered the Blueberry Hill which is as good as everyone says and the bacon aka Butcher's Crack was tasty but not addictive enough for crack status.  Some of the pancakes were a bit thick and dense while others were a bit thinner and crispier which were perfect. The blueberry sauce was sublime.

I also ordered a side order of the Apple wood smoked sausage which didn't arrive with the pancakes in fact it didn't arrive at all.

Hubby ordered the mini McCoy and found the chive biscuit to be his favourite part of the combo.  The brisket was cut too thick and while it had a fair bit of fat, it was oddly tough.  The ribs were smokey but very dry as if smoked to a crisp.  The pulled pork tasted to him like it had turned but the waiter assured him it is the Carolina style vinegar sauce they put on the pulled pork after shredding the meat... to hubby it tasted sour as in bad and so he brought it home to the dogs who were glad to eat it.

He also ordered the Mac&Cheese which arrived 20 minutes after the combo... we had not seen our waiter, actually any waiter, in all that time, and at one point I saw him try and deliver our Mac&Cheese to another table and then carry it back to the kitchen... so when he finally showed up with the Mac&Cheese we asked where was the sausage I ordered and the beans hubby ordered.  The young (and possibly new?) waiter freaked out and realized he forgot to order it and so another 10-15 minutes after that - and all the original food was cold - the last 2 sides arrived.

The beans tasted better than they looked and the sausage was peppery to the point of almost tasting like smoked pepperoni but it was juicy and the skin was crispy so it was a win.

The dish that redeemed Old School for hubby was the long awaited Mac&Cheese.  It was an OMG moment for him... from the biscuit crumble topping to the al dente pasta, to the rich and creamy cheese sauce that was NOT oily, to the layer of crispy chewy cheese browned on top - hubby could not think of a Mac&Cheese he had ever had that was better.  It actually went perfectly with the sausage when it finally arrived!

In the long wait for the Mac&Cheese hubby wanted another beer, and since our waiter was MIA, he walked up to the cool ""old school"" bar and asked the bartender for one and the bartender promptly brought it to the table.  Best service of the night was from the bartender!

After we finally had all our food, we thought our waiter left and another waiter had taken over so we asked him for more water and he brought a carafe full, something that would have been nice to have received earlier in the meal.

But it seems he was not our new waiter, so we asked if he could find our waiter as we wanted to get our leftovers packed up and get our bill.

Flustered waiter returns and takes all our food away and brings a bag with 2 take out containers inside along with our bill.  We ask for future if the Mac&Cheese is available for take out and he says the entire menu is and available for delivery through Foodora.

He is a sweet guy, and obviously new so we still tip him 15 percent and he absent mindedly walks away with our bag of leftovers we manage to grab it back before he gets too far!

On the way out we give a cash tip to the bartender because he actually deserved a tip for his excellent service, and he was gracious and appreciative.

We get home and open containers to give the dogs their pulled pork treat and discover that the 3 pancakes I had saved to take home were not in there but thankfully the Mac&Cheese was... I was not too upset missing my leftovers but hubby would have lost it if he didn't get his leftover Mac&Cheese.

Next time we are getting the Mac&Cheese and sausage as take out!  Maybe then Old School will earn another star or two!",2016-06-05 07:16:15

Not new to Jerry's Nugget, a 2014 trip to sample a slice of Cake celebrating fifty years of business even then showing the Bakery to be far better than most would guess, it was around 2:00pm that two guests entered the aged Casino's front doors where one armed bandits keep watch, the Coffee Shop perhaps one quarter full with a group in back celebrating a birthday and the Cake and Pie cases up front fully stacked.

Enticed by Chef Taylor's social media stream, something the folks handling Jerry's Public Relations would be wise to harness as it seems their attempt to bait ""influencers"" at Contento fell flat despite good word of mouth, it is by a vast array of colors and designs that eyes are greeted when peering at Cake after Cake and Pie after Pastry, the servers all pleasant and accommodating with surprisingly strong knowledge of items including those listed as weekly or even daily specials.

Charging $5-6 per slice and additionally offering housemade Loaves of Bread it was upon making tough decisions that nine items were carefully boxed and subsequently bagged, most surviving the twelve mile trip home unscathed and bites of an untoasted Sourdough slice showing good technique while the first Pastry sampled was a heavily frosted Cinnamon Roll with caramelized bits at the center and soft curls that improved from good to great when heated. 

Moving next to another Breakfast Pastry, the Cream Cheese Filling of Doug's Danish unsweetened and cooked like Custard inside a laminated Bun awash with Butter, it would be hard to say where a better Danish might be found in Las Vegas aside from perhaps Bouchon at twice the cost while a slice of Cake inspired by Chef Taylor's recent trip to Southern California also worked in subtle ways with delicate Cream and Cake featuring a soft crumb juxtaposing crunchy housemade Honeycomb.

Attempting to move light to heavy, the ""Milk Cake"" baked like a Bundt visually judged correctly to be not far from Tres Leches with intentionally burnt Sugar Glaze overlying a sopping wet sponge, it was next the special actually labeled ""Tres Leches"" which was less moist but equally delicious that tickled the palate, three actual ""Milks"" not counted but made irrelevant by virtually weightless Frosting perfumed with Hibiscus. 

Charged $45 including tax and tip for the lot, not ""cheap"" but certainly not overpriced compared to Freed's or Peridot Sweets for what amounted to almost an entire Cake, it was beneath Ganache with a shiny surface that ""Nascar Cake"" offered four layers divided by Milk Chocolate Mousse, the flavors all marrying nicely with two bites never the same while a second Bundt chock-a-block full of Butterfinger chunks and topped with melted crumbs  of similar tasted precisely as childhood recalls of the Candy Bar but with less intense sweetness.

Taking the position that Coffee is a far better palate refresher than Milk during the tasting, a stance not shared by others involved, it was with thick Nutella Cheesecake atop a crumbly Chocolate Crust that all stood smiling at the end, many bites left for later that evening and the fact that this Cheesecake was entirely different in terms of weight and richness from that in the Nascar showing Chef Taylor is not taking shortcuts even though the average Coffee Shop patron might not be all that critical or discerning.

FOUR AND A HALF STARS:  Marred only by location and a Casino that is in need of a serious ventilation upgrade the quality of Douglas Taylor's Cakes are  on par with any in Sin City while an obvious drive to do new things offers plenty of impetus for return visits as often as one may be in the mood for something sweet.",2018-07-31 11:21:58

My family loves Mexican food. I think I've finally convinced them to forgo On the Border for some better fare. Well, since they were in the Scottsdale area one Saturday afternoon, I thought we'd try Los Sombreros. I said I'd meet them there. Good thing I brought the book I was reading (Summer People by Brian Groh - fantastic). My family was running late, and I discovered that it's a little hard to serve food when you're closed on a busy weekend day. Saturday afternoon? Closed? You're kidding me... Well, I took a spot on a bench and read. Lucky for me, I could text a friend to consider other possibilities in the area. Los Olivos was where we ended up. (Ugh. Don't get me started on that place.) 

ANYHOW, I thought I'd give Los Sombreros another chance. I met my text-savvy friend the next evening for dinner. I arrived and snatched up a table on the patio. The hostess said it was the most popular table. Go figure, even if it's by all the little propane tanks surrounding the palms. I quickly ordered a Lager and drank happily while I waited. The menu presented a little bit of a challenge. Resist the amazing-looking entrees for dinner (and spare myself $17) or just splurge? I went with the fish tacos, since that's what the waiter recommended. What I got was not expected. Three mini tacos that were a challenge to eat. They reminded me of the signature dish you'd get at Pink Taco. I wasn't impressed. Later that evening, my tummy wasn't impressed, either. 

So, would I go back? Eh. Maybe. I'd like my family to try this place during operating hours. If I go back, I'll get one of their more appealing dishes, like the lamb or crab. They definitely surprise you with their take on Mexican cuisine. I like the looks of the menu. I just hope not everything they serve leaves me wanting, like those messy, greasy and so-so tacos did. 

3 stars for Los Sombrerors.
5 stars for Summer People.",2008-02-22 16:33:19

It was a medium-large sized restaurant, and there was some wait time. We didn't mind, because there are couches inside near the cashier and some seating areas outside.

One of the first things I noticed about the restaurant were the modern Thai decorations. They had large photos hanging from the walls, as well as some Buddha decorations that went nicely with the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. 

Overall, there was friendly service, although the waitress could have been more attentive; she was nice but didn't check once until the end. To be fair, the restaurant was very busy and there was a water jug that we could fill our own waters with.

The noise level was a bit loud, but there were lots of people in the restaurant. I think we were seated near the kitchen, because there were busy waiters coming out; we constantly heard the clanking of dishes. It might have been quieter on other days and in other areas of the restaurant. 

I got the Massaman curry, which was good. It had a nice strong coconut flavor, and came with a choice of tofu or chicken and potatoes. My mom got the drunken noodles, which were good in small amounts but perhaps not so much in large quantities; the sauce was overbearing (quite salty). My sister got the pad thai, which I thought was the best out of the three dishes. I would recommend the pad thai.

We seemed to be at the end of a rather long line, but one that moved very quickly. In no time, it was our turn to order. ""You should get the manwich dad!"" I teased. ""Hmph, maybe 20 years ago!"" 

We both ended up ordering a pulled pork sandwich. Mine a regular, his a large. The difference was that his had about twice as much meat on it. It's like the bumper sticker on the condiments holder said ""We love animals... they're made of meat!""

Two sandwiches, two sides (potato salad for Dad, cornbread for me) and a couple of pops run us well under $25. And I even got to educate my dad on a few things while we ate-boxes of trivia cards adorn each table.""We could play for who gets to buy lunch,"" my dad joked.

The reason I love Patty King is because they sell all sorts of Jamaican treats -- Jerk chicken, rice and peas, those coconut nectar drinks, sweet breads, and of course, every kind of patty you could dream of. Patties are chicken, veggie or beef in varying levels of spice, and if you buy them in the store they're only a dollar. Lunch specials of chicken, rice and a drink range from $4-$8.

But the real reason I come here isn't for the lunch special. It's because you can buy a bag of frozen patties that weren't pretty enough to make the boxes they sell to grocery stores, and they're craaaazy cheap. Literally they end up being around 30 cents each. For a package of 12 patties, I remember it being around $4. Grab a couple of bags, stash them in the freezer, and whenever you get the patty craving, pop one in the oven for instant gratification.

The factory is on Progress Ave, pretty close to Scarborough Town Centre. It's easier to get to if you have a car, but there's a Progress bus and it's not a terrible walk if you're feeling adventurous.

The Lady Silvia probably has the coolest interior of any Vegas bar.  In fact they take it as far as they can without pushing over-the-top for trying way too hard.

The Lady Silvia is certainly not a hipster bar as some have suggested.  They do things too well here for the hipster to love on it.  The clientele is not comprised of hipsters.  The drinks & the prices do not speak  to the hipster.  Having said my peace  there I can now continue to review...

The drinks are one of the areas that prevent The Lady Silvia from attaining 5 stars.  There are several solid classic cocktails, as well as a few original creations that are enjoyable.  The drinks just fall a little short...lacking balance and proper execution generally speaking.  The prices have dropped from when I first came in though--the house crafted drinks going for $10 or $11 as opposed to $15.  

The bartenders also earn the 4 star mark...better than the average bar tender, but not the exceptional mixologist that I would expect upon entering into The Lady Silvia.

The Lady Silvia also has a wide array of events and weekly alterations to their normal business flow.  This is not good or bad in and of itself.  I am not into their attempt to be a sports bar during football nights, but others appreciate it I'm sure.

They also offer some CLASSIC Spanish style tapas for a couple of bucks.  They make for some nice snacks while you drink.

For me the hero is the ambiance and atmosphere.  And I will return again for that.  The Lady Silvia is a perfect place to come with a group of 4 - 6 friends who want to relax, enjoy some conversation on some uber cool couches, and have some good drinks....the pictures do not begin to do justice to the decor inside.

The japchae had tons of veggies in it and was seasoned perfectly.  The kimchi fried rice was a little bland.  It could have used more flavor or ingredients.  

What sucked about our meal was that they didn't know how to split our order evenly between the two tables.  The table of 2 got the small beef combo which is meant for 2 people, and the table of 6 got the large combo meant for 3-4 people.  The food ratio was all wrong and we ended up having to share food amongst the two tables.  It wasn't a huge deal but the restaurant could have done a better job and separating the portions.",2017-10-23 23:06:02

So confused after the marketers and managements repeated explanation. Presentation and repeated sales attempts lasted about two hour. My group was not interested after numerous repeated attempts to sell us on getting one. 

Meal offered was good here. Service for the front desk was helpful. Marketing folks could accept not interested that day to be sold on upgrades or a timeshare could improve a bit.

I spend a lot of time in China town so it only makes sense to come here have a couple of drinks then go off for dinner.  I was always a little scared to go in because it has double tinted windows and thought I was going to run into some of the Las Vegas Triads in there.  ;) Nope a cool place with a cool vibe and very nice decor!  Think strip lounge ish off the strip with locals prices.

There are all kinds of people in the bar Asian decent, Tattoo guys, business men and women, dealers from the casinos like I said a little of everything.  The type of music they play depends on the crowd there at the time.  Quite a few Tv's so you can watch your games.  There is a ton of good food within stumbling, walking and driving distance.  A lot of the food places in china town are 24 hrs as is this bar. They do have Lee's sandwich and Pho Kim Long that deliver food here for them.  I haven't been there late night but I have heard it gets pretty busy.  They have a full bar with gaming, couches with tables for lounging and a back room off the main bar a bit for parties with couches curtains and a VIP feel.

It is under new management so they do have drawings for four of a kinds and wheel spins for full houses for happy hours.  They have 3 happy hours for the 3 different shifts in this town and I do seem to win here quite a bit!  A big bonus in my book!

Some of the downfalls of this place is because it is such a diverse crowd you never know the environment you will be coming into.  Sometimes they have parties and the music is extra loud.  The free wi-fi is moody and sometimes does not work ( if you now me that is a big gripe of mine ) But I am willing to put up with the downfalls for good drinks with good people.",2012-05-10 17:08:49

They've got your standard choices of lunch specials ranging from tacos, burritos, chimichangas, and rice and beans. The one menu item that makes this place shine forth is the chile relleno. Holy eff...a flavorful creation that makes anything else I've ever had named ""chile relleno"" pale in comparison. It's not even fair. The breading they fry this thing in is perfectly soft, sweet, and mellow. So subtle, but the texture takes the lead. The chile itself is very mild. Stuffed with cheese and topped with a few different styles of salsas. I can't event begin to tell how magical the flavors are. It's one of their signature dishes and is easily the best thing on the menu. I'm pretty sure you can eat 4 of them. They are medium size and come with rice and beans.

My hubs is Armenian, so i've tried a lot of Armenian food & pizza. If you have the chance to get one fresh & warm straight out of the oven, you won't want to eat these anywhere else. (sprinkle a little bit of fresh lemon juice on it - so delish!). Yes they are small and not a meal in itself, but who can eat just one? lol! We usually have them with a salad.  Pizzas are out of this world and must be eaten at the restaurant. Ingredients are so fresh and everything is made with such care but....

My hubby picked up an order a few weeks ago of 2 dozen. I had a couple of issues with these little discs of heaven. First thing that bothered me was the parchment paper between each one. it is SO thin and so small that it was nearly impossible to separate them the next day after putting them in the fridge. They were very glutinous and each one fell apart when i tried to separate them, they became shredded. I also froze 1 dozen and had the same problem once they were separated after defrosting. I even tried when they weren't quite defrosted and couldn't even separate them at all. Not sure if they stacking & bagging them while they are still really warm? That would explain them being so glutinous.

Haven't had that issue with other places i buy from. They cut the parchment the same size as the lahmajoun's. No tearing, no shredding and no issues. Wish they would do the same at Mamajoun at $15 a dozen. 

That was the 2nd time in the last few months that we've had that problem. It makes it not worth even buying anymore. Especially if i buy them for guests coming over. I'll give them another chance but if it happens again, i'll be buying my dozens from somewhere else.",2017-02-07 20:38:29

It's located in a business park on Gibson Road and totally unassuming. Actually, if you didn't map it or look for the building number, you would never know it was there! It's unmarked and behind Green Valley Pools - look for the wooden barrel outside the door! You can park on Mary Crest or in the lot by their building.

I called about two months ago to inquire about their monthly tours and I was able to reserve a spot for me and my fiancé that way. When you get to the brewery, they collect $5 from each person, you sign in, and you get a very cool souvenir JJBC glass!

We got a quick history lesson and were given the opportunity to ask questions while browsing the space. Then, we jumped right into the best part, beer tasting. 

We were offered their nine current beers. Fox Tail Gluten-Free Pale Ale (similar to a cider, light, but not sweet with a hint of hops; decent for a GF beer!), American Lager, Weize Guy Hefenweizen, Citra Rye Pale Ale, Hop Box Imperial IPA, J.J. Pro AM Foreign Extra Stout (Limited), Red Fox Russian Imperial Stout Dark Ale, Baby J's German Chocolate Cake Milk Stout (Limited), and 5th Anniversary Barrel Aged Smoked Wee Heavy Scotch Ale (Limited). Alcohol content ranged from 5-14%.

Everyone was really awesome and they were very generous with the tasting portions, inviting us to whatever was left over if we pleased. It was obvious that they were all very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their jobs and the brewery. It created a wonderful atmosphere for a beer tour/tasting. 

I'm not much of a beer drinker, so I can't really say how good it was or if it was better or worse than other beers in the same categories. My gauge is what my beer enthusiastic fiancé says. He really enjoyed all of them and states that the respective beers stood up to his favorite beers. His favorites from today were Hop Box and Red Fox. We both enjoyed Baby J's and will be searching for bottles soon since it's on a limited run.

My first impression, aside from the fact that we were short one pizza, was that it wasn't a very big pizza at maybe 12"" across, but then their menu doesn't give you any idea how big these pizzas are so I had hoped it'd be bigger.  Clearly I'd under-ordered for 6 people. 

My guy and I picked at it politely as the kids sat there; thinking maybe the other pizza would arrive shortly, but within 10 minutes we decided it was a toss up between eating a stone cold pizza *whenever* the other pizza arrived, or eating this one hot now and inquiring on the missing pizza.  We scarfed down the Fire & Brimstone Pizza; it was very tasty, it just wasn't enough.  Later I ended up walking over to the vegan restaurant down the hallway to order a supplemental meal.  In their hunger, our ravenous kids risked the heat of the jalapeños on the Fire & Brimstone Pizza and had some bites too, but because it was so small there wasn't much to go around for 6 people, but there were no complaints on the taste of the pizza.

A few minutes later I went back inside to find out what was going on and our waitress, who was very personable despite the situation, checked our order ticket and told me apologetically that it'd just be a couple more minutes...   (What on Earth is the delay in making a pizza with 2 ingredients: sauce and cheese?)  I could see the chef taking another pizza out of the oven at that same moment, so I assume the delay was that they forgot to put in all of our order.

Another 15 or 20 minutes later they brought the cheese pizza to us.  By this time I had already composed this review in my head.  I'm sorry you guys, do better with your order timing.  Our kids were cranky and really hungry by the time their food arrived, well after mom and dad's food had been finished, and we could have just stayed home and saved the $34 that two little pizzas and 5 drinks cost us, not including the supplemental meal from The Uprooted Kitchen.

ETA: I'm willing to try them again because the food was good and the service was friendly, I just hope it doesn't go sideways again like it did this time.",2017-01-23 19:23:59

Yes, it's small. WHO CARES?! Why would that even be a factor in your review?! (Some of you are just bat shit whack jobs.) 

I was impressed with everything -- service, ambiance, presentation, and quality of food and drink. 

Our server was wonderful. You couldn't get a thing past this guy. He knew the answer to everything. And let's face it, that's hard to come by. 

Pricey? Yes, but honestly I don't see how it's much pricier than other Japanese restaurants. If you're not in the market for spending a days wages, check out their happy hour. Their signature cocktails are half off.

Also, it wasn't a long line of a wait, (because of the fact being so early in the morning.) Our waitress was very nice, and came around to check on us periodically. She definitely knew what she was doing. 

I'm 50/50 about the fries. One good thing is that it was a whole bunch of fries in a basket. I just felt like  the fries was too skinny, then again, who cares, it was around 3AM, and I was hungry/tipsy. LOL!!

At that point, I'm not looking for anything super delicious or anything... I just want something in my belly to fill me up and last me a while, seeing as I have to get home to do laundry, getting stuff ready, buying groceries...

On more than one occasion, I've come here and it's been empty. That's actually the default situation here, it seems: the dining area will be about 95% empty, and there'll be a few guys manning the kitchen. That doesn't really present a problem for me, because people or not, I need to eat. But since it's always empty, I can usually walk right up to the counter and have someone take my order in 30 seconds or less: teriyaki turkey burger, hold the cheese, criss-cut fries, ranch, Sprite. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best meal in the place. Sure, the $6 burgers are great, too, but they're also about 1000 calories. (I know the Sprite, ranch, and fries aren't the best idea, but that's why I get the turkey sans cheese!)  I usually get my food out to me fairly quickly, and it's consistently pretty good. My only major gripe with them is that their bread seems to always be the worst bread ever. I don't understand it. It's bad on the turkey burgers, and it's passable on the premium burgers. Maybe it's because these guys are so liberal with their sauce that the bread absorbs it? That's my current theory. 

Also, the prices here are on the higher side. I've always felt there's a scale for fast-food restaurant prices: starts at McDonald's on the low side and ends with Carl's on the higher side. The food here is better than McD's, so I guess it's ok. But just be aware of that.

As far as this location goes, it is clearly not on the best side of town. I'm not complaining about it one bit, I'm just stating that this isn't the burger joint to take your girlfriend's parents (take them to Create). It's never been a problem for me, because I roll with the homies, too. The actual restaurant is in pretty good shape, which is a plus. 

All in all, I'll continue coming here when I get off the freeway. It's in the perfect spot for that, the service is quick, and the food is good. That's four stars right there.",2011-07-17 02:41:48

Located within the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada, a space more commonly referred to simply as ""The Center,"" Bronze Café had long been on my list of places to visit and seeking coffee plus free WiFi near downtown on Saturday I finally decided to drop in, the smiling staff greeting me warmly as I entered while several patrons sat throughout the atrium using a bank of supplied computers or looking through literature supplied in a small library toward the back of the room.

Admittedly located in a rough part of Las Vegas, the surrounding environs largely comprised of rundown housing with no shortage of panhandlers to be found on the streets, the interior of The Center seems to act as a sort of sanctuary to those in the community and with free services available ranging from HIV-testing to prevention and sex education the environment is both open and inviting, the electronic music overhead perhaps a bit of a distracter but certainly not so loud that it cannot be ignored.

Offering a selection of soups, salads, sandwiches, baked goods, and smoothies running the gamut from mundane to esoteric with options for vegetarians, vegans, and those dining gluten free in addition to several options featuring meat, it was entirely in the pastries that my investigation of the café's goods was undertaken and treated to a vegan smoothie shot as I waited for coffee to be brewed I'll admit I was pleasantly surprised, the apple and banana with light vanilla doing an admirable job of offsetting the bitterness oft associated with the greens.

Sipping the espresso over ice, a bold brew with a nutty finish at less than half what one would pay for Starbucks on the Strip, it was with seven items plus a gifted Fruity Pebbles Treat from owner David Mozes that the tasting took place and beginning the rainbow treat a theme of strong flavors and excellent textures quickly arose, any 'artificalness' associated with the commercial cereal completely lacking in a vegan strawberry cookie with a jam center that ranks amongst the best in the city with a pudding smooth mouthfeel and light creamy top-notes.

Trying best to progress light-to-rich it was next in the slightly dry oatmeal cookie that I partook and setting this aside in favor of hopefully better things a bite of the bacon-jam scone proved to be far softer than one might expect from the British tea-time staple, though the savory jam and ample use of butter was none-the-less quite delicious beneath a light sprinkling of sugar with subtle sweetness dispersed beneath.

Entirely impressed by the peanut butter riff on a Snickerdoodle with ample cinnamon and sugar helping to mellow the otherwise rich base it was with equal balance that fruits and vegetables interacted to create the ultra-moist chocolate zucchini bread with the sort of richness that spoke to high quality cocoa, the similarly soft banana-flax cake perhaps a better choice for those desiring something more subtle with a light nuttiness from the fractured seeds coming through on the finish but not a bit of oil or bitterness to be found.

At this point seeing the soundtrack transition to upbeat Spanish dance music as a large group of teens plus a young family with grandparents in-tow sat down to breakfast it was finally in ""The Loving v. Virginia"" that I indulged and having previously tasted no fewer than a dozen takes on the cookie-meets-brownie including Brooklyn's famous ""Brookie"" from Baked I'm confident to say that the version at Bronze Café may be the very best of them all - the chocolate base reminiscing of my childhood afternoon snack while the dollop of dough at the center was just seconds short of fully set, the whole far greater than the sum of its parts and something probably best shared, or at least enjoyed with a cup of coffee, milk...or in the case of Bronze Café, perhaps some almond mylk. 

Setting aside a location that some may find a bit intimidating for any number of personal misperceptions, Bronze Café is the sort of place that is likely to go overlooked by all but those who walk through the doors of The Center, but with strong sourcing, friendly service, and a menu as inclusive as the building in which it is housed it can only be said that there is a whole lot more here than meets the eye, and a whole lot of things to tantalize the tastebuds as well.",2015-06-15 16:03:06

KKupyZA-AbU2ilNW55xsTA,KTK_ws8lu_TWfR7DtDWjMA,xNqafsfYDataNwTJjKh80Q,5,0,0,2,"I had an excellent experience with this dealership.

I identified the vehicle I wanted, a 2007 Kia Sportage, via one of the mobile car-buying apps and contacted the dealership. Shortly after doing so I received a phone call that the car was still available and made arrangements to head over after work. My salesman, Wayne, was very professional and helpful. He let me know that the vehicle had just been traded in so it wasn't yet clean and hadn't been fully checked by the shop, but that based on the initial review he felt it was in good shape. 

Following the test drive, we began talking about the vehicle. I was looking to trade in my 2003 Kia Optima and had done my research on its value. Wayne didn't try to lowball me, but made me a fair offer that I accepted. We negotiated a deal for the Sportage contingent upon it passing its mechanical inspection. They also threw in a year of free oil changes and I went with the extended warranty as the original factory warranty had already expired. 

I also really appreciated the lady in the finance department who gave me an estimate on the loan interest rate but told me she would shop around and try to find a better rate. Clearly she did her job because my loan ended up with a Credit Union at a lower monthly payment than we discussed.

Because the Sportage was not ready that night. I made plans to come back the next day and pick it up. Although I did have to wait a bit the next evening for the detailing to be completed, I now have a great vehicle that allows me to get around without worries and go camping with my two boys in both Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts.

I was very impressed with the straightforwardness and professionalism of the staff at this dealership.",2015-05-10 15:41:27

5 options were available on my menu: Korean BBQ, Garlic, Hand-breaded, cheese-and-peppercorn, shrimp linguini.

But when I say 5, I mean the menu comes with 5 options. It seems like one of the menus we had listed a different set of options, but that menu was quickly taken away after the first order was made, and the one we were left with did not have a different selection. We did not attempt to ask for more menus.

First order comes with two orders of shrimp along with one side and one salad. Subsequent orders are placed one at a time.

Server was pro-active: recommended to get our next orders in when he brought them over so we didn't have to wait too long in between. Water re-fills came at a good pace as well, given that the food was quite thirst-inducing.

There seemed to be some inconsistency between different tables when it came to lemon slices with the glass of water, but that's a minor detail.

- Nice staff from the many experiences I've had here.

- The bar and grill are just fine for what you'd want - burgers, hotdogs, fries, sandwiches, chips etc.

- The both courses are well laid out and well kept...especially for how inexpensive the green fees are usually.

- The design of the full length course makes it my favorite choice here. It's plenty challenging but it also offers wide fairways and pretty large greens, so regardless of whether you're a scratch golfer or a complete novice and are trying to learn, this course will certainly play well.

- They have a full size driving range, a huge putting green and an OK chipping green. What I really like about the driving range specifically is that the yard markers and pins are set up on quasi-greens. So when you're trying to practice accuracy with your irons and raise your G.I.R. I find this place to be more than helpful.

- They also usually host an annual summer kids camp for local kids to do golf lessons... And I have to say it's awesome watching all the little munchkins swinging clubs.

Only reason for 4 star and not 5 - when it comes to golf courses, we're spoiled in AZ.  As fun as it is and as much as I enjoy it I have to be honest that there are better courses to play so it's not quite a 5 star...

The steak was the bomb.  I don't know what the marinate was but I want the recipe.  It made the steak so tender and it had the perfect level of spicy heat to it. We enjoyed our food so much I was bragging about the steak I had at work on Monday.

I have to add, our waiter was great, and after reading some other Yelp reviews we asked him for a sample of all their hot sauces. The regular they give you with the beans and chips is good.  They have two others you should definitely try.  I mixed and matched them and all combos were good.

Our experience here was enough to make us want to come back.",2016-05-01 22:48:48

I am so sure of myself that I want to write this review.   The meat cutter lady will trim all the fat and arrange the pork pieces with such passion and dedication equalled to none. So intensely that there is almost never time for any eye contact, and will never ever get an order wrong.  So focussed, like a horse with blinders on.   If only I could hire her to work in my department, productivity will just skyrocket.  ( I have nicknamed her WB's girlfriend ... which is the subject of another discussion)

The BBQ pork (Char Siwe) and roasted pork with crispy skin are prepared and cooked to perfection, so good, unbelievably good.   I levied a penalty of 1 star for not serving a wee bit of green vegetables with the combo.

Haji-Baba offers solid, down-home Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food at very reasonable prices and the well-equipped store make this a worthwhile stop for any ethnic food lover.  

One half of Haji-Baba is a small, tightly packed ethnic food store.  The other half is a small, tightly packed restaurant.  While space is certainly limited on both sides, the selection at Haji-Baba is huge!

The store side features everything from large pans of fresh-baked pastries and desserts behind the counter to rows of hard to find spices and aisles of rare, imported ingredients at prices that make exotic cooking at home reasonable for the casual cook like me!

The restaurant side delivers good, authentic food at acceptable prices.  None of the menu items are particularly unique and the overall quality of the food tends to match the cafe styling more than fine dining, but all of the dishes I've tried have been well portioned and tasty!

True story, I have offered 1000$ to the owner of Bombay Mahal (Jean-Talon location) for their butter chicken recipe and they refused.

The company was still stellar, so I can't complain too much, but at $15 I expected more than two sad little baguette slices and 3 not-so-impressive shrimp. The fried potatoes were very basic and the poached eggs WERE perfect, so there's that.  But really - it just wasn't what I was expecting.

Given that the chef was the runner-up of Top Chef Canada, I was fairly confident in my choice.

Beef Carpaccio - decent, nice thinly-sliced beef but lacked flavour overall
Little India Samosas - flavourful, but cold as though they had been sitting around for awhile
Sushi Pizza - good, but nothing mind-blowing
Lamb Pappardelle - easily the best thing I tasted all night - would recommend this dish!
Yorkville Taster - just decent
Burger - once again just decent. The burger also didn't come with cheese despite the fact that we asked for cheese (extra $2)

Overall, the food was quite decent, with the exception of the lamb pappardelle which was delicious. The main issue was that we waited SO LONG between each course!

In terms of the funnel cake, it was good, but not the best I've had. It was fried to be really crispy (and I think I prefer a little less crispy).

I guess I'll refrain and give you my straight up review.

But first a note to ""Paul"" your a ass clown douchebag. And noting that ""Paul"" has never reviewed any other place clearly ""Paul"" is aligned with the owners which is INCREDIBLY SAD and LAME!!!!

Here goes:

The interior is absolutely beautiful and a welcome change from it's past occupant (The Willow House). My Latte was quite tasty but unfortunately also VERY weak. I was there on the first day of their ""soft opening"" and they had yet to install a wi-fi access point (kinda a major thing for a coffee shop in my opinion). I was told that they will supply free wif-fi with a purchase, but that had yet to be setup.

The art on the walls was from local artists which I totally appreciate. The seating was varied in style and they had a comfy couch. I'd give this place another star if it weren't for the obvious attempt at gaming the Yelp system.",2008-10-02 05:12:59

It's located a bit away from the Jake's side of Main Street and across from the Old Firehall Confectionary. The decor is typical dark British pub type of interior but it's actually anything but that, starting from their menu to their waitresses to their clientele. 

Firstly, their food is not your typical bar food. Rather than nachos and fries, it's sort of an asian izakaya type of food. There are quite a few variety of skewers, and while the taste is great, is a bit disappointing in quantity. Perhaps due to slow service (though I did visit on a busy night), when you wait 30 minutes for food it's pretty unsatisfactory when all that gets put onto your table are a few skinny skewers. Definitely not a place where you would leave feeling  too full to move. 

To their credit, they do serve beer by the tower which is great for a group. 

The waitresses are quite friendly when they come around the table, but they do get spread out since there's apparently a second floor above where the patio is. Took a quick peek at the upper level and it is not a dining  area. There are low chairs sort of like bottle service at a club, though where it lacks in loud pop music you do get in its place random people singing karaoke. Certainly a bit unusual. 

Haven't had a chance to try the full menu, but overall seems like a decent place to watch sports games with a fair number of TVs around. Definitely prefer the lively downstairs atmosphere.",2016-05-10 04:41:54

My first sub at Dibella's was a hot Italian with the works on fresh made wheat bread.  As I was ordering, this well-dressed guy started telling me how good the subs were.  He said he was from Rochester, New York, where Dibella's opened its first sub shop long ago.  It was then that I knew I was in for a treat.

I ate half of my sandwich in my car.  My first bite was delectable!  I quickly finished off the first half followed by some Cheery Coke.  Four hours later, I ate the other half and it was still fresh.  I'm thankful that Dibella's opened up a shop fairly close to my work.  Now I can go as often as I want.

I am currently on a personal venture to taste all their subs.  The New Yorker recommended the Godfather sub, but I'll save that one for later.  I'm just going to jump around on the menu until I'm dizzy.  Can't wait!

Dibella's flavors and quality of bread are excellent.  It put me in the mind of Quizno's, which I also love very much.  This puts Subway to Shame.  There is one local shop, Yorktown Automotive, that makes subs that are almost as good as Dibella's, but not quite as good.

I wanted to try as they advertise 10% off because of grand opening.  False advertising, like many other ayce restaurants,  you get 10% off if you pay by cash. I get that this place is a few months old,  but they need to get their business together. 

First, we were debating between the ayce and a la carte menu .  They literally have two photocopied menus for us to read,  and the servers insisted on getting it back once we were done,  kind of strange.  We chose the ayce instead.  There are many items but nothing was out of the ordinary,  except for the many rolls....with absolutely zero descriptions.  I guess the mizuki roll is leftover end pieces rolled in rice?  We ordered room temperature sashimi (not by choice) , and for some odd reason the salmon came in two different shades of orange, I guess evening patrons get leftover cuts?  The tempura came out quick except for the shrimp,  which took two additional orders until it finally came out. This place knows how to deep fry properly as all the tempura came out crunchy,  shrimp was the frozen kind (mushy texture) .  Lastly, all the cooked meats were over cooked, and as somebody already mentioned the ribs were good.

The theater itself is very narrow and long. We were sat in seating group C which was perfect. Not too far away, and not close enough for the MC to pick on you. (Take note however, that you can only enter your row of seats from the one side, so if you need to pee or you want to leave, you can't leave from both sides.)

Speaking of the MC, I think he was the best part of the show. He was like a cross between Nathan Lane and someone I know. His singing voice is great, although I couldn't really understand the lyrics while he was singing, missing a lot of jokes. The fire alarm went off during the show on a part that I was enjoying, which one of the zombie girls fights an undead hand, which is actually her hand. I always find people acting like a part of their body is trying to fight them is hilarious and really hard to pull off (like Jim Carey in Me, Myself and Irene, and Bruce Campbell in Army of Darkness). So the alarm went off and the MC stopped the show. The zombie girl was sitting on the edge of the stage still in character trying to stop the hand from running off.

""Apparently the mall is on fire."" We just sat there. To kill time the MC talked to the crowd and he was very quick witted and sharp. Actually I think that part was the funniest of the whole show. The show itself is very campy and cheesy. There were a few eye roll moments and def some WTF moments. A box of Jello dancing around with a bottle of vodka for instance.

If you've seen the Variety show downstairs, you know the contortionist in that show. He makes another appearance in this show but with zombie makeup. He is awesome and a must see no matter what show you see him in.

As for the girls, they were ok looking. The main girl that sings is beautiful but some of the others not so much. And you don't see much, pasties stay on. I would have liked more zombie makeup on the girls. Seems like the guys had better zombie makeup on. The MC makes a huge amount of costume changes too!

The emergency lights were going off as this blimp was having problems walking to his car. I was stuffed. I obviously tried one too many items on the menu and I can only blame my gluttony for that. 

What I liked the most at Imadake was the freshness of the ingredients. You can tell they select good ingredients for their dishes and that, to me, shows a high level of dedication to not only their food but also their customers. Ingredients are probably the easiest place to cut costs but that is definitely not going on at Imadake as each element feels and tastes like it was made and sourced on the same day.

I tried the miso ramen with butter corn and both the potato and corn korroke (the latter is what sent this blimp into overloaded territory). I especially loved the korrokes and would go back to Imadake if only to have them again. Perfect frying. Perfectly crispy, light batter. Delicious. If you go there you need to have both.

The ramen was above average when it comes to Montreal fare based on the handful of others I have tried (I have yet to try Kazu's since they only serve it during weekday lunches). Noodles were good. Broth had a rich buttery taste and deep well rounded flavors. Toppings are a bit on the low side as a default so I suggest adding extras and definitely ask for chili to add to it as it rounds out the flavors very nicely.

Ambiance is what you'd expect from this type of establishment. It's loud - personally, not my thing but it certainly adds a buzz to the experience. 

Service was reasonably good. More like a pub type of service. Expect the waiters to place their whole arm across your face while filling your glass of water instead of going on the other side of the table. The type of stuff only some people would notice and by some people I mean people like me who are probably quite picky about service. They're certainly nice enough and the service was quick but it's important to keep your expectations in check when it comes to the details. It is what it is.

Overall I can definitely recommend Imadake. They serve tasty / fresh food. Nuff said?

Food 3/5 - Nothing ""wrong"" with the food quality or taste, but also nothing special. Portion sizes are reasonable meaning that no, you don't get a 4-serving size pasta like you would at an Italian diner, but you should leave here feeling just right. Complimentary bread comes with every meal and their bread dip/spread (combo of something tangy, olive oil, and BV I think) I enjoyed! More dinner menu options here than at Mercatto, etc, and a few vegetarian options are available although the mains are mostly meat/fish heavy. Daily specials are also available. 

BYOW available! But have to pay $30 corkage fee, boo.

My vegetarian partner ordered an entree-sized ricotta gnocchi ($24), which like all their pastas was handmade. The portion size was not enormous - was just right. Hence, I wouldn't recommend ordering their appetizer size pastas since that would be too small. I ordered the wild pacific salmon ($29). The salmon was quite large and one side was deliciously crispy. This dish also comes with small shelled clams. Kind of bland, would not highly recommend.

Value - $$$ for sure. Even starters were ~$20. Don't come here regularly unless you can afford it. Never come here on a student budget.

Service 5/5 - Very polite and professional! Glass was always refilled promptly. 

Venue 3/5 - Big, pretty ceiling lights and sky windows. Loud though because they have a lot of customers (but we didn't have to make a reservation), hard to hear across the table at times.

You can walk in this restaurant with 15 bucks and fully feed two adults no problem. The portions are big and they really give you what you pay for. The dishes usually have rice or hummus or salad, and they are all pretty tasty. 

The falafels are good, not the greatest on earth, but very good. The hummus too, it's tasty and authentic and has a nice rich flavor. The side salad is surprisingly tasty for being cheap lettuce, it has this tasty sauce that has tahini in it, I personally add a little lemon to it for more taste.

The entrees are good, the meat is tasty, and the sides are heaping. You get a good sized meal for 7-8 bucks.

My only issue are the pitas, they are the same old cheap white flour pitas you can find in the grocery store. Nothing special or tasty, just typical plain old pitas. I really wish they would offer whole wheat pitas, especially for the people with allergies to white flour and simple sugars. It's rare to see whole wheat in any mediterranean place.

My favorite dish here is the one that freaks most people out...THE LAMB'S TONGUE!

In brief, it's like a Korean version of T&T/BTrust, more modern PAT.  Aside from the Korean-specific items Galleria carries, here are the other differences:  
-  produce looks fresher.  During both visits, they were being sprayed by the auto-sprinklers, unlike other grocery stores where produce is just stacked on top of each other in bins
-  there is no seating in the grocery store, but instead, there is a seating area after the checkout 
-  there is a food court + a bakery after the checkout
-  PSY's image is EVERYWHERE, even on the workers' t-shirts
-  according to their website, this particular location is open 24/7!!!

I wanted to pick up some banchans, but they were a bit more expensive than I thought.  There were a selection of them, pre-packaged, that you can mix 'n match for 3/$10.  You can probably get them individually weighed 'n priced (too mah-fan!), but I decided against it altogether 'cause 1 little package is like the equivalent of the cost of a bag of chips!

Checkout was a breeze.  Kimbob that I purchased was a good snack and fresh.  Cooked items looked freshly packaged as well.  Bakery Gateau, the bakery beside the checkout, was yummy and reasonably priced.

Tip:  It's easier to enter if you're headed south on Yonge, otherwise, a bit of a nightmare.  And unless you like car accidents, there is parking beyond the entrance of Galleria.

Food: pizza, wings, burgers..but website indicates they are bar foods well made, main dish quality..they were not. Margarita pizza was burnt, black bottom with barley melted cheese, soggy. .decent flavor, but the cook needs a lesson..the wings were just 'eh' take out pizza spot quality, 8 overcook dry wings for 13.50$ AND you have to pay extra for ranch or blue cheese dressing/not worth price at all!! Salad came out with main dish, pop was flat..asked cook for plates for the pizza and he said it wasn't his job to get them.. (could he not have just asked whoever job it was?!)

How convenient right?! but, I did not  get a chance to read the previous reviews before our visit, but I wish I should have, so I knew what to expect!

I am not a huge coffee drinker but accommodated my father downstairs to get his daily caffeine fix. My brother also asked me to get him a drink too, so my dad ordered his and paid using his gold card, then I used my phone (I also had his card saved on my mobile app) to pay for my brothers drink. 

Moment's later while waiting for our drinks, I decided to order a green tea lemonade because it was a hot day and a cool drink sounded good! I stood back in line, and brought out my phone again, the same chick that assisted me said ""Sorry, you cant use the same card twice, that is our policy here""....Say what now?.... So how am I supposed to pay? because my dad used the same exact card to pay just a few moments ago, so how are you going to tell me I can't use the same card?! 

She then explains its their ""policy"" but decides to be nice and say ""okay I can accept it this time, but we normally can't!"" 

What the hell?!!!! This is the FIRST i've heard of such nonsense!!!!

What place of business would basically say no to money?! So I wait at the pick up station and I hear them muttering words to one another while looking at me, so I was staring at them right back and the girl comes over and asks...""can I help you with something?"" ....Uh yeah!!!! I am waiting for my drinks wtf!!!!

She asks...oh what did you order?

I had the ahi sandwich, which was overcooked and flavorless. As I ate it, I was taunted by the video loop of Triple D's visit to this place, where this sandwich was featured as a must have. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, maybe it was just a bad night, but either way it is evident that this place either suffers from lack of consistency or have fallen into output being more important than quality. Either way it's a problem. Perhaps the burgers and pizza are better, but unfortunately it would take some convincing to get me to give them another shot in lieu of the wait and price.

jfn8Zpfh2hpPwmw2XHQ8yw,xVV86BToDOQGxE1gt9MMvg,eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g,3,0,0,1,"This review is based on dinner. 

We had the mother's day combo for $288, which comes with a lot of good stuff:
-18 pieces sashimi
-Lobster/pumpkin cream soup
-scallion chicken (cold)
-scallop & shrimp in herb sauce
-Giant lobster
-Steamed fish
-Lobster fried rice
-Papaya/white fungus dessert

We added a mushroom e-fu noodle on top as we were afraid seafood wouldn't be filling enough.

The highlight is definitely the lobster. Big chunky pieces with lots of meat. I love the fried garlic style that I don't know the English name for. Sashimi is much more fresh than your typical AYCE place. The cold chicken is pretty standard. The lobster fried rice probably should have been bigger portion but there are good chunks of lobster ""goo"" in it. So it tasted good. The scallop shrimp dish was also very good. Big pieces of scallop and shrimps. That herb sauce was superb.

Now for the bad...the e-fu noodle was pretty meh. Hardly any scallop in it. Mostly noodles and sauce. Not even much mushroom. My mom threw a fit about the ""steamed"" fish. Before the food came, they told us they don't have sea bass and offered another type of fish. We had no choice so ok...the problem was that instead of a live steamed fish, they gave us fried fish. In Chinese food, you steam fresh fish. Frying is for dead or frozen fish.

Also, its quite common for Chinese seafood places to do this...the combo price is for 6lb lobster but they will bring the lobster over. They will nearly always pick one that's bigger and tell you to pay the difference per pound. You'll never get exactly 6lb so you always end up paying more than what the menu says.

So I would have given this place a 4 star otherwise if they didn't screw us on the steamed fish. I can let the bigger lobster thing slide since it's common practice. My mom really wanted to eat steamed fish, not fried. This is why Chinese are so good at doing business. They always find a way to screw you. They have a fish market right next door and could have easily given us any other fresh fish but wanted to unload their dead fish stock first. It's a pricey restaurant and final damage was about $400 for 5 people including tax and tip.",2017-05-20 23:22:24

My mom was in town and we headed over for a simple dinner, we were greeted and seated quickly,  initially contemplating ordering from their charcuterie menu we decides on the burger and turkey sloppy joe, respectively, and split a small chopped salad.  The chopped salad was great!  Light fresh and crisp, tossed with the prefect amount of their house vinaigrette.  
They made a little boo boo with the order, bringing my mom fish and chips and taking her burger to the next table but they eventually got it straight.  My turkey sloppy joe was tasty and I loved the roasted poblano pepper, the seasoning in the sloppy joe sauce was too much like the cumin laden taco seasoning I am not too fond of but it was still good.

Anyway ventured here with my girlfriend to try and get as close to my natural cultural base of food as possible.

The restaurant has a pleasant ambience with covered outdoor area and and inner air conditioning-the manager was very pleasant coming out greeting us and trying to get to know us on a personal level. Told us about the loyalty program, and how you could win a free trip for two to Istanbul!!!- to me the most important thing about a restaurant is not what it currently is but what it's trying to be- I definitely got the idea that they were constantly trying to encourage feedback and communication with customers and improve.

The restaurant was clean- it was apparent they did a lot to give it the motto ""2 hours until Istanbul""  the tables were covered with Turkish rug tapestry and menus were covered with it too- reminded me of Persian designs a lot!!

We got the inza salad and baba ganoush which tasted pretty good, the bread was fluffy and delicious!  For an entree we split the lamb kabob plate- it was not insanely plentiful in rice but it put the two of us at a good place! We left satisfied with our meal- the meats on the plate were spectacular! Juicy tender and cooked to perfection!!! My favorite were the kufta and adona kebab!!! 

It got busy so it took them a little while to come and wrap up our experience , but no rush we were having a good time. 

To wrap it up we had the baklava and black tea (another Persian similarity)- absolutely perfect ending to a delightful dining experience. Loved it here- will return!",2015-05-31 23:23:43

When I drove by the strip mall at the corner of Plaza 7 Central and saw that Akahana had opened I made a mental note to try it, but for some reason did not think it would be anything fantastic. So two days later, when we were trying to decided what to do for dinner and decided to head down the street to eat there I wasn't holding my breath. And you know what, I was completely wrong.

The decor is vibrant and inviting, giving Akahana a swank feeling that one does not generally find in strip malls. The servers were prompt and polite, though a bit green around the edges. And the menu, well lets just say it was expansive. It was far from the standard sushi offerings + General Tso's chicken  that I was expecting.

We both ended up going with Thai dishes. I ordered the Seafood Curry w/Scallops, however the server must have confused my order and I ended up with the combination Seafood Curry which has scallops, shrimp & calamari. I enjoyed it, but I feel the need to point it out since so many people have allergies to specific types of seafood. The BF got Spicy Basil chicken and the meat was unbelievably tender. Neither dish was swimming in sauce which allowed the flavors to remain balanced and the vegetables were all fresh and crisp. The Crab Wonton appetizers were warm and flaky with plenty of delicious filling. We decided to be extra indulgent and order a spicy salmon roll as well to get an idea of their sushi prowess. The waitress and sushi chef must have had a misunderstanding because we ended up with a salmon tamaki cone instead, but the fish was so deliciously fresh that neither of us really cared. 

The whole meal, for those of you keeping track, thats two entrees, one appetizer and two beers (she took the sushi off the bill without being asked since they messed up the order) plus tax and tip, ran me $50, which is certainly not unreasonable.

I thought it was tempered and tinted... he was able to properly identify the right type of glass (ended up being plain glass with tint film) and match it with a piece of tinted glass.  The competitors wanted to special order tinted tempered glass which would have been unnecessary and expensive.

My only complaint is when you order the hummus, they give you a tiny tiny amount of pita bread. When I ask for more bread, it is unrealistically expensive for just a few more triangles of bread- like pita bread is the most valuable commodity ever. What would it take to get a full pitta bread- a bag of diamonds in trade? I normally order the hummus trio and there is enough pita bread for 1/4 of the hummus.

All in all, it was fun.  Parking was $5, and we were able to find a good spot.  

We had tickets through a corporate sponsored event, and so we got to sit over by 3rd base, the bench seating.

Bench was ok. Not the most comfortable stadium seat i've ever sat in, but definitely not the worst!!!  

The bat dog was my favorite part, I think.  I've never seen a dog fetch baseball bats, and deliver water to the outfielders before.  

We happened to attend on a night with fireworks, and WOW.  This display was better than some of the casinos on the 4th of July.

My only issue was that the waitress/bartender was a bit abrupt and highly overworked. She was niceish when she actually was talking to us but that was a rare occurence. There was another girl walking around but I'm not sure what her function was because she didn't really take any orders.  She would clear plates and that's it.

I had the Crab Rangoon, the duck curry, and some Thai Iced tea.   Overall I wasn't overly impressed, but I could see bringing friends or a date to this place.  

The Crab Rangoon was very sweet.  The sauce reminded me of pomegranate jelly. Not bad, but definitely not the best.  Way too sweet in my book.  The Thai tea was alright, but it tasted a little cheap or perhaps with artificial sweeteners.

The duck curry (red curry) was the best part of the meal.  It was actually quite tasty.  This dish had a surprising mixture of green and red peppers, tiny chopped carrots, peas, fresh pineapple chunks, and raisins.  The red curry itself was satisfactory in taste, and had a watery texture that soaked well into the white rice.  It was served with the perfect level of spice (I asked for medium), and it was not too sweet.  Not a bad dish at all.

I didn't have any problems with the service, which I've noticed in a few reviews.  The place was mostly staffed by younger Asians, and they were having a good time while working, so maybe there are nights when the staff get carried away... I dunno.

We live on the property but we have never dined at the hotel.  The property is amazing, the hotel is beautiful, as is the restaurant.

I had the the Beef Wellington, but I would say this particular dish was more of a faux Wellington. Some might call it de-constructed, but this was more like cutting corners to me.  I would best describe it as Choice grade Filet with puff pastry on the side. The presentation was beautiful, I will say that, but it lacked the authenticity I was expecting. I'm all for creativity if the taste is there, but it was just ok. As I've said in other reviews maybe I've been ruined by City Hall and Durrants but it was just not up to par.

My boyfriend is a picky eater, sometimes he will agree to try a place just because I want to try it and sometimes we will have to ask for the kitchen to accommodate his affliction. In this case he just wanted a plain old filet, nothing else on the plate. Some kitchens don't like to make menu modifications, I respect that and their process, but I asked as soon as we sat down if they could prepare just a filet, nothing else, and the waiter said yes. When it came time to order my boyfriend asked for just a ""Filet on a plate, nothing else"" and the waiter then tried to convince him to take dish as a beef wellington, which he did not want, then with other garnishes and sides, so we had to say ""no thank you"" to his suggestions three times, and at that point it felt like he was actually judging us or frustrated with us for some reason. He took the order and didn't ask for the temperature of the steak so we had to call it out to him as he was walking away. 

The interactions with the server from that point were just awkward, he communicated with us in very few words, and there were a couple of times where he came to the table and just stood there like he was expecting us to speak to him first. It was weird, a bit creepy, and not the fine dining experience we are used to. Maybe he was having an off night but it made for an uncomfortable experience almost like we were putting him out, or possibly not racking up a big enough tab. 

The food arrived in the appropriate amount of time, they filled the water glasses and refilled drinks in perfect tune but the server/guest relationship was just off.  We were uncomfortable and so we skipped dessert and I almost never pass up Creme Brûlée, but we just wanted to get out of there. 

The cotton candy at the end was a nice touch. Can't say I would go back here again, maybe for brunch. I was just underwhelmed.",2016-04-30 17:20:17

They do a NY style pizza, huge flat slices.  They also have a bunch of typical Italian restaurant appetizers and desserts to choose from.  No complaints about the pizza, every time I get it, it is great.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, is this.  They sell pizza by the slice, which I am a huge fan of.  Why stop at a nasty fast-food place when I can get a slice or two of great pizza, right?  The problem is that 4/5 times I go, there are never slices available.  And it isn't that they are that busy, there are none ready.  Wait 10-15 minutes for some to be ready?.. no thanks, it kinda defeats the purpose.

Dr. Mumford seriously knows her stuff and isn't afraid to dive into an explanation. The office has lots of new (but not bleeding edge un-proven) technology *and* Dr. Mumford understands and can explain the strengths/weaknesses of each tool, using them each effectively in their place.
I now know what that darned bright light is for - and the super bright one with the lens, too - when the doc looks in your eye. (No I won't explain, you'll have to ask.) I know what the retinal scan is good for and why it's still necessary to have a look the old fashioned way even with those fancy pictures of the back of your eye.

On practice style, she is clear about what the best options and alternatives are and gives you all the information to be involved and direct your treatment.

I'll preface the rest with: I feel like most reviews of medical professionals focus on the staff, billing process, office decoration or at best the friendliness of the doc and many places get high # of star ratings because of their houseplant choices. That's crazy! I want someone who knows what they're doing - everything else is a bonus.

All that said, Innovative Eye Care is the whole package! The staff are very friendly and efficient, the building is nice, nearby businesses are clean and they even have tasteful decor in the office.

Do I recommend? If you like to be fully informed with what's going on in your eyes and feel confident making your own care choices, absolutely! If you want a doc to decide for you based on their experience and ship you on your way, you might not be as excited but Innovative will still more than meet the need.

The cashier was thoroughly trained on the register.  Not all the registers were open but I'm not sure if the kitchen could keep if they went any faster.  

There are two sets of smallish flat screens mounted on the upper wall of the dining room.  The patio was very large (they took Modern Steak's entire patio space looking out into the parking lot) and had a lot of larger capacity communal type seating (lots of benches, long tables, ring of seats around the fire pit).  The brand new wood-decorated interior was a perfect temperature when they had the front open to the patio.

The salted crinkle cut fries ($2.99) had a great texture, and are best when they are fresh and hot.  They become less crunchy and fluffy as they cool.

The chicken sandwich ($6.29) has a noticeable yet mild kick and a really great crunch.  The bun was toasted well.  The chicken was somewhat oily, but very juicy, and you can tell it is non-processed white meat.  Compared to Chick-fil-A, this chicken's crust was much crunchier, and the bun also had a better texture thanks to the toasting (CFA's sandwiches tend to be very ""soft"" though their seasoning is always spot-on.)

The black and white shake ($5.29) was incredible and actually tasted like the cookie's frosting.  I couldn't really place the chocolate flavor, but it was unique.  It was not too thick, but not watery either...just perfect.

Nitpicks: The ketchup dispensers were empty, but they had large plastic Heinz bottles out for customers to use.
 
It's quite loud inside due to the louder volume music and all the hard surfaces, and because it was very busy due to the opening day rush.

Their water comes from a self-serve dispenser on the condiment table, so there doesn't seem to be a way to get ice water.

They front the valet lot, but for parking I just used a parking garage and walked through the mall.

Overall: The employees are what push this to a 5.  I was surprised at how helpful and hospitable the employees cleaning up the dining room were, even offering to take my trash and throw it away for me.  Many employees made friendly small talk with customers, and a gentleman who I believe was the manager was on the floor.  This is also a great location for younger people, as it's more relaxed and quite a bit cheaper than Zinburger, while offering a more upscale (nicer decor, serving alcohol) atmosphere than Five Guys, The Habit, and Smashburger.",2016-02-27 08:33:12

Service was good. We ordered two entrees for our visit and were still fairly hungry when we left hahaha. 

PAD THAI (2/5)
(Zucchini & kelp noodles, shredded romaine lettuce, carrots & bell peppers mixed in a tangy Thai sauce topped with green onions & crumbled cashews.)

More Thai sauce would make this dish much better! There wasn't much taste to this entree. If you like the original taste of zucchini and kelp, then this entree is for you. There isn't much sauce, so you're tasting the raw ingredients itself.

QUESADILLAS (3/5)
(Cashew cheddar cheese, crumbled nut loaf, salsa, avocado, & romaine lettuce in a red pepper wrap. Served with kaleslaw.)

This had a lot more flavour than the pad thai. I actually liked this dish in comparison. I'm a big fan of avocado and they added a lot of it within the quesadilla. The portion is very small though, the size seems to be for an appetizer instead of an entree.",2016-06-29 17:28:04

It's very German. Did you see the hard-to-spell name? It's like 1960s factory meets the fonts of fairytale Germany. It's bread and pastries to the front and cafe sitting area to the side. A good vibe and even though it's in the middle of nowhere Etobicoke, the Germans and those in the know are a flocking. I feel like it's a Toronto secret. Though I did get a scolding from ""Franz"" for taking pictures inside. 

THE GOODS
It is ALL about the bread! I've have never seen buns so cheap! 20 cent buns people.Croissants are 70 cents and you can get some fine wheat and multigrain bread here as well. Such variety. The best part is that the bread is healthy, as it's made with spring water. Seriously. 
This place is the sh*t. They've got some really good pastries here as well (chocolate with almonds on top...Mmm) and spinach and cheese pastries.

My favourite things about Prohibition:
1. They're open when other places aren't. On New Year's Day (a Friday as you'll recall) night, bars across the city were dark, probably not wanting to pay their staff double time on a stat holiday. Prohibition was open and contemplating closing early, but stayed open when I called to say we were hungry and on our way.

2. The fries are among the best in the city. Perfectly crispy, well spiced and shoestringy. They come with tangy mustard for dipping. 

3. The grilled cheese is incredible and a new favourite in the city. Sourdough bread + ooey, gooey cheese. Get it with the fries and you won't be sorry.

4. They don't mind if I use their outlets to quickly juice up my iPhone.

5. I once ordered a mixed drink with grapefruit juice and they had run out of it. The server checked with me to see if I was dead set on the drink (which I was) and then ran across the street to buy more juice from the store. Amazing service.

6. Speaking of service, I love Joanna (a deadringer for Big Suze from Peep Show: http://www.comedy.co.uk/images/library/people/180x200/p/peep_show_big_suze.jpg) because she's patient whenever I bring an army of friends here and maintains a friendly disposition. Wally, who's Irish, is also a hoot. Mike S once asked for a beer recommendation and Wally told him to go for Delirium Tremens on tap: ""It's savage!"" he declared.

7. The space was probably previously divided, because there are two separate bathrooms in the basement. The one on the west side of the bar has a photobooth that I really hope starts working again soon.

8. They have brunch, and the options are appealing. Plus they have fancier mixed drinks in the morning, including your standard mimosas.",2010-02-04 17:59:16

Pulled pork was wonderfully sweet and smoky.

Portions are huge and the fish is flaky with a great batter, not overly greasy and no fishy taste. The fries were a bit overdone, and the tartar sauce came in little packets which was disappointing to more than one person in our party. 
The biggest downsides would be 1) the service and 2) the price.
The waitresses were friendly so I don't mean to say anything against them, but the restaurant was packed and at any time there was only 1-2 people managing all the tables. I do not blame them for not being able to keep up -- the restaurant should staff up during a busy sunday lunch rush.
The prices were great for breakfasts and I think I will return for this! I think it was $7 for an egg breakfast and you get 1 free refill on your coffee. However, the prices for fish and chips were steep. $17 for one piece or $27 for two. Everyone in my party still went for the fish and chips as the waitress said it was the best she ever had and I'd read the reviews on yelp. Most people ended up sharing a plate in pairs of two. The one piece itself was shareable as the portions are large as mentioned earlier, but a friend and I split a two-piece and I'm glad we did because the fish was great and I kept wanting to eat more. It was nice that the restaurant allowed all of us to share plates. However, I won't be frequenting this place for the fish and chips because it's still steep for a lunch, unless you're sharing. I will say that most people at my table said it was the best fish and chips they had ever had so the waitress was right!

I've had a couple of check ups and cleanings done at the new location, which have been fine. In fact, the hygienist was fantastic. The issue is that since my last visit and since the time I scheduled my latest appointment, they changed their pricing (I do not have insurance). If it was a marginal increase, I probably would have let it slide. But when I showed up for my appointment, I was told that the cost would be something akin to a mortgage payment on my home for a basic cleaning and check-up! Then the girl at the desk tries to coerce me into their new annual discount savings plan, where if I was to pay an annual fee, then I would have access to discounted rates, rates that are STILL higher than what I'd paid in the past. OK. Pricing can change over time. I won't argue with that. However, if you are going up your prices by over 500%, you may want to let your existing patients know before they are left standing in shock at the ridiculousness of your new business model, having taken time off work and wasted time and gas to get to an appointment they can no longer afford.

Overall it has always be fine but nowhere near exceptional.

The first two times I went I tried different pasta dishes and they were tasty but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about. This visit that changed! I have always looked at the Mushroom Pizza every time that I have been there but never ordered it because more often than not this kind of dish isn't seasoned well and I am disappointed.

Show stealer: croissant. So good. Not too flaky but not not too solid either, wasn't too salty or too sweet, simply perfect. Probably the best croissant in montreal. I had the ham removed because i don't eat pork so my croissant came just with cream cheese but I'd rather have nothing on it and just go for plain croissant. I cannot stop fawning about how great the texture and softness of the croissant was. Next time I come, I'm simply getting a good ol' croissant avec cafe.

Everything else was great too but honestly the croissant was so good that the rest pales down to it. I also had a latte (they use beans by illy) which was also a rich and smooth blend of milk and coffee, not too bitter. Definitely recommend. All brunch plates also come with bread pudding (not my fav) and (super-duper) fresh orange juice.

Best part is the location, situated south of downtown, in the heart of a non-touristy part old port. It's like walking into a perfect life and having your dreams fulfilled in cup of coffee. Great ambience and had a great experience.

We went to the 51's game on July 3rd for the following reasons:
-Real Dodgers were supposed to be doing their rehab stints during this game
-It was $1 beer night
-Fireworks

So, who knew that everyone in Las Vegas would have the same idea as we did? It took us an hour to get from the freeway offramp to the parking lot. Drivers in Las Vegas make drivers in Los Angeles look  sane and polite.

$1 beer in Las Vegas is not unique, however, I spent most of the night standing in endlessly long beer lines. People were getting beer and then drinking it while standing in line for more beer...and it was not even that cold. 

No real Dodgers played in the game...and the 51's had their asses handed to them by the Salt Lake Bees.

The fireworks kind of sucked.

The seats are metal benches...not too comfy, especially if you are sitting next to someone with a huge ass.

That's my rating philosophy, it is what it is. 

For starters, considering the area this restaurant is in, it is definitely incredibly clean and well kept for a fast food restaurant. Many others in the area are nothing short of disgusting, so I was pleasantly surprised to see this. There was a guy there doing maintenance when I was there too, so someone clearly makes sure this place stays in good shape. 

The staff were attentive, not particularly friendly though. No one smiled. No one was necessarily rude, but the two employees I interacted with were just rather flat. 

The food wait was a bit long. After ordering it took about 5 minutes for my food to be called out, despite the fact that I saw it ready the entire time I was waiting. They were a little busy and a little understaffed, so this may have been why. 

Food itself was typical for Arby's. Not mind blowing, but decent. Huge homestyle fan myself, but not going to lie, I get excited when a few curly fries accidentally sneak in the fry box. I'd come back to this location if I was in the area.

Located in a small strip mall just down from Presbyterian Hospital, this restaurant offers a mix of booths and tables for dinner parties of all different sizes.  Decor is pretty generic and spartan- muted colors and bad painting of flowers.  Definitely not distracting, but not exactly cozy either.

The menu holds all the well-known favorites you'd expect, with weekends offering the chance for the more adventurous to request an authentic Cantonese menu.  Don't throw in the towel yet, though, as even the staples are served with a level of quality not often found amongst 88's peers.  Veggies are fresh and snappy.  Sauces have distinct and vibrant flavor.  If you ask for spicy, they will hook you up- and not in the ""couple extra shakes of pepper flakes"" kinda way.  

Standouts include their egg rolls- nothing deep frozen for months here.  The owner told us they make them fresh each day, and it shows.  The veggies inside are still crunchy and colorful.  Nice!  I also really like their egg drop soup- lots of flavor and it has always been served piping hot.

My only gripe here is the young male server who rushes service and interaction to the point you feel like you're in the way of him getting on to his next appointment- even though the place is near-empty.  Orders are prompt and correct, I just don't see the need for the rush-hour approach to getting me back out the door, especially on the weekends.  A little more customer service would go a long way.

Still, I didn't come particularly for the service, I came for the food, and the quality is there and noticeable.  When I don't want to slum it for Chinese take-out, 88 is my new go to.",2010-12-23 03:13:51

Ordered a calzone with pepperoni/mushroom and some garlic bread. The calzone had a thick edge which I found to be too much - had it been seasoned or swiped with some garlic butter, it may not have gone to waste. The mushrooms are canned - I prefer fresh, and there wasn't enough pepperoni. *shrug* The garlic bread though - was laughable. It was a hoagie roll, buttered with garlic powder. I probably could have made that at home eh? 

We've had pizza from them before and it's meh... As other Yelp reviews have said, if you're just looking for bare bones basics, it'll do. If you want pizza with some flavor and personality, this probably isn't the best bet. 

I do want to say regarding their screen door that locks (you have to be buzzed in) there is a VERY good reason for this: I live just around the corner from OCP, and can attest to the fact that there are transient and homeless persons to be watchful of most of the time. OCP is just down from a large social service agency and in fact attached to an interim shelter for women. To be clear, I'm in no way saying that homeless people are in general scary, bad or whatever... I'm saying that if I were a business in this area where there is often one employee working way in the back, I'd darn sure have a door that locked and a buzzer to let me know who's wanting in and why.",2015-06-08 00:29:03

-utterly decadent avocado/mushroom carpaccio with savory crisps. There's a hint of truffle in there as well that is not overbearing. Although we were sharing this (my friend had the mac and cheese which I tasted but didn't lov, so I pretty much kept this plate in front of me the entire time), I might have, no I definitely did, eat the entire thing! Divine! 

-Smoked. Beet. Sandwich. With. Pickles. WHAT? I thought I had given up beets forever after ODing on them on a juice fast but this sandwich is utterly incredible. I took a bite, intending only to taste it, but I ended up smashing in an entire half despite myself. Glad my friend could convince me to take a bite. What I loved was the smoky flavor mixed with the tang of pickles. The beets are thinly sliced and piled on and it was a pure lov affair for me.

-crispy giant juicy onion rings. Need I say more? OK, one thing: the creamy dipping sauce could use a kick... I'm a hot sauce fanatic and don't expect others to be, but say a smoky chipotle pepper might be added to spice things up?! Fireworks might ensue?!

As I mention above, not as much lov for the mac and cheese, but I'm a weirdo who doesn't lov mac and cheese at all. Lov's is good, don't get me wrong! The crispy kale makes it interesting & at an edible level so that it's not pure starch and creaminess (not the fault of any restaurant, this is purely a texture thing that doesn't appeal to yours, truly). So while I wouldn't order it again, I absolutely recommend it for mac and cheese lovahs! 

No lov for the risotto. Sadly a bit bland and without much bite to the arborio. The salt I added still didn't help, but I'm not gonna dwell on the negative and leave it at that. 

I so cannot wait to return to Montréal and get back to the Lov affair. It makes my little vegan heart so happy.",2017-04-26 14:01:53

Everything about it is absolutely spot on - starting from the almost hidden entrance and garden-green exterior to walking into the beautifully designed interior, every experience at Graft is a journey.  

Upon being greeted at the front, the hostess offered to take my coat and umbrella to hang up before seating us at a table. Inside, there are two seating areas: tables near the front window, and majestic, cozy booths lining the bar going towards the back of the restaurant. The booths are half-circles and perfect for sharing dishes and being able to converse with friends. A+ design.

In addition, the service here is incredible. My waiter/waitresses have always been delightfully helpful, friendly, and kind and check up on the tables often to make sure everything is perfect. The three times I have visited, the owner has also personally come up to my table to check in on how our dining experience has been that day and gave suggestions on new menu items.

Beyond the wonderful service and ambiance, the food at Graft really is amazing. Focusing on Midwest ingredients and tapas-style dining, the dishes allow you to truly experience brilliant flavor and texture combinations while not over-stimulating your palate. Some individual menu reviews:

Bread Platter: PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND ORDER THIS. I think it's around $3 and so worth it - the bread is warm, wholesome, tasty, and comes with the smoothest butter. The first time I came was a honey based butter that really made the bread melt in your mouth and the second time was a whipped, saltier butter. Don't underestimate the name because sometimes, simplicity is magic.

Brussel Sprouts: Served with pumpkin seeds and balsamic glaze - Graft takes this dish and somehow eliminates the bitter taste of brussel sprouts but enhancing the best flavors and accomplishing the perfect texture. 

Roasted Beets: So many beautiful colors and cut into bite-sized pieces. 

Graft Mac & Cheese: A must-have. The best mac & cheese I've ever had - perfectly creamy, flavored, and topped with breadcrumbs to take you all the way to food heaven.

Oyster Po-Boy: Comes as an individual order and I was a little taken aback at first by the combination with the okra and hot sauce. It's small but tall and daunting to bite into but the outcome is so, so worth it.

Pork Belly: Average. Was a little over-cooked and too sweet for my taste.

Half Chicken: The only really disappointing dish I've had there. The chicken was pretty dry, the sauce was also pretty average with no outstanding flavors or textures. Also pretty pricy for just chicken although the portion size is larger than the others.

Chocolate Tart: Wowowow. Super rich chocolate, great crust. Kind of hard to eat though because it falls apart with a fork since the crust is pretty tough, but not sure if it's not proper dinner etiquette to eat it with your hands.

Vanilla Bean Semifreddo: Super sad this isn't on the menu anymore! Topped with candied almonds, blueberry compote, and lots of love. I never wanted it to end. I might have almost shed a tear eating this.

Pot de Creme: I'm getting emotional. I thought it would be too sweet, but I was so wrong and I couldn't have been more happy about that. Perfectly sweet, smooth, cold, and the perfect end to a perfect meal at Graft.

Tacos: EVERY TUESDAY. There's a featured taco every Tuesday that isn't on the menu (so make sure you ask your waiter about it!) and it's $9 for 3 tacos. I've had a Korean taco, a pulled pork taco, and I've heard only great things from other friends who have tried other ones. Always an explosion of amazing complimentary flavors with the taco flavor choices and the perfect packed taco for satisfaction, but maintaining your composure eating it.

I was probably dramatic with this entire review but it accurately describes my experience every time. Love the environment there, love their cleverly designed website, and everything about it. Thank you, Graft!",2017-05-09 03:12:36

Restaurant style: Long benches, order at the counter, food delivered to your table.

I love the menu concept of listing all the flavourings and ingredients in all the sausages. There are so much to choose from. We shared the barese heritage platter with 4 ppl, along with side orders of duck fries, kimchi and pretzels.

The wursts are quite a bit different from what I expected. They are narrower in diameter, and quite oily from appearance. I love that there are different mustards on the table to go along with the wursts. The pretzels and duck fat fries were delicious - wish we ordered more. I was a bit surprised that the side dishes stood out more than the sausages themselves, but I could be wrong.

Suggestion: Have a tasting menu where customers can choose different flavoured sausages in smaller sizes. I would have tried the game meats, but again, I was hesitant that I might not like it. A sample / tasting menu could easily solve that. 

Sidenote: Beer list is extensive! And some extremely pricey.",2018-05-15 22:26:47

I thought some good food and bachata dance lessons all in one place would be great! The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the gentlemen behind the counter were friendly.

She also made sure to take up the only table that said ""reserved for Walrus and the Pearl customers"" to do her work. Given, there are plenty of other tables to choose from, this specific one was more quaint and separated from the other parts of the open floor, which would have been nice since we were celebrating. We never received food menus and had to ask for a drink menu. We were basically told we had options of oysters, tuna poke bowl and lobster roll. The lobster roll was supposed to be on special for $12 but I later seen I was charged $14 and the roll was more bread than anything. The poke bowl should've been named rice, tuna with avocado chunks, no dressings, or ginger available and forget any other toppings. Tuna was warm for some reason. I wouldn't recommend especially after seeing the guy shucking oysters grab the lemons with his bare hands while maneuvering other devices in and out of the kitchen. I should've listened to the other lady that left the same review. I wouldn't waste my time ever again. I've attached the photo but don't let the image fool you, the bowl is a lot smaller than it appears.

I no longer frequent this neighbourhood as much, however, I was in the area and needed to get my nails done for an event. I found them on Yelp and saw that they had a check in deal! When I walked in, there was only one customer, getting shellac. I needed a mani/pedi (and the deal was $30 for a mani/pedi, which was perfect for me). They sat me down right away, and were very fast and efficient at getting my mani/pedi done. So far so good, right? This is when things start to go south for me...
I brought my own nail polishes, in case I could not find anything that worked for me. As it turned out, I preferred my own polishes, and my pedicurist was good with that. However, she then got helped by another woman, as they were about to get an influx of customers. So the new pedicurist started finished up the pedi while the first woman started on my mani. When I was being moved to a manicure station (after the pedi was completed) I grabbed my polish and dropped it into my bag. At this point, I noticed that the woman who had finished my pedicure saw this, and seemed suspicious (as if I were stealing their nail polish).
As my manicure is being done, by the very lovely woman who had started my pedicure, a couple of women came in. My manicurist was needed to help with the services they needed, so she asked the other woman to come finish my manicure (apply topcoat). The other woman (Rita?) TOTALLY IGNORED ME. 10 mins later, the first woman noticed I was still waiting for top coat and called to Rita again, and a different woman came by to apply topcoat. This woman then asked me if it was my own nail polish. She was referring to my hands, but the implication was for both. After this I was completely ignored for 35-45 mins. I had arrived at 4:20, and didn't leave this establishment til 5:40 because I was basically ignored by the 4 employees who were there (serving two customers while another one sat at the dryer). Also, the two customers they were serving were sitting in pedicure chairs to the right of mine (where all my stuff was) and one of those two women had decided to leave her belongings on the chair I had been sitting on... where all my things were! I found that to be incredibly rude (and uncomfortable). I know it's the customer who did this, but I still don't understand why she was seated right next to my belongings when there were 6 other empty chairs?
Eventually I had to call someone over who then asked me if my nails were dry... Uhm, I don't know? I'm the customer, you're providing me a service, which I'm paying for, so maybe you should check and then let me know if I can leave?
They did accept my check-in deal, and I have to say that the only non-Asian employee at this place was great at doing my nails and provided great service (unfortunately I did not catch her name). But other than that... I honestly wouldn't go back. This neighbourhood definitely needs a place like this. It's clean inside and inviting. But I did not appreciate their service overall. Hopefully they clean up their act.",2016-03-13 23:38:46
RAQUqgvJo9ONF0gXhDmE1A,AkYXzrbH5EgOZKUY-3fNDg,3U6KnoF3T-xC5wtL-Xc8hQ,3,3,0,2,"I heard so much about Poke bowls through online reviews, cooking shows etc. I was itching to try this place out! Who doesn't love a bowl of your fav things including sashimi?!

I heard that they were opening and was looking forward to hearing news about their grand opening. That never happened. I heard they had a soft opening - i found after that was done. Nothing was posted about either of those things on their social media which i was following (after hearing about it through the Downtown Markham Fan page on FB). Fine, no problem so i waited, anxiously and excited to try out their food after reading so many great reviews of their other location.

Last month i finally made a point of stopping in. I had so many questions and i was really looking forward to picking a bowl that would be my ""go t bowl"" when the craving for Poke hit. I decided to order 3 of their bowls, (Cali Bowl, A Hui Hou Bowl, Angry Shrimp 2.0 Bowl) 1 for me, 1 for my hubby & 1 for our guest. The idea was to share & try out more than 1 option.

As you can see by some of the photos Yelpers have posted, the food is visually stunning, but does it taste as good as it looks? Ours did for 1 and missed for 2!

The sashimi wasn't as tender as i would've liked or expected for any of the 3 bowls. We had to chew several times as it was a bit on the tough side. Isn't this supposed to be sushi grade fish? I was also surprised at the portion of salmon in the bowl and tuna - which seemed like only 2-3 small pieces on top. Avocado was overripe and too soft. I ended up taking it out of the bowl, because i couldn't handle the baby-food like texture of it. Avocado is listed as a premium topping, it shouldn't be served overripe and mushy! I also didn't care much for the crab meat salad which had zero flavour. My Cali Bowl was supposed to have fried onions. If i didn't read it on the menu, i never would've known because i didn't taste any. I also see so many pics of food with sauce drizzled over their bowls. Umm, only one of ours did. I wasn't even asked which one i wanted. Rice was cold and hard. Haha, it says Cali bowl comes with salmon & tuna! Nope, not mine, just salmon. 

I did love the seaweed salad & edamame in the bowls, but it seems like that's what filled up the bowls (and the spring mix lettuce - which FYI is not listed as an ingredient on the menu). I would love to see some new choices for their signature bowls. I feel like some of the salads & vegetables, just don't belong in a Poke bowl - like corn, kimchi & pineapples in 1 bowl. 

Service was fairly decent, but could've been better if things were explained better. Being too busy is no excuse for that.

I will give them another try because i would love to create my own Poke bowl and i still love the concept.",2018-07-24 20:31:01

I visit Vegas quite a bit, and try not to eat on the Strip if possible.  The Strip is a ""rip"" and the only benefit of eating at the Strip is I can use my comp points for mediocre, overpriced food.

Finding a mom-and-pop place like Coffee Pub makes the trip more enjoyable.  Its nice to just walk away from the clangs of the slots or the smoke filled casinos.

This Coffee Pub is tucked away in a desolate strip mall, completely on the opposite side from the other merchants.  Its next to an Embassy banquet type place, which I mistook for the Embassy Suites Hotel (its not!).  Its across from the Nevada Bank if that helps.

The place is small, holds maybe 50-80 people, cozy, with a few big table for groups.  There's outside tables for the pets (I guess?) or maybe for the smokers, though I am not sure of the Nevada laws regarding smoking near an eating establishment.

Prices are reasonable, and plenty to choose from for Breakfast/ Brunch/ Lunch.  Originally I was going to get breakfast but the sandwiches sounded so yummy, I decided to have that instead. I thought I ordered the San Diegan, but realized it was the Redondo, the turkey, bacon, avocado on sourdough.  It came with melted cheese, but I held off on the cheese. It comes with fruit, salad or chips.

Our calamitous week was over, and weary from the possibly demonically-influenced chain of events that plagued us, we decided to play it safe and dump one of those birthday gift cards my father (and his sense of humor) gave me. 

Kay claims that this is the hipster's preferred chain. Pop culture memorabilia fills the walls. To my right I could see a mint condition Gold Key Fat Albert and The Cosby Kids comic book http://www.milehighcomics.com/cgi-bin/backissue.cgi?action=fullsize&issue=31320133744%201 (it's worth over 50 bucks!) next to a blown up photo of Archie Bunker. Irony: It permeates the joint.

What also permeates TGI Friday's is competent food and service. 

Kay had her heart set on the Sesame Jack Chicken Strips, which come off as redneck Asian fusion, like Maylene and the Sons of Disaster jamming with Sigh, those sesame seeds and Panko crumbs marrying that Jack Daniels glaze and chicken in a double shotgun weddin'. 

It was the equivalent seeing a goateed kid in a trucker cap and Alabama Thunderpussy shirt and finding out he's actually pretty cool and not fronting in the least. I mean, he really likes suvvern metal, and he wears the trucker cap because that's what he truly does for a living. Yee haw and hell yeah! 

In fact, I was so enamored with that scene, I got the Captain Morgan Caribbean Conga-Line Chicken Sandwich.  Ya get a chicken breast slathered in Captain Morgan's rum, which is put it in a brioche bun along with avocado, sour cream, pineapple pico, and...holy cilantro Batman! Cilantro's becoming my favorite herb, I swear. It does not taste like soap. I mean, these haters need to start speed dating or volunteering or something...

http://ihatecilantro.com/about.php

Enough about them. Instead of sweet potato fries I got the Loaded Mashed Potatoes. I dunno, I like cheddar and bacon in my mashed taters. If my mom made them this way years ago, I might have learned to like mashed potatoes at a much earlier age. I didn't know they still had them (it's been a few years since I've been to TGI Fridays). I had to ask for ""those mashed potatoes"" and nod a certain way. Our burly and very cool server Brian got the picture. 

Kay got a beautiful steak that looked like a brick shithouse and tasted like a dream. 

Dessert then commenced. I got the Oreo Madness which is just a big Oreo cookie with ice cream in the middle and hot fudge and caramel on an oblong plate. I picked it up and ate it as Kay and Brian chuckled. 

""That's the way to do it, man,"" Brian said. 

I don't dismantle my Oreos either. You people who open them, eat the cream, and discard the cookie are misguided, man. 

Kay got the Brownie Obsession, and I hadda help her out with it, and it was good enough that I didn't mind. 

Kay also ordered a Pink Punk Cosmopolitan drink, something that involved cotton candy and was very girly. 

She accuses me of hating on chains just because they're chains, but she's wrong because if a chain's good, I won't hate on it, and TGI Friday's is pretty damn good even if they remind me of a certain classic of 90's comedic cinema...

Mountain Roll
Caterpillar Roll

Mountain Roll was one of my favorites since its sushi piled with raw tuna and salmon on top. Its spicy, its sweet, and the taste makes you want to come and eat more.

Different but good. It didn't last long amongst five people. As we went to order our entrees the chef saw that our table was empty and sent us another bread on the house. Well worth the carb overload. After that we ordered our main dishes. Everyone got something different so we could really try most the menu.  And the portions however misleading in pictures are actually a good size. The lobster with squid ink pasta gives a generous amount of lobster which is rare in most restaurants. As for the pasta, it's all made in house and was my initial reason for wanting to go. Last but not least was the dessert. The panna cotta was full of different flavors that paired nicely leaving a lightly sweetened taste in you mouth. Nothing ordered was less than amazing. The staff was great here as well.

Three ""loves"" because it was so good, I have returned three times in six days (four times in two weeks) It is really a breath of fresh air in a place that has been teetering on the brink of a slow painful death and mediocrity in dining options for a while. 

Had high hopes going to my first dinner here, which were increased by Yelperazzi who share my taste/preferences assuring me I'd love it. So, off to an early dinner with my siblings Sarah-Marie V & Anthony M on a recent Sunday. Anthony was greeted warmly by Camille and I took advantage of the complimentary champagne (or champagne cocktail=Kir Royale for me, please) they offer to ladies DAILY from 5-6:30PM. Since we all knew what we wanted, we were seated quickly. 

Our server Andrew whom we nicknamed Adam Levine, was truly engaging and well informed on the menu. (Big plus because I rely heavily on servers suggestions) sadly, several of the items we'd planned on were sold out, so we regrouped and shared the following tapas: 

""Deviled Egg"" and tuna tartare a huge hit; delicate sushi grade tuna with chopped egg doesn't sound like it would work but it did. A unique take on a classic dish. 

Jarred tuna: same ahi in a mason jar with crostini (Anthony and SM both said crostini was burnt) I'm not much of a mayo person, but this was a solid dish. 

Sun dried pineapple quinoa ""fried rice"" I could eat this every day for the rest of my life. There is tofu added & as someone who cooks with and eats tons of quinoa: I want this recipe. I've had it as my main dish on three return trips with extra tofu. It's packed full of protein and flavor. 

Main dishes:

Monkfish with caramelized onion jam was my fantastic entree. Perfectly cooked living up to the ""poor man's lobster"" nickname for texture and taste. The onion jam and accompanying dill balanced it perfectly. Another dish I'd do over again and again. 

Crispy Pork Belly was Anthony's choice (at two meals) and SM put her stamp of approval on it as well. SM had the duck with Brussel sprouts, she enjoyed it. Though not a carnivore but trust my ""siblings"" palates. We were stuffed, but Camille insisted on comping the sake soaked strawberry shortcake dessert. It was creative and delicious, not too sweet and what I'd have chosen.

We got comped 3 nights and low rates fri/sat (MGM wasnt so accomodating, the reason for the switch)

So FIRST update is there is the new annoying resort fee, despite their advertising rhetoric the last several years about 'no resort fee'.  Its $23/day (incl tax).  Supposed to cover internet - BUT ONLY ONE DEVICE PER ROOM.  (@!%#@!!) Really?  You're supposed to be hip yet dont realize that 2 people are gonna have at least 3 devices?

After waiting in line to check in for 45 minutes at 11pm on a Weds night, we're informed we couldve gone to the secret unmarked line since we were casino guests.  Pardon me, no sign, say what?  The front desk person was polite, quick professional, but we got stuck in the veritable dungeon - room 5106, which faces a stucco facade with service ladders, piping, and loads of flotsam/trash for our viewing pleasure. It was FABULOUS.  It was so dark we had to turn on the lights in the middle of the day.  ""well I guess this is how they treat casino guests, they really arent interested in real gamblers anymore"" was my thought.

Now we have been coming to the Flamingo since it was a Hilton back in the 90's.  We always liked the new pool (yes, I remember the old rectangular pool); Flamingo has made the big pool an adults only pool now (YAY), but they have crowded out a great deal of space for highprice cabanas, day beds and rental lounge chairs.  Leaving far too few chairs where the saving of chairs is an art form, with whole slews of them appearing occupied having been 'saved' by someone draping pool towels over them.  I LIKE the music and live DJ, but cmon, lets send someone around to pick up the trash, the pool was a disaster of empty buckets, beer cans and plastic cups near the end of the day.

Food - well theres a food court, quite overpriced, so I skipped it.  We learned a long time ago to avoid the Paradise buffet - it continues to set new lows for scary food.  We actually have enjoyed the coffee shop over the years - used to be called Lindys and now the Tropical Breeze, they have decent breakfasts and lunches (watch out for the overpriced drinks tho, just drink water).  I miss the old Flamingo Room!

Now lets talk about gaming.  Craps, theres little they can jigger with here - 3x4x5x odds, and a fun side bet called the fire bet.  Well dealt, but I got my butt handed to me this trip.
Blackjack - theres not much here.  A few tables, but most were the 6/5 21 (an abomination of 3/2 blackjack).  It was hard to spot where at the table this is announced, sometimes on the felt, sometimes on a cardboard tent, etc.  
The blackjack game I did find was out of 8deck shoe, had surrender (yay), DOA, DAS.  Not bad, once I found it.
Video Poker - Jacks or better sank to new lows - the entire property was 7/5.  Now for the uninitated, thats the payoff on Fullhouse/Flush hands.  The nice thing about video poker is that regulations state that machines mimicking a card game must be truly random 52 card deck.  They wont risk their license rigging this.  So the only thing they can jigger is the paytable.  9/6 JoB is close to an even money game, and is much sought after.  Gradually, casinos have rigged these to 8/6, then 8/5 (which I consider to be my very bottom) and now must Harrahs properties are 7/5 (Caesars, Linq, Harrahs, Flamingo, Cromwells, etc).  If the are stooping this low on machines where they have to honestly announce the payout, just imagine how bad the 'unannounced' slot machines are.
Like many strip casinos, roulette is the hideous Americaon 'double 0' wheel, with terrible house advantage, unlike the european wheel with a single 0 and 'en prison'.

So we get a '1 star' on the casino rating;  I wont be back here to play.

And another HUGE irritating change - PARKING.  OMG.  Flamingo has now dedicated almost half of its garage to valet parking.  ANOTHER third is now reserved for the Hilton Grand Vacations next door, which I assume must've lost its garage to make room for the new LINQ breezeway and the High Roller.  So now you're pretty much relegated to parking in the back lot - and this is a VERY long walk, it makes the walk from the MGM garage to that hotel seem short in comparison.

I will be delighted to see the Flamingo come back to its former glory - until i see the reviews perk up and the negative twitters fall, we wont be back.",2014-08-06 22:07:08

The Matthews Goodwill is in a relatively prosperous part of town (near Providence and McKee Rds) and then donations they receive outmatch what you find at other thrift stores.  It's not uncommon to find gently-used men's Gap, Banana Republic, and Brooks Brothers shirts and pants.  While other thrift shops have ""vintage""-looking clothes (I'm using vintage euphemistically here), this Goodwill has clothes that pass for brand new.  

Also, the book selection is quite amazing.  They sell hardbacks for $1.40 and paperbacks for .99!  I've found some pristine books that may have been read once.  Even if the store is out the way for you, you'll save major $$$ by purchasing your books here rather than at Borders, B&N, or other new book retailers.  

The service is typically amiss for Goodwill-the cashiers are indifferent if not downright unprofessional.  The furniture is overpriced, so don't waste your time looking for a steal here.  Otherwise, this Goodwill is A-OK with me.",2010-07-31 21:47:05

They have the BEST lunch specials (12-4pm Mon-Thurs, 12-3pm Fri-Sun) - so cheap!! Did I mention it was cheap? $7 specials for 12 rolls (2 different types). Our eyes were bigger than our stomach as we ended up ordering way too much for just the two of us but that's what leftovers are for.

We shared:
- Miso soup and small salad (you get these to start) - nice way to start the meal
- Lunch special S1 ($7) - 6 pieces of avocado roll and 6 pieces of dynamite roll.
- Lunch special S7 ($8) - 6 pieces of spicy honour roll and 6 pieces of unagi roll. I think the unagi was the best out of the lot that we ordered.
- Ikayaki ($5.50) - delicious, perfectly cooked grilled octopus appetizer.
- Sweet potato tempura and avocado VR1 ($4.75) - you get 8 pieces. This one was just average, probably wouldn't order it again.

Service was fast and our server was busy but super nice. It was my second time coming to this place - I was craving sushi the whole time I was in Toronto and this hit the spot! Good quality sushi for the price and busy so you know turnover is constant.",2013-10-16 20:45:30

I love the chips and salsa at this place its the main reason for the 3 stars. 

So I have been here a few times now since the remodel. Here is what I can say...It's nice, I mean as far as Mexican restaurants go, this place is probably one of the nicest ones I have been to in quite a while. The food is always consistently good...and can I say if you can't already tell that the chips and salsa are delicious...also no charge for chips and salsa, complimentary as much as you can stuff your face with...if you like free refills for good chips and salsa then this is definitely your place.

It's really clean you can tell everything is brand new and the staff albeit slow is friendly and fairly informative. 

So that's a win. 

The down side...service is a really a bit slow. It seems like both time I have been there since the remodel I have had to chase down staff to order, get refills on everything, and get your check, and both times I have went it has not been busy enough to really allow this to happen.

Seems management needs to get a better grasp on this. I wouldn't mind if a manager came to my table to and introduced himself and asked how everything was...not happening here. Staff seems to be off talking amongst them selves. Yesterday my server walked up and you could tell she was eating some food somewhere else, cause she was still chewing on it as she walked back up to our table to take out order after a lengthy wait. Kind of gross. So they get three stars because of poor service practice.

But back on the plus side they have great chips and salsa. So I would go back...hopefully they will have stepped up the service game next time I come in.",2015-01-14 12:33:40

I love their oyster shooters, but their 2000 different rolls all taste the same to me.  They rely WAY too much on sauce and often I want to yell at them that simple is good too!  A nice elegant simple roll can go a long way.

The service is always great.  Sometimes I wonder if the servers are really Japanese or they just fake a thick and heavy Japanese accent to go with their beautiful Japanese costumes and restaurant decor.  The one thing I really like about I Love Sushi is the ambiance.  It is always loud and rowdy in there, unlike many sushi restaurants.  You feel like you're somewhere ""happenin"", which I love when I'm eating out.

Be aware as your read reviews to take those without clear corroborative evidence with a grain of salt, especially the positive ones. Especially if there are a bunch of shriekingly positive reviews lacking any specificity.

Tryst has been on my restau-radar for awhile now. I saw the owner speak at a celiac disease foundation meeting and decided to make a trip - sigh - . Went mid-Sunday afternoon. There was only one table occupied; they soon left, leaving us alone.

Menu is ... eclectic, leaning heavily into casual and simple fare like salads and sandwiches. There are hunks of meat with sauces on them and an ""around the world"" menu that rarely touches upon the actual cuisines of the nations represented. Don't take my word for it, go look at the menus yourself. Ireland represents with an $11 Reuben sandwich, and France with $18 porkchops. You didn't know that Reubens and porkchops with red wine orange demi were Irish and French, respectively? Neither do they, I assure you. 

[If you are one of those spelling-and-grammar-OCD types, be sure to take your meds before reviewing their online menu.]

There is a nod to local and organic in the hype of this place, but you can't tell from the menu. Provenance and organic-status aren't mentioned in most menu descriptions.

Breakfast is served until 2:30 only. Since that meal's menu has the majority of the gluten-free (GF) options, this was disheartening. My despair increased as I noticed that the majority of the lunch/dinner GF items were on the pricey side of the menu, things like $13 burgers and the even pricier dinner entrees. Many of the sides aren't GF. At the time I was there I was told the only available GF sides were fruit salad, tossed salad, coleslaw and black beans. Fruit, lettuce, cabbage and beans don't make me want to be a repeat customer. There are no GF items on the children's menu.

We arrived juste au fin du petit déjeuner and settled on burgers. My accomplice ordered his with sweet potato fries and a side salad. I ordered mine GF with slaw. They don't have GF buns for the $13 burgers. Note to somebody who might care: GF buns are widely available in Phoenix. Provide some for those paying $13 for an otherwise middling burger.

Accomplice's salad was obviously wilted from being stored in a cooler uncovered for a significant period. The carrots atop the salad had a touch of that white haze that carrots get as they loiter on veggie/dip trays. His fries were, as he put it, ""plain."" My coleslaw was underwhelming, vague crunch and creamy mouthfeel without any flavor or color, strikingly akin to premade deli slaw.

Our burgers were tasty but not exceptional; good but not very good. And we were hungry, which should have heightened the taste - ""hunger is the best sauce,"" as they say.  You could make burgers of equal or better quality at home without any special effort. Accomplice's ""natural burger"" was smaller than mine, didn't fill the bun. He found this a touch sad. 

It's a smallish dining room, pleasant, a touch trendy, stained concrete floors and high ceilings. The design and decor do not stand out. Popular-ish music was playing a touch loud for the empty space. The hallway leading to the bathrooms and the bathroom itself had a strong odor of commingled sour yeast and dog funk. This odor increased inside the bathroom, which had fashionable fixtures including a Dyson Airblade hand-dryer.

It cost over $30 for two burgers and two soft drinks. When you are paying such a significant sum for a meal, your expectations are raised. You expect really good food and service. The service was acceptable, but again, nothing special. Mostly though, one is put off by the high prices and the mediocre fare. We did not try any bar drinks, appetizers or desserts.

[The establishment's ""wine tastings"" are comprised of things you could easily find at Costco (Louis Jadot) and Safeway (Fonseca Port). I recommend doing your drinking at home.]

I'm seeing a GF trend here: A restaurant with higher-than-average prices claims to have a GF menu, which is in reality a few stripped down, higher-priced choices from the regular menu. Often the GF options have a surcharge, even when the menu prices are already high. GF diners are pining for real options on a GF menu, things they can't get at most places or make easily at home, things like fries, breaded and crispy appetizers, satisfying sweets.

My non-GF-dining friends are becoming frankly annoyed at me for taking them to these dine-and-disappoint establishments. Any of a number of places are cheaper and better: True Food, Outback Steakhouse, In-N-Out Burger, Pei Wei. My summary is that this place has far better marketing than menu.

The main floor and upper level have tables/booths with beautiful lighting.  A nice girls night out or date spot.

It's Yorkville so expect higher prices and smaller portions.  We ordered the Buffalo pizza and the lobster ravioli to share as we just wanted a small bite before heading off to the ROM

I must say I was impressed with the lobster ravioli- it's rare to find a lobster dish where you can actually taste the lobster but this dish the lobster rang through the heavy cream sauce.  

The pizza was ok - nothing particularly special about it - a pizza is about 8 or so slices so definitely shareable.

The vibe is really nice and the service I can't complain about.  I'd come back if I were in the area - of course the wine/drink list is interesting:)

As other reviews state, the AYCE dinner price is $28, which is slightly higher than the local average. However, quality here is among the best AYCE I've had and the majority of lower-priced businesses in town have significantly lower quality to match.

APPETIZERS: This was our favorite section of the menu. The Jalapeno Popper dish that is commonly found around town was nicely presented here and actually had a good kick of spice for once! Salmon poke had a great spicy chili sauce, both were offset by the seaweed salad. We really enjoyed the grilled mackerel and the soft shell crab, but I did not care for the oysters. The real standout was the Rock N Roll appetizer, which is a riceless roll! 
NIGIRI: Nigiri selection was ample, and fish was typically pretty fresh. The super white tuna, scallop, golden eel, and squid were good options, but I felt the salmon and yellowtail weren't that great and lacked flavor. Rice was an average portion, fish was cut on the thin side.
ROLLS: We tried the Twilight roll and the White Dragon roll, both had several sauces and fishes, both were tempura-shrimp based. I generally try to be more adventurous with my roll picks but by this point I was too full to care. Rolls were solid and they had a lot of new specialty options, but I wish they had more riceless options.

The space was another sushi spot before Hanabi took over, but the modern, clean décor and chalkboard specials menu are a bit different. Service at the bar was attentive and we were frequently checked on by both chefs and management, though our empty dishes stacked up- this didn't really bother me, as they were pretty busy.

For those who are outraged by the higher AYCE price here- if $3 is really a deal breaker for you to drop your rating over, you have no business coming here. Stick to the Dollar Menu. The quality of dishes, freshness of fishes, and variety on the menu are more than enough to warrant the difference in cost.

For us, we don't enjoy hanging out at the bars on a Friday or Saturday night.  But, we do work late, so the fact that there are decent places to eat late at night during the week, really works for us.

Yard House has always had decent food, with a huge list of options.  You can pretty much get whatever you're in the mood for.  

Saddle Ranch Chop House is a bit loud for me, and I could really do without the bull, but again, they have some decent food, and lots to choose from.

I had never been to Buffalo Wild Wings until the other night.  It was very good!  We had a super-nice waitress, which always makes any dining experience so much better.  The cheese curds were yummy (they don't even need the sauce).  And, hubby and I shared a large wings, we each picked 2 sauces.  I'm a fan of the honey BBQ!

For the others, Shane's Rib Shack...so good!  Which Wich...not a fan.  Chipotle...I actually preferred when it was Moe's.  Kabuki...pretty good.

Now, for the lack of one star...do not like McFadden's.  Went there once, and never again!  Ditto for Margaritaville!  I'm originally from South Florida, so I've been to the original one in Key West.  I got so excited when they opened out here, but that soon went away.  The servers were horrid, and the food was just bad.  Plus, considering they're supposed to be a bar-type restaurant, they're one of the few that close really early. 

We still haven't tried Whiskey Rose or Calico Jack's.  Calico Jack's is advertised, both on their website and on their front door, as being open until 2am every night.  Well, we tried to go there at 12:05am, and they were already closing.  After we'd left Saddle Ranch, a little after 1am, we walked by, and their lights were all off.  If you don't want to stay open until 2am on a Thursday, then don't advertise that you are.

We also enjoy the outer rim restaurants, like Gordon Biersch (yummy!!) and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant (they serve my favorite salad).
 
We really only come to Westgate to have meals. We wouldn't go near the place during gamedays or concerts, mainly because of crowds and parking.  But, we're aware of that, so we don't get all upset, like some other reviewers.

Pho Tan Thanh is the restaurant located in Lee Lee's asian supermarket. The pho is well season and deep in flavor. All bowls are priced at ($5.50). They also have an upsized version. We love the barbecue pork with crab cake (Number 43 on the menu; $6.50) as well. My son loves the shredded pork that they serve with this rice dish. Tonight, I tried the Vietnamese stew with french bread or the Ban Mi Bo Kho ($5.50). This stew has the same delicious pho base. Although it is thinner than its western counterpart, this soupy stew is savory and fantastic over rice or noodles or with the warm loaf of french bread that they served up.

Last time, instead of salmon I ordered a grilled wedge salad. It was covered in oil which made it inedible. 

They also almost always mess something up in our take out order. Usually it is something small like giving us regular fries instead of garlic fries, but hey, we pay extra for the garlic! It is frustrating.

They don't have the ""buy X get your next free"" pricing that C-Fu has, but their prices are lower.  All of the employees were friendly and professional, and my water glass was always full.  The front staff (hostess/servers/cashiers) were all excellent.

Pork Dumpling (Shumai): I liked not having mushrooms in them, but they didn't seem to have the yummy whole shrimp C-Fu's has.  Still, solid.

BBQ Pork Bun (Cha Siu Bao): Served cold, sadly.  Decent, but not great.  I've tasted many better ones.

Sugar Cane Shrimp: Delicious!  Somewhat oily, but plump and juicy.  I was so happy they had these today, and at a price better than C-Fu!

Rice Cake: I think the server referred to it as ""white cake"", but it's the plain, sweetened triangular cut one.  Smallish serving, but with a good texture and sweetness level.

Custard Tart (Egg Tart): This unexpectedly stole the show!  The pastry was supremely flakey and buttery, and the custard was sweet but not too heavy.  I usually prefer my custard tarts chilled, but this was really good.  We were almost tempted to order some to take with us, but resisted!  (Bought daifuku mochi from the market instead.)

I had a taste of a warm tofu in ginger syrup concoction which wasn't bad but just wasn't my thing (lunch companion loved it).

Parking can be a nightmare, with many inconsiderate (or just unskilled?) drivers.  There was a small wait, but they went through the numbers quickly as we were before the big rush (number 9...they were in the late 50s or 60s when we left I think).  They could really use those buzzers than restaurants like Cheesecake Factory and The Habit use to notify you when your table is ready.

The ambience is okay, but a little off.  Chandeliers, decent chairs, and a fancy stage (blocking the windows), but it still looks like a food court.  I'm just used to the opulence of C-Fu, so this came off as a little ""cafeteria"" to me.

For some reason I really loved their water glasses.  They're tall, slender, cylindrical, and very classy.

Overall this restaurant offered good food, good price, and is a nice dim sum option!  The parking lot was very busy, so I wouldn't really worry about the location being in a less upscale part of town (by Tricity/Riverview/the old Levitz).",2015-01-12 00:34:39

I had a reservation for 5:30 and was promptly seated in a mostly empty restaurant.  The waiter was soon at the table with ice water and to take a drink order quickly.

After finding out the weights of the various steaks. I didn't want 18+ ounces in a steak so I ordered their ""signature house-aged bone in sirloin.""  I ordered it cooked blue.  I also ordered a side of the Special Spud.  Last night, it was mashed potatoes with jalapeño pieces, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese.  For dessert I got the Sticky toffee pudding.

I was brought a nice bread basket with two types of bread and some whipped butter.  The server brought my iced tea and it was kept filled throughout the time I was there.  The steak came and it was done exactly the way I like it--nice grill marks on the outside and cold, red on the inside.  It was a good steak.  The Special Spud was very good, probably the highlight of the evening which isn't necessarily a good thing when a side is what you remember your dinner for.  The sticky toffee pudding was good, also.  It came with some whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Service was attentive and pleasant from the time I was greeted at the door to leaving. My server was Bobby and he was a very pleasant gentleman.  I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and it got to be fun when some more people came in and I could overhear the tourist talk going on.

A solid steakhouse but it's not in my top tier of Las Vegas steakhouses.

Chef Santos has described B & E's food as ""whimsical"" and some of it did indeed exude a certain whimsy- small bites such as grilled cheese/tomato soup and a yummy slider are more than worthy of a mention!

Well it turns out that our waiter (Keoki) thought he recalled seeing the 100.00 drop out of the purse and went over to grab it, well a guest saw it too and the guest took it themselves. Then the GM got involved and they looked at camera tape and did in fact see that my friend  dropped it, so they requested the guest give it back to them, so they did. They then contacted us via text letting her know what happened. BLOWN AWAY!!!!!!!! This kind of honesty is so hard to find nowadays! Hats off to you Sake Rok!!!!! After the concert was over we went back and she just said to keep the 100.00 because honesty like that is SO hard to find. What an awesome place and still just mind blown by that honest act!",2017-05-31 03:18:49

Same roll but it feels just a little modern now
Our food on the menu but it don't sound the same
When we Yelp and talk about you, all it does is makes me hungry now
Cause my stomach growls a little when I smell your dish

It all just sounds like oooooorrrhh....
Mmm, too hungry, too thirsty to realize
That I should've bought me eggrolls
And ate some Pho
Should've had some spring rolls
When I had the chance
Take my friends to your restaurant
Cause all we wanted to do was make our appetite's dance
Now my belly's full
And I don't intend to eat anymore....

I was a tad bit skeptical of Rice Paper after hearing about their food and what it was.  It's definitely not your traditional Vietnamese restaurant by any means.   Very modern and artsy with an Americanize menu.  

My expectations weren't high needless to say, but I had to try with an open mind and stomach.  In the end, I was pretty blown away.  I really appreciate the food play here with different ingredients added to traditional cuisine.  It was bold and playful at the same time.  Apparently, this is a spring and eggroll kind of restaurant so I ordered their spider and tuna spring roll with a traditional pork eggroll.  

Overall, I LOVE SPIDERS!  I don't say that much cause truthfully the creep me out!  The crispiness of the tempura soft shell crab was a perfect combination to my soft and delicate mango, avocado, and vermicelli noodles!  Served with a miso ginger sauce this roll was bangin'!  My tuna spring roll was okay, but definitely sticking to the Spider.  My traditional eggroll was decent nothing to spectacular.  

In the end, if you're looking for traditional old school Vietnamese food -- go elsewhere cause Rice Papers new school with some ass kicking springs ready to rock and pop your palates! - Enjoy!",2013-09-16 18:21:17

StZmqLRgCxBT6t1_EWhoCw,zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,gITpNFvvnzAscUybTjwNRw,1,7,4,3,"As a foodie (sadly on a budget) I'm willing and ready to pay astronomical amounts of my cashola in order to enjoy whatever food-dragon I chase. There's no price I won't pay for the ultimate steak experience, and I won't choke on paying over 50$ for a burger, yes a burger. But the pleasure experience better have me bleeding from my eyes before I pass out.

And since the burger craze has taken over Montreal I have yet to find one of these joints that can even stand next to my expectations of what a good burger is. All they are is some business man with no knowledge of what good food is starting a stylish hipster-bait restaurant that is all about form over function. O' Burger is no different. You walk in and it's the poor-hipster's version of an ultra trendy restaurant that serves Burgers and Fries. And that's what O'Burger is doing, cashing in on a trend and it's places like O'Burger that will kill the trend.

The reception was warm and friendly as was the service, also expedient. O'Burger offers a good variety of burgers, but the template remains the same from burger to burger, that it the meat, the bun and the garden. They offer fries and Poutine of course. So I had the Dallas Burger. Typical interpretation of the Texan burger, that's Jack cheese, some Creole sauce... wait what? Creole? Yeah and it wasn't spicy, not even tangy, not even mustard tangy. Crunchy bacon? Huh, ehhhh, where? Cus I didn't have any bacon in mine. Caramelized onions my ass. The bun was the hit. Most trendy burger joint have dried crackly buns but here it's soft and moist. 

The meat... is epic facepalm worthy. This patty had nothing resembling fresh or hand prepared. It's the same patty I see in every hipster burger joint. Barely had a beefy taste because of all the filler compacted into a flower shaped patty. This patty was produced by a machine in a factory somewhere, where it was flash frozen. 

How about that poutine? How about more frozen foods? There's no way those were fresh cut and they tasted even synthetic, so who knows what chemical treatment they endured at the plant. No amount of gravy, cheese, bacon and those ridiculous caramelized onion could hide the horrible taste of those fries. Gravy wasn't even good.

In my book if I don't need at least 3 or 4 napkins to eat a burger, then it's not a good burger. Sure it was pretty but it was bad, so bad a Big Mac would have been a better option. If your restaurant is named O' Burger shouldn't your burger blow people away? I'd prefer having my greasy burger at La Belle Province than eat that bland boring piece of crap I was served. 

How hard is it to go to a butcher, get your chuck FRESH and make the patties as you go? How hard is it to hand cut fries and fry them in good oil? Well it doesn't matter to the owner, he just wants to cash in on the trend and when O' Burger crashes with the trend, he'll open another restaurant cashing in on the current trend of that day. It's not a passion for food; it's a passion for profit.

O'Burger how thou sucketh. It's no wonder I was the only patron in the restaurant.",2010-12-19 19:19:07

Ocean Prime is a white modern looking structure with blue neon lights.
We sat out on the patio which has a beautiful fireplace and the architecture of the patio ceiling is really neat. They incorporated two circles into the ceiling to allow the palm trees to grow through. The patio door and wall is all glass and looks as though it can be slid off to the side to open up the restaurant when the weather gets cooler. The bar at the back is neatly lit with all the liquor bottles and I did see a separate area labeled ""blu lounge"" that must be their sports bar section cause 2 different TV's were seen, however I did not venture back there so the ""sports bar"" description may be inaccurate. 

Our server, Kristin, was very welcoming and quick with service. I started out with a candied walnut salad with goat cheese that was delicious and my friend got the Caesar salad which she enjoyed because she said the flavor wasn't over powering. My entree was the filet mignon that I asked to be cooked medium rare and WOW, did they do an amazing job. It was by far one of the best filet's I have every eaten, it just melting in my mouth. My friend ordered the crab encrusted talipia that was equally as delicious. We split the brown sugar glazed carrots as a side, need I say more? We both ended up with the creme brulee and both savored in the sweet goodness and thickest layer of caramelized sugar coating I have every seen (but greatly appreciated).

The only negative I have to mention is that the patio chairs are wood and thus super uncomfortable (my right buttcheek went numb at one point), but it was well worth the tastiness I experienced.

My drink, miss katie's pimms cup (pimm's #1, ketel one vodka, 
muddled cucumber, ginger and sprite) was amazing. So refreshing, not too sweet, subtlety of cucumber and ginger, I could have drank these all night and it would have been worthy of 5 stars, but a girls gotta eat!

After I read the menu, and not only saw but smelled the delicious food coming out of the kitchen, I actually felt guilty for being Vegan. I too wanted to enjoy one of those mouthwatering meals. 

However, Chef Justin had no qualms about catering to my needs. I was informed he was preparing something special for me. I do Love surprises. 

It was quite a treat to have something so artfully presented to me. (see pics) 
Not only was my dish Beautiful it was Delicious! It tasted of the same care that the signature dishes on the menu were made of. 
It really says a lot about Chef Justins level of customer care that he went out of his way to prepare me something that was not just a bunch of sides thrown together on a plate. It was a well thought out dish from presentation to flavors. It was my pleasure to meet Chef Justin last night  and I can't thank him enough. 

My husband had the Short Ribs (see pics), which he'll attest, were amazing, as well as the Fig and Pecan Pie (darn, no pic) that blew him away. 
All put together with stellar service form Cort our server, it was a Wonderful evening that we will look forward to enjoying again and again.

The Coventry location is always busy during dinner time--bustling with young Case students rockin' their American Apparel--which just about guarantees you fresh fish from the rapid turnaround alone.  MEOW!  Plus, they actually use short grain rice (trust me, there is a difference).  

So, my only gripe is with consistency.  Sometimes, the sushi is amazing, a handful of other occasions, though, no umami at all. What the hell?!  But I'll chalk this up to the decreasing availability of good fish.  However, if I think about this too much, I get depressed and guilt-ridden, and feel like there is nothing left to eat that doesn't adversely affect our environment. 

But I digress...I highly recommend the Ika-maru, the Uni, the Sapparo Reserve, and the Tempura Soba.

This was a 2 star review turned 3 star due to the nice way that they split the bill and made payment super easy. 

However, it was a busy Sunday morning and we came for brunch at 11:30am. Their 'policy' was not seat anyone until their entire party was ready.  This wasn't known to us until we got there, so be warned.

They were waiting on me and AT, but they were already 5/7 people, and they still were not able to be seated because of some ridiculous rule (even though the table makeup would not change if we were to not show up for some reason). 
When they were waiting, they witnessed some couple being sat down at a table of 8 without their whole party being there, and the hostess got an earful from the manager. This was also the reason they weren't seated. 

At some point, the tables were actually going to be given away, and we were right there crossing the street. They had to fight with the hostess to give it to us when we did get there (about 1 min away!). 
(btw, we're sorry we were late!!)

Anyway, after settling down after that fiasco, we ordered. The food wasn't amazing, but it was still good.  It's at a decent price point, but I've had better. 

I got the Vegetarian Benedict, which was veggies on an english muffin, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. It was okay. Homefries were crunchy and yummy. At least that stayed the same between locations. 

AT got the Scrambled eggs on a croissant with avacado, tomato and goat cheese on a croissant. I'm glad I didn't opt for that, I had expected a crisp half cut croissant with most scrambbled eggs on it. Instead, it was a whole croissant, smooshed flat (not seeing the point), with flat eggs omelette style. i felt like I could have made this at home. At the same time, maybe I expected too much. AT really enjoyed it though. 

Another friend got the vegetarian chilli, and I tried some: I have to say, it's extremely hearty and delicious for a vegetarian dish, and if ever I were here for lunch or dinner, I'll probably get that. 

Coffee refills were good, sometimes magically appeared, kudos for that. 

I'd recommend coming here on a quieter morning for breakfast or lunch and I think you'd have a better time.

I went with the large steak burrito with all the toppings. The burrito toppings were definitely fresh and tasty. There was veggies, rice, corn, beans, cheese and even guacamole (huge plus for including guacamole at no extra cost).  Burrito boyz is a really good value and to be able to get a large burrito for around $10 with tax is pretty awesome. The large burrito is definitely more than enough to satisfy your hunger.

I was severely disappointed with the 'steak' itself which was like ground beef (sirloin cut probably). I expected steak strips but with the price I paid I guess I should not have. The beef was pretty flavourless too. I also felt like the toppings could have been spread out more evenly, as the end I started with being considerably better than the side I ended with (all that guacamole and cheesy goodness was at the top). I also would have liked to see carnitas or even pork as a protein option.

Service was a tad slower than I would have liked for 'fast food'. It took them a while to the burrito when it wasn't busy at all.

Side note - today is my day off and normally would always go for some pizza or something so decided to try it. 

White Garlic pizza - First off I am a huge fan of white garlic pizza if its done right like. either with a oil garlic blend on it. This one well not so much. The crust was super buttery I mean like if you like butter then this is your pizza for you.. I think I should of copied Philip T advise and got hammered then came in here then ordered. The cheese is ok and not sure on the dough I can't make out if its homemade or not to me it has a weird taste to it either being a PHO- Dough or real I still can't figure out. 

I ordered chicken wings there more lollipop style witch I guess is the rage here.. to me its over played. Give me a high quality jumbo chicken wing over these any day. They where ok however no sauce and asked for sauce. 

Also for to go or delivery you get these blue cheese and guessing ranch packets they say artificially flavored -- Its not a good practice to have these I recommend going with some other company that does not word this -- due to the fact I trashed them Its not that hard to make blue cheese or buy in -- actually Kerns blue cheese is really good and if you get that I would recommend getting some more blue cheese crumbles and combining the 2 it killer good. 

Overall -- If your not drunk, high .. on life that is then this place might not be for you

Dinner consisted of 3 Courses, which accompaniment of great bread and butter. 1st course was the pork belly. I came into it excepting a small sliver of meat. This was not the case, I received large square hunk of awesomely tender and juicy belly, with tangy drizzled sauce.  A+

The main course, I ventured out the normal and got the crusty salmon with really tasty Black Rice. It was great for the variety, but I would say if you want the standard preferred experience of a main meal, try the short ribs.

Desert was a crème brulee, and one of the best that I have had in recent memory. My counterparts got the chocolate mousse and there was a ton of it, all of it fluffy and smooth.

The only thing that was a slight knock was the time it took to get the food, but I wouldn't ding them a star for it, because of restaurant week and dealing with the influx of people.   Also, allowed us to have some friendly table banter.

The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the strong cheese smell...not that pleasant, but we were starving. We sat down and were given menus, dirty ones at that, and ordered some bruschetta to start just to have something to eat. Although the bread was delicious, the bruschetta tasted like cut up tomatoes - that's it. No seasonings or anything. Needless to say, we did not finish it.

The salad and breadsticks are ALWAYS delish, so we devoured those. My mom ordered a pasta dish with steak and goat cheese, and I ordered a chicken caesar salad. Her pasta was delicious!!! My salad was pretty good as well (hard to screw that up) but had too much dressing and became soggy towards the end.

What really irked me about Olive Garden was the lack of knowledge from the server. They knew absolutely nothing about the wine, my mom had ordered a glass of white but wanted a second glass afterwards - of red. The waitress COULD NOT comprehend this, even when my mom named the wine she wanted, and we both said RED multiple times. After a manager came over to confirm, they still brought her the glass of white. We had to repeat AGAIN that she wanted a DIFFERENT glass - the red she asked for.

Lq29YgTj2rUgWA9orEm1kg,QSA05SquUKJZnxasypxvjg,nkMAcmooVZvBuLqywYYHwg,5,6,2,5,"I was in Las Vegas with family members who had flown from the East Coast when the unthinkable happened. The unthinkable quickly became an emergency situation.

My sister was on the Casino floor when she bit down on something so simple and cracked her front tooth which is a porcelain crown. My sister is one of the toughest people I know, she went back to her room with crazy glue, a q-tip to fix it herself. As my sister debated how to go about applying poison onto her tooth inside of her mouth I arrived at the room to find distressed family members not really sure what to do.

I quickly calmed my sister down, advised her I had my car in the parking garage and that I was going to take her to the dentist ASAP. I pulled out my Iphone, accessed my handy dandy 'Yelp' application and began the search for 'Cosmetic Dentistry' based on my current location which was the 'Golden Nugget.'

I quickly found Dr. Brown @ Comfort Care Dental Group (which is open 7 days a week) only 0.8 miles away. I called the office and explained the situation, how my sister was due to fly back to East Coast the following morning to the staff and they were beyond helpful. The staff advised they did not have any available appointments for a few hours but would take my sister in as soon as humanly possible.

Within minutes we were at the Dental Office. This dentist office is located right off of Las Vegas Blvd in the Downtown corridor with its own dedicated parking lot. We walked into the Office and were assisted right away. The staff quickly verified my sister's insurance information and quickly took her back to an exam room.

As I waited for my sister to be finished with her emergency appointment I looked around the office which was quite nice. I noticed a '2015 Dentist award of the year' on the wall for Dr. Brown in both fields of Cosmetic & General Dentistry. There was a golden horseshoe over the door for luck (we were in Vegas) but most importantly there was a picture of a 'Dragonfly' on the wall which has significant meaning to both my sister and I.

While in the waiting area/lobby I was able to watch TV, charge my sisters Iphone and sit in some pretty comfortable chairs. The reception staff with whom I had spoken to on the telephone and who made all of this happen in a timely manner offered me 'cold' bottled water which was fantastic because an hour or so prior I was in a Bikram Yoga class. Before I knew it my sister was finished with her emergency appointment. I was called back into the exam rooms by staff and met up with my sister who was closing out her deductible with the insurance care specialist. 

My sister had a temporary crown placed over the damaged tooth until she could arrive back on the East Coast and she her regular Dentist. My sister whose standards especially for Dentists is quite high described the Dentist, staff & Dental assistants as professional, nice, caring, clean and extremely knowledgeable. 

From the moment the 'incident' happened we were walking out of the door of the Dentist within 2 hours. There is no question that Dr. Brown and his staff at Comfort Care Dental Group saved the day. They literally saved the trip to Las Vegas from being a disaster and literally saved the trip as well as our families sanity.

Immediately following the Dental visit any pain and/or discomfort regarding the damaged tooth was gone. Later that evening our family including my sister were at a sit down meal at Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse. My sister kept her food order pretty 'soft' as in soup and oysters but was still able to enjoy herself on her last night in Las Vegas which would of not happened without the extreme professionalism and quick service provided by Comfort Care Dental Group.

There is no question if a Dental emergency situation ever arose again while in Las Vegas I would without question come back here. If you are a local a resident and don't already have Comfort Care Dental Group as your primary care provided you might want to change that up. 

That day in particular I had been seeing 'signs' everywhere including that 'Dragonfly' on the wall of the Dentist. Later that evening I hit a penny slot machine for a pretty significant jackpot, just thought I would add that in this review because we were ""SO LUCKY"" to find this place. Top notch service start to finish, could not be more grateful for the help we received as a family from this group of professional strangers=)",2015-09-19 15:01:07

The Seafood Pumpkin Soup ($8) has crab meat and scallop that make the bisque very tasty.  I found that more and more soup and congee are now with Pumpkin.

The Scallop wrapped in seaweed with Broccoli and truffle oil.  The scallop is big, soft and tasted fresh.  

Asparagus with Bamboo Shoots ($20) has fresh asparagus with 2 rows of bamboo shoots on top.

The Seafood fried rice though not much large dice of seafood is enough to fill up all our stomach.

It wasn't the only bad taco though the shrimp, bistek and chorizo were also pretty bad. Literally no flavor what so ever with the fish and shrimp. Both were previously frozen, which is fine, if it wasn't basic Giant Eagle shrimp small and flavorless. Neither were transformed to provide any experience but disappointment. The Bistek and the chorizo were crazy salty. 

Sooo this isn't a Mexican restaurant where you go to eat tacos (it sounds crazy I know). The guac was OK too much tomato and not done tableside, despite it being named tableside guac. 

The place is too nice to give it a 2-star rating and I haven't had their main dishes which to their defense, looked pretty good and made me wish I didn't order my poop tacos. I had some serious food envy. I will return to try their main dishes, just don't go here for tacos because I'm scared you'll never go back.",2016-09-26 18:31:42

Oh wait, it makes sense now, they are still in business because drunk ASU kids eat food from one of the few places that is open 24/7.

Do not get chicken as a pizza topping, its breaded chicken. Pizza dough was gross, soggy, not done well. The sauce was super watery and tasted bad as well. We ordered garlic knots, and well, the same thing here. In fact, the garlic knots had no garlic, there was just some garlic sauce on the side and some marinara (tasted like crap). I think I had the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. I think frozen pizza tastes 10x better.

They have these alluring packages but if I knew I had to trade poor customer service and odd policies in exchange, I think I'd rather pay the higher price.

We protested seeing that as a rigid nonsensical policy but they insisted.  We offered to pay whatever extra sitting fee they wanted us to pay but they refused. We asked to speak to the manager and the same woman who had been yelling at us (yeah, we weren't sure why she was yelling either and in front of other customers) was in fact the manager.  I guess what I am unable to fathom is why you would take a customer who on their last visit bought a large sum in pictures and is now offering to pay to make amends for any perceived policy violation and you turn them away, refuse them at every turn, and basically lose the company a customer then and always.  The policy of which she spoke was not on the coupon, or posted, or online which is why I say let the BUYER BEWARE.  Stuff like that is just tricky and should be clear and posted.

My friends and I have made this place our yearly go to place during the summer. When summer comes around we have to go to duffs, I don't know how it started it just happened. 

They have many different flavours from the traditional mild, medium, hot, and bbq. But the flavours that I consistently get is the honey garlic, and the spicy honey garlic. Normally I am not a honey garlic wing fan b/c theres either too much sauce or its just too sweet. But these wings were very well done the sauce was just right. The spicy honey garlic sauce is even better b/c its got a little kick to them.

Now I have a couple of downfalls to this place.

The first being that I only like the wings and nothing else. The fries reminded me of fries that you cook at home, onion rings weren't that much better and I have had a few other things on the menu and they weren't that good.  

The second had to do with the size of the wings. The size of the wings were small, so small that the first batch that me and my friends ordered was 100 wings. You would think that 100 wings would satisfy 6 people, thats basically almost 16 wings a person. NO, it didn't, so we ordered another 50 wings just to be satisfied. And it's not like me and my friends are fat, well with the exception of one, haha, but it was pretty sad that we had to order that many wings to be satisfied. 

I may dislike this place b/c of the size of the wings and that the other ites aren't the greatest buts its that honey garlic sauce that will keep me coming back every summer.

Here's my story:  made a reservation, got a great seat by the window so we could people watch, table was ready when we got there [good], and then everything went wrong from here.

Took a friend of mine here from San Diego, I live close to Mandalay Bay, & I had a $50 Restaurant.com certificate, so it was a logical choice. My only downfall was I took her to Panevineo the night before so the dining experiences were extremely different.

They don't serve bread to start, but rather french fries. Interesting. Making America fatter, I dig it!  I have never seen this before, I'd rather eat these with my meal then prior, but whatever. Fries were great! I mean they weren't McDonald's fries but they were dang tasty.

Ordered 2 cocktails, one with a splash of cranberry [that never happened], limes in the cocktails were actually quite gross. They looked old and discolored they had been cut days prior and when we got brave enough to squeeze them into our drinks like 2 drops of juice came out.

We ordered a stripsteak, lamb chops, and brussel sprouts [see pix].  Lamp chops came out extremely under done since my friend is Greek and ordered them well done, her mom likes to over cook lamb and that's how she's used to eating it.  She put some brussel sprouts on her plate and then we proceeded to hunt for our waitress so we could get the problem rectified.  Friend starts  eating the side dish on her plate, flag down a bus boy, who tells another waiter, waiter comes and removes her plate from in front of her--doesn't even offer to get her a side plate so she can continue to nibble, but says they'll bring out more sprouts. 

Now she has no food, no bread, so she's staring at me. Naturally, I offer some of my meal to her she starts eating some of my steak [fine].  About 10 mins later lamb comes back ready to be eaten.....no sprouts???? About 10 mins after that round 2 of sprouts appear.  OK so their preparation is interesting on this as well, they shave the sprouts so they remind you of cole slaw????  Add bacon and then drowned them in butter. Like there is a pool of butter on the bottom of the dish. Not my favorite. My strip steak was ok, but it needed chimichurri.  There wasn't really a selection of sauces you could put on your steak much like you would see at STK or other fine places in this city.  Menu was rather limited and lacked depth to me.

No apologies for food, etc [fine] .  Bill finally comes, we've been here now for like an hour and a half, give them the restaurant.com certificate, and now the waitress has to find the manager to take it off.  ANOTHER 10 mins goes by, finally get the bill back, and thankfully we checked b/c they took the certificate off but then added 18% gratuity. OK. Our waitress was not worth 18%, I can guarantee you that, but fine.   What I didn't like was that she didn't mention that the tip was on there, which I HATE.  She was sat with a 10 to 15 top in the back, and 3 tables of 4.  THEN another table sat down of 6 men. They got the menu, waited a bit, no-one came to help them, they got up and LEFT--and I don't blame them.

So that was my story and my morale is: pick another steakhouse :) there's some really good ones in town.",2012-02-20 16:32:05

I ordered the Chicken Breast Kabob with rice ($10.75 plus tax). The meal consisted of  one grilled skewer of marinated boneless pieces of chicken breast with basmati rice, tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, shredded lettuce, coleslaw and a naan bread.

The dish was really good, the salad was crisp and fresh, the basmati rice was perfectly cooked, moist but not too moist and lightly seasoned.

The parking situation is annoying. There are very limited spaces in the lot and Hot n Juicy, which is always packed, is in the same plaza. You can park on the street adjacent, which is a very short walk away.",2015-06-30 05:20:50

I arrived at about 5:45pm and since I didn't have a reservation I had to wait until about 6:30pm for the next hibachi table that had room. No biggie I went to the bar, had glass of Cabernet and order the dragon roll. I mean it was happy hour and all and it was pretty reasonable so I had no problem waiting. 

Well lucky me gets seated with a family of 5 1/2. I say that because it was the two adults, three boys (the oldest was celebrating his 14th birthday) and a newborn baby girl, hence the 1/2. The father looked like a George Bush Jr clone, I KID YOU NOT! I had to do a double take that is how much this man resembled him. Let me just say that this family loves them so sushi. They ordered a ton of it along with their man courses. My kind of family! They were pretty comical that's for sure. 

Our server (who's name I never got until I got the bill) was friendly enough but I kinda felt like and after thought as she seemed to be more focused on the family. No biggie but even though my meal was ""free"" doesn't mean you have to treat me any different. I say ""free"" as it was free up to the first $30 and anything over you had to cover. Again no biggie. 

I ordered the Splash and Meadow which was steak and colossal shrimp. We started off with the miso soup which was really good, especially since it had fried onions and scallions mixed in the broth and wasn't overly salty like some miso soups can be. We received our salads very late, like we were in the middle of our hibachi presentation when we received them. I must say I was disappointed in the salad dressing as it was just blech. Almost like it was missing something and believe it or not, I was actually looking forward to my salad. Oh well. 

The fried rice cost extra and I didn't know it and had I realized it, I would have just ordered regular white rice. It is mixed with some chicken, vegetables, etc, which I understand the extra cost but honestly it tasted as if the rice was undercooked. It was still hard. Another disappointed but oh well. Now the shrimp appetizer along with the all the vegetables and the colossal shrimp that came with my meal were very good. The chef was generous with the shrimp because two of the kids didn't want any. I think they were pretty full from all the sushi that they ate. Now onto my steak. I was a little disappointed because I wanted it medium rare and it was medium done but still not too bad. By the time everything was actually ready, I was full as I had had that dragon roll while waiting for my table and had tasted everything as it was prepared. So needless to say I ended up taking my entire meal home. I spent about $20 total at the bar and for dinner including tip. I will probably be back again someday soon. 

Side note, I did notice that they have a sign for all you can eat sushi for $26.95 Sunday thru Thursday. I may have to go back and try that one day.",2010-04-03 22:55:41

We walked in and saw one other couple eating, and no one was there to greet or seat us. Finally a worker came out and still he didn't greet or welcome us in a friendly manner... but usually very authentic Asian restaurants can be that way, so that wasn't a huge deal.

After being seated, our waiter stood in front of us watching television... Didn't take our drink order until I asked if they had coconut juice. He said yes and my bf ordered a coke. I was astonished when they brought out a coconut with the wrapping still on it and some kind of sauce smeared on the exterior, and it was only half full... it creeped me out so I didn't drink it, plus they brought out a can of coke, no cup with ice.

I was still hopeful that the food would make up for the odd service... so I ordered the Vietnamese udon with pork and shrimp and my bf ordered the fish porridge. I was overwhelmed with disappointment when they brought over my bowl and I smelled a very unappetizing scent .. I have a very keen sense of taste and smell and something was clearly wrong with the dish.. Whether the pork was going bad or the shrimp.. I couldn't figure it out. I tried squeezing some lime into it and adding hot sauce but that scent wouldn't leave the dish no matter what I did. My bf's dish was too sweet for porridge and the fish was undercooked, plus... It seemed as though the fish wasn't fresh. I took a bite and had to spit it out :(

I think it's time for this restaurant to do some serious evaluating .. service-0, food-1, pricing-2... for its own survival. 

Worst part was that no one even checked on us the entire time so they couldn't even tell if we were having a good or miserable experience. They gestured for us to pay at cashier without even coming to the table or looking at us directly.. Rude! Needless to say, we went up, paid the $24, left a tip, and decided never to go there again..",2011-10-11 19:43:47

- taro nest with vege and chicken - jolly good!  Reminds me of the Hillman Restauran in Singapore.  Missing cashews in the dish.

- vege curry claypot - very good - lots of beans, okra - curry nicely spiced

- steamed prawns on a bed of steamed egg - sooooooo good!!

Ordered two Falafel wraps, a Fatoush Salad, a Falafel plate, A Mezza Plate - an appetizer consisting of Hummus, Baba Ghanoush and tabbouleh, a Saj wrap, a zatar and cheese manakeesh and an order of fries. Lot of food but costed $70 + which included taxes and tips. A bit too much for a casual restaurant. We have been to a few Mediterranean restaurants and this one tops it. 
The Saj wrap had cheese in a thin pita and no flavour. The falafel platter has nothing but falafels and some fixings that do nothing. Our other experience at other restaurants had so much to offer in a platter that it is a dinner. Not this one. The falafel wraps are dry as well and I think they skimp on fillings such as garlic sauce and tahini sauce. 

Not a memorable visit. The restaurant in spite of being not busy, when requested some pita, they forgot both times and had to wait. Requested again and got it after a few minutes. This repeated again during the main meal as well. Same thing for water. 
Asked for some hot sauce and same thing again and got in a tiny container. Disappointing!!!

That said, the restaurant decor was very modern with a jazz lounge vibe in the front with a beauty fire place and decently sized bar.  There are a few booths around the perimeter but a lot of 4 tops through the center of the room which make it extremely crowded and hard to maneuver.  

With those things in mind I was an expecting a great experience and awesome food, what I got didn't quite live up to that. In any new restaurant I expect a nominal level of kinks that need to be worked out, hostess greetings, waitstaff timing's and responses, food timings slightly slower.  This was all expected and received. What I didn't expect was the mediocre food, and maybe I ordered wrong but this seemed to be the sentiment throughout my party.  I really hate to say this but I have to, the waffle was horrible.  It was flat, chewy and I don't think quite cooked through.  I would unfortunately have to compare it to an Eggo freezer waffle.  The chicken was o.k, seasoned well.  The corn bread was dry and neither sweet nor savory, I had quite the difficulty cutting it open to butter which maybe says something. The grits were o.k as well, we went with cheddar and it seems that the grits weren't quite cooked slow enough or long enough to get that creamy texture naturally without the help of the cheese.

Overall I understand this restaurant is new and maybe I went on an off day.

Their main parking lot is small but they have an over flow lot on the next block down which is nice.

It was a half chicken baked on top of ratatouille and something that looked like a pancake. It all went together really well. 

The other dishes on the table were mussels, razor clam soup, oysters, veal and gnocchi.

-The L'Amuse-bouche:  a small bite that excited my palate.
Bread cart approached me and oh how I tried to so hard to limit myself to 3...we were given olive oil and salt sprinkled butter to enjoy with the bread.
-Soup: Delicate tofu velouté with lemon zest on warm seaweed gelée, smoked and caramelized eel.  This has layers and layers of flavor.
-Appetizer: langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage
-1st Main Course: Black Cod with a yuzu daikon velvet puree
**after the 1st main course, I was pretty full.
-2nd Main Course: Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour cherries, fresh almonds.  This dish was very delicious, but again, I was full at this point, I could not finish my plate.  I still had a piece of foie gras, and almost 2 pieces of duck left...I had to tap out.
**we ordered some hot tea to help us stay awake.  When we were ready, the cheese cart came by.
-Fromage:  So many different cheese!  Our awesome server brought out some fruits for us to enjoy with the cheese.  He was also kind enough to write down our favorite cheese on a piece of paper for our future reference.
-Dessert 1: Strawberry Daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks - yummy yummy joy joy for my tummy.  Who knew pop rocks will elevate such dessert...GENIUS.  I loved it.
-Dessert 2:Raspberry milk mousse, spiced raspberry sorbet, earl grey puffed rice krispies and pistachio foam.  Ahhh, the pop rocks...oh wait, I was going to write about the Dessert 2...it was different.
-Mignardises: Finally, the dessert cart.  Unlimited amount of macarons..all the items on this cart was just delicious.  Our server knew how stuffed we were so he packed us two small boxes filled with delicious chocolate delights in them.

The menu is extensive and provides many choices. I ordered the Okonomiyaki fries and the Smoked Salmon pasta with combo. The fries were amazing and came in large portions (easily enough for a meal). The soup that came in the combo was a potato chowder which was also very good. The pasta was cooked al dente, just as everyone else has stated in their review. The sauce was good and not too salty. However, my friend, who ordered the clam miso pasta, said his was way too salty and struggled to finish his meal. 

We ordered a slice of cake to share (came with the combo) - green tea and red bean. The cake tasted strongly of green tea (yum!) and was slightly sweet, which was a great way to end the meal after all the carbs and oil in the pasta. The service is great here and the food is above average. I would come back to try some of their other menu items.",2015-06-01 14:43:48

If I could rate this place just on oysters alone, I'd give it 5 stars. The drinks were created with creativity and personal attention. Mixoligist David Steven Stephen English told us all about the restaurant and the concept that Chef Krohmer was aiming for as he handcrafted our drinks for us. And while the chef and owner has succeeded in some areas, others will hopefully improve with time.

Let's talk about the good first - the Oysters. The daily oyster selection is posted on the specials board. The prices are extremely fair ($1, $1.50, $2) for different varieties. They were extremely crisp and fresh tasting and the sauces added a lot to the flavor as well, even though they aren't necessary. I had literally nothing bad to say to this point.

So why am I giving it three stars for now? I think primarily it was the fact that we had a lot of trouble finishing the Chirashi Bowl - and don't get me wrong, we weren't stuffed or anything, it just lacked in both flavor and texture. The rice was overly bland - it couldn't help carry the delicate flavor of fish because it lacked in vinegar flavor. Most of the fish was decent, but the Ikura was severely deflated and/or popped. They looked unattractive and didn't taste any better.

Another dish that disappointed for me was the Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice. Now I get that you're trying to tone the kimchi flavor down to please the taste buds not so familiar with traditional Korean kimchi (thus, Fusion?), but the flavor just wasn't there. I mean I'm Korean and I've had kimchi fried rice probably 50 times in my life, and I wouldn't have put the word kimchi in the title. If you're going to put Kimchi Fried Rice in the name, I feel like you're going to have to risk the kimchi being a little strong. That being said, the mushrooms were a great addition, and the pork belly was really nicely done, if only lacking a bit of flavor. I wasn't a fan of how they were sitting on the side, almost as if an aside to the dish. I think I'd love it if it was chopped in and cooked with the rice to push that texture throughout the dish. If they can incorporate a little stronger flavor in this dish, it'll be amazing.

For me, the Yuzu Chicken Wings were the most intriguing of the dishes I had. The light airy and yet crispy texture was unlike any that I've had to that point. However, as others have said before, I didn't taste Yuzu in the otherwise delicious sauce.

Another disappointment for us was the Japanese Cheesecake - others had described it as fluffy and delicate - but to me it was thick and dense. What it was, however, was not overly creamy or heavy, which I do appreciate. However, the texture didn't really come out the way I think was intended. I did enjoy the overall flavor of the dessert though.

I love the decor and the atmosphere that they've created here. The staff was friendly, and the Chef was kind enough to talk to us and allow us to voice our opinions on his food. I'm actually looking forward to trying more of his food in hopes that it can reverse some of the impressions we got during our first visit. That being said, we're already coming back for oysters, and probably all the time.",2015-04-09 23:17:52

Anyway, in all seriousness, I tried this place last night on new year's eve. They were packed. Around 13 tables inside, and a sushi bar. The sushi bar chef is actually Japanese, and his wife works as a waitress. On a any given day they have 4 waitresses, but last night, they were so busy I think I saw 5 or 6. There are 13 tables inside the restaurant. spacious and clean bathrooms. 

Ordered off their Chinese menu (At the back of the regular menu):
1. Egg noodle stir fried with soy sauce $9.50. Pretty big portion. Nothing too spectacular but definitely tasty, sesame, onion stir fried egg noodle in soy sauce. 
2. seafood tofu clay pot $16. Very good, but SUPER salty! I did not have enough rice to finish this dish because the salt content was so heavy. The seafood was generous portion and the tofu is not the fresh type but the tofu puff type, which I like. Great sauce, but again, too salty.
All the waitresses here work together, you will not have the same waitress who took your order to bring out your food. A different waitress brought out our food and she mistakenly took our sea food clay pot to the table next to ours. She of course sincerely apologized, but I thought the logistics could have been worked out better.
3. Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce $10. This I thought was kind of overpriced, I mean I guess so is the seafood tofu clay pot if you were really getting down to the nitty gritty. The Chinese broccoli were cut up to smaller pieces so it's easier to eat, it was very tasty, but there weren't that much on the plate. Any non-noodle dishes that are not appetizers come with 1 small cup of rice, you get a choice of 1. egg fried rice, 2. white rice or 3. brown rice.

Service was very friendly and perky, definitely way superior than typical Chinese or Asian joints. Nothing sketchy here. They don't try to scam you, or do things that make you question why they did certain things. The whole experience was very comfortable. Lighting was great, seats were nice and so is the dining table. Overall nice ambiance. 

I don't know many restaurants in Charlotte where you can order such authentic Chinese dishes, oh I was told the head chef here is from HK. However, this is the only authentic Chinese cuisine in Charlotte area I am able to locate that actually has good service and great ambiance.",2016-01-01 16:54:25

The lady at the cashier greeted us and asked us if it was for here or to go. We asked for it to go and she gave us time to sit down and look at the menu for a bit. My fiancè got a 3 meat combo plate with Meat Jun, BBQ Chicken, and Short Ribs. I ordered a 2 meat combo with Meat Jun and BBQ Chicken. After paying we had to pick our 2 sides, I got bean sprout and cucumber kimchee, and my fiancè got sweet potatoes and pancake. We ordered a side of Japche. 

Wait time was short, we waited 10-15 minutes and as we left the cashier thanked us for coming in. So customer service was awesome, loved how she was very patient with us and really nice. However, taste wise was not up to par as I expected. The meats were delicious! Their rice was wet and soggy, ruined the main dish. As for their sides, the sprouts and cucumber kimchee had no taste except the kimchee was spicy. That's it. The Japche was kind of the same, you could taste it but it lacked flavor. Korean food from my experience has always been savory and filled with amazing texture. Sadly, our dishes weren't like that. 

Our food was about $37 including tax:
$11.95 for the 2 meat combo plate
$12.95 for the 3 meat combo plate 
$8.95 for the Japche

In my opinion the price was okay - marching it portion wise but taste wise it was not. If their rice was not soggy and wet it wouldn't have ruined the main dish.",2017-01-19 22:00:59

Fries came with the burger (you can sub onion rings or some salads) and were all-you-care-to-eat, like Red Robin. The fries were just OK- they tasted a lot like In-N-Out's. 

They do have veggie and turkey burger options. 

Hubby chose the veggie tacos which were very fresh, with avocado, corn, black beans, red and yellow bell peppers, and zucchini on soft whole wheat tortillas. On the side was an ""island slaw"" which was vinegar based (maybe a little too much so) but very fresh with cabbage, carrots, jicama, red bell pepper, and green onions.

The staff, from Front Desk to Therapists (Tina!) and techs are all knowledgeable, caring & super efficient. Being injured and having complications it was tough going at times to even make appts but they helped me every step of the way. Massage therapy is added and Shaighleen truly gives the best deep tissue I've ever had. 

I ""graduated"" (diploma & all in last week Dec '11) after 6 months of work and healing there, I opted for the Post Rehab Pilates Classes to keep my spine healthy. First, I had a Private Session with Linda, she is very kind and patient and assessed & coached me regarding cues, etc. Now, I'm in a semi private class with maximum 6 people. 

Still seeing Shaighleen bi-weekly for therapeautic massage and she is just magnificent, knows exactly where to work and does so without attacking my back and neck. Deep tissue without hurting me = amazing.

Was it just because it was Happy Hour? Food was still GREAT . . . even more than great . . . . but WHOA the service sure lacked . . . . actually it sucked. 

I've eaten dinner here; I've been to parties here . . . . service and food were way over the top Fantastic . . . but I've never been to Happy Hour. And unless someone tells me that Peter has stepped up his game . . . I won't be back for HH again.  And it won't be my first choice for dinner again. Too many other good choices in Scottsdale. 

Details: When we arrived it was early. The work crowd still hadn't hit the door. There were lots of empty seats at the bar and in the lounge area. Our server announced that he was doing double duty -  serving and bar-tending. Ok,so I know a good barkeep can do both. I wasn't worried. 

Searsucker is the kind of place that hires only the best. Customer Service is as important as their vittles. The server was friendly and one of those that never writes anything down, which is fine, if you have a good memory. He apparently did not. He returned several times to ask again about drinks. And  . . . don't dare ask for something that was out of the norm . . . like please no ice in my Peter Rabbit. (Geez, where's Owen when I needed him? Highball glass? I think not! Owen taught me that it should be served in a martini glass when it has no ice.) 

When he arrived back at our table with a PR just overflowing with ice and took one look at my face, he took the drink back. I didn't have to say anything. When I got it back it was sans ice, but also it was obvious how little drink had been in there. If you've ever scooped ice out of a drink, or coffee, some of the drink goes with it. So my PR now was slightly less than half a glass worth. Even at HH prices that was a tad extravagant. I would have been willing to pay full price for a full drink.

Second drink order? Sure. I only had 1/2 a drink the first time. Came with ice. Ugh! 

And the food order?  It took forever to get it right. I just ordered the HH shrimp cocktail. It was scrumptious, as usual. But server-poo kept trying to give me tacos too. Didn't order; didn't want. Perhaps he needed a small notepad to write down the orders? Not writing it down only works, if you can remember who ordered what!

And then the bills. Oh, lord help us. We were there two hours for a couple of drinks and a few appetizers. Had a 7 o'clock movie to catch. The bill-paying episode was  . . . .oh, shoot . . . not even worth discussing. Just suffice it to say . . . . Peter & Brian need to work on their service. And until they do, I am no longer running around telling everyone I know how WONDERFUL Searsucker is . . . I'm from Missouri . . . the Show-me state. Prove it!",2013-06-14 23:08:48

She graciously checked the system to see if they had his size at another location in Toronto. I liked the SA because she was very grounded and down to earth and totally related with us.

Now that they've opened a location in Central Phoenix, I have no more excuses.  My girlfriend and I were looking for an ice cream spot on a Saturday but we've already been to Churn and Mary Coyle's just closed its doors.  Boom, Sweet Republic time.  Their new location occupies what used to be Asahi Bakery, just a a few doors down from the iconic Golden Phoenix Chinese building.

The flavor varieties here are more unique and funky than any ice cream parlor I've been to in Arizona.  They've got signature ice cream combos, milkshakes, floats, as well as a gazillion ways to customize your own ice cream and toppings.  Among some of the more unique we found were earl grey tea, and honey lavender (my girlfriend ended up getting a scoop of each).  I was torn so I asked the girl behind the counter for a recommendation.  Without hesitation she told me their signature sundae was their Toffee Banofi.  2 scoops of ice cream (I went with Madagascar Vanilla and Salted Caramel), almond toffee brittle, bananas, caramel sauce and whipped cream in a waffle bowl.  Total price for both of our items including tax and tip was $15.  

I really liked the honey lavender my girlfriend had.  The earl grey was also unique, though not really my thing.  Both of her scoops tasted very light.  As for the Toffee Banofi, this thing was a grand slam.  For starters, the presentation is pretty amazing (and almost intimidating) as they stack the toppings high.  I finished it, though I'm sure its meant to be shared by two.  The salted caramel was a perfect accompaniment for the hearty chunks of toffee.  And they didn't skimp on the bananas either.  The waffle bowl was was of the best waffle bowls I've ever had (seriously).  Not sure whats in their batter but that alone will keep me coming back here.

So yes, Alton Brown, Time, Food & Wine and Thrillist were dead on about this place (and the Toffee Banofi).  Great ice cream, great toppings, great variety, local ingredients, environmentally conscious.  The Scottsdale location is where it all began, but this new location in central Phoenix is where I first fell in love with Sweet Republic.",2014-10-05 16:16:57

Also, I saw the owner, Lisa, bringing coffee to those who were sitting waiting which I thought was a really thoughtful touch to ease the wait time.

On both visits, I went for the Light Breakfast of sorts which was one pancake with a fried egg on top and then ordered a side of home fries.   On the second visit I upgraded the regular pancake for a banana and chocolate chip pancake.  That decision was definitely NOT a mistake!  Well, maybe a mistake for my waistline but not my taste buds.   Everything on the menu looks great and you get a ton of food for a great price.  I love, love, love the home fries.

And if you're unfamiliar with Fran's they're a known staple for breakfast and diner type foods. Their most popular location being on College and has expanded across the city.This location has been here for a couple of months and is located in a very cliché area. It is surrounded by steakhouses and close to the busy business downtown core. So is it out of place or perfect placement, debatable.  Either way we were in the location so we got a table for a weekday dinner.

The interior is an upgrade to their typical decor. It's been catered to fit in with the surrounding restaurants and clientele. We order quickly as we were starving. I got the fran's legendary banquet burger with all the typical toppings (ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles and onions) with home fries.  Angela got Monte Cristo which is french toast with ham, turkey and swiss that's grilled with home fries. My sis got the chicken parm sandwich with fries. We also got a basket of onions rings to start off with which sits well with the sis. =P. The wait wasn't bad at about 10 mins before the onion rings came and another 5-10 for the rest of the entrees. Our waitress was all really nice and there's a number of lcds to catch the local game.

The onion rings were the big pub style version with large onion rings. My sis is more of the ""Harvey's"" type where the batter and onion rings are infused well together striking a good balance. She doesn't like it when the onions are strongly present. And I have to say they're okay but I too prefer ""harvey's"" type of onion rings.  My burger was surprisingly good. I mean I wasn't expecting much so maybe that helped. But it was a solid burger and they cooked it well too. Wasn't dry and it did in fact remain as a moist patty.  And home fries as side, yess pleasee. One of the benefits of going to fran's?  Home fries as a side option and they weren't bad at all.

For the ladies, angela enjoyed her monte cristo.  Was it a fatty choice, ohh you betcha. Not only was it fatty in nature but she also chose to pour a fair amount of maple syrup on top. Another unexpected surprise was just how well the ham, turkey and swiss went with the also moist french toast.  I myself would have wanted more meat, but Angela seemed happy with the amount. And tho 100% fatty and non heart-attack friendly, the maple syrup did definitely help to bring all the taste to a full circle. I too am guilty of enjoying more with the maple syrup. My sis's chicken parm was definitely wayyy too big for her. She's a tiny eater unlike myself and Angela.  She ended up having to pack about half her dinner. The chicken parm wasn't bad and was definitely saucy.  But it wasn't anything special and tho saucy and filled with cheese (thumbs up), I somehow just expected more. As well her fries weren't very good. I know she ended wishing she had gotten a salad or home fries instead.

Overall, fran's was not bad at all. The price is manageable and it's in an expensive area of downtown. Having fran's as an option is definitely nice for peeps working dt and want to have something before heading home. Yess it's a diner so definitely not the healthiest and yes it's greasy, but I liked it.  The only dish which was a little let down was the chicken parm, but still it wasn't horrible. Just average at best. So I welcome fran's to a location that needs food that isn't starting at $20-30 a dish. It's in a very cliché and business oriented area, so Fran's against all odds, I hope you make it.",2011-05-10 03:16:48

Our food was done in a reasonable amount of time and delivered to the table. 

The Kung Pao chicken was good to very good.   Light on spiciness despite ordering extra but they did have the sambal olek sauce available to spice things up.  

The chicken teriyaki was good.  Even the toddler with us had some and liked it.

We also had a bit of confusion.  I attempted to get two orders of pad thai; one to go and one to eat there.  Unfortunately I did not review the order at the ordering station.  When I wondered where the second order of paid thai was when our food was delivered I checked the receipt and noted it was not there.  Pei Wei brought us a second order anyway with out charging.

-fMO-TMYvaygUPXEog3bsw,0cG35-H4SbjjTTSlNoK3fw,MGMFNqzpCnwKNDkqyyWBbg,4,1,0,1,"Dave & Busters delivers on fun. We waited for a while for this location to open since it's closer to where I live.  There's lots of games, a dining area and bar with big screen tv's everywhere.  It is kid friendly,  but you have to be 21 and older after 9 p.m. to enter. 

One option you can do is an Eat and Play combo. With these, you get a discount on your food when you get a game card with your dinner, but the menu is limited to certain items on that deal. I suggest this if you plan to eat and play. I was eating healthier that night and got salmon with wilted spinach and substituted the seasonal vegetables (broccoli) for the rice. My husband got a steak and shrimp noodle dish. For my food, everything is covered in butter. On the salmon, I enjoyed it along with the peppery seasoning. The spinach and broccoli were too buttery for me to enjoy. A manager stopped by to ask how everything was and I told him about the veggies which I already ate. He offered to cook more without butter, but I was full at that point. Now I know to order it without butter in the future. It was good food. Not the best salmon I ever had, but satisfying.

The games are a lot of fun. If you don't do Eat &Play, you can purchase game cards at the front or at a kiosk. Keep your card for future visits as there is an activation fee for new cards. It is really noisy though.  Even on busier nights, there's always something available to play. I appreciate this. There's classic games like skee ball and hoops. But there's a decent selection of arcade like games like Batman, Mariokart and a new Justice League game. Some games give you tickets you can exchange for prizes. And the prizes are decent from toys, candy, shot glasses and stuffed animals to DC Comics and Nintendo novelty items, headphones, Bluetooth speakers and more. I'm personally enjoying my Pac Man mug that illuminates dots and characters when hot drinks are added to the cup. And if you want to save up for something, the points stay on your card so you can come back and continue to add points. 

There are deals on certain days. We enjoy half-price Wednesday.  All games and drinks are half price. Also, most receipts have a survey you can take to get a code for a free appetizer or Buy $10, Get $10 game card on a future visit. You can also get deals for signing up for their email and registering your card. 

D&B's really has something for everyone.",2017-11-02 17:43:31

Yes, for sure, you're able to get a lot of what you need at these particular stores, but what you don't get is a sense of theme and direction in the stacks of books.  In a big franchise-y book store, books are thrown together by genre, sorted by author, and that's pretty much it.  Large numbers of copies available for a decent price.  What is missing is a bit of soul.

Pages gives you the sense that you're going to find something in there that is decently cutting-edge and most certainly not available in larger book stores.  The direction of the store is definitively modern, newer titles being showcased, but definitely with an alternative flavour.  To give you a sense of the type of book you can uncover, my last purchase was a book called ""Meet Mr. Product"", an anthology of corporate cartoon icons from the Michelin Man to the Jolly Green Giant.  What started out as a neat novelty book quickly became a page turner of historical significance.

The style of books on site align to that sense of ""You'll probably not find this elsewhere, and if you do, enjoy the one copy that will be available.""  Not so here.",2008-09-15 01:19:49

There are traditional breakfast items like oatmeal, omelets, and french toast, and also brunch-type items like breakfast burritos and paninis.  Vegetarians and carnivores will have plenty of options.  We ordered the almond french toast which was drizzled with lemon creme and topped with strawberries and also the apple panini which had cream cheese, raisins, cranberries and other goodies and came with a side of fresh fruit.  Both were more than enough to fill us up, and we also shared a side of the homefries which were very tasty.  The french toast was fantastic as well, and both meals were unique and delicious.  

Price: The overall cost of breakfast was slightly above average but the variety of ingredients and great taste of the food made up for it.

Drinks: The coffee was good, and the Almond Coca Mocha was fantastic.  Coca Cafe also makes their own juices, and we tried the carrot-ginger-orange juice.  It was very natural/healthy tasting.  There were also smoothies to try but we stopped at two drinks each.

Atmosphere: There is a bigger dining room in the front and a smaller, narrow dining area in the back next to 38th street.  The back room has large windows that let in sunshine and fresh air.  The back room is primarily tables for two, and the tables aren't too close together.  There aren't a lot of tables, and they fill up quick.  We parked on Butler Street and didn't have to walk far.  We tried Coca Cafe on a weekend morning once in the past and we were offered a 45 minute wait for a table, so we left.  On a weekday the restaurant was still full but we didn't have to wait for a table.

The homemade food was delicious, but we waited quite a while for it and had our coffee refilled only once, at the very end of the meal.  The waitress was friendly but seemed rushed and slightly frazzled.  The restaurant was busy, but we've seen it busier.

Anyway, the combo meals are on the high side but pretty generous for the amount of food you get. Basically, you cook your food on the grill on your table. The veggies, noodles, meat, etc. comes out one by one. One thing I did NOT like at all is that we had to eat our meals without rice because the server said we can only have rice at the end.

Excuse me, huh? What? I'm Asian. I need my rice with my meal. I don't eat rice after. I eat rice during. She was also in control of what gets cooked, how it's cooked, etc. We asked things multiple times because she kept forgetting or she was just by herself and didn't have time to everything at once.

A tip for those on the lawn seat, the seats on the sides of the lawn actually have a better view than the seats in the middle of the lawn.

And the food is spot on - at least what we tasted, which included a flavorful pizza, a salad, and a burger (good, but the least successful of the lot due to under-seasoning).

But it is the ""little"" things which differentiate Tavern Americana from the crowd.  For example, the beer was properly chilled and poured correctly (just the right head).  For example, when we ordered a half salad and split that, they brought it in two bowls with a separate dressing cup for each.  And, I didn't have to ask for ketchup (home-made I believe).

AYCE is kind of hard when its busy just because it starts to get slow with the food coming out. One time it was busy and the guy just told us we can just order what we wanted (usually a 2 plate max at a time). Thus, we didn't have to wait everytime we were done to order and get our food.

They also have shave ice! You can add condensed milk or ice cream to your shave ice! mmm!!",2010-06-15 17:29:04

 I had 15 beef and curry dumplings. It was not bad to eat but not something I want to eat in the future. The curry and beef mix with soja sauce dont go well together. 

However, the second dumplings were chicken and mushrooms. I heard from my friend, the mushrooms werent there. 

Overall, this place served homemade dumplings. I would give this 3 stars for a first time. The customer service could use a little more work since we had To call a waitress To be served. I believe this place could be pretty good.",2018-03-02 03:49:57

They have craft beer on tap. After walking around for a couple hours, our beer tasted good!

True to its name, there are pictures of celebrity mugshots on the walls. It was fun trying to figure out who they were.

We shared an order of Mac 'N' Cheese Fritters. They were good ... they could have used some bacon to liven them up, though.

We both got a pound of wings. Mine were with medium sauce and Gord's were dusted with Cajun spice. We found them overcooked and dry ... maybe because they are ""baked, fried and then sauteed"". Plus they were small (there were 13 to a pound ... I'd rather less but bigger).

Our server was Chantal. She was funny and sarcastic and took good care of us.

Chris, the chef/owner is extremely mellow and easy to communicate with.  He sent us a suggested menu and it was perfect.  No negotiating, no revisions needed.  The day of the event was very smoothly run.  The waitstaff was fantastic.  They were attentive yet felt invisible at the same time.  The food was very good and presentation excellent.  It is also great that they are BYOB, which of course makes for a less expensive tab.  The cost of the entire event was extremely reasonable.

5/5 stars for pet friendliness. You can bring your dog and hang out at one of the many outdoor seating areas. 
4/5 stars for atmosphere. JJ's has tons of outdoor seating and is great for watching games on the big screen or ogling the many healthy people on a jog past the bar. 
3/5 for food. Food was basic bar fare. I had the fresh avocado BLT with tator tots as my main course (honestly, I don't know why everyone doesn't serve tots - they are so delish), along with a taste of a chicken quesadilla and the bacon jalapeño hush puppies. Again - edible food, but nothing to write home about.
3/5 for service. Our service was a bit slow for a Tuesday night, especially considering the place wasn't packed. And our server may have been a bit confused as when I asked for a drink menu, she said there wasn't one, but then later brought out the condiment tray with a drink menu on it. Yes, that happened. If I hadn't already tucked into my vodka soda I may have swapped. Next time....

All in all, go to JJ's for the atmosphere and to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. Just know going in that the delicious beverages may lower your inhibitions and there is no shortage of greasy treats on the menu. I mean, funnel cake fries? Yes, please.

I would have given the place 5 stars, but the place is run poorly.  There were about 10 people in front of me, and I had to wait in line about 30 minutes.  It should not take 30 minutes to make food for 10 people, although they were getting call in orders as well.  I can blow through a line of 20 people in 10 minutes with myself and my employee.  Whoever designed that place was a nut job.  The 3 employees were working hard, and fast, but they have to go over to the cold bar, then over to the grill, then over to the fridge, etc.  Then at the end when they take the money, the register should be right there, but it's against the back wall.

The acoustics allowed us to hear the background music and we were able to hear each other talking in soft voices. Almost all the tables were taken yet the setting was very relaxing.

We started with an Old Fashion which was just perfect. The ""supper club"" feel of the bar just called for an old standard. We both ordered off the ""Restaurant Week"" menu. All the of the foods offered for restaurant week were also on their regular menu. We could see what a great bargain we were getting and portions were quite generous. $25 for dinner was a real steal. 

For an appetizer, my dining partner had the Caesar Steak Tartare, which was presented with Caesar dressing, Parmesan cheese, egg yolk and crostini. It was quite delicious and lovely to look at. I had the Iceberg Wedge which was spared the common mistake of overly dressing the salad. It was crisp and all the little additions,radish,bacon,tomatoes, and red onion truly complemented the butter-milk blue cheese dressing. We were off to a great start.

My friend ordered the Pan-Seared Walleye, that was simply served with smashed red potatoes and green beans. She liked every aspect of the presentation and the fish was cooked to perfection.

I had the ""Beef Stroganoff"" which was really fresh tagliatelle pasta with braised short ribs, roasted shiitake mushrooms, peas, red wine sauce, and horseradish sour cream. It was the perfect dish for a winter's evening but I am not sorry that I chose this dish. The short ribs were tender and the meat was falling apart without being overcooked. The pasta soaked up the gravy and my leftovers held up well after sitting in the fridge overnight.

Now for the Piece de Resistance, dessert. We both had the Cold Fashioned Ice Cream Cocktail made with Korbel brandy, orange, cherry, and a dash of bitters blended
with vanilla ice cream and topped with whipped cream. What can I say... a perfect dessert before heading out the door into the summer heat. All in all, a very Wisconsin meal.

Having come here in the past and being less than impressed, we stopped by before a show at the Royal Alex (due to location and time constraints) to grab a quick bite with really really low expectations. Even still, they managed to disappoint.

Well the nachos are terrible. Served flat and sparse they are really expensive for the small quantity you get. They arrived cold and with minimal toppings. And didn't come with guac as requested.

Which leads to the capabilities of our server....she had none. It took me 5 minutes to explain to her that we didn't want the chili sauce on the nachos but on the side if possible. She still left with a confused look. She offered the guac like three time (all three of which I said YES and it still came without). She NEVER once came to check on us. My boyfriend ordered a basket of fries afterwards. That took over 20 minutes to come out. Again cold. We wanted to tell her to ask for a new batch and also to bring ketchup the next time around.

If you have never experienced Boba you may not be too apatized based on the description. Boba is black flavorless tapioca pearls in some kind of drink, often a tea or milk mixed with juice.

The straw is think enough to accommodate Boba beads going up it. 

It is not for every one, but it is unique, fun and relatively cheap. This place has a few sofas, a fish tank and a computer for the Internet. However I usually take my drink and go to the adjacent Asian supermarket and marvel at the unique and strange food items as I enjoy my drink.

It's fairly a small cozy restaurant, a mom and pop place with who I assume was the waitress their daughter. This is just a guess. I ordered the combo chicken and beef kabob (kubideh) the portions were good with a roasted tomato and a roasted jalepeno, it came with a chunk of raw onion which I wish was roasted like the tomato. The flavor was very good. This place was a bit more pricey compared to other persian restaurants in Las Vegas for their entrees.

I also ordered the egg plant dip, kashkeh bademjoon. It was tasty and I know a very healthy dish. It came with 2 warm pita bread but my only complaint is that it should have come with at least 3 or 4 pita bread in my opinion to finish off the dip. The bread and dip ratio was off, not enough bread for the dip. Also $2 extra charge for 2 more pita bread which I thought was a bit just for bread. When it wasnt house made.

Overall a good meal with tip my meal was $39 (20 percent tip) The service was very good.",2016-05-01 07:18:44

* is the foodie in him finally coming out?  what's next, a Yelp account?! *

Only an hour has passed since I wolfed down a BLT sammy, when we found ourselves standing outside Mesa Grill.  We actually called the day before about placing a reservation, but it was the Labor Day weekend, so they were booked solid.  We still went here to take a chance. 

As luck would have it, there were seating available at the lounge area.  No sooner than 5 minutes after seating ourselves, our friendly server gave us the menus and told us that we could also order from the dinner menu.

Sweet!

We made a conscious decision to order just one prix fixe dinner to share, since we were not entirely starving yet. 

For starters, the blue cornmeal pancake filled with BBQ'd duck, topped with habanero chile - star anise sauce.  The presentation is pretty with the different colored sauces and every bite is delicious. 

Next came the New Mexican spice rubbed tenderloins with the bourbon-ancho chile sauce.   You know Bobby Flay has got a thing for heat -- the meat itself is peppery-spicy, but the sauce is not too overpowering, just a subtle kick in the end.  Served with a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter on top.  Oh. So. Yummy. 

Lastly for dessert, the roasted strawberry/gooseberry shortcake with vanilla whip cream is passable.  Flay is not a pastry chef ok. 

Our cactus pear margaritas aren't all as everyone hyped it to be, although the bartender didn't skimp on the alcohol, which I guess justifies the $13 cocktail price.  Service is nice and very attentive, replacing our plates and cutlery with every course.  Although it was a bit awkward eating at the lounge area, trying to balance your plate on your lap, we enjoyed Mesa Grill's dishes for a bargain, since it was restaurant week in Vegas.

I'm looking forward to the next time I come back here, coz there WILL be one.",2009-09-16 08:30:34

I've waited way too long for my order on a week night, with  the staff not acknowledging my wait or giving me an update. I even witnessed a customer walk in and order minutes after I ordered and receive their food first. 

The menu was down on the tv the day I visited, and the printed menus don't even adequately display the choices (like their 6 oz meat option). 

The prices are way too high, and everything is an expensive add on. 2 bucks to add in zucchini? When they charged me 50 cents to use my debit card that's when I decided this place lost my business for good, out of principle alone. You're charging me to receive money straight out of my checking account? With how much you charge to add on a cheap vegetable? That's greedy of you. I think you can afford to eat the processing fee.

I signed up for their text coupons on my last visit. The door had a sign to do it. The guy who rang me up looked at my phone like he had no clue what I was showing him, and like he'd never seen it before. 

I can't believe they'd call themselves a healthy food cafe when they aren't even allergy-friendly. I told them that one of our dishes was for a soy allergy and they put it in the same bag as another dish with teriyaki sauce, which was dripping into the bag.

Both spring rolls were pretty standard in taste compared to other pho restaurants. The regular pho broth was good but not as flavorful as some other pho places. Both broths were not piping hot and were verging on warm to hot which could have vastly improved the tasting experience. Maybe the noodles were cold and they just threw them in the soup which would have cooled the temperature of the overall broth.

Cleanness: They are one of those restaurants that have all the chopsticks and spoons out. Kind of unsanitary since I've seen what people have done to them in the past.

I am so glad we purchased the 30$ all year round pass to Red Rock.  There are so many trails to hit in this area.  Creeks springs canyons and loops.  Rocks to climb and scramble.  From easy .5 mile strolls to sprawling difficult 11 mile round trip excursions.  The drive is 13 miles long This is one of the best natural places to visit in car or on foot in Vegas.  Given the 10 - 15 degree weather drop, it can be one of the greatest escapes for your mind and body or soul (if you believe in that sort of thing).

You would need a permit to rock climb.  Many anchors are already set in the most popular spots.  Everyone we have encountered on the loops have been in great moods and of all ages.  You get complete descriptions of each trails rating of elevation and duration before ascending.  Most walks are maintained respectively and simple to navigate.  No problemo as long as you bring enough water and are up for the challenge.

The visitors center has a few out door exhibits that explain the natural phenomenon of the canyon in contemporary museum style.  You'll find many knowledgeable people who are helpful to explain the information that you can learn about Red Rock in the visitors center.  A very nice gift shop is there where many native objects and souvenirs can begot.  They close the visitors center at 4 or 4:30 I believe.

Majestic, beautiful, peaceful, awe inspiring, neato, super cool.  All of these words I'm sure you may read in all the other reviews, and they are just about right too.  I think I'll use NEATO.

Our first taste was the legendary biscuits which were soft on the inside and crunchy toasted on the outside, with a hint of cheesy herby goodness, brought to us by the handsome and mild-mannered Brandon. He would take good care of us throughout the evening.
 
We got half a dozen steamed oysters on the half shell, a bit dinky but the horseradish was amazing. I'd go for the raw ones next time and hope for bigger oysters.

Next came the salad which was your basic Caesar, however nicely shaved slivers of parmesan on top which was a nice flavorful touch, the dressing was light and not too salty.

I should pause to say they have a pretty extensive drink menu for those who like to get their foofoo fruity, margarita or tropical drink on, you are covered, as well a decent compliment of beers, wines, and standards along with virgin non-alchy drinks and smoothies.

We got the Ultimate Feast and split it, it did not disappoint, the lobster tail, crab legs and fan tail ( aka scampi ) were great! Along with it came some yummy wild rice pilaf and mashed potatoes and a compliment of sauces for each thing, buttery sauce, seafood cocktail sauce and seared lemon which were well paired. Everything cooked just perfect. 

Would have finished it off with an awesome desert but wanted to go for froyo so off we went. Total was around  $50 which ain't bad, we could have easily doubled that with all the yummy stuff on the menu.

Anyways, we showed up at around 7:00pm, and were told that they didn't have a table for us, but we could wait at the bar and they would let us know when a table opened up, which we were ok with. 1 hour passed and we went to ask the staff if anything had become available and they said no, but it would soon. Another hour passed and we went to go ask again. Again, we were told we would be seated ""soon"". Finally at around 10:00pm we were given a table for ""dinner"". They took our orders and to nobody's surprise, the food (which wasn't good) took another half hour to come out... and not even all of it. Three of our friends' meals were brought out after the rest of the group had already finished eating. Also while bringing out the food, the server dropped fries all over my friend, the table, and the floor which weren't cleaned up until we had finished eating for some reason, although that was kind of expected by that point... At least there were fries. 

After asking multiple times, we were finally able to speak to a manager and explain that we had waited over three hours (some of us four) to receive our dinner. He agreed (not without difficulty) to compensate us for our meals. This was a big success and probably the highlight of the night. It was nice to see that they at least had some sense of customer service.

After that adventure, we were finally able to play the games - which we could've been playing the whole time if they didn't keep telling us to wait because we ""would be seated soon"". It was sad that the whole dinner disaster spoiled the night because the games were actually fun. 

If you do decide to come here, I would recommend to just come for the games. Eat somewhere else before or after.",2018-04-22 05:40:59

I came here today for lunch with Jon S. and our friend. We were quickly seated at a table in a mostly full dining room. Got our menus and our server came by soon enough to take our drink orders. Per other yelpers, I had the Turkish coffee with some water. Jon S. ordered some babaganush (btw excuse my spelling for this whole review, their menu isn't online so I have no idea how to spell these things). HEED THE ADVICE OF THOSE who say splurge the extra 30 something cents and get the handmade pita. It is worlds better than what you would get otherwise. 

So we munched on the babag and pita and decided what to get. Our friend had been there once before and she got one of the veggie sandwiches, and because there's so much on the menu, Jon and I each got the combination plate. Not too long after, everything came out pretty quickly and hot. Even though I looked at what came with the plate, I had no idea what I was eating so I took it one item at a time. 

Gyro meat = BOMB. mmm it was so good. 

Not-handmade pita bread = disappointing after having the homemade 
version. 

Kibbi = I would compare it to the American meatloaf. It was a loaf that was tasty but a little dry. 

Falafel = I was full when I got to tasting he falafel, but I really liked it. 

Fried egg roll = Can't remember if there was another name for this, but it was surprisingly good. Filled with a bunch of beef, very good.

Stuffed grape leaves = Jon kinda hyped this up as he had heard good things about it. Eh, I guess it's an acquired taste, it was pretty bland, but tolerable when dipped in tzatziki. 

Tabouli = the ""salad' on the plate. It was pretty citrusy and bitter for my taste, but Jon really liked it. 

And I think that covers everything. While I wasn't a HUGE fan of the entire meal, it was definitely fresh, homemade, and a quality meal. And even though we tried a bunch of stuff, it wasn't nearly everything on the menu. I'll certainly be back.",2011-09-11 00:07:18

After the remodel, I would say this place is pretty classy with a menu to match.

What I tried:
Chicken Fried Dill Pickles (served with green goddess dressing)- exactly what you would think. Hard to hate fried things dipped in mayonnaise based sauce.

Corn Nuts- great if you need a crunchy fix

Blue Cheese, Apple and Fig Salad- totally packed with toppings and a really good vinaigrette. Didn't seem like there was a huge size difference between the small and the large option. I would go with the small even if that is your main meal because it is quite filling and I would hate for you to get gypped.

It was a late Saturday afternoon, and we were preparing for the copious amount of alcohol we were about to consume that night.

Knowing that the best way to not get completely trashed was food in our bellies, my friends and I set out on a quest to find some alcohol buffer. 

After going through countless takeout menus online, we finally settled on Fugu. Having never heard about this place before, our expectations were pretty low.

First of all, the Chinese food in Madison is crap, period (Sorry Madisonians(?), just being honest).

Second, this place is located right off of State Street, which is basically drunk haven for college kids.

Third, this place is called Fugu.... and they sell Chinese food. Dictionary.com defines fugu as ""a puffer fish that is eaten as a Japanese delicacy, after some highly poisonous parts have been removed by an authorized chef."" 

So ok, this place is named after a highly poisonous Japanese delicacy, but serves Chinese food... 

Alright then, moving on...

As soon as we opened up the menu, however, I knew we were in for a special treat. My non-Asian roommate couldn't read the menu at all, which is immediately a good sign when it comes to Chinese food.

As I browsed through the list of food, I saw quite a few authentic Chinese dishes that I was so used to back in Boston. 

We ordered the sesame pancakes, Singapore beef noodle, eggplant in garlic sauce and deep fried chicken with dry chili pepper. 

It took roughly ~30 minutes of wait time before the food was delivered right to our doorsteps. The fact that this place delivers AUTHENTIC Chinese food alone should merit 5-stars.

While waiting for our friend to bring up the food, the aromatic scent of delicious Szechuan cuisine wafted through our house, and made our mouths water. The moment the food was set on the table, we went into it like ravenous savages, and devoured the food within minutes.

It was definitely not a pretty sight, but oh was it ever so delicious... I can still taste the soft eggplants with its sweet, garlic sauce. The numbingly spicy chicken with its perfect crusty skin. The thin, dry noodles intervened with tender pieces of beef and vegetables.

Everything about the meal was delicious. I thought I had fallen in love before, but it wasn't until now, that I have realized my naivety. 

Fugu, you're now my number 1 love in Madison.",2013-02-11 21:54:46

This restaurant is part of the same chain that is in Scarborough at Midland and Finch, where I used to go all the time, back in high school (scary to think that was over 10 years ago!!!) So I'm probably a bit biased about this place since this is what I think of when I think of korean BBQ, authentic or not!

I don't think anyone can argue with me as a place that is solid value for the money. If you're hungry, and craving some meat, this is the place to go! It's all you can eat, and your food is always hot and tasty, since you cook it the way you want. The regular all you can eat menu is $12.95. We went after 10pm, so we got the late-owl special, which is $8.99 for all you can eat beef, chicken, pork, squid, and white fish, with rice, soup, and sides like kimchi, tofu and bean sprouts. The meat is probably not the best quality, nor the service, which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5,  but for the money, it's a solid choice, and a very affordable option downtown.

Some tips from my many years of korean BBQ'ing - cook the fish last, since it tends to stick and leave a char-y mess. Enjoy!",2009-11-23 06:23:16

Located at the corner of Queen and Kennedy, Giggling Tomatoes puts itself in dangerous territory. Not only does it have to compete with the Asian cuisine and Crabby Joes across the street, it also has to lock horns with the popular evening spots like Sonny's, Burrito Boyz, and Taco Bell, though its closing time is oddly early.

At first I thought I'd wandered into Jurassic Park. The ceiling and walls are decorated with forest designs, faux leaves hanging, and the colour of the booth padding matches, which were also very comfy. There is also a plasma TV hanging by the exit, in case you feel that burning desire to watch CP24 while waiting for your food.

The menu was surprisingly extensive. They have an all-day breakfast setup (complete with peameal bacon and a good selection of omelettes), as well as diner goodies like grilled cheese, soup, salad, gyros, and BLT's. They also offer a vast list of lunch/dinner options: Souvlaki, chicken shawarma, wraps, steak, seafood, burgers, and pastas with shrimp/chicken. They also offer beer and wine if you choose to partake. The prices are all extremely reasonable as well. 

Being a half-hour before closing, I'm not sure if they normally have more staff on hand, but they had one very sweet server and one cook while I was there. Being so late, I ended up skipping the big breakfast I was craving, and opted for their Home Style Burger with Onion Rings instead. Pretty risky, considering I could very easily get a trouser-tickling burgasm at Sonny's instead, but seeing as how the price of burger was the same in both locations, I thought I'd steel-cage-match this bitch, and see which burger came out on top. The onion rings were onion rings. I don't think I've ever had an onion ring that was inedible, or didn't taste like all of the others, so it's burger time!

Holy Kennedy and Queen cattlecaust! Burgasm achieved here as well! In terms of cooking time, I had to wait longer for GT's slice of sly steer, but the portion was much thicker than Sonny's. Flavourful, fresh-bunned, and served with a smile. I'm a fan, and have a whopper of a menu to burn through on subsequent visits. 

If the tomatoes' giggles are that of the chest-out 'bring it' persuasion, they have the right.",2011-10-22 03:00:34

First they are open late at this location, even on Sundays.

I've purchased dozens of books from here and I've never had an issue with a book I couldn't find.

The staff is usually hard to seek out but only because they always seem to be helping people find books.  For the most part there set up is pretty easy but every once in a while there is that book I want but can't seem to find anywhere and even the workers wonder what happened to it.

Every once in awhile they have sales which is great because the books can get expensive.  And I love that they have a Starbucks built inside so you can buy your book, buy a latte, and sit down and read in peace.

It was wonderful! First and foremost, the food was incredible. After we shared the salmon sashimi as an appetizer, I had the seared tuna and my boyfriend had the filet mignon. Both were tender, juicy and just as we ordered. We also split the family-style side dishes, wild mushrooms and truffle mashed potatoes as sides. I insisted on the mashed potatoes after reading about how great they were on Yelp! and everyone was right - they were even better than anticipated. So creamy with a special 'bite' to them that I find impossible to describe. You really have to taste it to believe it. Drooling as I write... but I digress. Prime has an extensive wine list and the excellent staff even surprised us with a 'happy anniversary' free dessert of lava chocolate cake a la mode. Everything from the ambiance to the service to the food was perfect. The incredibly romantic view of the fountains at the Bellagio which went off frequently throughout our meal made the night even more memorable and special and the waiter didn't even complain when we asked him take a photo of us. We had a hard time getting reservations even calling a month out - we had to choose between 5:30 or 10 p.m. so I recommend making reservations as soon as you know you will be in Las Vegas and celebrating a special evening.

At the Rainbow location towels are stacked right in the locker room available anytime.

Wide open layout, carpeted weight area, and every type of free weight, strength machine and cardio that you could want. Was updated some years ago with the newer cardio machines, including the newer recumbent bikes.

Indoor basketball and swimming pool, coed sauna, steam and jacuzzi.

Unless you're staying at the Venetian (with its Canyon Ranch Spa and gym), this is the gym to drive to from the Strip for a serious workout.

Sometimes I stay in Vegas for such long stretches that I become a local, and this is the gym I like to go to when here.

Seriously there is black magic going on here. Apparently they start by getting a super high quality dog made for them back in Buffalo, then they beat the heck out of it above open flame! Seriously they poke and slice the dog up while it's being grilled over white oak charcoal and it picks up all that smokey goodness while cooking. 

There are two other shining stars at Teds. Their house hot sauce and the Loganberry drink. The loganberry is basically glorified koolaid, but man is it good. The hot sauce is more of a relish and is unlike any other I have had. I'm not really sure what's going on in it, but it's just a little spicy, sweet and awesome.

Their cheese is straight up east coast style cheese sauce. Basically cheese wiz. If you like that sort of thing go for it. The chili is that midwest no beans kind. Not my thing, but that's fine. I always get the jumbo all beef topped with mustard, relish, onions and the hot sauce. 

Everything not fried is cooked over that same white oak charcoal, so it all picks up that goodness. That means if you're not feeling a hotdog, everything else is going to be sold, but keep in mind ""Hot Dog"" is in the name of the place. Don't expect for their burger to change your world.

No, I'm not commentating a dirty movie. I'm describing the most delish, huge, meat-packed sandwich evah! (Which also sounds a little naughty...)

Either way, Ohio City has been needing a late night, fresh eats spot to grab a quick bite to-go for a looooong time. That's not to say there aren't places to eat late night around the OHC, it's just that most of them are sit down. And that's not always ideal. 

Old Angle has kicked up it up a notch by opening a mini sandie shop off the side of their already awesome establishment. The best part (beyond the tasty food)? You can even take it right next door to enjoy with a cold brew. Ummm, heaven much? 

And let me just warn you, these things are packed to the gills with your protein of choices. Steak, turkey, it's loaded up, doused with au jus, covered with cheese sauce and sprinkled with crumbled potato chips. Does life get better than this? The philly has fresh, sauteed onions and mushrooms on board, but not too many onions. The BF has beef (pun intended) with too many onions on philly sandies and he was beyond pleased. They're sloppy, delicious and require the same eating tactics as a Chipotle burrito (read: leave one layer of tin foil wrap on and peel down as you eat.)

The chef worked at Flying FIg for years, so you know the quality standards of these 'wiches just have to be fantastic--and they are. Plus, the price is reasonable and you aren't bombarded with ""combo"" options. Just good, sloppy, delicious food.

Overall I had a great experience here I love the detail they put into their business even the water was excellent I think it was some kind of basil rosemary infused water idk but whatever it was the water was good as hell lol.

They have over 100 gel colors to choose from so you're guaranteed to find a color you want. I've also brought my husband here before. He got a spa pedicure and loved it so don't be afraid to bring your man ;) he also got a complimentary beer so that was an added bonus.

Disappointing is an understatement as to our last experience. The entire meal was slow- from drinks and refills to food service time to payment. We each ordered a meal, and we ordered an order of Tempura California rolls. It took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive, and the California rolls did not even come until after the meal was served. 

 Our waitress was not attentive and several other servers had to come to refill drinks as they would be empty for periods of time before anyone stopped by. The food was ok, but highly salted. At the end part of our meal, we asked for a side of eel sauce for our rolls. The waitress attempted to get a side from the sushi bar- during our meal, we sat very near the sushi bar and could watch/hear what was going on. The head sushi chef told her NO, he would not give her eel sauce. we waited about 5 minutes before she went back to the sushi bar and asked him again for the eel sauce. At this point, he began yelling at her, loud enough to where we could clearly hear what he was saying, telling her no, go get it from the kitchen herself, that its her job, not his to wait on the tables and get stuff, and was pointing directly at our table. Another server heard what was going on and went over, and again he was yelling and pointing at our table making remarks about getting stuff for us. we were completely done with our food before the side of sauce even arrived, and we felt like we had inconvenienced the entire staff by asking for a small side of sauce.

 We then got the check and placed cash in the folder. I noted the time since everything had been so slow- and it was 27 minutes before the waitress returned with our change. During the half hour we waited for change, we heard and saw the same sushi chef snap at several other servers, as well as a customer! There were place settings around the sushi bar, and when a customer sat down, he informed him - ""were not serving here- were too busy, you have to go away- go over there."" and pointed him away. 

 This was an almost 2 hour dinner for only 2 people, with a background of rude employees. 

 What a horrible experience for a $70 dinner.",2015-06-18 20:12:04

The server and staff are very knowledgeable about what they offer and the details of how it's all made. This is great for people with allergies or who are just plain curious. 

We ordered the taco wrap which was absolutely delicious! It's like a tomatoes salsa with avocados and lettuce wrapped up in a giant leaf. And inside they have a nut loaf made with peppers too to give it a huge hit of flavor much like a meat protein would normally do in a salad wrap. 

I had the pad Thai zucchini noodles! I love the zucchini noodles. It was more like a giant salad with nuts and a peanut dressing or sauce though. Not very pad Thai at all so it was not what I expected. Still good anyway and wonderfully balanced.

We had a very nice fresh juice which had beets, apple, carrots, and a lot of ginger. Really delicious but I really really would have loved it more if it was colder. Perhaps a smoothie next time then.

I'd suggest to order their korean prime kalbi, brisket, premium beef tongue, kobe style beef, spicy pork, and their filet mignon for meats. They also offer happy hour in which some of the dishes come at a discount that ranges from $2.95-9.95 per tapa order depending on the meats. 

Mixxed veggies are a good choice for sides, kimchee, japanese pepper, mushroom, and asparagus. The stuff with the cheese sides aren't really worth it. I wasn't too fond of the whole cheese dipping thing, and didn't end up using it. 

For the combos, the first time we came, we ordered the Paradise combo. It says it's good for two people, but we split this with a family of four. We don't eat a lot, but it was still enough to fill us up! Well, we also ordered calamari (which was also good! especially their sauce!) and their fried dumplings (beware. it's really spicy).

This place is pretty hip, they also have a nice private room for a big party. They feature this big projector screen that plays a mixture of popular music videos from here and Korea. The Korean music videos are so fun to watch even if I don't understand the language. It's a good way to help the time pass.

It is a family owned little restaurant that must have started up with simple greek fare. But they have forgotten how to make the stuff. Everything is extremely average, and for souvlaki there are many more places that far outpace this joint. And their prices are a bit high when you consider quality and cost of what they served, and for this type of restaurant the portions are not huge. 

As to the pitas I found them dry and not so tasty. If as someone else said they make them, they are wasting their time. I would much rather go to the Mr. Greek on East Beaver Creek for this type of fare at the same prices with very good food.

My first impression is that they have very limited offerings. I usually go for pistachio but they did not carry it. I asked the server if they normally offer it and he said no because it's not a popular flavor. I was surprised because that's one of the most common flavors. Anyways, that's okay, I decided to go for ferrero rocher and strawberry. 

The gelato was good and it is on par with other gelato places in the area. Nothing exceptional. It's decent. In terms of pricing, I think it's similar to other gelato places as well. Overall for quality and price, I think it's about the same as other places. 

So I really don't have an incentive to purposely come here for gelato. I may get it if I pass by, but that is assuming they carry flavors I want on that day. It is so small with limited offerings, maybe the next time I pass by I will not see any flavors I like. I am not complaining since this is what they can offer given the size of the place. But it may be hard to attract all customers.

I don't think their primary focus is to attract everyone and be THE place for gelato. If people wanted gelato then they may go to a bigger store with tons of gelato flavors. 00 gelato is a small store that offers gelato conveniently while people are walking and it seems like they are doing well in that aspect.",2017-08-03 04:36:13

The veterinarian was good; she was told me ahead of time how much the x-rays would cost for my cat. I obliged to the cost as well as set up a payment plan for them. It turned out my cat had broken his leg, and the surgery to fix it would cost $2500+. She gave me time to think. I just sat there and cried. I couldn't afford to do this, even with payments.

The vet tech came in with my cat's prescriptions. She didn't ask, ""What's wrong?"" even if it's obvious I'm upset over something. Instead, she just went through the motions of telling me how to give my cat pain medicine and demonstrated how to draw it up in a syringe. She left the room without saying anything else. I cried even more. I'm sure the staff has seen these kinds of situations many times, but wow; she never even looked at me.

I went to pay at the front desk, and the vet tech came out, said ""He will be OK"", looked down at the cat carrier, and then walked away. No, my cat didn't end up OK. I had to give him up to the humane society because I couldn't afford to give him the help he needed. 

I'm in healthcare; when I see someone upset or crying, I at least acknowledge their feelings. I can't always do anything about it, but even an open-ended ""I'm sorry"" would have helped some.

The brunch menu is different than their regular menu so their are some items missing from their regular menu. But everything we had was pretty good.

Fresh croissants to begin our brunch were good but appeared over cooked/burnt, the honey, jam and butter accompanying  them helped moisten them up. 
I was able to get another drink while we waited for food so I tried a Poppy Sling which was a good sweet drink also that I'd get again.

My husband liked the pork dumplings more than I did, I felt like they were over cooked. The filling was okay but nothing special. I was able to sample another diners fries with Kim-cheese dipping sauce, I wish we would've ordered some, they were tasty.
We all shared and sampled a trio of  their Ice  cream with Potato Chips...they sealed their 4 stars in there! Miso Toffee was my favorite, the Strawberry was good but just like strawberry ice cream anywhere, and The Lemon Poppy seed ice cream came in second for me.

All of the staff was very friendly and attentive from start to finish. The decor was cool, it set a good vibe but not sure if it goes with the food. I may go back, I may not. It's not a place that's calling me back.",2013-02-13 01:08:33

What kept me coming back? I am a big fan of the salad and fries, which is a bit weird for a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant known for its pasta. While the pastas are delicious, they were also very big and creamy and I cannot possibly have them that often (especially after an order of their amazing fries). The salads use a really yummy Japanese-style dressing and the fries are a delicious Fusion experience (check out their Okonomiyaki or Nori fries). 

What also kept me coming back was the coffee, which was $2 for all you can drink and it wasn't just crappy coffee you can get anywhere. The atmosphere of the place is just so lovely. It's a beautiful modern setting with soft acoustic music playing in the background. It almost feels like I've been transported to a small roadside cafe in Japan. I've eaten in a lot of places around Markham, there really doesn't seem to be any other place that has the same feel.

The price is the same whether you eat their buffet or take a small box to-go. Not sure why, since you're obviously going to get a smaller amount of food. I'm not a fan of Chinese buffets anyway, so this one really didn't do much for me. The food is greasy, overcooked and definitely not fresh.

Ordered:
-Beef carpaccio
-Sashimi platter
-Spicy yuzu chicken wings
-Rib eye prime and waffle fries
-Japanese cheesecake
-Ice cream (miso honey , strawberry , and tamarind)

Nothing wrong with the food, but also nothing very special. Very expensive for what it is. Service was also a bit slow - we asked for ketchup for the waffle fries and it never came , was gonna flag down our waitress again but she was never found. We ate all the waffle fries anyways before we got to her again. She just completely forgot about it. Japanese cheesecake was a bit disappointing. The only thing that stood out to me (besides the medium rare rib eye prime that was cooked to perfection) was the miso honey ice cream , it had a unique taste.

Total bill was 100$+ , and for a party of 4 they were able to split the bill no problem. Left pretty hungry still though. This is the type of place to just order for taste/presentation.

I've frequented their hot dog cart plenty of times on the weekends when bar hopping downtown and was completed satisfied with their hot dogs then so I was curious to see how their actual restaurant compared.  Came here on a Friday night around 7:30 pm and there were no other customers inside, the weather was really nice out though so most of the customers were dining outside.  The place itself is really small as most of the businesses are inside the Container Park.  We went inside and were greeted instantly, paid for our food and given a number.  We grabbed a table outside and the worker brought out our food about 10 minutes later.  

We ordered:
-Classic Cheffini's Hot Dog ($5.99) - comes topped with the normal toppings onions, mustard, ketchup BUT they also throw on jalapenos, mozzarella cheese, potato chips, and pineapple sauce, not sure what the hell the person was thinking when this concoction was created but boy is it TASTY!
-Crunchy Dog Hot Dog ($6.99) - topped with onion, peppers, bacon, potato chips, seaweed, sriracha, and fry sauce didn't get to try this because my friend devoured his but he said it was good! 
-Side of Large Fries ($4) - Nice and crispy the fries were extra long too and they give you a lot with a side of fry sauce

For some reason I think compared to the hot dog stand, here gives you more food.  At the stand I would usually need two hot dogs to fill me up (maybe it was because I was slightly intoxicated when eating at the cart), but here I was full with one hot dog and a shared plate of fries.

I recommend, checking-in online and checking your luggage at the curb (I'd tip a dollar or two per bag for this though). Do realize that the 3 security checkpoints actually lead to the same general area and can access ALL three terminals. So simply choose the least congested security checkpoint. The one leading to terminal C is usually the busiest of all.

The Starbucks is in terminal C close to the lounge. The food court is down by the middle of the airport. This is one of the few airports that give you free wifi. People are friendly and helpful.

We were at the bar next door for Paint Nite. The Yelp reviews were pretty clear that the bar's food was subpar. My friend asked if we wanted to try this place for sushi. Being from Seattle, it's hard to find decent fish in the dessert. But, you're equally hard pressed to find decent Mexican food up there.

The quality of the fish is unmatched; it's so fresh you'd cry tears of joy. I hadn't ever had a poke bowl before, but it had everything in it that I enjoy eating. I've been hooked ever since. I definitely get cravings for their food. 

One of the owners was our sushi chef, and he's very kind. I mentioned that I hadn't ever had eel before, so he gave my friend and me generous samples to taste. Nom, nom, nom. 

I don't like Americanized roles-mayo on rice? That's just not right. Their selection of rolls is diverse enough to accommodate me. I highly recommend the Pink Princess Roll. It's a painting on the plate and a party for your mouth. Both the unagi and poke bowls are a must. The unagi is just so savory. And if you are a carnivore, don't forget the teriyaki beef roll. 

The restaurant is always kept very clean; clean bathrooms mean a clean kitchen, too. Several of the employees have been working there since there restaurant opened. That, to me, speaks volumes about the efficiency and the quality of the place. The servers always are polite and upbeat.

The Spicy Girl Roll was my fave, which is pretty much tuna on top of crunchy tuna. But a very close second, if not equal, was the Godzilla roll. Gosh darnit, it was amazeballs! It came out warm and freshly fried (totally healthy, right?) with cream cheese, white tuna, eel and crab. YUM! I also had a good old faithful philly roll and Amazing roll, which was basically tuna as well. I obviously like tuna.

They also have a sister eatery in downtown Gilbert called Joe's Real BBQ. That's on my Bucket List to try as well.",2017-03-12 15:22:24

Cons:  Gyro sandwiches and Baklava are dissapointing. Maybe they should stick with Persian food.

Found this place in the 89074 magazine and thought we would give it a try. I was excited that they had a Gyro meal for a fair price; $6.99 on their Yelp menu.  When I got to the restaurant I was even more excited to see that they had the same Gyro and fries meal for $5.99 on special.  Their Baklava was also fairly priced for $1.99.  Henderson is full of overpriced Kabob and Greek restaurants, so I was very happy with their prices.

The food was made to order, which is always awesome but the flavors were dissapointing. The fresh bread was good, but the meat was dry and bland. The sauce was sour and overpowering.  Maybe they should stick with Kabobs and not try to make Gyros.

The Baklava was equally dissapointing. We won't be back, but I wish them the best.",2016-07-30 04:37:16

I had been here over 10 years ago and while I liked the food, the loud bar customers and louder music were a complete annoyance.  I never thought I'd return.

I had a reservation for 5 PM which would give me plenty of time for the 7 PM show.  As the hostess was walking with me, she asked if I wanted bar seating for happy hour or did I want dinner seating in the downstairs dining room.  Bingo!  Downstairs to avoid any loudness!  I never knew it existed.

Down about 7 steps is a large room off the pool at TI and this is there main dining room.  I was seated halfway in the dining room and I had a good view toward both one pool area and the stairs.  Right in front of me was a TV with Monday Night football so that took my attention.  

Rowan was my server and he was there soon with menu and took my order for iced tea.  After looking things over and asking about the soup of the day, I opted for chicken tortilla soup to start and Bang Bang shrimp for the main course.

The chicken tortilla soup is listed on the menu as spicy but it wasn't--at least not for me.  The soup was very hot and it was good.  The chicken was a bit meager.  There were some tortilla chips standing in the bowl instead of the normal tortilla strips most places use.  This was good.  At this time came the only glitch in service.  Before I finished my soup, a runner came from the kitchen with my main course.  Damn, I wish restaurants would watch this.  If I hadn't been somewhat close to finishing my soup, I would have sent her back.  But then, it would probably sit under a heat lamp for a few minutes.

The Bang Bang shrimp was very good and a reason to return.  The dish consists of 8 shrimp with bacon, zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, red pepper, and carrots.  The shrimp have a nice spicy zest to them making their bang bang name appropriate.  The rice appeared to be regular rice rather than jasmine and the shrimp wasn't served over a bed of rice as the menu states, but it was a good looking dish with an orchid in the rice.  Nice touch.

For dessert, I got the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was OK and something different.

Service was very good.  Rowan brought a new iced tea before I finished the first one and he asked if I wanted a cup to take my leftover iced tea with me.  His service was very good and he was a very personable and polite man.

On the way out, the hostess wished me a good evening and used my name which was a very nice touch.  This is a place to which I'd return if I were coming to TI, not something I do very often.",2014-09-16 20:25:54

From  Alaska and California to prime cattle country in Alberta to the american heartland and NYC and beyond. Had them in Asia, South America, Latin America, all over Europe, Africa and Mexico (don't ever recommend them there). In fact, if I can be so bold, I'm gonna lay claim to being a burger EXPERT. So when I hear about how great Burgatory is, I'm intrigued.  And when I go to a place like this, I'm ordering burgers -not exotic milkshakes or truffle fries or some distraction. Nope. Gimme the burger. 

Now, with that said, these are just not that good. I know, you're appalled. But Gary, you say, how can that be? Look at all the rave reviews!! Here's a clue. Check the reviews more closely and you'll note that people mostly rave about the spectacular shakes, not the burgers. And I'm just not interested in shakes - pretty much anytime. 

Sure the menu is cool, build your own or pre made options like the  Morty's steakhouse I ordered or even the jerk chicken one my wife ordered. The beef is a ""succulent blend"" of angus sirloin, brisket and short rib. Sounds like it should be full of flavor. Sadly it's not. In fact it was uniquely bland and uninspired. Morty's says it has horseradish cheddar ( no evidence), Cabernet sauce (no evidence) and onion straws. Tons of straws but I couldn't detect an onion particle in any of them. So I'm profoundly disappointed. My wife's burger was equally tasteless. There are far better burger options throughout the city. I suggest going elsewhere.

Frustrating.

It's a pretty small space with plenty of wood surrounding the bar up front and a small booth filled dining room in the back. We've eaten here well over a dozen times and have always enjoyed our experiences here.

The sandwiches are killer!!!! I enjoy a good chicken sandwich and their Jerk Chicken Sandwich with grilled pineapple, provolone and roasted red peppers may just be my favorite chicken sandwich ever! I've also had the crab cake sandwich which is pretty darned fantastic, too. The jalapeño steak wrap is so delicious and spicy that it also ranks near the top of delightful choices. It's real steak cooked to order inside, too. The fish tacos are also a tasty option.

I'm not much of a French fry eater unless I'm at Lot 17. Their sweet potato fries are served with a side of brown sugar honey butter dipping sauce that I wish I could make at home. Tried and failed many times. It's the perfect compliment and I now refuse to get sweet potato fries anywhere else because I'd just flat out miss that sauce too much! Occasionally it shows up runny or less than perfect & I get sad but its still better than my best attempt to copy it.

Beer selection is good but could be more extensive. We've sampled some of the items off the appetizer menu in our early days coming here and realized they were totally unnecessary based on the amount of food you receive off the sandwich menu. We did manage to score some free chicken wings by texting Lot 17 using a sign on our booth once. Fun!

FYI - I am reviewing this place even after losing (financially) on my vegas trip so don't think I am giving it a good rating because I was up and anything would've tasted good.

We chose to sit out on the front deck/patio area, which was a little walk to the food area (it's a buffet) but worth it to enjoy the weather.

So like I said, this was a brunch buffet.  You also get a menu where you get to choose one a-la-carte item.  I chose Shrimp and Grits, and my husband chose an omelet.  We both enjoyed these items!  The brunch had a variety of options, including juices.  I enjoyed bacon, potatoes, some pizzas, and some other random finds.  They also have a grilled pineapple which I tried- it was good and I guess soaked with alcohol!  A good treat to end your meal.  

I really enjoyed our meal- but it was definitely expensive.  We will have to save a place like this for special occasions and celebrations because of the costs.  If it way maybe $5 less I feel like we could swing it more often.  I can't speak for any drinks or beer because we visited when I was pregnant.

Retro Cleveland Indians lineups and other kitschy art lines the walls, and little dinosaur figurines are inconspicuously placed in hilarious places around the parlor. There's also a fantastic vintage jukebox that plays both local tunes and old school jams. Turn me on some Blondie, and I'm a happy camper.

This parlor has the absolute nicest people at its helm. The entire staff is super helpful and non-judgmental on teaching you to play some of their retro games. When you enter, you purchase your cup of tokens and can embark right away on your playtime. So grab an Old City Soda from their counter and go nuts on some old-fashioned family fun!",2016-04-23 00:52:28

No Breakfast place that I know serves 6 huge pieces of bacon! A gigantic tasty order of  homefries. 

Just the one piece of Fish n' Chips is enough for me, the size and quality of the halibut they serve is nothing like any other Fish n' Chip restaurant I tried. I always change the fries to homefries.

Service is always friendly and lovely. Warm and cozy atmosphere and awesome food. If you like a really nice, well prepared home cooked meal, you really can't go wrong with any of the choices and prices.

As with other reviewers I waited ages for my appt and wound up with last one of day. The abrupt and rude woman who provided the service slapped on the chocolate crud, wrapped me up and did the facial. After showering, I expected  a MASSAGE at the least but it was about a two minute slathered on lotion using rubber gloves that left the charming scent of latex on me. My treatment lasted less than an hour and I left less relaxed than when I came as well as feeling ripped off and angry. 

Why did they even bother with a groupon?? Obviously they offer less than excellent service for those purchasing them and I don't see that any of us would return. Isn't the point to get more permanent business at full price? I'll never return.",2012-02-24 15:14:39

They allow a choice of 3 appetizers per person from a large list of variety appetizers but they're not worth filling up space in your stomach (save all that room for the all you can eat meats and veggies). Shabu hotpot is about $20/person for all you can eat. It comes with the 3 appetizers as I've stated above and ice cream at the end of your meal. They serve half regular broth and half spicy but you can choose to do both the same if you'd like. You can also change your mind later so don't worry. One thing I love is their dipping sauce station! You can create/choose your own sauces and as many different kinds as you like! For someone like me who basically has condiments with a side of food that is heaven. Hotpot is self serve. They keep all of the meats and veggies wrapped up in a refrigerator and you grab what you want. Some people might be a bit iffy about the arrangement but for $20, you get what you paid for (everything's fresh, don't be afraid). I love the variety of veggies and tofu. It's a great place for my husband and I since he's such a carnivore and I'm such an herbivore. Service is always friendly and if you basically want the place to yourself come around 4-5pm, people don't begin rushing in until about 6pm and after.

Sultan's Grill is average Greek fare.  Good, not great food that will hit the spot when you're hungry.  It really bugs me that they do not have pita, but a more tortilla sized, thin flatbread.

Visited on Thursday 8-25-16 at 1PM.  I don't usually come to this part of town but I had went to IKEA and decided to stop by since I've had it bookmarked for 2 years now LOL 

$37.94 got me two sandwiches, two small salads, and a watermelon lemonade. I wanted to order a fresh juice (which is almost $7 by the way) but their machine was out of order. 

 I ordered my food to-go and sat on the filthiest couch I've ever seen and waited about 10 minutes.  My name was called and I looked up to see a dark handsome French man with my bag of food.   

$7.95 tuna sandwich-Menu says it has mixed greens, tomato, onion, tuna salad, and olives.  Mine was on delicious crusty and chewy french bread but the olives were missing.  The tuna salad was divine and tasted just like my mom's.  I'd love to try the tuna salad on a bed of lettuce...I bet it's amazing.  

$7 three cheese sandwich- a warm baguette with tomato-basil pesto, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, and goat cheese.  I bit into the sandwich and loved the bread and the cheese was tangy and warm.  I didn't notice the blue cheese on the menu and was shocked that I liked it because I don't like blue cheese. 

$6 crunchy green salad has mixed greens, jicama, carrot, celery, red onion, cucumber, and cilantro.  My opinion is this salad is overpriced.  It's very small and has no meat in it and jicama+cilantro+vinagrette is kinda gross.  I did not enjoy it.  It's the same size as the petite green salad which is only $4.50 and I don't see the difference in quality or quantity of ingredients.   

My favorite thing besides the tuna salad was the chocolate tart.  It was a generous slice and the ganache was smooth and rich.  The crust was light and delicate and the strawberries on top were a perfect pairing for the creamy dark chocolate.  

I don't think I'd go back.  I can get the same thing at Panera bread for about half the price and it's bigger, has more places to sit, and is much closer to my house.",2016-08-31 17:00:10

Their chicken roti was good but nothing outstanding. The flavour was good, but it could use a little more heat. The roti was microwaved so the outer edges where there wasn't any sauce was dry and chalky. The chicken was nicely stewed and not dry, but it had many bits of cartilidge in it -- at least it's not bones.

The patties were good. The pastry was nice and flakey, but a bit oily.

Would I come back again? Probably not. 
The small roti was $8 which was expensive for the rather mediocre food you are getting. The Oxtail (and most of the the dishes) was even more expensive at $10 for the small and $13 for a large. Another customer remarked about how expensive the prices are as she haven't been back since it was Albert's, she also said how good it was when it was Albert's and asked me if this place was any good as she was hesitant on spending $10 for the Oxtail.

I support it every chance I get and I never miss an exhibition. The exhibitions change only a couple of times per year so make sure you call to find out what's currently on display.

I love that a free audio tour is included with your admission. Make sure you pick it up because it's very informative. The gallery itself is super tiny. Even if you are expecting the small size, you'll still be disappointed. The exhibits only have a few pieces on display but it's better than nothing. The curator here is big on having a certain theme or artist on display for each exhibition. We've had Monet, Warhol and more general themes like Women Painters. Allow 30 minutes to an hour to view the exhibit. You won't need more time than that. 

The museum offers a local's discount certain days of the month. It changes so call ahead, but tickets are reduced in price from $13 to $8.

The place was empty at first but then wave after wave of high school students came pouring in. It was like I was in a high school cafeteria and the noise level was so loud I wanted to just leave. 

This joint is a bit run down and could really use an update. Small but cozy at the same time. I believe this is a husband and wife operation. They were both very friendly and easy to speak with. Their friendliness gave me a bit more confidence about the place.  

Eggs Benedict with salmon $11.99 - comes the home fries which I really enjoyed. The home fries was basically a whole potato with the skin which was cut into small cubes. The egg itself was poached really well and the hollandaise sauce was pretty decent. 

Big Breakfast $11.99 - 3 eggs, 3 meats (sausage, ham, bacon), home fries, buttered bread, huge fluffy pancake and French toast. It was so big that it comes in 2 separate plates. Everything tasted good. Bacon was extra crispy just the way I like them.  

A good breakfast place but Honey B Hives is still hands down the best.

I ordered the Crab Eggs Benedict... the Benedict part was amazing- it had a tasty sauce, a nice crunch on the bread, and the egg perfectly poached. The hash browns that came with it were actually shredded potatoes and they were so deliciously moist and flavorful.

My bf ordered chicken and waffles. The strawberry creme that they serve with the waffles were very appetizing. The dipping sauce of syrup and hot sauce makes the taste to a whole level. We also ordered Three cheese grilled sandwich to go. The portions are very large for the price and we did not walk away feeling hungry. 

The waitress is friendly. We had a big piece of fried chicken and waffle left on the plate and she forgot to ask if we wanted a box. She took the plates away and later we realized it and went to ask her. The manager who was standing next to her is nice and made a new piece of chicken and waffle to go.

My friend ordered the Unagi Don Pasta while I ordered the Sukiyaki. The plating is indeed very elegant - and it is indeed pasta. When I tried my friend's Unagi Don I found it okay. The sauce was really rich and creamy. He liked it but I suppose he didn't find it anything different from other creamy pasta dishes he has tried in the past. What I did really love was my own dish. The sauce used in the Sukiyaki was absolutely perfect. (Blend between Italian and Japanese cuisine). It's slightly sweet which is what I love, and what my friend does not love. The noodles are made perfectly al dente - I don't really know what else to say. Then I looked over to the table on my left and my jaw dropped at the sight of the Okonomiyaki-Style fries.

Overall, the food was great - the sauce is absolutely amazing for my dish. Period. The service was swift and courteous.

I was sulking in my mind and kept on screaming out ""I want my melted sugar candy"". 

To end the meal I also got a caramel flavored coffee and a cinnabon flavored coffee. They both tasted the same in my opinion.

They have a sushi station, an Asian station, a salad/fruit station, a pasta/pizza station, a burgers/dogs station, and a dessert station.

The pulled pork was also pretty good and had a tangy mustard style sauce with it. The salad/fruit station was the usual, but had a German potato salad with no mayo which is good for those of us who hate mayo. The burgers at the burger station looked to be the cheap frozen patties and were sitting in some sort of sauce or something so I passed on those. 

The dessert station was impressive and had apple caramel cup cakes, fresh made mini-donuts, mini peach and cherry pies, and cheesecake among other things.

Beyond the food, the space is pretty special- it's the former Satay Bros restaurant and a lot of the kitschy decor remains from it's Asian-fusion predecessor, all overlapped with souvenir-type things from Ile de la Réunion. If you dine in (they have takeout as well), you'll be sitting at colourful picnic tables with mismatching utensils. Totally my cup of tea.

The true gem of this place is the fellas running it- upon entering they happily explain to EVERYONE that they're from IdlR and this is their family/friend-run joint. While we had already ordered, the chef insisted I try the dumplings (because he claimed I absolutely must) and when I asked about their tangy taste he retrieved the citrus-type fruit from the fridge to have me smell it.

The restaurant itself is beautiful and I really like the concept of farm fresh food cooked to order but with a slightly eclectic menu.  That's about where the good ends for me.  First of all, this place is in the so called 'arts' district of Las Vegas.  The area is up and coming but still has a lot of coming left to do.  I am no stranger to downtown - I work right off of Fremont, so I'm used to the re-gentrified-but-not-quite all the way there vibe.  It's kind of dicey & the parking situation is terrible.  We went on a not-so-busy morning & could not find street parking anywhere.  We had to park in the garage, which isn't that big of a deal.  I suppose in that area, your car would be safer in the garage anyhow.  

The food was good.. not great.  I had a waffle and a side of bacon.  This is what really got me though - the waffle was the size of an Ego (you know, the frozen kind you can buy in your grocer's freezer section) and cost $9.  NINE DOLLARS.  For one waffle.  The bacon was an extra $3.  I'm no huge cheapskate - I'll shell out the $$ for a great meal - but for crying out loud... For $9, there should be at least two waffles & some powdered sugar on top.  

My husband and the rest of our party enjoyed their salmon skillet breakfast dish very much, so I think this is a case of 'It really depends on what you order'.  Some dishes are obviously better than others.  I'm sure I'll give MTO another shot at some point.  I'll try something other than the waffle.",2014-12-27 19:05:46

On the plus side, the table wine is reasonably priced and tastes alright.  The eggplant parmesan I had was really well-done, and the sauce was pretty killer.

On the negative side, the dinner menu was a little pricey for the quality.  It felt like some shortcuts were taken on what should've been made-from-scratch pricing - in particular, I don't think the pasta I had was fresh, unless it was very over-cooked.

After perusing all those in-flight magazines advertising for Brazilian steakhouses, I decided I would at least need to try it once.  As some of you may already know, I'm not the biggest fan of steak, but I know a good steak when I eat it.

It's a good idea, but it's really only an upgrade of Golden Corral and there's no real comparison to Morton's, Del Frisco's, or Capital Grille.  If you're spending over $40/pp you might as well get a premium cut, cooked to perfection.  Even if Chima used premium meat, the massive amounts needed to be served ruins any chance of being well-cooked.  Each slice of meat seemed overcooked, and if you wanted a more rare slice, it became flavorless as it just meant they took a slice closer to the center.

The salad bar was interesting and has almost everything, but is very little actual green salad options.  However, the gouda platter was pretty awesome.  Service is pretty good and they'll try to accommodate you, but since this is essentially a walking buffet there is very little individual attention.

I want to know...I'm interested, don't look at me when I ask these questions like I've grown horns!  Then third...bus your damned tables!  If you don't clean the tables, you can't seat new guests...  Get busy!   Votive candles on the tables don't make money...they're just a fire hazard.  Or put them out in the afternoon when the sun is setting so they don't just look stupid.

You're looking at a higher price-point for ayce sushi tho. About $30 pp after tax and tips on weekends. But trust me, it's worth every penny. 

The service is quick. Everything comes out fresh and hot, and they don't purposely slow down the food because they're afraid you won't finish.

They have a wide selection for sashimi and during the summer, they would occassionally serve sweet shrimp, which is typically rare for any ayce sushi places since a la carte usually charges $5 for 3 slices. When I went last weekend, they served scallop sashimi which is never heard of in ayce sushi places. During the weekdays, they also serve their pan-seared salmon sashimi.

Their mango rolls and yoghurt is a stolen recipe from ten-ichi it's just as good, if not, better. I can't give them any credit for innovation but MANGOOO ON EVERYThiNG...shall i say more?

Another menu item that WILL blow you away is their garlic stir-fried sirloin steak... Make sure you double or triple order because you WILL want more after!

Make sure you arrive early and if you're coming with a party, RSVP! It does get hectic over the weekend, but no matter how crazy they get, you never have to wait too long for food or wave a server down.",2014-12-10 01:07:51

SERVICE NOTES

Order at the counter and then sit down and wait for your food & beer at communal picnic-style tables. 

On the menu they ask you to tip the ""servers"" who bring your food out to you after you've ordered it and clear your tray after you're done. I think this is ridiculous and choose not to tip. I encourage you all to do the same. Seriously, they're not really helping in any way. The counter is 10 feet away, a person with extremely long arms could do that job from a standing position. Incidentally, I would tip that person...",2011-08-15 00:16:19

Most of the time the store is pretty well kept and I can find ""Some"" Fresh veggies but as Margret C's review says the clientelle is usually a little odd and I am not a fan of my wife heading there alone with all the panhandling that does take place right outside the doors. 

The saving grace for this location came a few weeks back just after thanksgiving... My wife and I made some delicious turkey for thanksgiving but she really wanted a freshly cooked ham about a week after so I volunteered to cook it since she never has. She took off to go to the store since our daughter was sleeping I hung back at the house. About 20 minutes later she comes walking into the house with a bag and says, "" I got the ham, I hope its the right one.""  I opened the bag and low and behold it was a smoked log of deli ham... This was in no way shape or form the correct thing so instead of making some crazy comment or letting out the laughter I had inside I offered to take the item back and get the right one. The words, "" I will take it back "" came out long before the thought hit me.... I have never returned anything to a grocery store, do they even do that? 

Well, the answer to that question is yes, I walked in with the bad o ham and the manager asked why i was returning it and I told her well my wife meant to buy a baking ham not deli ham so they let me return it since they did not have any baking hams. The management has always been helpful and pleasent to deal with so I guess overall I dont mind the location as long as I am there with my wife but I would not send her there on her own.",2010-12-15 19:04:46

So I was actually wicked excited to try it.  My parents each got burgers.  The burgers  were nothing special, heh.  I got the Ahi Tuna sandwich.  My complaint about the tuna is that is what cooked too long.  It came to me cooked as if it was a medium rare burger.  The next thing that really frustrated me and was a huge dissappointment was the bun they served it on.  It was an everyday hamburger bun that you can buy at any supermarket.  Lame.  As far as the atmosphere of the place, bleh.  The interior was kind of bland, nothing special to look at.  What I will give props to is that you can watch your food being cooked.  Technically it's not an open kitchen because you watch through windows.  I mean everything tasted fine, but it's not a destination that I will go out of my way for.

That pretty much sums up my experience at South Point, so don't get confused and think I have stayed, eaten or gambled here. We stopped by for the premiere of their virtual horse racing. Not being a gambler, I can't offer an expert opinion on this new addition to the gambling repertoire. 

However, while circling the casino, we wandered down the hallway leading to the arena. The giant Benny Binon on a horse statue beckoned to us, and we noticed a sign advertising a ""Cutting Horse"" championship. We had no idea what this was, but before we entered the arena we asked a South Point employee. She informed us it is a horse trained to separate cattle from the herd. The competition was free for the public to attend, so we sauntered on in. Unfortunately, the round of competition had just finished up, but we were still able to see some horses circling around the arena floor. We also popped into the Saturday Night Bar. We didn't have a beverage, but the venue was nice complete with the old Western feel and huge windows overlooking the arena floor. 

The arena apparently hosts cowboy events throughout the year, and the majority of them are FREE! For example, August 1st-4th is the Cowboy Mounted Shooting Association ""Scully Western US Championship."" Cowboys? On Horses? Shooting?

Monkey Bread $6 (DELISH nice gooey & sweet)
Fruit Plate $8 (Satisfying portion size of seasonal fruit)
Egg White Omelette $10 

**Shrimp & Grits $15 I appreciate the chefs creativity with the panko grit balls however they were terrible and left a gritty residue in my mouth. I found it odd the shrimps weren't sautéed either. The shrimp cocktail on top of salad was not satisfying and I'm pretty disappointed by this dish.

Bottle of Aqua Panna

One advice when you call the bar to book it : you have to send them an email to confirm the booking otherwise they will not keep the room for you.
Staff is quick and friendly but if you come as a group they will put a common bill for each table, so do have change or you can just order straight at the bar.",2013-06-15 15:31:34

More importantly, it was delicious (hubby allowed me a bite) and I loved how the rice got a little crispy from the heat of the bowl. I went with the spicy squid and pork belly and was in heaven!!  They also brought out a bunch of sides which came with the meal - fish cake, radish, potato, kimchi...awesome variety!!

There is a difference between charbroiled and burnt - and this was just burnt. Also noticed weird portion sizes, like a ton of chips with a thimble of salsa.

We ordered the unagi don and the shrimp okonomiyaki. The okonomiyaki pasta was quite oily actually. I think I would have preferred the unagi don which came with 2 large pieces of grilled eel and the pasta was cooked in a creamy sauce.

I was skeptical about the Peking duck pizza, as Peking duck is not easy to make but after I've tried it, I know I would be coming back for more. The duck on it were definitely not Peking duck, but with cucumber, scallion and hoisin sauce it did a pretty good job on resembling Peking duck, replacing the thin rice tortilla with pizza dough and adding cheddar is such a clever idea. Cheddar goes surprisingly well with the hoisin sauce, cucumber and scallion makes the pizza quite refreshing, the crispy duck skin satisfied my junk food craving. This new twist on the traditional food is genius.

Funghi turned out to be exactly how I wish it would be. Creamy and full of shrooms, really don't know what else to say about it, it was good.

The only flaw I can think of was the pizza dough, tasted like they were pre made or reheated, it is probably just me tho...

Right now the hype is all about the Peking duck pizza, but the pastas here really worth a try. Pastas and salads here comes in a generous portion. I had the Cavatelli, mind blown... Tried some from my friend's bowl and kept me thinking about it all night. It is a lightly seasoned pasta with pea pesto, ricotta, red pepper, white truffle oil and baby spinach. I don't like peas but dayuuuum it was good

Other than the great food, what gave this oasis in Chinatown a solid 5 star is the service. Yay another pizza joint I will frequent.

Tips:
-Peking duck pizza is only available at the Chinatown location, it taste the best when hot and fresh
-Reservation is available, there is a table for 12 at the back of the store.
-Also available via ubereats and foodora.",2016-07-09 02:44:33

Why? because when you get those sushi cravings, there is no other place in Charlotte, or let alone many parts of the US that is like this. Maybe in New York or like San Francisco...but definitely not in Charlotte. The LUNCH BUFFET that everyone else is raving about is the only thing I have tried. You have a good amount of sushi roll selections, raw, fried, vegetarian and sashimi!! I think the sashimi section is what makes it worth it, 4 plates, usually 2 tuna and 2 salmon. They used to just put out raw sashimi slices around a certain time but the past few times I've been, they stopped doing that (the sashimi is stuck to a a rice roll). That was a huuuge bummer. But oh well, I still come back. Their miso soup is terrible, too pasty and not flavorful at all, no tofu or seaweed it in just the soup. Their lo-mein is also really bad, drenched in sesame oil, which is VERY heavy. I LOOVE their fried rice though, it's quite fluffy mixed with diced carrots and peas. Their calamari is also pretty good. 

Also to be fair, I have heard a good amount of sanitation problem with this place, but I think since their last incident a good 5 years or so back, they have really tried to step it up. Never heard about sexual harrassement but I wouldn't be surprised.

SERVICE: mediocre to terrible, for higher priced restaurant, you'd expect above average service but the first thing that I noticed was too many servers on a less than busy night, most of them were just standing around. Our server in particular seemed attentive at first but then disappeared after when we tried to order our food and pay the bill.

FOOD: I ordered the Albacore Tuna Soba Noodle salad which was recommended by our server but after eating a few bites, I almost felt sick after. The tuna didnt seem to be fresh and not seared properly giving me an upset stomach the morning after. The noodles were overcooked and too creamy for my likely. All in all the dish lacked flavour and was overpriced at $25. My friend ordered pot stickers as an appetizer and which appeared to be overboiled not like how a real ""dumpling"" should taste. Another friend ordered some chicken flatbread pizza which was even more unappetizing as the chicken pieces itself were small, overcooked and lacked flavour. 

AMBIENCE: I'll give two stars here because I liked the roofed patio, the spaciousness of the restaurant and the decor.

While dogs are allowed on-leash on the hiking trails there also is an off-leash dog park.

We arrived just before our 6:30PM reservation and sat in the bar and had a drink while our table was being cleaned off for us. They have a very nice bar and a very cool whiskey wall when you walk in. They also have some neat cocktails, so I tried their version of a white russian, with cherry flavors, and it was delicious. If I hadn't been driving, i would have had about four of them over the course of the evening.

We were seated shortly after we received our drinks and headed into the dining room. Some very neat decor here to look at. The place was quite busy, as was expected, but our server was over fairly quickly to take a drink order and provide us with the specials of the day.

After perusing the menu for a bit, I decided to go with the cod croquettes (a daily special) for my appetizer, the mahi mahi for my main and the white chocolate cheesecake for dessert. We were brought bread with (what I recall... not sure) red pepper spread of some kind. Quite good and flavorful, but butter would have also been a nice option.

Our appetizers arrive and my cod croquettes were delicately placed on a bed of tartar-type sauce, golden crispy and fried. They were quite good, the sauce was perfect with them, but I felt they could have used a little bit of a flavor kick. Still, a very good dish that was gone rather quickly. I love mahi mahi and I had high hopes for this dish. i didn't want something super heavy (there was a great lamb special on but it was a large dinner and probably too much food for me) so that's why I picked fish. I was so very disappointed, especially after everyone else kept raving about how good their dishes were. The fish itself was good but nothing special, and it was on a bed of ""organic sprout, garlic fermented stew"" with ""pickled zucchini"". The zucchini made sense and actually made the fish stand up a bit on my tastebuds. But there wasn't much of it to go around for the amount of fish on the plate. Whatever that garlic fermented stew was... well it wasn't. Bland, boring and added absolutely nothing to the dish or the flavor profile. I finished my meal but I was sorely disappointed. Especially after seeing the lamb special, which had a lamb shank and a lamb shepherds pie, which my dad and boyfriend raved about. If I went back, I wouldn't order the mahi mahi. Very disappointing (even now, its making me disappointed).

My parents and brother decided to each get a glass of prosecco with dessert. I ordered a hot tea with my white chocolate cheesecake, which came fairly quickly. Our dessert soon arrived and by the time we had finished, the prosecco still had not. We couldn't get a hold of our server, let alone anyone else so when the manager or front of house manager came by, we said something. He was very apologetic and offered to rectify the situation immediately. My folks are fairly laid back so they agreed and wrote it off as a blemish on the otherwise good meal. They brought four complementary glasses (the manger persuaded my boyfriend into having a glass too) for us to have. A few minutes later, the manager came back to the table with a special dessert just for us - chocolate cookie sandwiches with mocha ice cream inside, a dish not on the dessert menu, and apologized again, noting that this was not the kind of service they usually offered and that he hoped it would make up for it.

Everyone else was pretty pleased as we finished up and paid. I think the restaurant did the right thing and dealt with the issue as best one can. I was just so disappointed with my food that the night really couldn't be saved, even with the delicious cheesecake (which was amazing btw). 

A few things worthy of note - I found this restaurant to be loud, especially so for a nice dinner out with family. Talking across the table had to be done in a louder than usual voice and it kind of ruined the ambiance for me. As well, this is a BUSY location. So if you don't make a reservation, expect to wait! This isn't a quiet romantic place to have dinner for two (in my opinion.

A great shout out to Rachel C, our CM for organizing the event and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust for supplying our tickets to the show.

Now as far as the ""musical"" goes I will point out as others have, this was originally written as an opera.  I am not a fan of operatic singing and though I liked several of the songs the switching back and forth from operatic signing to more main stream musical was not pleasing to my ears.  I barely could understand the words when they were belted out in this format.  The storyline was ok, however it had several racist undertones depicting African American's during this time period as fighting, gambling, drinking, drug abusing criminals.  The story was also at times hard to follow, possibly because of the manner of the singing which left me disinterested at some times.  I have seen several musicals at the Benedum and this was the most disappointing.  

Furthermore, for the last piece of bread on my sandwich, I really think the actors did a great job.  I may not be a huge fan of this work, but I think the cast was top notch, and acting and dancing were entertaining.  And as always any event at the Benedum is worth going to as 9 times out of 10 the experience is splendid.",2014-03-06 17:41:40

The tuna tacos are to die for and I find myself craving them! The pizza is excellent as are their burgers. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their bread pudding. The salads have always been good, but occasionally over dressed. I have never had a bad dish here. 

The atmosphere is casual comfortable with trendy decor and nice clean bathrooms. The patio is private and beautiful in the summer with a bar outside as well. The bands on the weekends sometimes are a bit loud. People do go to dance and that area can be a bit congested. There is a dining room side for quieter ambiance.

The fish is always very fresh and the grilled/cooked options are out of this world. It can be just a smidge pricier than some other sushi places, but you are paying for quality and you get it. They do have happy hour during the week which goes through 6pm and gives you a nice selection of tapas and sushi for $5 a pop.

The atmosphere feels very authentic. Yasu is front and center of the very small dining room...often he is conversing with guests and overall just looking like he's having a great time. It's part of the charm of eating here. He is also very passionate about his food and it shows. He will often make recommendations about what is fresh and different for the day. You feel like you are in good hands when you eat here, like someone has your back in the kitchen. 

There is a huge selection, far too big to even discuss individual plates/sushi options. In fact, if I had one complaint it's that they have too many menus. For a first time diner it can be a little daunting to sort it all out. You've got the daily menu, the regular menu, the tapas menu, the sushi menu, and I think one other menu. Simplifying things, would be the only thing I would change at this otherwise heavenly spot.

I highly recommend this spot, it has spoiled me and become the measuring stick I compare other local sushi joints to.

Paczki is kind of like a doughnut with sweet filling (raspberry, custard, jam). The dough suppose to be rich and more heavy because it contains eggs, fats, sugar and milk.

Custard Paczki (80 cents)
- ratio of fillings to dough... 1:5... so all carbs...hardly any fillings

So it is great to find a cool ASIAN bar where you can actually watch games!  And they come with great food, which is double great!  $20 pitcher of Heineken is a bit steep, but it does fill up about 6 tall glasses and it comes in those pitchers with built in ice cooler.  Miller Lites are $15 for the pitcher, if you're looking for better bargains.  The food is more Vietnamese fusion than diverse Asian, but no matter, it's still good stuff.  We had a few dishes:  Ox Tail Pho, Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings, Beef Lemongrass skewers, and Calamari.  The pho was fantastic, calamari was great, and wings and skewers were good but not great.  The meatiness of the ox tail and the light & crispy batter on the calamari stood out.  There are other interesting dishes we want to try out, which will have to wait for the next time.

The real winner that is a great accompaniment to the good food is the atmosphere.  Wait staff was great for the most part, and like a typical Asian restaurant they don't have ""designated"" sections for each server so you can flag anybody down for what you need.  They're very good about coming around and waiting on your table, and many of them were even social with the customers in a pleasant and non-intrusive way.  Big ups for the wait staff.  There are TVs all around every section of the place, so wherever you sit you will have multiple views of the action.  Wish the TVs were a bit bigger though, although they were close enough that it wasn't a bother.

Great atmosphere, great wait staff (including the super cutie that appeared to be the hostess/manager?), and great food all make for a great ""bar"" that deserves at least 4.5 stars.  Oh, the tab came to $150 before tips for the 4 of us, but I suppose when you order 4 $20 pitchers... but the price is a bit steeper than your typical Vietnamese.

I guess...so we ordered and when the plates came out they were clean and everything looked good.

My husband had the fried chicken, it was cooked perfectly but the batter was bland, even a little salt would have spiced it up. The chicken came with 2 buttermilk biscuits, but no butter. The biscuits were dry and definitely needed some butter. I ordered the short ribs with wasabi mashed potatoes. The ribs were cooked perfectly, but again lacked flavor. I mean they should have been cooked in some sort of spice! The wasabi in the mashed potatoes was overpowering and didn't seem to fit the dish. I barely touched my meal but our waiter said nothing. He brought me a to-go box but didn't even put my meal in the box for me. Ok I can do it, but he seemed to be avoiding the fact that I didn't eat my meal. He never once asked how our food was during the meal. 

Then he brought the check...now I had already told him about our Groupon, which he waved off as no big deal, but of course the discount was not on the check. I reminded him again and when I pulled out my iphone to show him the code, he got really huffy. He asked why I didn't print out the Groupon, well because I am not required to, welcome to the 21st century. He took our check and then the manager (I think it may have been the owner) came over. He asked about the Groupon and was very friendly. He asked about our experience and we explained the lack of flavor and the poor service. He explained that our waiter was a little older and may not have understood the new technology.

It was top of the line....next was the dinner..wow...pork had a ton of flavour and the potion was more than average. rice and potatoes were slow cooked and were soft. Excellent!!!!

Once the meal was done the owner (George) came by to other tables to check on the food/service. When he arrived to mine he offered and insisted to buy cake for me and my guest. I said no but he really wanted to offer...cake was fantastic!! I wasn't sure what kind it was but all food looked and tasted great. 

I will always recommend and go back here. Not far from the subway.",2016-01-24 21:04:37

We all ordered separately because we all couldn't decide what we wanted at the same time. I ordered the bacon cheese burger (comes with fries) and the deep fried dill pickles. My bill was about $20 bucks, a little hefty for a burger combo but these days burgers joints are jacking up the prices so I waited it out to see how it tasted.
The fries were epic, nice and crispy, a good amount of salt, I was very impressed. The burger - which is what you pay for right??- was just ok. It was really nothing special I actually could probably make it myself at home. I don't know if it was worth $20. My dad got the pulled pork burger which he really enjoyed so perhaps I could have gotten something a little more fancy. I have no clue how my mom's was more expensive then mine, she got a chicken burger and poutine for my sister and it was $25, she agreed it was nothing special. Overall it wasn't a bad experience, the staff was very friendly and the place was spotless which I appreciated but the food in general was just meh.

While it took a bit of convincing to get my friend into a ""vegan restaurant"" we both ended up happy that we went - because everything was delicious! 

Loving Hut is a strange vegan Asian-fusion restaurant. I say strange mainly because of TVs, which are constantly streaming the teachings of most world religions (well, I assume it goes through them all, I made it through Buddhism, Christianity and Islam). Their menu is absolutely HUGE - I mean this not only because of all their options, but because the size of the menu is absolutely GIANT - probably the biggest menu I've ever encountered! 

I had the avocado smoothie ($5.95 - did not look at the price before I ordered it, and wish I had because it was not worth it!) and the BBQ and Spring Rolls Noodle ($9.45), which was basically my favourite Vietnamese dish, except for soy protein instead of skewers of beef and pork. Both of these were delicious, though I have to admit, I definitely prefer the real meat version. My friend had the Mexican Wrap ($8.95) which was also quite good.

The service here was prompt; the food came quickly but was obviously made just for us (hot and fresh!). The prices were definitely decent, except of course the smoothie (why didn't I look at the price before ordering!!).

While the restaurant lacks a bit in décor (don't take anyone here on a first date), it really does make up for it with deliciousness! I will definitely be back - and I'm not even a vegetarian!",2011-10-11 14:14:55

I was still on hold at 1 hour. The phone rang to get me to a rep finally and they switched me to auto billing. I have a legitimate issue with double accounts that cannot be fixed with automated billing. If I did i wouldn't have wasted my time. I pushed zero and I was back in queue at THE BEGINNING!!

oFHrDPEQjYJjVEslX5aF0w,b4ZbEEDbCPT6pVT4ImJU4w,Ul6JwluSTm12PVDIqnNaTg,3,0,0,0,"I recently went to Kaya's monthly vegetarian prix fix dinner, complete with wine pairings. I ordered all of the vegan options. I was not entirely impressed...

The amuse, a beet ceviche, was delicious -- I would have traded out my main course for a big bowl of it. The two bite portion was a true tease.

Course one was roasted potatoes, meh. These were served with a green tomato ketchup which tasted too much like heinz for me to give a shit. OK, it did have notes of apple which was slightly interesting. But also served on the side was a ""sour cream"" and onion dip that was pretty yummy and had hints of horseradish.  I think the ""sour cream"" base is the same as that used at Mad Mex.

Second course was Chilled English Pea Soup. I LOVE raw english peas, thus appreciated the imagination of this soup (I believe it was a raw dish). However, I would have just as soon cracked open fresh pods, enjoying the full texture of nature's candy. Toward the bottom of my bowl of soup, I realized that blenderization diminishes the essence of peas, and felt slightly sad.

Carrot-lime intermezzo -- fine.

Third course was a big disappointment. Roasted Porchini Arepas sounded exciting (""what are arepas?""), but it tasted rather plain. The arepa was dry; dying for some of that ""sour cream"" and onion condiment from course one. The mushrooms were delicious, as mushrooms are, and that is my only compliment for this course. Crispy sweet potato fries were served on the side, but again with no condiments and I had had my fill of potatoes at course one. This course lacked moisture and flavor all around.

So why three stars instead of two? Dessert was amazing. ""Strawberry Pound Cake"" is the strawberry short-cake I have been dreaming about for 13 years (about the length of time I have been vegan). Probably not all that difficult to make, but wow, those strawberries were good (I surmise they were local, yay)!

The mignardises, chili chocolate, was like a slightly spicy m&m. Cute.

To quote Kaya's website, ""The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible."" I feel that exotic foods were completely lacking from this meal and that the emphasis was placed on creativity with familiar foods. Plantains would have been an excellent substitution for one of the potato dishes. The meal was full of ""American"" flavor with very little suggestion of ""island"" influence (ie. lime and cilantro). Perhaps they strive to use local ingredients, which would be cool, but there were no indications of that on the menu. No, I am not going to lay into a discourse to define ""American"" cusine, but hey, the restaurant is located in the U.S., admittedly serves ""fusion"" styles and the kitchen boys were white; probably studied culinary arts in 'merica. I mean that one should not expect an exotic experience at Kaya, though one should expect, demand even, an imaginative and quality meal.

The wine pairings were all perfectly on point; I owe much to this in creating what was generally a lovely meal. 

The service was also excellent. We had come in from the rain and were soaked; the host brought us towels to dry ourselves. Our server made intense eye contact which, in my eyes, made her an attentive communicator.

The ambiance was nice, with exception for the tv airing CNN in the front corner; it wasn't obtrusive, but it was there. I did not care for the seating. The tables were close together, and there was a great distance across the table between my date and I, thus at Kaya, you will often be sitting closer to your neighbor than your companion. 

Thankful to the date who paid,

My husband & I visited the brewery a few weekends ago with two friends on a Saturday afternoon. The place was packed (it was the first nice weekend of spring) but we managed to find a table to perch at while we tried 5 of Blood Brothers brews. We're craft beer nerds and have been to many of Toronto's breweries. Usually the beers we sample at a brewery are hit and miss, but EVERYTHING we tried was great. They do a lot of great fruity beers, that have a subtle fruitiness to them without being overpoweringly sweet (both the Paradise Lost Cherry & Guava are worth trying).

My only complaint is I wish they had a bigger space as I would love to come here with a larger crew.",2018-05-04 22:04:47

I should go on about the dates, the afternoon football games, and the times I've gone out with friends, but that'd be a novel.  Instead, I'll focus on just a few things.

The food is fantastic and strangely reasonable, especially for the portions.  I'll admit that I was unaware that chicken and waffles was a thing until about a year ago, but theirs is top-notch.  The chicken is lightly breaded and juicy, and clearly cut from a chicken breast, while the waffles are soft and substantial.  Where the victory really is, though, are the specials.  The gnocchi are like a weekly present.  I have to try the fish sandwich sometime, on that note, but it's too hard to pull away from their burgers!  The last time I was there, they had a clambake, and it was fantastic.  

The beer list rocks (with good pours), their whiskey/whisky list is overwhelming (68 kinds, from grandpa-grade hooch to liquid diamonds), and the wine list is tasteful and well-planned.  Honestly, if you can't find something you like to drink here, you've got some issues.  

There are some complaints about noise here, but honestly, it's no worse than anywhere else.  Compared to other bars in the area, it's noisy, but this is no interchangeable W6th Erie-Shore bar where you go deaf inside an hour.  For what it's worth, I've always been able to find a table or a place at the bar.  

Where they really win, though, is the service.  They're all very friendly, without that creepy-awkward mandatory-15-pieces-of-flair attitude.  I felt like a regular DURING my first time there.  An anecdote;  the night I went to their clambake, while the waitress cleared away our dishes (one large bowl, two small plates, another medium bowl, plus clambake-related debris) a little bit of the clam broth spilled from a cup, finding its way onto my jeans.  It was about the size of a silver dollar, and I was wholly unconcerned.  In a split second, the waitress apologized profusely and wholeheartedly, then started offering free desert, drinks (plural, not singular), and other goodies.  I insisted that none of that was necessary and that these things happen.  She wouldn't budge, and offered to buy our next round;  I grudgingly accepted, with no intention of taking her up on the next round because it was only an honest accident.  When I paid the bill, I noticed she took one drink off;  naturally, I tipped to make up the difference.  

Long story short;  go for the food, stay for the beer, come back for the service.",2011-10-11 17:08:49

Places like this have a very specific group of customers, as is evidenced by their limited hours. So I consider myself very lucky to have found this place during one of the few times I'm in the area during a weekday lunch time. It doesn't help that you really wouldn't suspect much about this place unless you got closer, since ""coffee house"" doesn't really say much about the unique food here! The place has no seating and is meant purely for takeout, but it is quite nice and efficient, while the owner is very friendly. 

The food is fantastic. Portions are a decent size, and a large for $9 is very worthwhile if you are hungry. In particular I had the Thursday special of spaghetti and ribs. I've never had curry with either of these items, but I was definitely a fan. The curry had a good flavor and kick, but it was still mild in a good way. It also helped that the spaghetti was made well on its own and the ribs were basically tender chunks of meat falling off the bone. I'm sure any of her other daily specials would be just as good.

To go with this, we also ordered the Kenyan chai tea, which was quite ginger-y and less strong than a typical chai. Very good!",2016-04-22 22:39:10

On Friday night, I walked over to The Arrogant Butcher with four friends, and we had a nice meal.

This place was actually our second choice, but apparently you can't just walk into Blue Hound on a Friday night and expect to plonk down at a large table. We had passed The Arrogant Butcher on our walk over, and it looked spacious and charming, so we went back. (It later became apparent that everyone from this conference ate at this restaurant at some point or another.) There was a short wait--twenty minutes, if that--which we spent at the wide-open bar. We could've eaten there too if we were a smaller group, but were happy to get a comfortable table at a corner of the restaurant.

I really enjoyed the place. I feel like I've been to a lot of restaurants that might as well be called The Arrogant Butcher and liked them all. This one was in line with the rest--meat-centric menu, lightly throwback Ron-Swanson-for-Pottery-Barn decor--and very obviously established in the last five or so years. Somewhere, there's a restaurateur Pinterest board that creates this exact restaurant. Service was solid, both at bar and table. We ordered food in a couple waves and did an interesting check split, and our server handled everything well.

I had a cocktail to start and a beer with my dinner, and both were great. The Snakeskin Boots was a lovely drink made with Maestro Dobel tequila, Ancho Reyes, Cointreau, citrus, and smashed lime, garnished with a shishito (or other mild/green/little) pepper. It was very well balanced with a pleasant kick. The Four Peaks Kilt Lifter was a nice Scottish ale that took me through dinner and, it should be noted, the entire conference--this beer is everywhere in Phoenix, and I adore it.

The food was solid, the menu stacked with gastropub/trendy new American fare. We split a few hearty appetizers, and these were pretty good. The house soft pretzels were nice, fresh and fluffy bites--like donut holes but for pretzels-- served with a rich provolone fondue. The artichoke hummus was also great, smooth and flavorful, the hummus cut with artichoke, olive, and tomato and served with flatbread. Then there was the Butcher's Platter, an assortment of the chef's favorite charcuterie-type items of the day. This came with deviled eggs, smoked salmon rillettes, bacon-wrapped sweet potato, a few cured meats, a spot of cheese, olives, pistachios, a few condiments, and a bread plate. The deviled eggs were a definite highlight, topped with crispy prosciutto bits, and I also liked the sweet potato and stuffed peppers. The meat and cheese weren't anything special on their own, but the house mustard was great. The bread plate was kind of strange--the crusty bread was drizzled with a startlingly salty balsamic drizzle, and the only other option was greasy madeleines, not exactly pile-with-charcuterie bread.

After the appetizers, everyone got their own salads. I'm not really a salad person, but I was the last one at the table to order, and everyone else had gotten a salad, so you tell me--WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? I didn't want to get the only $30 entree at the table, so I went with the crowd and ate healthy. It wasn't a bad choice. I ordered the roasted beet salad with a filet of grilled salmon on top, which gave it some substance. The salmon was excellent, moist and flaky with a good grilled char. The salad was good too, the roasted beets mixed with grilled corn, green bean, asparagus, caramelized fennel, pistachio, manchego, and crispy prosciutto. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty, and they came together well, particularly with a full meal's worth of salmon on top.

We settled on 6 items plus fries (4 adults) for take out and went home to eat. My first problem with the food was, that all the sandwiches were put into a bag that was way too small. The wrappers were so hard to take off some of the buns, that the buns fell apart.  None of them looked like their advertised tacos & bao buns on their website or even on Yelp for that matter. I was not impressed at all at how dry and small the chicken was. The pork belly was so undercooked that i gagged when i bite into it. It's supposed to be ""roasted pork belly"", it looked like it had been boiled. Everything tasted the same, well because all the toppings are the same give or take 1-2 different sauces.

Finally, the burgers. I decided to create my own burger and opted for an elk burger on herb focaccia with bayou Cajun dry rub, arugula, tomatoes, and red onions.

Hotel Sofitel (@SofitelMontreal) was amazing, located on the Golden Mile right in the heart of the city perfect for both business travelers and art lovers alike since it's basically away from the Museum of Fine Arts. For the foodie in me, love how it's surrounded by all the different types of restaurants.

Love the black pumpkin decor they have up for fall, love the height of the bare branches with the chandelier in the lobby, that the first thing you see when you go in.

We each had our own room and I was totally surprise at the size of the room with the incredible luxurious feathertop and duvet sleep system... so comfy that I could have stayed in bed the whole day.

And did I mention that they make sure the room is tidy up before your return in the afternoon plus you'll find the decorative duvet pulled back and soft music playing when you come back at night.
They probably noticed how much empty water bottles in my room, the 2nd night they left 3 bottles for me. 

Even the bathroom was rather large with both shower and bathtub.
Lower the light and light a candle, I can spend eternity in here.

And we all each welcome with a personal not and this amazing cheese plater with a bottle of Maple Syrup with was the theme of this year's TASTE MTL

~ L'Américain $29
We actually got complimentary breakfast but I have to say that this is rather pricey for what it is although it was perfectly made.

~ oh and did I mention the bottomless french press coffee.
~ The waffles are so so so good, perfectly warm fluffy and buttery goodness. 


 Verdict :
~ Wish they had a location in closer to home (Toronto or Niagara?!) and it would be a perfect staycation.

Their service and kitchen are both FAST, and the pizzas that I get here are always high quality. It's an intimate little place, and you can watch dinner being made in their oven pizzas if you get a good spot.

Anthony's also plays to their strengths very well, in that they offer a focused menu that's based around a handful of key ingredients that can be made into pizza, sandwiches and so forth; I admittedly always get their pizza. A focused menu means that while its list of options is smaller than some places, the ingredients are generally as fresh as possible, and it enhances the quality of dinner all around.

Mostly recently during my visits I've sampled their meatball and ricotta pizza, as well as their eggplant pizza. Let me tell you, that eggplant pizza is the best I've ever stumbled on. I've found many bad eggplant dishes out there, so the fact that they managed to perfectly cook theirs and layer it on top of fresh dough and sauce and cheese...I was impressed. Kudos to the cooks. Giant glasses of sangria always complete my meals here - they're the (sometimes literal) cherry on top of a fresh and flavorful night out.

This is a huge banquet hall, huge... I didn't count the tables but it's having a banquet inside a convention centre... oh wait that's what this place is right?

On a Saturday morning this place packed enough people inside to feel like a big wedding because that the kind of venue this is.  They do however have morning dim sum for those wanting to have such a meal this early.  Cool idea right? 

We had a large group, 20 or so and 2 tables out of the dozens available were needed to accommodate our party.  Our measly party of 20 disappeared into the sea of tables like a drop of water in a tall glass.  The place is just so big and so busy as if there is some sort of organized event.  In a way there is, it's morning dim sum for Saturday January 7th.  In the grand scheme of things it's not a special occasion but it's probably just another busy weekend at a Markham banquet hall.

Because there are hundreds of people in this great room and dozens of employees serving and such this place as you can probably imagine can get pretty noisy.  It's not loud, just crowd noise with every table telling its own story as conversation carries on with the enjoyment of small plates, steamed dishes, fried dishes, hot tea and the spinning of a lazy Susan.  Stacks of bamboo steamers family style sharing now come into play.  These tables are all designed to serve groups of people, about 10 to a table or so.  The entire banquet hall is like this oh and did I mention it is rather large.

I didn't see the menu because I didn't need to.  Because I so rarely go to dim sum we basically left it to the most experienced to order for everybody.  There were more plates coming to table that we were able to finish before it started to pile up.  We had a wide variety of plates, so many it's hard to remember, many with pork, some with vegetables, seafood, noodles, rice, and so on and so on.  The selection menu was a piece of paper and you chose what you wanted by checking off how many.  The list remains at the table and items are crossed off as they bring it in order to keep track of what is still outstanding as they have a copy in the kitchen.  However they make it work on the back end it works.  Things are brought out whether in bunches or individually and the empty plates are being taken away as fast as the new ones are brought out.  It's like witnessing a machine working but it's people working as a team and we're only one table among many.

You'd have to appreciate the organization required considering so many things are being made, brought out and served to so many people at so many tables in the mid morning.  The food while apparently affordable in the morning with this ""breakfast"" service is also quite diverse but if you're not ready for this kind of cuisine this early in the morning you just won't be.  It is what it is, Chinese dim sum with lots of variety and choices.  I can't really count how much of what we had but it was a good amount.  There was only as much left over to fill a single container.  Yes, we were that efficient.  The take out containers you'll need to take your food home provided... they actually charge you 35 cents per container.

For the table of 10 we had including tax and tip we paid 20 dollar per person.  So yes, we fed 10 people for 20 bucks a person (200 dollars for the entire table) for what we chose to order and for what he had in which everybody was pretty much satisfied on a Saturday morning.  By the time we were done it was rolling around noon time so we spent the better part of 2 and a half hours there eating and enjoying.  

The experience was good and the food was decent for how much we paid.  For this place however it's probably just best if you had a large group to be able to share the wide variety of dishes.  I honestly don't know if you can have smaller parties here because the place looks like a wedding reception...",2017-01-09 14:51:52

P8gwBEAHBH-Ng8bbCziNTA,zZYHZwmBl9Af4pI-aLXBFA,xfJI2zI_mAX4bz2yd1fYkg,4,1,0,0,"Lady M is quite a nice cake store. Though I'm kind of disappointed by the name change as well as the fact that they no longer carry anything other than basics.

I think there is a lot of thought behind the industrial modernist decor with nice little touches like the almost lemonade water and fresh flowers at rickety steel tables under white lighting and white washed brick walls show off the trendy nouveau art pieces scattered throughout. But I don't care about all that when the cake here is a hit every time.

I wish they would offer a larger selection if they were going to take away the food and just focus on mostly cake. There are only 3-4 cakes on offer at a time and none of the seasonal ones that are always fun to try out like the lemon mille cake or earl grey version and they've taken the really unctuous dark chocolaty molten lava cake off the menu too. /sadface 

Service is alright I guess. If someone orders a drink ahead of you though prepare for a bit of a wait before you can place an order as it feels like 1-2 people handle the drinks, cutting the cake, and serving people while ringing up customers as well. It will give you time to ogle the cakes and limit yourself to one due to their price.

This place used to have a perfect score in my books but now I think with such limited choices and slow service mixed with the prices has curbed a lot of my enthusiasm. I'm still an addict for the cake, just begrudgingly.",2017-04-05 17:53:39

9pPOl2EU7zsKzKgo-Tr1FA,pg2soiiAWSvenWac41oG8Q,BsvCTCVG7lrzXZ68VyyIcg,1,1,1,0,"We went on a Thursday evening for dinner around 4:30.  It was my husband & 2 older teens.  We walked in and the place was not busy at all.  3 people sitting at the bar, 1 table outside was taken and 2 tables inside were taken.

The hostess asked if we had reservations, I replied no.
She proceeded to point to only 2 tables and said we could have one of those .  Right across from the tables were 3 empty booths.  I asked if we could have a booth.  She said no that they were reserved.  I said 'really, they are reserved?'  She replied, 'yes, in a half hour.'.   Now I have made multiple reservations in my life to many restaurants across the country and ones that are way more upscale then this.  Not once are you ever given the chance to reserve a specific table or booth, and here she is telling me 3 booths are booked.  Ok, I wasn't going to argue.  We took one of the tables she offered.  

The food was decent.  I had cavateli, but for $19 was not worth it.  My son had short ribs and that was the best out of all the meals.  My husband got the burger and he did not like it at all.  I tried it and it was not good.  Had a very odd flavor to it.  He ate it anyway w/o further complaint.  My daughter just got the meatballs which again were fine but nothing great.  Same for the calamari app.

The reason for the 2 stars? Well after we were there for about 2 hours, only 1 of those 3 booths were  ever sat.  So because we weren't worthy of a booth and the hostess lied, we would never come back.  Paying that kind of money for food and you are treated like that is not going to fly in my book. It was never busy, only 2 couples came the entire time we were there and actually a 4th booth opened up after a couple that was there left.  So you keep saving those booths for worthier people I guess, we won't be occupying them ever.

Here is another update since the management replied to my review.  First of all don't tell me about being responsible for what I ""insinuate "" on social media.  We are old enough to know exactly what caused our gastrointestinal disturbance.  Let me clarify.  The 4 people that sat at that table that live together had no diarrhea issues before we were there.  Because of our busy schedules, the ONLY thing that any of us had shared to eat in the days leading up to the issue, were two of us and it was your burger!  Of which in my original review also so happened to be the ONLY thing the two of us said had a strange taste!  And low and behold about 24 hours later we were both stricken!  So yes, we know.  So don't try to berate my review because not me, but your establishment made you look bad. And really? You said it would not have only been us but a restaurant wide problem?? There are so many variables that could have made our burger tainted but not others!  You should know this!  So you making that statement shows me you are not very good manager!  For example, an employee could have had clean hands making all the burgers that night, but perhaps he went to the bathroom and came back w/o washing their hands yet touched up the burger I was served.  Or perhaps an ingredient on my burger was contaminated by a sneeze or a number of other ways!  So who are you fooling by making a statement such as ""had an incident such as you are insinuating occurred, this would have been a restaurant wide event.""  And the fact that you received no notification from any other guest means nothing!  Most people deal with it and never go back. And yes, I happen to write the review and that is NOT an ""odd"" way to deal with what happen to us.  You also mentioned you ""will not accept"" my insinuation of our results of eating at your establishment!? Well then I would say YOU are not very responsible and anyone reading your response to my review alone should have red flags raised.  Ps. I just looked this up, and wish I had before, but how many health violations did you have in the past couple years? And you questioned my review!?",2017-09-20 11:49:34

Let's start with the good: 
-Huge portion sizes
-Cheap
-Friendly service 
-They give out coupons for free food 
-Arrived very quickly

Okay, the bad:
-Bland. The food is usually great quality and tasty. Not today. 
-The veggies were cut really bad and unevenly sized. Like some of them were huge and others were barely there. So they weren't all cooked the same. (some huge carrots, some noodle like carrots)
-Pork & Vegetables... where's the pork?
-Egg Rolls... Tasted unlike any egg roll I've ever had, can't put my finger on what was wrong.
-Crab Puffs... this was the most disappointing part... There was NO crab!! The menu says CRAB PUFFS. They've always put crab in them until tonight. Just cream cheese.

Without reading the reviews and looking at the star factor, I committed to taking my partners out to luck on this particular visit.  This decision was solidified after talking to another buddy who states he was the first paying customer (at a discount) and said the chow was decent.

First, beware of the parking.  Meters are all around and make sure you have plenty of quarters because you during lunch you never know how long it might take to get your meal. LC was heated up during lunch time.  One of my partners said he would take care of the parking situation and little did he know just how much a task it would be.  It was quite the challenge to find change for anyone in LC during the start of lunch.  Not even the bar had change!  I will say this, it was pretty damn cool when the bartender reached into his own pocket and gave my partner seventy-five cents of his own money to assist with parking after not being able to break a twenty.

Our waiter was very nice as I think most everyone else was.. except the hostesses.  

The menu looked awesome but it was configured at ""foodie"" prices.  Hoping the sizes of the chips, salsa, apps, and meals would make the pain of paying so much bearable, I was sadly mistaken.

The app was a queso dip with it's size being only large enough to satisfy a smaller person let alone three guerrillas.  The Sea Bass Tacos I ordered, though tasty were the size of those one would get from a taco street vendor in TJ.  Only those on the other side of the border were like five for a dollar.

Between the quarter/parking fiasco and the absolute ""foodie"" portions at ""foodie"" prices one might expect this type of meal further south of the strip, say past Sahara where the tourists are.

$70 dollar meal (lunch) with no booze just plain sucks.",2013-07-06 15:58:23

(1) The staff come across as pretentious, as if I'm lucky to be there.
(2) The place is BUSY!
(3) Some unknowing person is dumping sugar in their iced coffee/latte because they thought what they ordered was going to taste like a Starbucks extra-sweet frappuccino.

The lattes here are always very good, although not as good as the Marda Loop location.  Even still, it's nice to have a good cafe in a mall for once.  One thing CrossIron Mills mall is missing is good coffee (the Second Cup, Timothy's, and Cafe Supreme are all barely passable, and the Starbucks in Indigo is easily the worst in the city).

If you decide to visit Phil & Sebastian's, you will get a great beverage.  However, don't expect to get what you would get at Starbucks (that's a good thing)--P&S doesn't do syrups, frappuccinos, or white chocolate mochas with 900 calories of whipped cream on top.

In terms of espresso beans, P&S is one of the best in the city.  They offer beans that are traceable and fair trade, which is always nice to see.  It seems they have beans from a new farm every week!  This is great if you're looking for variety while also getting a consistently well-roasted bean.

If you're looking to buy an espresso machine or coffee equipment, don't go here.  There's a great place called the Internet that's a lot cheaper.  I bought a Rancilio Silvia for $60 less than what Phil and Sebastian is charging--and the one they're selling is an older model.  Speaking of machines: the La Marzoccos they use here are SWEET!

I have relied on the system countless times to get me from Point A to Point B. I've had good experiences and I've had bad experiences. Just depends on who's working the shift, as you'll read below.....

METRO: Very efficient. Good to communicate when a line is down or interrupted. Reasonably priced per trip and the map is easy to catch on to. I buy an AMT train pass that allows me access to the AMT train, the buses, and Metro. It is so convenient for me to recharge my Opus card every month. I have lost my Opus card once in the past, but I was able to get it replenished because I registered my card with the AMT/STM. I only paid for the new Opus card ($7.00), I did not have to pay for my monthly pass again. Big Bonus. I think the metros pretty clean too.

BUSES: They are generally on time and trustworthy. Many good routes exist on the MTL island. There are times, however, when a scheduled bus doesn't pass at all or the driver passes right by your stop, claiming to be full, but we can clearly see that there is still space at the back of the bus. Some of the drivers are horrendous and rude. Most of them refuse to speak English or claim they can't speak it. Others have been really friendly and approachable.

IDMbr2WL_dPbigH4dDVFGQ,GsFr15zUG8wO9fsSHwvZUw,PBmMvDows5HWIqrEVvNfQQ,4,4,0,1,"This is my first review of Istanbul Sofra, based on a 4 person visit there last night -- 6 - 8 PM.

Reservations were made easily, and honored when we arrived.  Our group came in spread out over about a half hour.  The server attended to the table frequently, which was off in a side room and not the main area, frequently.  This is the area with a small bar, and close to the central ""computer"" system for managing orders.  I think it was the owner/manager who greeted us and took us to our table.

Other Yelp reviewers note that the corner location has challenged other enterprises.  The restaurant will need to ""manage"" the space outside to make it even more presentable.  The ""corner"" with its associated clutter will need to be separated by a visible line or barrier so everyone knows what Sofra's area is, and what the other small business area is.  ""Ropes"" might work, or a line of tables or even taller potted plants - rather than the ""entry"" being the door, it will need to pushed outside a bit, as in New York restaurants.  As trivial fix actually but important as an element in ""entryway presentation""  or whatever it is that architects say.

Sofra's have been open only 2 months.  Most places take 3-5 months to ""settle down"" - service, quality, presentation -  Sofra's is there already.  I presume it was the manager/owner who greeted us, and seated us, and came around frequently.  I did speak to him on the way out and asked ""how it was going.""  He engaged fully, was pleased I would be asking, and wanted us to return.  I do like places where the ""management"" has an actual stake in the customer experience, and their own fiscal futures.  

BYOB - one brings their own wine to the venue, and there is a trivial corkage fee.  The ice bucket is provided for the wine.  Nicely done in all respects.

Grape leaves - ordered and 5 appeared.  Grape leaves as an item vary significantly in the Middle Eastern cuisine.  Everyone has their own ""signature"" grape leaves.  These were excellent and well presented on the plate.

Three of us ordered the Shish Kebab - ""Char-broiled lamb cubes, cooked on skewers and delicately marinated in Turkish spices. Served with rice, our special yogurt sauce and grilled vegetables.""  The lamb cubes were perfect and taken off the skewers.  Rice tasty and spiced nicely.

Lentil soup ordered by 2 of the 4 -- they've had it before and said it was, again, excellent.  

Portions we so amble we could not entertain the notion of desserts.  Thus, a ""dessert"" and coffee run seems to be in order...

As we were receiving our checks, there was the need to separate a bill into two components.  One couple was going ""dutch.""

//Oh, and here is the quick edit -- TV's and TV screens -- NONE.  I am so tired of going to 'restaurants' that have a dozen huge TV's playing a variety of channels... it was a relief to experience ""dining"" versus everyone trying to outdo themselves with large screen TV's. //

If you live on the north side of Pittsburgh, use a GPS to get there.  It is easy but does take a bit of navigation - go early to avoid rush hour traffic.  Free parking is  around the corner and on side streets.  

We will be going back there.  It is wonderful to find a place that doesn't have 7 different varieties of hamburgers, fries, and nachos as the ultimate in dining delight.  Meh... as it might be said to that level of originality...  Istanbul Sofra's is a must visit dining experience.  

Welcome to Pittsburgh.

The coffee comes from Vancouver, and almost has a ginger-bread taste to it (it's a good thing, trust me). I haven't had their coffee straight-up (black), but I'm pretty sure it would be worthwhile.

By far my favourite thing on the menu is their big chocolate chip cookies - I rate them the best in Montreal.

The vibe is always chill, but it can get noisy when there's a lot of people coming/going for takeaways. In the quite times, it's a great place to sit with your laptop and get some work done (the wireless is always good for me).",2012-08-30 16:31:17

If their coffee was spectacular then that's a different story.

Otherwise cash only.

There is free wi-fi and the space is actually quite comfortable to work in.

The staff here is always quirky and charismatic, which goes a long way towards making a meal.

This would have been a 5 star review except for two points. Firstly, your extra room in the back doesn't have the charm (or noise absorbance) of the main restaurant. It's nice but not as good, and that means that sitting there is a letdown. Secondly, my girlfriend told you that she was allergic to nuts.

Came here with my husband, son, sister, and nephew.  They had only been open for about 3 minutes when we came in so we were only the second patrons (plus it was 11 a.m. on a Sunday- no one goes for pizza at that time).  

A cool thing about this place is that they brought out a little pizza tray of dough for the kids to play with (complimentary) and popped it in the oven when they were done so that they could eat it later (like a bread stick).  Those didn't turn out so great- but the fun in it all is really just playing with the dough.

We ordered the large veggie pizza and it was amazing.  The crust is thin but can support the toppings, and the slices are large so you have to fold them in half.  So good, I will definitely be ordering that again.

We also ordered some boneless wings for the munchkins- I was unimpressed with them (in my experience boneless wings are breaded, but these weren't) but the ranch dressing that came with them were awesome.

Service was quite good, as was the food overall. The reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it is unfortunately just way too expensive for the amount of food you get.  The wine list has some reasonable bottles ($60 ish), but one of the cocktails was $30!! 

While I won't go back, I think it's a restaurant worth trying if you want to celebrate a special occasion, and if you're not particularly hungry.  Here is my summary of various menu items:
- Wagyu short rib - REALLY delicious flavour, tender and juicy. But it only comes with 3 tiny morsels of meat
- Tacos - delicious, but so small 
- Truffle bomb - so good. Recommend these for sure!
- Wagyu fried rice was far superior to kimchi fried rice
- Chocolate in a cup was by far the best dessert. Get one all for yourself and do not share. Matcha cake was forgettable. The black sesame cheesecake literally comes as 4 tiny cubes meant for a microscopic human to eat. The yuzu dessert is tasty but too small.  I AM A GROWING BOY. 

I do not recommend the following items:
- Filet mignon - one of the servings was nicely medium rare but the other one was overcooked
- Tuna tataki, salmon tataki, and hirame carpaccio - meh
- Tuna pizza - this was supposed to be a standout dish but I thought it was meh; the crust is very thin and lacks flavour
- Brother/Mother roll - this sushi roll has fois gras and it seems totally unnecessary. Overly saucy.",2018-05-08 02:01:26

Unfortunately, I've never felt the warm and fuzzies at any of the breakfast places in Las Vegas.  Sure, the food at hash house a-go-go is awesome, but there are a bajillion tourists who kind of turn Sunday morning into a zoo. I've had good breakfast at Omelet House and Egg Works, but the atmosphere is just not there.

When I walked into Republic this Sunday morning, I loved the decor (not sure if it's changed since Fado's).  Very clean and simple.  Black and white checker tile, dark wood tables.  Has a very hip feel.  It kind of reminded me of something you would see in D.C.    

The concept is all you can eat where you order each item off the menu.  Love this, as you get the value of the buffet without having to go to a crappy buffet.  The price varies depending on which option you choose.  I suggest going all in so you can order anything on the menu.  

I took one look at the menu and upon the recommendation of the two who brought me, proceeded to stuff myself.  It was ungodly.  I started with the Surf & Turf Benedict.  Now, I love me some Eggs Benedict but I keep it traditional and am not usually a fan of a restaurant trying to tweak something that is soo great as it is (i.e., salmon eggs benedict. Ick!).  If you are a traditionalist when it comes to Eggs Benedict, do not be afraid!  This was awesome!

By far, my favorite dish was the pastrami hash, another variation of a traditional dish.  Pastrami instead of corned beef and a poached egg on top.  Wonderful.  I also sampled the Monte Cristo (very good, but too heavy for my taste), the stuffed french toast (also heavy but so freaking good) and chicken and waffles.  This was my first time trying chicken and waffles and now I understand the hype.  

The added bonus is that, with a few exceptions, most of the portions are small, so you can try everything.  There's also a really good jazz band playing near the bar.  Nice background music and playing at the right volume.

Great food, excellent service and all you can drink bloody marys?!? As Charlie would say, ""Duh!  Winning!"" My only regret is that I couldn't refrain from eating long enough to take a photo of all the food that I inhaled.",2011-03-15 19:22:54

I usually dislike Future Shop when it comes to purchasing electronics. No points system for purchases, the prices are almost always higher than their main competitor and the staff is usually less than helpful (read: not around OR overbearing). I had reserved a few items online and when I walked through the store trying to figure out where to pick my stuff up, I stopped the FS rep that was at the main door and asked. She pointed me just outside the main entrance to a pickups area they've recently added.

There was a bit of a wait to pick up my stuff but seeing as how it's the holidays, that's to be expected. Once one of the reps asked what I had ordered, he was back in less than 2 minutes with my items, I paid and was out the door. Unfortunately for me, I reserved the wrong item so I had to go back about 15 minutes later and return it. Super super easy return. This counter wasn't busy at all and the guy even went so far as to look for the right product. He found it, but it was more than I wanted to spend, so he easily and quickly refunded my purchase.

It shares a building with an automotive supply store and I thought for sure that I'd be losing my dinner faster than I ate it.  My husband suggested it because our usual spot had closed down and I was craving sushi.  ""Let's go to Sushi Ave"" was a phrase I was positive that I would regret...

SURPRISE!  This place is great.  The first time we went we had amazing service and the food was good.  The second time we went, the service was amazing and the food was delicious.  I think that my only gripe would be that the rolls are huge and I had to google the appropriate way to eat large pieces; it's all or nothing, btw.  My favorite treat was at the end of the meal when they brought 1/2 an orange drizzled with chocolate and whipped cream.  Ugh, I'm hungry again...

Sushi Ave is our new fav sushi place and I am so happy about that.",2012-12-12 19:56:28

First of all, the complimentary bread is A M A Z I N G. The menu is small and only a handful of dishes are ""mains"" but really, the mains weren't significantly bigger.

The octopus dish ($28): outstanding. I have never been a fan of octopus but I have been converted. It was so soft and tender. The pork belly that came with it was a nice thick slab, crispy and fatty. There was a nice cauliflower puree, but no bread/carb to mix it with. It was a very heavy dish.

Crispy squash ($12): hearty. Loved the crispy pumpkin seeds. A nice dish to share, but also very heavy.

Scallop tostada ($14): juicy scallops and refreshing. Definitely messy to eat (impossible to try to fit into your mouth in one bite). Lots of cilantro on top so cilantro haters beware. 

Would highly recommend getting at least one seafood dish (i.e. scallop tostada, hamachi sashimi) as they are more refreshing and lighter to cut the heaviness of the meat dishes.

This is a really nice cozy restaurant that specializes in southern fair. They have a great menu, full bar and great southern hospitality. They have small dining room, seating at the bar and a nice patio outside.

After being seating and reviewing the menu they brought us complimentary  biscuits with raspberry jam and rosemary butter. The biscuits were light, fluffy and the jam and butter were a nice compliment. After devouring them we decided to order. 

Items ordered:

Avocado Toast (soft boiled egg, smoked trout remulade, pickled red onion and multigrain toast). First time having avocado toast and I have to say we are a fan. The creaminess of the avocado on the nice crunchy toast and the smoked trout and runny egg, amazing flavors.

Shrimp & Grits (butter poached prawns, andouille sausage, asparagus and cheesy grits). We were not to fond of this dish. The grits were really watery and the prawns seemed rubbery and overcooked. The whole dish just seemed under seasoned.

Chicken & Waffles (southern fried chicken, rosemary waffles and ohio maple syrup). The chicken was seasoned and  cooked perfectly the waffles were crispy with a soft center. Great dish! 

Bourbon Glazed Bacon. Bacon and bourbon = perfection! 

Deviled eggs. Great presentation, egg was cooked wonderfully and the whipped yolks were fantastic. Over all great experience will definetly return to try their dinner menu.",2017-08-15 23:02:18

So seriously, I've been to 2 Paramount's and I don't get the hype.  While I think the meat is very fresh, it tastes somewhat bland.  I ordered the Fatteh, which is a mix of chick peas, hummus, fried pita bread topped with melted butter and fried nuts with beef shawarma on top.  This came to $10.50 before taxes.  

What I liked: everything was very fresh.  The beef, the chick peas and the fried pita bread.  They also give two massive pieces of fresh oven baked bread.  

What I didn't like:  Price - I find it kind of expensive.  Also, I found out after my meal that they do have hot sauce.  The cashier never asked if I wanted any.  In addition, I asked for water at the cashier and at the table and it never came.  So I went to the bar and asked for water and the server seemed resistant to give it to me.  It was weird.  So I got my food and finished 90% of it before getting water.  Odd.  Granted, they were busy, but it shouldn't be hard to serve a person a glass of water.  While they give the bread, I find the bread kind of tasteless and they should add hummus to it or something.  

Verdict:  While this may be to some people's tastes, I find the food at Paramount's overrated and would much prefer any Middle Eastern food from the small hole in the wall joints in downtown Toronto.  So 2.75/5.",2013-12-23 14:54:02

Now, the food! 
Fried artichoke hearts: DELICIOUS, and fragrant! The dipping sauce is a refreshing touch. 
Roasted squash and beet salad: It was good, but a bit dense for what I thought would be a refreshing, light dish. 
Pork Ribs with Mac n Cheese: The balsamic glaze on the ribs were the perfect balance between sweet and savory. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone. The mac and cheese was flavorful, and not too heavy. BEST DISH LAST NIGHT! 
Chocolate Mousse: For you chocolate lovers, I would definitely recommend this! It's more dense than your regular mousse, almost feels like a light and fluffy cake. 
Crema Catalana: light, and refreshing. It's not too sweet, for those that do not have a sweet tooth.

Go to Maxi or Loblaws, get 2-3 types of Soya sauce... go to Marche Hawai? AN ENTIRE AREA has this, I'm talking of hundreds of different types of soyas, vinegars and whatnot.

If you're someone like me and eats at least 1 Asian meal per week, this is the place to go to get what you need to make your recipe come true. Heck, at this point I have my own section in my pantry from things I've bought from here over the years that completely trumps what you'll find from Maxi or Loblaws. 

The vegetable section has a lot of variety though I don't find them particularly fresh. They have a huge variety of cuts of meat not found elsewhere, even Adonis which can make some recipes come true.

Pros:. Our chicken tikka masala was great. One of the best I've ever had. Unusual. Has coconut milk in it.  Creamy. 
Garlic naan. Perfect
Pani Poori appetizer was fabulous. (Never had this before, took a Yelpers recommendation, thanks, it was really a cool appetizer. Fun to eat)
Cold Indian beer
Our waiters were really friendly (Raymond Anthony) really. And he gave us some history about India and the building of the Taj Mahal. Interesting and very entertaining. He really helped make the night memorable in addition to the delicious food.
Cloth napkins.
Nice decor-granite table tops
No charge for plate sharing
Dish comes with rice. Didn't have to pay extra, like a lot of other places. 
Filtered water!!! Drinkable-yippee.

Cons:. Slow start.  We were ignored for quite a while. But then it picked up
Found a long dark hair wrapped in my napkin
Original seating was in a booth and it was very uncomfortable
Could've been a fraction more spicy. I think they afraid to scare off the non Indian clientele. 

Portions are reasonable. Friend and I shared an appetizer, entree, naan and big Taj Mahal beer.
Plenty, but certainly no leftovers.
With reasonable tip, total of $40.00

I ordered the Soba Tuna Salad.  The noodle part was good, but as expected, I could tell the tuna wasn't the best quality and it was kinda pink but mostly cooked.  Tuna needs to be really pink and slightly seared for me to enjoy it.  So while my meal was blah, my friend ordered the Steak and Ranch Pizza.  She was smart and made the right choice!

+ Apple Store, Tanzy, Brio, Sol Cantina...some of the places we enjoy at this mall.

+ It's outdoor and walking around is pleasant.

+ Convenient parking.  There are 2 large parking garages on opposite sides of the mall as well as a few valet options.  The street-side parking is often hard to find though, so it's not worth driving around looking for a space in my opinion.

+ They have misters throughout the entire place to cool you off during the hot Summer months.

My only complaints are that it is relatively small and that businesses go under quickly (see Narcisse, Prime Bar).

Overall, it's a pretty cool place to hang out at.

I got the yellowtail collar, teriyaki chicken pizza, crunch roll and California roll. I got all this for happy hour so it was a good deal. The yellowtail collar was amazing. It was so moist and mild. I wanted the salmon collar but they ran out. I'm glad I tried this because I was pleasantly surprised. The teriyaki chicken pizza was so good. It took a while to come out but it was the star of the show. It was so fresh and good, I was in heaven. 

What really stole the show was the crunch rolls. My friend kept begging me to try them and I was hesitant because I don't like any kind of rolls. I don't know why but I don't like seaweed! After much pleading I finally tried it. I was so amazed because these were the best I ever had! I haven't tried too many but I did not taste the seaweed at all. My friend said she can't even get them anywhere else because they were the best she's ever had. I will be getting my own order when I go back. 

I would never expect South Pointe to have such an amazing Japanese restaurant, but this place is amazing. I really like the customer service, the prices, and most importantly the food. I haven't been this pleased in a while. I can't wait to come back!",2014-07-09 00:22:01

They were out of cold saki, so I ordered a saki martini; it was interesting; I had two so I guess I can't complain too much.

After my friend introduced this cafe to me last year, I have been coming back so often that the owner Olivier pretty much knows my name. After I had a taste of their baguette sandwich, I have become a sandwich snob and no other sandwich in the city even compares. How much do I love this place? After moving to the other side of town earlier this year, each month I still drive 11 miles ONE WAY to this place for my favorite chicken curry baguette and cup of soup. It's crazy, but it's definitely worth it. 

The menu has breakfast sandwiches, wraps, salads, sandwiches, coffee, drinks, and French pastries. There are 2 soups of the day, and they vary each day depending on what Olivier wants to make. I love his cream of potato soup with truffle oil and butternut squash soup, but I've never been disappointed by any of his other soups. The first time you come here, Olivier will be more than happy to explain to you the items on his menu, and he's always enthusiastic with customers. He wants you to love the food as much as he does. The food is made with love, and I think that's why I like it so much. I would definitely recommend the chicken curry sandwich (it's not on the menu though) and the chicken pesto sandwich is delicious as well.

The cafe is located in the same plaza as a whole bunch of big business buildings so it can be a bit confusing trying to find this place the first time. The cafe is small, with about 5 or 6 small tables on the inside, but there are more tables located outside. I've noticed many of the customers are people who work at the nearby office buildings on their lunch breaks, but there are also many customers who, like me, make the drive for the food and relaxing atmosphere. The cost is a few dollars higher than your regular sandwich, but it's well worth it for fresh baked bread and ingredients. 

The only gripe I have (and I've told Olivier this before) is that the cafe is only open until 5:00 pm Monday-Fridays. It makes sense as most of the office buildings nearby operate on the weekdays, but I get mad cravings for my chicken curry baguette and soup on the weekends!",2012-08-12 02:30:55

I tried to continue to eat it to be polite but ended up ordering a coconut curry dish to compensate for the flavors.

Highs: Awesome, friendly, skilled bartender by the name of Rob. He went out of his way to create his very own, very good Bloody Mary when the waitress said they use a mix.

He really liked Santa's Little Helper! 

Cons: The waitress wasn't familiar with the menu, but was friendly and tried. The big negative was the Reich burger. Described as a burger on a brioche roll covered with hash brown potatoes and melted cheddar, it sounded really good. Not so much in actuality. The burger itself was a thin flavorless patty. Those hash brown potatoes? Nothing more than that crappy oval disk you get at McDonalds. Even the cheddar was flavorless. They COULD make this a stellar burger...good beef for starters. Try adding REAL hash browns...you know  with onion and peppers and seasoning! Then top it with a fried egg and maybe a little bacon or crispy pork belly...THEN you'd have something!

The food is typical Jamaican.  The only thing on the menu that varies from day to day is the dessert.  And the desserts are always a surprise to the taste buds. 

Not much for a vegetarian.  Salad with iceberg lettuce (no thanks), steamed veggies (okay, but what do I eat them with?), or veggie stew which is quite tasty but all the coconut milk leaked out of the to go container.  Then there are the plantains that will cost you $3 for 4-5 small slices.

2) Interior a bit dark and overly masculine for my taste, especially where we were originally seated, crammed into a corner. Hence the desire to be moved.
3) Music was not very enchanting. Rather, it was a lot of early-2000's radio hits (think Nickelback or Linkin Park). It did not match when we were seated in a fancy, beautifully-appointed outdoor patio. I would suggest something lighter or more romantic.

I was unexcited to find that Havana café didn't have any spots available to park, and the rest of the open spots in the parking lot were all labeled specifically for the next door flower shop, coffee shop, and so on. What was I to do? I risked it and parked in a flower shop spot, and well, I wasn't towed, but I still felt like I was doing something wrong by parking there :-/

Ultimately, I was lured back with a groupon they had available a few months ago. My first mistake was expecting that I could use my groupon to pay for meals which both totaled above $30 (the value of my groupon) and ALSO ordering additional items from their HH menu. I asked for two of their mojitos and was told that I couldn't order HH since I was using a groupon also. I obliged and let them know that water was just fine. My guess is they realized I wanted to buy my drinks in addition to our meals, and the waitress came back a few minutes later and told us she would put our drink order on a separate check. Nice save on their part - I was a bit miffed at first!

My second mistake was not realizing how excessively sweet their mojito was going to be. I saw at the bottom of the glass, what appeared to be a large spoonful of sugar. In this case, it didn't help the medicine go down. After them accommodating me with the drink order and all, I didn't want to make a big to do out of this, so I soldiered my way through my drink.

I ordered a shredded beef dish, and my wife a shredded/pulled pork dish. Apparently Cuban's like bell peppers and onions a heck of a lot more than I do. The peppers and onions with my dish accounted for about 3/4th's of the meal. I ate two or three slices of the peppers and a few slices of the onion, but was not satisfied with the small amount of beef the meal came with for a sticker price of $16, and even at $8 since I was paying about half with the groupon.

My third mistake was choosing to sub their house vegetables for the beans and rice. I don't eat that many carbs, so often I will exchange potatoes, fries, rice, etc for whatever vegetable is available. The waitress explained that it was a mixture of squash, zucchini, mushrooms, and a few others. In reality, it turned out to be a few slices of squash, a few slices of zucchini, a couple of mushrooms, and guess what, a bucket load of chopped bell peppers and chopped onions. They were also nice enough to charge me extra for the substitution with the meal now totaling $18 before tax and tip.

Two $6 mojito's, two $16 meals, an upcharge for the vegetables, and a $5 forgettable appetizer (I don't exactly remember what it was at this point). I was leaving with a $65 meal after tax and tip, hey, I saved $15 on the groupon though.

I say that first just in case this review is too long and you do not read on, that is the must have sandwich. Our waitress said it was her favorite and she wasn't just overselling it was fantastic!! We also tried the brocolli rabe sandwich which was good, especially the bread but still couldn't compare to the pressed filet. The sandwiches won't disappoint, and neither will the desserts (be sure to ask for a dessert menu) both the cheesecake and the grilled banana bread and panna cotta were delicious, particularly the grilled banana bread, what a concept. The only thing that disappointed were the appetizers, we tried the tostada and the yakitori trio. The tostada simply wasn't very good but was shareable, unlike the yakitori trio which has three meat skewers that are hardly enough for one, but tasty. Overall, the place is midway on the price range, apps $7-$10, sandwiches $11-$13 and desserts $3-$7, you'll be tempted to try several items so if you have to skip something pass on the apps, because the service is plenty fast enough to wait, another plus.

We got there at 5:03 PM and almost every seat was already taken. Luckily we got there 3 minutes after they opened as opposed to 7 minutes after we wouldn't have found an open seat for quite some time had we done that. 

I was excited to see poke on the menu. That's a dish that's very difficult to find in Pittsburgh. I've honestly never seen that available here. It met my expectations and then some. We also had the chips and salsa. It was nice to see a place serving more than just one basic salsa with their chips. They gave us three different salsas and they all tasted great.

Two nights ago my boyfriend and I were hanging out a friends, and we were crazy hungry at about 10pm. Caliente was suggested and chosen. We went for their five-cheese calzone and jalapeno poppers. 

The food took about an hour to arrive, which I guess makes sense for a late night. We probably should have just walked there, but we were too lazy to do that, plus we were gaming. 

The food arrived and it looked amazing. The calzone was definitely big enough for two people, but certainly could have fed three. At first bite I was in love. Cheesy deliciousness danced around my tongue and my hunger was sated. I was a bit of a challenge to eat it all though, so I shared with my friend. 

The jalapeno poppers were pretty tasty too. They weren't overly fried or greasy. They were just right! They could have been spicier though. 

There's not a lot else I can say about Caliente. Their pizza and food is consistently delicious, they employ friendly people and the price is right for what you get. I highly recommend Caliente and some of their great happy-hour deals.",2014-05-17 16:45:04

Four pieces came topped with big chunks of mozzarella cheese and then covered high with chopped tomatoes, bits of basil, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar.

Hubby ordered the individual sized Italian Beef deep dish pizza. It came with his choice of a side item and he opted for the garlic Parmesan french fries. His pizza was really good and had a perfect balance between the sweet peppers and the hot peppers. It came with a side of au jus to dip in.

We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's patio fit the bill.  The second floor patio provided nice views of the Bellagio lake,and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!

We started with some guacamole and queso which came with two huge baskets of corn chips.  The guacamole was ok, the cheese was really runny, and the chips were in tiny pieces which make dipping a challenge.

For mains, between us we had the Baja fish tacos, the jalapeno chicken, and the southwest cobb salad.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, but the overall flavour was good and spicy.  The fish tacos featured grilled fish which was also a bit try, and they definitely weren't the best I'd ever had.  The salad looked great, and was a huge portion.

Tried a few apps and drinks, then came back for lunch a few days later. The drinks trend on the light and fruity side, and the foods are fresh with several healthy options available. Good spot for brunch or a girls night out. 

BEEF CARPACCIO ($14): thin sliced raw beef with parm-reg, balsamic glaze, and arugula. The regular portion is fairly large, fitting for the price. Really enjoyed this app.
SPICY SHRIMP PASTA ($16): Shrimp, tomato, arugula, and pasta in a Sriracha cream sauce that wasn't nearly spicy enough, IMO. I rarely eat pasta, but this was a fun mix of lighter ingredients that kept the dish from being too heavy. The sliced grilled bread added some much needed crunch.
CHIMICHURRI CHICKEN SANDWICH ($13): Large portion of thin-pounded chicken cutlets on a soft baguette style roll. Cheese received on sandwich did not appear to be queso fresco as stated on menu, and I didn't taste or see the avocado mousse. Chimichurri sauce was thick and chunky but seemed to be missing something in the flavor. Not sure why there were a ton of red pepper flakes on this.
HAND CUT FRIES ($6): These were soggy and limp mere minutes after ordering, but they were skin-on with sea salt, so they were more flavorful than expected. The garlic aioli was delicious, couldn't stop dipping! Can't imagine how much better these would be if the fries were actually crispy.

I'm not a huge fan of the Container Park, but I really like this restaurant's upstairs location and glass windows, which make it light and airy. The bird motif throughout is a cute decorative touch, and the bright colors and warm staff are welcoming.

2. The Dosas... this and this alone should make you speed over. I think they have 15! That's nuts... NUTS! I'm used to seeing maybe 3 or 4 different kinds at a place.

3. The Flavor... everything I tried was incredible. And although spice/heat is key to Indian cooking, theirs is well balanced, and not so hot that you can't taste anything. 

I had vegetable jalfrezi, chicken tikka masala, masala dosa and garlic naan. All of it was awesome! (GET THESE THINGS!) Even the garlic naan, which I sort of feel like is tough to make incredible, but it was incredible. It arrived at the table piping hot and aromatic and didn't have an offensive garlic flavor. The chicken tikka masala was some of the best I've had, topping some of the curry I long for in London. The veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce. And the dosa. Ohhhh the dosa. It was good, not my favorite, but with so many options, I can't wait to get back and try another one... maybe more adventurous than this one. 

Huge props to the stellar staff that made sure we had no questions about the menu, kept water glasses full, and told us they will have beer/wine/liquor soon. (Just wrapping up some paperwork.) They also sent us home with leftovers in boxes and gave us extra rice. Very kind. 

The atmosphere ain't much, so don't go expecting to be transported to India or anything. There is some nice stuff hand painted on one wall, but that's about it. Small space. Bright light. No tunes playing the night I was there. I didn't notice construction dirt or dust so I'm guessing they cleaned up after what sounds like a rushed opening. And my feeling has always been, if I'm there the first week, I'm going to make a few exceptions anyway knowing they're still trying to find their footing. These guys have though. And if food remains consistent, this will be my go to for Indian stuffs in Madison!",2013-11-07 05:26:37
l3y403FrP45NApNOS4upQg,QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,4,1,1,1,"Hands down one of the best locations for a catch up session with galpals. The smell of coffee filled my senses as I paced towards the cafe, carefully savoring every detail of Tivoli Village. You can't go wrong with its exquisite European touch and sophisticated vibe but I can't help but question the quality of their fruit smoothies.

$3.75 (tax included) for a small fruit smoothie isn't bad. Plus, you can add up to 3 flavors (including mango, strawberry, blueberry, banana, pineapple etc.) with either orange juice, apple juice or regular as its base.  I opted for mango-banana with a milk base and despite it sounding really healthy, not to mention, being made at a really classy location, it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. There was just no wow factor to it. In fact, I believe I tasted way too much banana and almost no mango. My friend had a medium strawberry-banana smoothie and she didn't seem so enthusiastic about it as well. There's hope though because our other galpal couldn't stop raving about their yogurt (with fruits and granola). I don't exactly know how much it was and I tell ya, she had nothing but good things to say about it so you might want to try that out instead. 

Nonetheless, the smoothie pulled down the rating a notch. Perhaps it could redeem itself next time I try another item on the menu. We'll see!",2012-07-09 04:02:04

I don't know if this is strange, but my wife's favorite American food is Burgers. Having said that, we have been going out of our way, to try every Burger joint on the west-side. I have to say after trying: Farmer Boys(very good), Smash Burger(over rated), 5 Guys Burgers(worst burger, but insanely good Fries), Montana Meat Packing Co.(very good), In-N-Out(best service & wife's favorite), Red Robin(great, but pricey), Chilli's(so-so for the price), as well as the Real National Fast Foods: Burger King(best of the Nationals), Wendy's(love the Red Head in the commercials, burgers lack flavor), Carl's Jr(not bad, but also not great), McDonald's(a familiar friend, but never the first choice), Jack In The Box(hate the burgers, love everything else), & Sonic(way over-priced). We have not tried: Any Asian Burger joint, Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, Applebee's, Heart Attack Grill & White Castle.

After everything is said & done, Fatburger is still my favorite all-around Burger joint. Keep this in mind, I love a thick, juicy burger cooked Medium Rare to Medium, any more than that & I consider the burger to be burnt. I also love Fat/Steak fries or Potato Wedges. Fatburger has everything I look for in a Burger Joint.

The bad things people say about Fatburger: They take forever to make your food- yeah, this is true, but everything is made to order & I get the Fattest Burger, with Fat Fries & this gives me the perfect time to have a pre-meal smoke. Service is bad- Not True. I have been to almost all of the West-Side Fatburgers & have always had better service than a McDonald's or Burger King. Fatburger is pricey- yeah, this one is true, but if you eat as much as I do, I normally spend just as much at McDonald's or Burger King...... I just need 1 FatBurger, instead of ordering 4 normal fast food sandwiches/burgers.

The Skinny on Fatburger: If you love your burger, thick & juicy burgers & the option of  steak fries, Fatburger is the best California Chain Burger Joint.",2015-01-27 22:28:18

FOOD:  I had the pesto panini and it was just okay.  They served it up on a plate but didn't look very appetizing.  Super plain plate, super plain panini.  My fellow alums were enjoying their pasta dishes and pizza.  Both looked ten times better than what I got.  I'll get the pasta next time.

AMBIANCE:  Pretty hectic because of the way they set the place up.  Instead of really getting into it, I'll just leave it to the other Yelpers to describe it.  I suggest you read a couple of their reviews to get the lay of the land and how it works...or not, it's cafeteria style and you use a charge card they give you there.  Easy enough.  The place looks pretty clean with some green plants here and there and plenty of seating and lots of windows.

SERVICE:  It's cafeteria style, did you get a server come up to you in fifth grade and ask if you want flat or sparkling water?  Did the lunch lady eloquently describe how the Sloppy Joe was prepped that morning?  There's no real service - I mean, there's a coupla hostess chicks and the person who took your order was nice and all, but I can't really grade them on service.

I'll be back.  Avoid the panini, especially if you're with company that ordered pasta, salad, or pizza.

We ordered the breakfast sandwiches, both in bacon and sausage. The order came in fairly quickly despite the small issues of working with a new system (the place opened on super bowl weekend). Waffles sandwiches were great, the waffles were fluffy, the eggs and sausage/bacon we're properly cooked.

Other reviewers mentioned them having a lot of drinks for $2, but I didn't see any.  They have a small list of $2 food options, but it's separate from the regular menu, so it's not easy to find.  I wish they did a better job of highlighting the $2 options since they named the whole place after them.

I had the buffalo chicken wrap, which was ok.  The chopped celery was a nice addition, but it was not nearly spicy enough to be called buffalo.  I tried adding some tabasco, but it's just not the same.  My husband said his philly sandwich was also just ok, but we both really liked the fries.  I wish my wrap came with a pickle spear.  We both agreed that the best food item was my son's mac and cheese from the children's menu.  I love that you can just get mac and cheese for $2 instead of ordering a whole kid's meal with a side and drink for $5 like most places.  We usually just skip ordering something for him if that's the case, because he can't eat that much and only drinks water.  It was fun for him to be able to get his own food at a restaurant for once.  And the mac and cheese was delicious!  My husband and I both said if we go back we'll pay more attention to the mac and cheese offerings on the adult menu.

While I was pleased with the mac and cheese from the kid's menu, I was a bit disappointed when we asked for two high chairs and they told us that they only have one.  Fortunately we were able to keep our younger child in her stroller at the table and use their single high chair for our older child, but if it had been occupied when we arrived we would have had no choice but to leave.

Two Bucks seems like a pretty nice bar.  I like the interior, which was open and clean, and I liked the garage door style front to open the bar into the patio area.  They had many televisions over the bar, and lots of specials and events plastered all over the walls.  We didn't have any issues with the service being slow like others have mentioned, but the place was pretty empty when we were there.  I would definitely come back.",2015-06-29 13:22:30

While many of the items on the menu could have come from a Szechuan restaurant in any large city, the authenticity of the taste didn't quite live up to my expectations. 

Their food is doused in way too much sauce, as if they're trying to compensate for taste. The food wasn't the freshest I've had, but when you take an hour and a half to deliver something that you said would take 45 minutes, it could take away from the freshness. 

Their cuts of meat also weren't of the quality I'm used, giving it a stale taste. My least favorite part, however, was that their chicken dishes aren't boneless. I ordered their Deep Fried Chicken with Dry Chili Peppers, a favorite of mine, and was sorely disappointed.

The chicken wasn't fully fried, creating a dichotomy between the crispy outsides and the soft insides. Also, the chicken had bones in it, making it extremely difficult to eat. 

However, I will give a huge props to their Fried Sweet Bun, which was absolutely delicious. And at $3.55 for 10, it's also a complete steal. Too bad you have to order an additional $11.45 worth of other mediocre food to get them to deliver.

And with that, my quest for good Chinese food in Madison continues on.",2013-09-24 01:22:31

Parking lot sucks.

I went in after getting my fresh squeezed sugar cane juice at lee's in the same shopping center. I was needing some HP ink for an office jet printer and saw their sign and figured lets try em out.
When I walked in I saw a lot of ink cartridges on the wall and felt good about getting what I needed.

It's not self serve and the inks are behind the counter. Lady comes out and greeted me. I looked around and the had some printers copiers for sale too. Not new but looked like repaired units that didn't get picked up. It seems like just buying a new one these days is cheaper than a repair would be. So repair uhhhh no, I'm going new.
Anyways I told her the model and they had it $17.99 original HP. So she goes over and also pulls out their house brand packaged refill. She really seemed to push  that one and said $10.99. I'm like hmmm cuz I always go for original OEM ink because I have bunch of printers and had 1 bad experience. She sold me on their house one so I said I'll try it. So then asks me if I have the old one to ""trade in"" I said noooo. She says then there's a $2 core charge. I started laughing cuz at the moment that shit just sounded funny.. Really a core charge on a $11 item. I throw like 5 of these out in the trash. She assured me I could just bring in a core to get my $2 bucks back . I love the add on and she did a good job presenting it. The place was clean and they were convenient and had what I needed.
All around good experience, but let's see how the house brand performs. 

Update...cartridge was terrible and only lasted a few days and maybe printed 30 pages. I replaced it with HP original and all is good.
I wont be back and they can keep the stupid $2 ""core' charge

Would have been 4 star rating when i started, but after terrible product performance 2 stars for this transaction.",2012-09-22 19:12:43

Also ordered a chicken appetizer... it was pulled chicken on a plate. Very good... mixed it all together with the guac and the chips.. excellent mish mash do it yourself appie lol

I ordered the fish tacos again, they were as awesome as the first time.  Friends ordered the beef and chicken tacos and the burrito. ALL AWESOME. 

For the drinks, we had sangria and beers and they were great as well.

I somehow sense that the end may be near or at least close to it for this once great Teppan restaurant that used to be a family fave when it was known as Blowfish. It has been at least a year since we last visited, and we had pretty high expectations because of overall good experiences since they opened. 

So one evening last week my wife and I met my mom for a Teppan meal (no sushi) and we expected the food to be of the the usual high caliber that we had all come to know and expect here. The first tip off that things were a little awry was that the teenage hostess couldn't locate our phoned in reservation from early that day. Not that we really needed them, as the place was quite empty for a Friday night at 7PM. 

We started with some Edamame and Boneless Korean BBQ ribs as starters. The ribs arrived in a sizzling hot fajita type platter, but were much less tasty than I remembered - and a bit gristley with more fat than meat.

Many at the table also commented negatively on one of the most typically thoughtless items  - the green salad. The lettuce tasted like it had been left open to dry out in a refrigerator - extremely cold dry iceberg lettuce leaves, with a dull dressing that had no expected flavors of ginger or sesame, with a cloyingly sweet almost bottled flavor. Yech.

We also all ordered the fried rice, which was almost inedible. It had no taste, was oily and not cooked enough by the teppan chef, and again not at all like I remembered from my prior experiences.

Speaking of the chef, get this: Somewhere in between the typical flaming onion volcano (yawn) etc... the non-Japanese chef asked me if I would like to have a chunk of broccoli ""flipped"" into my waiting mouth. 

OK, I have had teppan chefs do some cute stuff before, but this one struck me a little odd. I politely declined, but the couple with their little boy across the way enthusiastically motioned to the chef. 

Woman opens mouth W-I-D-E like a trained seal...

Ping! 

Broccoli hits woman in side of cheek, chunk of broccoli falls to the floor.  

Ping! 

Big chunk pops into woman's mouth! 

Score!

Then hubby went for it too! Ping! More pieces fling to the floor. This whole spectacle kinda sums up Electric Eel these days - you just can't help feeling sorry for them - But what happened to this once great place??? 

My wife and both I ordered the chicken, and my mom ordered the lobster and Fillet combo. The chicken was as dry as a bone and tasteless. My mom was also unimpressed. It's very obvious that the owners have really let the food quality go here, as other reviewers have mentioned. No question.

This is not an inexpensive meal either - easily $125 for the three of us (3 glasses of wine). Cha-ching.

On a side note I used to casually know the owner Barry, and in the old days  he and his old business partner used to greet us warmly. On this occasion we saw him as he nervously tiptoed past our table, half smiled as he walked by... but didn't take even 30 seconds to chat and welcome us back. Nada.


Gee,  I dunno but something has definitely changed for the worse at this once great place and we are not likely to return again.",2012-02-14 06:26:27
2cGLv5hCmKOMmWg-NYW6_w,sOudRDE_R3VYni0rEYFkSA,poSV39UqEg-gpESXafS9-g,3,0,0,0,"I'm so disappointed by this location so far.  My first visit was lackluster but fine as was this one.  The management even contacted me for more info so they could straignten their issues out.  That's nice but there is clearly a lack of leadership on site.  There are plenty of people working though.  I counted 18!!! people in the front of the house.  About half were standing around dancing and half were cleaning.  From my restaurant experience that's a very successful ratio actually.

- Still no happy hour and this time there was no happy hour pricing on drinks.  This is funny because there was last time I was there.  Also, the bartender even gave us a run down of the happy hour prices before ordering our drinks.  
- Ordered some raw oysters that came out lukewarm. Once my friend and I ate 1 oyster each we just stared at each other with an ""oh no, what just happened?"" look.  If you've ever been sick on oysters you get awfully skittish if something tastes off. Especially in Phoenix in August.  We had to send them back which is an unfortunate waste of food.  What likely happened is someone put them under a heat lamp before serving.  Even if that's the case, I certainly wasn't taking any chances.  
- One of our drinks was made with the wrong liquor.  They did end up comping that.  
- Second time I've been where no salt/pepper or utensils are available at the bar.

The upshot here is the bartenders and staff were nice and the food is (usually) very good.  I was so excited about this location since I live two minutes away but both visits thus far have left me shaking my head wondering what's going on.  I'll be back but, quite honestly, I can't see any reason to return until closer to the end of the year when, hopefully, it catches up to itself.",2015-08-28 16:58:13

Went to this place to pick up marinated chicken for a bbq. After reading the reviews I was a bit weary. But went anyway. This review is based solely on marinated chicken, chicken Briyani and fish pakora.

The poultry was marinated in a variety of flavours- tandoori, non spicy tandoori, afghani tikka, lemon spicy, jalapeño, mint chicken and etc. the price for each flavour varied but was at 3.99-4.99 a pound. It was reasonable and tasted good when grilled.

Chicken Briyani was okay - big chicken pieces. Fish pakora was okay too.

I wouldn't come here to get curries and take out though. However it seems reasonable priced for that and the flavours are decent. 

It's worth checking it out for chicken and things you want to put on the grill! It's not really just a restaurant - it's a meat and take out place too!!",2015-07-12 01:57:22

Zipping down Queen Street East to avoid the horribleness that is the DVP (aka Don Valley Parking Lot) during rush hour to get home to Scarborough, I have driven by Gio Rana's many times.  There is signage, or label - just a grotesque and prominent nose that looms overhead the entrance that has you hoping that no slimy boogers are going to land on your head upon entering.  The restaurant has been dubbed by locals as the ""Nose.""  I've pondered many times as to why one would choose such a monstrosity as its logo and how it has anything to do with (Italian) food.  The most clever reason I've come up with so far is that food is meant to tantalize the senses, and more often than not, our appetites are aroused simply by inhaling the whaff of aromatic food does the trick.  My more politically incorrect notion is that it might be a play on the stereotype that Italian's have really big schnoz's :p

The decor inside the restaurant is just as puzzling as the jutting nose out front.  Some may call it an ecclectic mish mash of randomness that is actually quite refreshing, some may call it minimalistic, and some may start answering on behalf of Gio Rana's for the up and coming Restaurant Makeover's casting call.  With tables spaced tightly together, I was already thinking of escape routes once this place got busy - and boy did it ever!  The walls are rather ""industrial"" looking as they are bare walls that look like they've been mid-stripped for repainting but then was abandonned.  The focal point is a vent that has been creatively made to resemble a hanging plant.  The mish mash of paintings distracts you until the server comes to tell you the specials.  What place do Japanese paintings have in an Italian restaurant?  Beats me!

A bread plate is quickly presented before us.  The browner and probably ""healthier"" alternative of the two is bland, boring, and a little too boring - while the white tomato bread is almost too pillowy soft.  The balsamic vinegar and olive oil dip however is quite interesting.  Although a tad bit skewed towards the olive oil side, the actual balsamic had an almost sesame-ish and nutty flavour to it that I liked. 

Their cocktails have some pretty raunchy names (e.g. Pink Panty Pulldown or Sexy MOFO).  I ended up going for the French Martini which was made with Chambord, Vodka and Pineapple Juice .  I loved the bit of foam at the top as it gave the drink a creamy texture.  It was a great cocktail, just the right amount of sweet and the alcohol content was not overpowering.

We shared the Seared Scallops & Braised Pork Belly as an appetizer.  I had pretty high expectations for this dish and was rather disappointed by a leaner pork belly which meant it was dried and not as moist or juicy.  The scallops were not overcooked, but lacked the soft and tender texture I look for in a scallop.  In short, while taste-wise this dish was great, it was off on textures. 

The daily pasta special with a roasted half-lobster with spaghettini tossed in garlic butter and tomatoes was a 50/50.  The solid chunks of lobster were easy to eat, but it had an almost ""grainy"" or ""stringy"" texture to it.  For me, the best part of this dish was the actual spaghettini as it wasn't drenched in sauce and was delicious in its simplicity.  Nothing ruins a pasta dish more than being drowned in a heavy sauce. 

We also ordered the Ossobucco which I can say is one of the best I've had.  While I've no doubt had more tender ossobucco in my lifetime, the sauce is what blew me away.  The flavour of the bones fused with no doubt, some butter and wine made this rich sauce drinkable.  I must confess that long after the actual veal was reduced to a bone, I consumed a few spoonfuls of the sauce.  This dish is quite a ""heavy"" dish in that the flavours are really bold and the portion sizes can be overwhelming.  While others may frown upon a smaller portion size at Gio Rana's, I thought the portion size was just right.  And isn't quality more important than quantity anyways?  Plus, you have to save a little bit of room for dessert! 

For dessert I opted for the Goat Cheesecake with Lemon Curd.  I loved the subtle grainy texture that the goat cheese gave to the cake.  The berries reduction also had a slight hint of licorice flavour to it that I liked.  The lemon curd was subtle and not overpowering.  Suffice it to say, I ate most of this divine dessert.

I really really wanted to give the Nose a higher rating.  But I really really was disappointed with the pork belly, and I really really didn't enjoy the noise level that stemmed from sardined tables and loud music in the backdrop.  Service was pretty good as our server checked up on us a few times, our bread plate was replenished when empty, and we were given new plates before our entrées came.

Sides here are a la carte which is rather pretentious for this casual dining resto.  Next time I think I'll come with friends to share small plates.",2012-02-16 15:49:24

On my visit I had the chicken and waffles tacos (recommended by my server) and the whiskey ginger sour. The chicken and waffles were good. You get three waffles stuffed with chicken pieces. I was expecting them to be hotter than they were but I truly enjoyed them. The chicken was spicy and the waffles were very sturdy and by that I meant they kept their shape and held the chicken well. The syrup was sweet but not too sweet. I asked for more of the hot sauce butter to add a little extra spice. 

Now they whiskey ginger sour Hot the spot. I could have sucked that down it was made so well. I don't taste much ginger but the flavor was good.

The place is cute and a little modernized.  However it's chilly inside.  And I am not talking about  the spice in the food either.  So if you visit bring your sweater.  The waitress was hard to understand but we got our orders in.  We requested to put no salt in the food because my father-in-law was sensitive to it.  The  choices are typical but the presentation for the food was fancy.  The food came out one at a time (15 minutes wait) but it was still salty!! I  did like the appetizer.  We ordered all seafood dishes except for the bbq chicken.  We also ordered coconut  ice cream for dessert.  The waitress said  it was for one person but it's huge! Also,  if you are planning to come here after the gym make sure it's not ARM DAY!  They must have the heaviest teapots.  It weighed as much as a baby elephant!

It really was outstanding service.

All the food that I had was very good.  Its not phenomenal food but is very good nonetheless.  Burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc.  It's just basic bar food stepped up a notch.

I just wish I lived closer to this place so I don't know when I'll be able to make it back.  However, if I'm ever in the area again I know you really can't miss with this place with it's great atmosphere, excellent service, and solid food selections.",2012-03-26 16:36:31
YZrGl1NMvXwkdCwzkyQw6g,0EhPIlDozxGKpbbHRr6vZg,a2qlFwIy9vUvfUb4EnQNmA,4,3,0,2,"Randita's is the newest addition to the quaint business district along Commercial Avenue in Aspinwall. They focus on organic and vegan cuisine. Now, I'm not vegan (cheese and I have way too good of a thing going for me to ever give that up!), but I can appreciate healthy, non-GMO food (at least some of the time -- other times I just want my damn french fries, and that's okay too :) Anyway, my husband and I stopped in here for lunch the other day and had a lovely meal.

The space inside is small -- only about 7 tables and a small bar. It is clean, cozy, and charming, with deep red walls and fresh flowers adorning each table. For lunch, my hubby and I decided to split a few things -- African peanut stew, veggie burger, and an order of chips and salsa.

The chips and salsa came out first, and it was delicious. The salsa was clearly homemade and not some crappy from-the-jar stuff. Tons of chunks of tomato, jalapeno, onion, and other spices. Super fresh! As for our meals, we really enjoyed both the stew and the burger. The African peanut stew is a sweet potato-based soup deliciously spiced with pepper, coriander, cayenne, and other warm spices. It had just the perfect amount of kick to balance the sweetness of the sweet potatoes. The whole peanuts garnishing the top added a nice salty, crunchy bite as well. The veggie burger was also delish. It was topped with a gourmet ketchup (no overly sugary Heinz ketchup here!) and coleslaw, and also came with an additional side of slaw. The slaw was really unique....thickly cut, unlike most coleslaws...almost like a dressed cabbage salad. The food here is clearly healthy and prepared fresh and with care, so I felt really good about what I was eating (which can't always be said when you dine out).

The one knock on this place is that the portion sizes are fairly small for the price. However, it IS all organic, non-GMO food, and that comes at a premium. Plus, for lunch, I'm not looking to leave super stuffed and needing someone to wheelbarrow me outta there. So I didn't mind the small portions.

They also do dinner, and our waitress said it's good to make reservations since they're so tiny. It looks like they might also have live music sometimes as well, since we saw guitars and music stands sitting in the corner. Oh, and the sign on the outside says they're also BYOB!

Overall, if you're looking for healthy, vegan, organic food that you can feel good about eating, definitely check this place out!",2015-07-12 14:06:49
k9lJR0pkN5Zf6v9a1avtpw,TwMSmTQjxVWJSJnErBIXlg,QNfh79NwsNnl-AngRhg2ww,3,0,1,1,"Decided to try this place with 3 friends last week and glad that we did.

We ordered:
-Tako Wasabi(3/5)
-Ume Seaweed Hotate Carpaccio(4/5)
-Tan Tan Men(5/5)
-Somekind of duck salad(3/5)
-Grilled Black Cod(3/5)
-Stone grilled Tajima Beef(5/5)
-Karaage(2/5)
-Sea Urchin Don(5/5)
-Aburi Toro Battera(4/5)

Out of all of the above, the Tan Tan Men is most memorable. We think the noodle is not one that can be bought anywhere in Toronto and deduced that it must be handmade. The broth also had a pretty good umami flavor to it, but not too strong to the point it would make you have chinese food syndrome.

The stone grilled tajima beef is a must to order if you come here. It's very soft and taste like it melts inside your mouth with barely any seasoning. (they provide some sauces though)

The Sea Urchin Don is a must try too. The uni provided the buttery taste to the rice and make it to taste like paella with no tomato puree. The buttery taste from the uni and the ginger sauce to get rid of the smell just brings out the flavor of the other seafood on the bowl.

Overall, we're really satisfied with the food. We're planning to go to other place for our desert, but the waitress brought us some frozen grape for us. The service was decent considering how crowded it was. Though, I'm still a bit pissed that my glass had some red hair or something inside it and the waitress didn't even say sorry and just left to get me a new glass (one that I hope she didn't spit on).",2013-04-28 02:02:17

Hmmm....what to eat?  Pizza?  Sure, sounds good.  

I was browsing Yelp and came across this pizza spot.  I take the 303 to work every day, and I noticed that this spot is right off the 303, about 2 miles down Happy Valley.  I decided to jump in my car and take a drive.  It's only about 20 minutes from my house, so the trip down here was pretty quick.  

I had looked at their menu online before I arrived.  It sounded like a cross between a ""build your own pizza"" (Fired Pie, MOD, Pieology etc) place as far as the pricing and ordering, and a nicer Neapolitan style (Pomo, La Piazza Al Forno etc) place as far as the type of pizza they make.  Your basic Margherita pie starts out at $7.99 and then goes up from there depending on what toppings you add.  I had my mind made up that I was going with a pizza with meatballs, onion and garlic.  Each topping is $1.00 (garlic is free), so my pizza, and a Coke came out to $13.00.  Not too bad.  A little more $$ than the ""make your own pizza places"", but less $$ than the ""good"" Neapolitan style places around town. 

About the ordering process......... Right when you walk in, there is a guy with the dough, forming pizzas.  He asks you what you want, and then you kind of move down the line.  The only problem with that is this........The menu board is behind the long counter.  They have specialty pies and bruscheta/salad options etc.  You don't see the menu though until you are half way down the line.  If you didn't know what you wanted, it would be a little hectic trying to walk down, browse the menu, then come back to tell the guy what you want.  It got a little more odd because after you tell the guy what you want, you then get asked by a lady at a register? what you ordered.  I guess she types that in so that when you get down to the cashier, the order is there in front of them?  I didn't get the purpose of her having to key in my order, then have to go somewhere else to pay for my order.  Maybe when they are super busy, it comes in handy?  There were only like 10 people in the place when I was there, and nobody else in line.  Anyways....when you get done with that, you pay the cashier, they hand you a number to stick on your table and then bring the pizza out to you when its ready.  On to the pizza...............

My Meatball, Onion and Garlic Pizza-  When this pizza came out, it looked pretty good.  It had plenty of meatballs and a nice amount of onions.  The cheese was a fresh mozzarella and it was a bit sparse, but that's how most Neapolitan style pizzas are, so it was alright by me.  I took a bite in and the flavors were very good!  The dough and crust were pretty soft and had only a little bit of char on it.  I prefer more char and other places around town have it down to perfection.  The crust was a bit more doughy/chewy than I prefer on a Neapolitan style pizza.  Still, not bad.  Overall, it was a decent/pretty good pizza.  I ate all 6 slices and left feeling full. 

I'm pretty sure I will be back again to try out a plain Margherita.  You could get that and a Coke for right around $10.00.   Not bad, not bad at all.",2016-01-01 03:27:34

Their tacos are fantastic! They've got a nice selection on their menu, where you order them individually. The mahi taco is one of my favorites here -- it is really fresh and refreshingly zesty! I can tell that they pride themselves in using good, fresh ingredients.

There's no way you can come here without getting the guac or cheese dip appetizer. The guac is delicious and full of flavor. The chips are also really good -- not too thick and not too thin.

I also recommend the Fajitas! The steak fajita is made with quality steak and topped with a cilantro sauce, which gives it a little bit of a bite and makes it unique compared to other fajitas I have had.",2016-11-06 15:56:07

1. Wings were SPICY! Just how I like them. They were crunchy. They could of maybe used more sauce. 
2. Didn't try the wings but my friend ate them all. That's a good sign lol
3. Salad was great just DRENCHED in dressing. Ease up on the dressing! 
4. Wall street pizza was delicious! Tasty. Crust was crunchy 
5. Didn't try Kahuna but my friends said it was good lol
6. OMG I would eat another! The cookies and ice cream was perfect 

The price for all 12 wings, 1 Chicken Caesar salad, 2 pizzas, and dessert, was $68.

I scored by copping two 5-gallon water bottles for the crib at $5 for two.  I also got my wrestling luchador mask, much needed for our upcoming Harlem Shake video.  Chaching!

Then if that was not enough, Mr. Garcia was kind enough to extend a complimentary bottle of dessert wine before walking us out of the restaurant over to the entrance for the Foundation Room and place us on the list under his name. I cannot wait to return to vegas to try yet another one of his venues. I am sure I will be just as impressed as before!",2012-07-10 07:12:24

Checked Yelp and found a few places, but the wife and I love Italian, so here we come.  Plus just a few minutes from the play.  Place looks nice from the outside, several vehicles parked outside on a Sunday afternoon, so it was a good sign.  Friendly greeting at the door and promptly seated.  The decor wasn't very complex, but it looked fresh, inviting...so we took our seats.

We reviewed the menus.  Nice solid classic Italian food, nothing fancy.  We ordered the salad with the arugula, cherry tomatoes, and gorgonzola to split.  Plenty to split.  The salad was nice and fresh.  A nice ""breadbasket"" was comprised of something like cut up pizza crusts from their wood-burning oven brushed with olive oil, herbs, and maybe a touch of garlic.  Yum.  A few minutes later, dropped in that bowl are some garlic knots, hot and fresh out of the oven.  YUMM!  We gobble up all and ask for more.  C'mon, it's too good!

After we finish the salad, the entrees arrive right on time.  The wifey gets veal piccata, which she says is very good.  I got mussels in marinara sauce.  We both substituted mixed veggies for pasta.  The veggies were carrots, broccoli, and summer squash lightly boiled so as to leave them al dente.  Perfect!  Everything tasted delicious in the tasty marinara sauce, which I'm sure would be excellent on pizza.  I only thought the mussels could have been cooked possibly so as to leave them a little more tender.  But they definitely tasted fresh.

For dessert, we split a house-made tiramisu.  This was the real deal, with good flavors of rum, coffee, cocoa dusted on top, and constructed with lady fingers.  

Our waitress was friendly, checked on us just the right amount, and came with the check in good time.

Unfortunately, we don't live near here, so it's not too likely we'll return soon, but I highly recommend it to anyone in the area.  This is excellent classic Italian food served right.",2015-08-03 04:03:43

1) The steak that I saw them putting on my salad was some sorry looking steak. It was dried up and looked pretty old. I asked for fresher meat and while I did receive some pieces of fresher meat, they still left the older portion that they served on my salad.
2) The ratio of steak to the size of the salad was too small.  They seriously need to look at increasing the amount of meat that they allot for the price of the meal.  My husband had the chicken kabob platter and he said the same thing -- not enough meat. We left feeling hungry.
3) The temperature of the steak was cold.  
4) The quality of the steak in my opinion was cheap.  It was very fatty and there were several pieces that I just couldn't eat because of being too hard to chew.  Since they are claiming to be a healthy type of restaurant, I expect leaner meats.

I have been frequenting Olivier, Shelby and the gang for quite sometime now and all I have to say is Thank God for Baguette Cafe. 

I love everything about this place. Upon entry into this unassuming cafe, you are greeted with a smile and the delightful smell of fresh baked breads and pastries. I love the purity and love that goes into the food here. It really is unlike any other cafe in the Las Vegas area. The staff is very enthusiastic about what they serve and it shows. Olivier will take the time, despite a line out the door at lunch time, to describe in detail the daily specials of soups, sandwiches and pastries. 

I have been here too many times to count. With the free wireless, I often find myself setting up shop and spending the morning or afternoon catching up on graduate school or just chatting with friends. 

Some of my favorite daily specials served: Chicken curry sandwich, shrimp bisque, french peasant stew, Moroccan chicken sandwich, gazpacho, spinach and cheese quiche, pear tart.....OK now I'm making myself hungry again.

They have a wide range of beverages and serve Illy coffee! 
Some of my favorite drinks: Thai iced tea, green tea iced tea, CHAI SO AMAZING. 

Warning: It becomes very busy at lunch time and also is not open on the weekends. Also sometimes food takes a bit due to the nature of the care that goes into the sandwiches they prepare.

They had a sample of their gemmes which was delicious but I was aching to try their macarons. I was really very torn between the cookie butter, nutella, and salted caramel, and asked the girl behind the counter which two I should get. She told me the first two, but upon check-out, I noticed that a Yelp check-in gets me a free macaron so I promptly ran out to my car to grab my phone to check in and was able to get my salted caramel. My husband opted for the lemon bar, and my kids each got a chocolate dipped pretzel rod. Prices here are very fair. $1.50/maracon, $2 for a good sized lemon bar and $1.50 for the pretzels. 

My husband couldn't even wait for the movie before he dove into his lemon bar. It was AMAZING!! Usually, I find lemon bars to be too tart, but this one had a perfect balance and was the best lemon bar I've ever had. To be honest, I haven't had too many because they all make me pucker with their tartness, but this one did no such thing. It was excellent and will certainly purchase one again from Peridot. The kids enjoyed their basic pretzel rods. They loved the gemmes, but for the same price and because I only allowed them to choose one treat, they chose the pretzels because they were bigger. No complaints there.

Onto the macarons. They rank like this: salted caramel, nutella, cookie butter. The salted caramel was heavenly!! The center wasn't solid and still kind of runny, and it was the perfect combination of salty and sweet. The nutella maracon was definitely very sweet in comparison, but tasted like... nutella. Lastly, the cookie butter, which I was most excited to try was a bit of a letdown. The cookie in my mouth ended up being kind of like paste when chewed with the filling, and the cookie butter tasted almost bitter. I don't know.

So I went to the Chinese Cultural center on Sunday, Chinese New Year, looking for Chinese culture. I found a street fair with such cultural gems as a booth for Wells Fargo loans, and one selling ""crazy Chinese hats."" I wanted authentic food, and the booths selling egg rolls and stuff from the market buffet were pretty much the opposite of what I was there for. So my date for the event and I decided to try one of the Chinese restaurants at the center, and I chose Szechwan Palace because I was in the mood for something spicy.

The place was packed, which was to be expected. Since a good portion of the conversation I heard taking place was in Chinese, I was hopeful that that this would be an experience similar to what I'd get in Seattle's international district. I knew that wouldn't be the case when I saw the menu, which was basically the same menu you'll find in any americanized Chinese restaurant.

So we just ordered the Szechwan dinner for two. Hot & sour soup, crab rangoons, fried rice, general tso's chicken, szechwan shrimp, and a rice based desert that I forget the name of. I thought all the dishes were decent, but nothing had the spice I expect from Szechwan cooking.

Joe's has a retro theme, so the look ends up being misinterpereted by some. The flies are a problem, though I don't know how you get around something like that in an open air setting. I can't remember if the farmhouse at South Mountain had the same issues, probably because I wouldn't go near it in July.

I dropped by for lunch today. My timing wasn't so good, as they were featured on The Food Network last night. We arrived at 11:45, stood on line for about 5 minutes and ordered. The food came out in about 10 minutes. My wife and I split the Ahi Tuna sandwich and the Portabello Mushroom sandwich. I thought both were excellent, though to hear Guy describe them on DD&D, you might have expected a bit more. The kids got the chicken tenders and mini corn dogs, I liked the way they were fried to a light crisp finish. The french fries were excellent.

$37.50 for a lunch for four was a little on the pricey side, but I expect we will be back again. It will definitely be a spot to go to from October through May.",2008-07-08 20:20:46

The decor is modern-cheap. Lot of fake wood with sharp angles and bright colors. From afar, the room looks great, but there's certain big things like peeling wall paper and a backed up bathtub that make it hard like this hotel.

Their Korean-Chinese dishes are also very very good.. their jjajjangmyun is second only to Young King's version in Los Angeles.

kRgWwX54n6mQgKj9ra2ybg,hkLERFVXO07vFNN5Ws_IAQ,1gQrMs-I8oKg2p-iRxznzQ,4,3,0,2,"I LOVE SOHO! A co-worker raved about SOHO's cozy interior and their phenomenal food. He and his girlfriend both work in the industry so I trusted his recommendation and was eager to get there.

After a sub-par, non fulfilling dining experience elsewhere on West 25th last week my boyfriend and I ventured past SOHO. We decided what the heck? Why not get a drink? We peeked in and immediately were taken. It is so chic and cozy inside. The lighting is dim yet inviting. It is primarily wood which gives it a rustic, southern look. There are tables however, I'm a bar person. 

The first time we went we got drinks and ended up ordering an appetizer. The menu looked so good we had to try SOMETHING. We ordered the clams casino and were both surprised when they gave us biscuits first. The biscuits come with an apple jam and some sort of delicious butter. Whatever they were they were delicious and I ended up enjoying a spoon of apple jam! Oops! The Clams were OK. I wouldn't say they were great and I probably wouldn't order them again. 

I went again last night for dinner - I vowed after my experience I would write a yelp review. It was fantastic from start to finish. I drank the menu drink with Bourbon, the name escapes me. It's delicious. As is their general selection of whiskeys and bourbons.It is HUGE! I started with the Farmer's Daughter salad which was bibb lettuce topped with avocado, pickled red onion, cucumbers, green beans, and a rich yet not overpowering buttermilk dressing. The pickled red onions alone are a reason for me to order the salad again. They gave it such a unique flavor and added crunch. The green beans were a little overpowering so I took off about half. Very very enjoyable salad.

 We split the Oyster appetizer. I was a little nervous after the clams casino that is would under-impress me --- and was I wrong. It was quite the opposite. They were phenomenal. They were hot, juicy, flavorful. For dinner we obviously had to go with the fried chicken. We got two different styles: Evenin Style and Late Night style. Evening style comes with Mashed Potatoes and Collard Greens whereas the Late Night Style comes with Mac'n'Cheese and JoJo's. I got the late night. My boyfriend got the Evening and he LOVED it. The mashed potatoes were really great as was the gravy. They both tasted homemade and were very savory. The only reason I would say I didn't love mine is the chicken.  Mine was pretty dry. And the JoJo's were REALLY greasy. Everything was good, don't get me wrong. It just could have been better. The mac'n'cheese, however, was fantastic! I loved that --- I barely shared. 

After dinner we finished up our drinks and talked to the bartender who ended up being the owner! He was talking about some of the hard to find bourbons and let us try one of them! It was great and a nice gesture. His wife (who is also the co-owner) was there as well. He introduced all of us and we gabbed for a few minutes before paying our tabs and heading elsewhere.

First off the lunch specials are enough to make you want to at least try it once-the food will make you come back for more.  $5.95 lunch specials to include soup, egg roll, rice and the crunchy noodles that you dip in sweet and sour-all to include your main dish with any type of meat you want and any level of spice you can customize.  The portions are gigantic-always.  I never can eat everything and usually take half of it to go.  The Chicken Pad Thai is what I usually order and I am never disappointed.  I order it a spicy 8 (from a 1 - 10 level).  It rarely is spicy enough for me (I can hear my BF now....blah blah blah) but I'm afraid that one day it will be really a spicy 8. LOL

Saturday was an odd day.  They usually have this cute teenager girl working the cashier and tables.  The cook, who I assume is the owner?, was doing it all as I believed him to be the only one there.  I must say that the guy handled it pretty well considering he had several tables occupied yet he still made time to check on them occasionally.  Gotta love a man who can multi-task!  

I ordered the Mongolian Chicken. I was in the mood for rice versus noodles this time.  The dish came with the rice on the side with the Mongolian chicken, onion and green onion.  While the chicken was very tasty, dang there were a lot of onions!  Like I said the portions they give you are so big so it didn't matter to me too much.  I just didn't eat most of the onions.  I didn't eat the eggroll that it came with.  It looked greasy and I rarely will eat them just because of that.  The BF ordered the Mongolian Beef.  That's what he always orders and it is always consistently yummy.

I always notice people picking up to go orders and there are always people seated as well.  They have a TV going that is muted BUT there is music that's playing that makes me want to actually rip my hair out.  For real.  Something about Celine Dion versus Thai food doesn't mesh well with me. hehe

The mussels were really delicious especially in a creamy sauce, the chicken breast was gigantic and seasoned well, however the vegetables, especially the beets were not that tasty. The creme brûlée was below average, not garnished at all, and tasted very plain. 

The service was good, a bit slow when the restaurant got busy; it seems a bit understaffed. The staff themselves were friendly, and our server was nice enough to change our desserts from the winterlicious menu to the regular menu. The restaurant itself could use some interior decorating as the chairs and tables make you feel like you're at a diner.  

I would definitely come back here as the menu has a variety of options and portions are big. Would like to try the steak next time.",2014-02-15 08:39:27

I went to the counter and ordered a pepperoni slice and soda.  The guy took the order but then when I went to sit at the counter...he said that I needed to order from the server.  

So the server came and I placed the same order.  Slice of pepperoni and a diet coke.

Food comes and I'm eating.  I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to get my own refill or wait for the server.  There is only one other table and they're regulars.   The server is there talking to them for about 10 minutes.

I'm hoping I could catch the attention of one of the two employees who are behind the counter, but they're in their own world.  So I stand up and refill my own soda.

Le personnel était super accueillant et sympathique. (J'ai été invité pour un événement privé, c'est évident que le personnel est accueillant et sympathique me direz-vous, eh bien, je vous assure que ce n'est pas toujours le cas).

Sur place, j'ai pu goûter plusieurs plats de leur nouveau menu... pizza, pâtes, viandes, etc. et même assister à une démo de cuisine italienne par le chef lui-même qui est bien drôle.

Pour moi, le plus important dans un restaurant italien est la sauce. Si la sauce est bonne, tout peu passer. Ici, la sauce tomate est absolument délicieuse! 

Il en va de même pour les boulettes de viandes qui sont juteuses et goûteuses. 

Je vous suggère la poitrine de poulet parmesan gratinée au mozzarella et la lasagne au ricotta et épinard. 

Ce qui m'a charmée? Les pâtes sont faites tous les matins que ce soit les pâtes ou les pâtes à pizza. L'endroit offre également des pâtes sans gluten, bien que celles-ci ne soient pas faites sur place, le restaurant n'utilise pas celles du commerce. Comme il y a trop de farine dans leur cuisine, ils ont trouvé préférable de faire affaire avec une entreprise qui leur fait des pâtes fraîches sans gluten. C'est tout à leur honneur. 

J'ai adoré mon expérience. Tout ce que j'ai goûté était très bon.

Firstly, this place is absolutely beautiful, the restaurant seems massive, it has high ceilings but still achieves a warm and romantic atmosphere. The ambiance is really great, especially on a cold night, you feel like you've been transported to a cool vacation spot. The food is also really good!

We ordered a number of dishes, and I wasn't particularly disappointed in any of them, but some were definitely better than others. The ambiance, like I noted was excellent, but on an absolutely freezing night we were seated very closely to one of the entrances and the breeze kept hitting us every time someone opened the door, which was quite frequent. We had asked to move but they mentioned that they were totally booked up so we were out of luck. I think they should opt to not let people sit there on nights like that since it was quite uncomfortable at times. After we started eating and drinking it was definitely less of an issue however. 

We ordered just about half the menu it seems but some highlights were: the pan con manchego, the selection of meats, beef tartar, the Croquetas de Setas, the queso frito, the lamb chops, the rib eye, scallop paella, and for dessert, the curros and semifrio. Some items I could probably take or leave were the wagyu meatballs and the patatas bravas. Not bad, but not super memorable. The rib-eye and the croquetas were the highlight for sure and for dessert, the semifrio was amazing, full of flavour and texture! The food is all beautifully presented as well as fresh tasting, with an expert focus on bold flavours and textures. We also ordered some wine and sangria and they were all great! 

The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is the price point. I really can't understand the justification for the high prices and tiny portions. For a group of 5, you'll probably need to order 2 or more of each menu item for everyone to try one piece. For the most part, the tapas have 2/3 pieces of food per order so it can get expensive when you start order 2-3 of each item. It's definitely not for the faint of wallet but it's an experience to try at least once or on a special occasion. 

The service was very good. Our drink glasses were filled regularly and the server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food, which was good as this was a new experience for me. He let us try a few wines before ordering a glass which was also a nice touch. I've never had spanish wine but everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. The sangria was delicious. 

Overall, I'd probably only come back if someone was footing the bill, I'd be hard pressed to spend what it takes to get full at this place, even though it's exceptionally good. If I won the lottery though, this would be one of my first choices for dinner!",2018-01-05 20:53:52

The room we were in was TINY, so if you are clausterphobic, be forewarned. One of the clues in our room was a little worn, so it set us back a bit of time, but all in all the clues were decent.

This is one of them.  I came to eat at Yupha's on a Monday night because my friend chose this restaurant to have her birthday party at with her friends and our Wild Dining MeetUp members.  30 people attended.  

I asked the server what items on the menu were considered truly authentic, that REAL Thai people from Thailand would order.  Is this authentic?  Is that authentic?  I told her I didn't wanna eat Whitey-Gringo Thai food.  Finally she said nothing on the menu was truly authentic as would be found in Thailand because we American's couldn't eat it, too spicy.   I agreed with her, told her that I spent 5 weeks in Thailand  in 2011 and just could not eat the food.  Even asking for NOT spicy, was so hot, that all I had was diarrhea.  So I ate only Australian steaks and pizza.  When I came back to the States, I was shocked to see I had lost 12 pounds (119 instead of 131).  I thought something was wrong with the scale.  

I love duck so I chose Ped Gra Prow, $18.00   It said Crispy Skin on the menu.  Crispy roast duck over onions, bell peppers, Thai basil & chili pepper.  The server said it had crispy skin, and I love duck with crispy skin.  I ordered it for the ""skin"".  The girl next to me ordered the same thing.  Her order came first and I commented that the skin did not look crispy at all!   It was coated with a dark soy-looking sauce, ""glistening"" on it.   She poked at it, NOT crispy.   I called the server and she said it wouldn't be crispy because they put a sauce on it.  Do I want it without the sauce?   I said yes.  Well as soon as I said Yes, the dish came out of the kitchen and it was ""too late"".  

The sauce was good (given rice was insufficient to eat the sauce with, like other reviewers said), but the duck, two legs of dark meat (I prefer dark meat) and some small additional pieces were so overcooked, hard and dry, that parts of it were like old jerky, and I had to spit it out (like eating bark).  When I told the birthday girl, after we all left the restaurant and went home, she said I should have sent the duck back.  Yes, trying to eat the leftovers, so hard and dry, tasting like vulcanized liver,  I should have sent it back, but the restaurant was so busy serving 30 people and their different orders.  I find it really hard to pull the meat off the bone, so tough the duck is.  I did tell the manager the duck was so hard and dry, when I left the restaurant, but I also commended them many times for their good service.

I tasted other people's orders such as Pad Thai, but nothing tasted good enough to come back here.  I am giving it 2 stars because I felt the service was not lacking like the duck was.  They handled 30 people very well and the food came out relatively quickly, without mistakes.  Otherwise I'd give it one star if service was lacking or rude (like Yelpers know Chinese restaurants are famous for), and food was bad too.
  
The thing I liked the most about the dinner was the Costco chocolate cake that the birthday girl bought for us.  I ate two pieces!   Yum !",2016-01-14 06:33:20

So much can change from visit to visit that I always find it a bit presumptuous to assume that a place is 5 stars worth of awesome or 1 star worth of non-awesome based on one measly visit.   And yet one measly visit to the Bronze Cafe, oh, 2 hours ago, and here I am anointing it with 5 stars.   

Enter the Tree of Life.   The Tree of life stars Brad Pitt in a Malick film about the life and the universe.   Yelp/RottenTomatoes Crossover alert!   Okay so this Pita stuffed with veggies and other vegan goodies like a cashew crema and a brazil nut crumble has nothing to do with the movie, but much like I had left the theater after seeing Tree of Life, I had a lot of questions about this Tree of Life after I left Bronze Cafe.   Namely:  was that one of the tastiest pita breads I've ever had? (yes).    Did I really just enjoy a Pita stuffed without any meat products?  (yes).   Did I really just order something called ""Banana Boy Bait""?  (YES)   Well how I really ordered it was I said something along the lines of ""and one of those banana bread things"".    Then the guy who seemed to be running the joint goes ""Banana Boy Bait?!""  to which I looked around sheepishly before saying yes.   It's totally worth any stares you might receive though.   It lasted all of 3 minutes on the table.   I'm not joking when I say I plan to try every sandwich and every Vegan dessert on the menu before my own personal Tree of Life wilts away and has me feasting on dirt and worms.   

Service was friendly, quick and efficient.   The dining area was clean and there wasn't any air of pretentiousness that I think Vegan friendly places can oftentimes be stereotyped with.   In fact it was the complete opposite.

I didn't need to use the restroom so I didn't get to participate in the gender neutrality that it provides.   The thought excites me though because I've heard from some of my female friends that sometimes you all have couches in there sometimes and I'm curious how this translates here.

The BBQ duck rolls were melt-in-your-mouth good and arrived on a wood plank as did the chicken wing tacos which had a great zesty sauce. The truffle aioli fries were well-seasoned and the beet salad with buffala was great (in true Top Chef fashion). The eggplant dish was equally delicious. 

Our only complaint was the very slow and scarce service. We literally had to hunt down a hostess on the patio as there was no one inside and had to flag down a bus-boy to get a waitress to bring our bill.

I first visited this place as a student, then when I graduated and my siblings graduated, for Nuit Blanche and various events.  As you can tell, this place is a place with multitude of uses.  If you're a student and need a place to work, you can visit the cafeterias or study halls with amazing high ceilings, wonderful architecture and art.  The other students there would definitely put you in the mood to get down to business!!!  If you already graduated, come here to do your work!!!  They have a phone charger in the study hall, which is a plus for long hours of studying or working.

Various events are held in several rooms contained in Hart House, which include great halls, cafeteria and the Hart house theatre!  There is also a chapel for quiet contemplative moments, which creates a perfect ambiance for quiet contemplation due to its ancient architecture. When you step outside, you will find ample photographic opportunities.  Hart House faces a roundabout with several other historical UofT buildings that you can pose in front of, or pose in the middle of the round green space and take a picture of several of the architectural delights around.  If you have a drone, take a bird's eye view picture!

If you need help finding the interesting spots around Hart House and inside, you can use Pokemon Go and it will point you to several interesting art pieces/point of interests that you may not know exists there!  This place is a Pokemon Go pokestops  haven!!! 

So, check this place out if you're a tourist, a student, to work, to eat, to hold an event, to take pictures, a Pokemon Go player, to meditate/contemplate/pray, if it's Nuit Blanche, just check it out!!

Needless to say this resulted in many a restaurant dinner but despite that (thanks to Thanksgiving) an ever accumulating pile of dishes we now call ""Mount Doom"". 
So even when the heavens poured their miserable buckets of fall water on us we dragged our butts outside to enjoy food at its finest: the kind with no dishes. 

This is how we ended up here, Gado Gado, a small, simple but clean, Indonesian restaurant...that was entirely empty (and it stayed that way). 

A slightly confused waiter came up to our table, handed us menus, and took our drink order: Extra spicy Caesar (as per usual) por favor! 

I ended up ordering Bakpao and Laksa, while the husband unit decided on fried chicken skin and Sate. 
We also got side orders of sambal, krupuk and nasi kuning (why do I have to pay for a miserable little bowl of sambal and two pieces of krupuk?...sigh).
The Bakpao was awesome, loved every bite of it, even kept one for the moping hubby across the table who didn't enjoy his chicken skin (it was fine, not great however) and he loved it as well.
My Laksa was good but not extraordinary, I ate most but got bored with it after a while.
Meanwhile the husband was poking at his food and making little soy figures on his plate, I asked him what was up and he responded something along the lines off ""I don't like this, it doesn't taste like Sate at all, I can't find any peanut flavour"", so I guess he didn't  enjoy his meal.
 I must say it did look rather sad, meat sticks, no Sate sauce, a tiny spoon of veggies and some steamed rice.
At one point slightly confused waiter man shows his face again, and I order another Caesar, this resulted in more confusion and me having to confirm it as if he never had a second drink order before, poor guy, the Caesar is pretty good too so what is all the confusion about?
*shrug*

And that was the end of our Gado Gado adventure.
The prices weren't bad, despite having to pay for the sambal and krupuk, so that's a plus.
I would come here again, but for lunch and only for the Bakpao (oh fine, and probably a Caesar, but just one), the rest was just not good enough to warrant a second visit.

The music for the evening was OK, mainly house and trance, It was also extremely loud and hard to converse down by the booth and being a lounge type place i thought it would have been better.. but than again it was prob because we were close to the dance floor.

What I didn't like was the fact that the washrooms were downstairs and we had to travel a flight of stairs. In heals that is not a good combination.

The original Caldense Bakery is only a few blocks west in Little Portugal on Dundas a little west of Ossington. This neighbourhood has no shortage of Portuguese bakeries, but Caldense is the most chain-like with the multiple locations selling the same baking. The coffees they make are terrific, and the pastries divine. One could argue that there are better mom and pop Portuguese bakeries, but Caldense I am a fan of because it has the European look and atmosphere so lacking in obvious North American wannabes like Starbucks. Everything about the place, the colours, the graphics, the presentation, the sounds, the staff, all feel different than if you were anywhere else but in Little Portugal, Toronto.

We nearly ordered everything on the menu and were delighted at every turn, starting with house made tofu, through a perfectly seasoned and textured black cod, to fresh and thoughtful sushi, tempura to die for, a steamed mushroom dish, a seafood sampler that included a fresh Kumamoto oyster with sea urchin, and finishing up with custard dessert styled from Okinawa. Every dish was something we had never seen prepared that way. Get the chef's course OR do what we did - order a variety of dishes off the menu, which for us cost about $75 per person (with a couple drinks each) versus the $125 (or so) chef's course that the house recommend.

Thankfully our ordered arrived 10 minutes after, we started off with the soup of the day, which was a very luscious tomato soup with chunks of sweet potatoes, carrots, celery, wild rice and chick beans. It was one of the best soups I have ever had.

I had ordered the Miami sandwich, which consisted of smoked beef brisket, grilled red onions, cilantro pesto mayo, havarti,  and a pineapple and jalapeño salsa on the side. Wow! What a great combination, the panini was pressed with grill marks on it, the cheese was oozing out. The pesto mayo just brought all the flavors together.

""Burger Fighter"":
Set your expectations accordingly, is my take.

If you're in the mood for a gourmet burger with some fancy artisanal sauces, look elsewhere. This won't fit the bill.

If you're in the mood for your basic 'greasy spoon' cheeseburger with a ton of shoestring fries, this will definitely suffice. Sometimes we're all in the mood for that so it's good to have the option available.

I paid $7.99 for their cheeseburger special -- burger, fries, and a canned drink. The veggies, bun, and 'fighter sauce' (ketchup, mustard, mayo, and hot sauce all mixed) were all fine. The 4oz beef patty was pretty greasy and average tasting (didn't taste like it had any special herbs or spices in the mix, and lacked much flavour), while the cheese was your basic processed slice.

If you're in the mood for a simple diner-style cheeseburger, $8+tax is about the best price you'll find along Queen. Would've liked a 6oz patty for that price, but again the area isn't cheap and I basically got the cheapest combo on the menu.

I'd give it a 4/5 if the beef patty was the star of the show -- it's supposed to be the heart of the cheeseburger, and here it wasn't. I won't fault it for being what it is... so it's overall A-OK.",2017-11-15 01:22:23

We went to 'Marche' and they close at 11PM too... 0/2=(

Luckily we were walking along front street and saw 'Fran's'! Now I have been to Fran's to eat at the College Street location a few years ago with a sit-in diner style, but this location had a pretty big patio, so we went in and got a spot. They open until 2AM EVERYDAY!!! YEAAAA!!!

We were greeted by a young, cute waitress and started off with their fruit smoothies... I got the 'Fran's Fanta' which has banana, pineapple, manga, raspberry.
Verdict: A little too watered down and not too thick like I like it... But still healthy.

My gf got the 'Pina Colada' which has pineapple, honey, yogurt, coconut.
Verdict: YUM YUM!!! This was a great smoothie compared to mine.

On to the main event!!! I ordered the meatloaf...It comes serve steam veggies and mash potato. Now the meatloaf has beef gravy on it as well, so I mixed it with my potatoes. I noticed that my meatloaf was a bit burnt, thus, tasting very different and funny...
Verdict: Not a HIT!

My gf got the 'Fran's Premium Breakfast' which has 2 eggs, home fries, toast, home made potatoes, sausage. Now the sausage is split in half so it works out to be 2 sausages. 
Verdict: I can make a better breakfast than this!!!

Our server was not really visible, but I guess she's doing some work inside. After we finished our meal, she did recommend that the coconut cream pie is really good...So we got the pie.

We came here on opening day to have weak drinks, our food order wrong, and a wait of 30 minutes for our tab after we asked for it.  It was opening day, everyone was friendly, and the place is so aesthetically pleasing that we chose to give it another try a few weeks later.  It had very much improved and I had a great time.  The drinks were not weak this time.  The food was delicious and came out as ordered. 
The only suggestion I have is to install another light in the ladies' room.  It is pitch black in the first stall and you have to use the light on your cell phone to find the seat.  I hope this place is able to last while so many others fail.  It's a really cool place.",2012-06-12 00:37:05

My brother had the turkey sandwich with fries and OMG did it look good. A thick slice of fresh turkey breast with a red cabbage slaw he said it was great and offered me a bite. The fries looked perfect so, clearly the food is good! 

The place is actually a wine store with a great selection of wines and the neat part is for $10 more than the retail price you can enjoy it at your table. There was a young couple who appeared to be celebrating and had a new bottle of champagne.

Beauty & Essex is a highly pretentious and over-priced ""speak-easy tapas bar"" with mediocre service, horrible acoustics, and your typical rowdy vegas crowd.  Its only redeeming quality is the fantastic food.  If you want less pretentiousness and better service, go to Cleo. 


The long version:

The restaurant was largely empty when I arrived for a reservation at 6pm for me and 6 friends. We had a last minute add-on and wanted a table for 8, but the hostess up front gave us misinformation saying that we had to wait to be seated when the whole party arrived or if we were seated early they would kick us out at 7:45pm. We decided to wait at the bar. Then when we went to get seated at around 6:30, she said we missed our reservation by 1.5 hours (wrong) and that we would need to give back the table at 7:45p. This made no sense as the restaurant was largely empty at the time, and the idea that a restaurant (a high-end one at that) would have a seating time limit is odd. She also clearly had our timing off. But whatever, we get seated at a table and our waitress comes by and states that ""we must be in a hurry and that we'll need to leave by 7:45"". Again, what is with these people trying to get rid of us?? Luckily we were able to clarify this situation with management, but it definitely didn't start our evening off well. 

The hidden restaurant is sneakily located behind a faux ""pawn shop"" with a cool secret entrance and fabulous decor. It's a cool spot that makes you feel swanky and part of the in-crowd just because you know about the place. The interior is dark and lush and very romantic. But other than that, the restaurant is not very well thought out. First, no restroom in the restaurant (I guess that might be a vegas thing?). Second, the whole seating area is filled with 4 person tables that are basically touching each other, and more than once wait staff dropped dishes. I can only imagine this is bc the restaurant is hard to move around. Third, the acoustics were absolutely terrible. I could barely hear the person sitting next to me, let alone others at my table or the waitress herself! The atmosphere, while dark and seemingly intimate, is not conducive to enjoying other people's company. 

However, the food is phenomenal. Dishes are small plates meant for sharing and the prices are pretty high. But man, the food is GOOOOOOD. We all ordered about 3 dishes per person and shared amongst the table. Would highly recommend:

1. French Onion Soup Dumplings - Incredible. Cheesy. Flavorful. Bite-sized deliciousness. 
2. Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings - It's the perfect combo of tomato soup and grilled cheese in one bite. 
3. Garganelli - One of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time
4. Thai style deep fried shrimp - Very tasty, not too sweet, not too salty, and shrimp was fresh. 
5. ANY OF THE DESSERTS. THEY ARE ALL GOOD. (my fave was the donuts, but the devil's food layer cake with milk ice cream was also incredible). 

Tips:
*Get here early
*Free champagne for ladies
*Good for small groups
*If driving to the Cosmo, park on east side and take east elevators up to 3rd floor :)",2016-07-11 06:17:03

Pizza was cheesy, so that's good, but unfortunately also saucy. That's not a compliment when it comes to pizza. There was way too much sauce and it had a weird taste to it. Kind of like Ragu pasta sauce, which I only know the taste of from eating dinner at non-Italian friends' houses when I was young. A taste I wish I could forget. The crust was thick and bready, which can be good if done right, but this one was underdone and didn't have any crispiness to it. The flaccid slices caused the cheese to slide off in a rather unattractive manner. I don't think flaccid is ever a compliment in any context, anyway.

We also got wings, and the skin was kinda slimy and chewy...again, no crispiness. Maybe they were rushed and were undercooking everything that night? Their hot wing sauce is dark and sticky with lots of hot pepper flakes, not a classic orangey-red buffalo sauce, so I didn't like that much either. They were very, very spicy, thanks to the hot pepper, but didn't have much depth of flavor beyond that. They don't have celery, so I had nothing to cool down my mouth from the intense spiciness. And the bleu cheese was just packet dressing, so the taste wasn't appealing enough to drown my wings in it (like I do at Fuel & Fuddle, which also does not have celery, but makes up for it with an amazing homemade dressing).

It was fairly cheap, delivery was quick. If you're not picky about pizza, it's fine. Pizza is one of my favorite foods, so I'm not going to settle for a mediocre to bad one, especially when the wings weren't good either. Probably not ordering from here again.

I got three cupcakes today, berries and cream, vanilla vanilla, and key lime pie.  I was so excited for the key lime pie because it had a graham cracker crust!  I love traditional vanilla with vanilla because that's just a classic you can't go wrong with... at least so I thought.  Maybe it's just me, but I was not a fan of the icing, the texture was off and the flavor was weird.  It was a little too buttery, guessing it was a buttercream icing, but it taste like a sweet piece of buttered popcorn.  The cake did not melt in my mouth for any of the flavors, the texture was crumby and dry not really smooth, airy, or creamy, just bleh, meh, and ugh.  The only cake that was half way decent to me was the berries and cream, but I couldn't manage to eat it.  The icing was runny and gritty not smooth light and creamy.  The key lime pie cupcake was disappointing as well, same feel as the vanilla cake on the vanilla vanilla, and same texture icing as the berries and cream.  I was most disappointed by the unpleasant demeanor of the lady working.  Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I got the feeling that she wasn't to interested in helping me.

When I saw this new restaurant, I had to try it because it specialized in Hainan chicken. We all love the dish and sometimes, I would even make it at home. We typically usually go to Flock n Fowl for Hainan chicken but they're a little far sometimes. The hours for Nuro are a little weird though because of their hours. They close pretty early so it's hard to come here during the weekdays when I have work. 

They have HONG KONG STYLED LEMON ICED TEA!! Vegas lacks Hong Kong styled cafes and it's really nice to know that Nuro incorporates a little of it in their menu. Also, if you check in on yelp, they have an offer for a free drink! 

We all got an order of their Hainan chicken because that's their specialty. I wanted to try their chicken wings too but we can't eat that much food. And their chicken noodle soup looked really good as well cause it was a little chilly that day. In fact, their establishment was a little chilly as well. I had to keep my coat on while my friend had to grab his coat from his car. 

They have white meat and for a dollar more, you can order the dish with just dark meat. I'm not quite sure how that works because when we got our dish, it looked like a combination versus JUST white meat. Maybe their dark meat option just gave you legs and thighs? Haha. 

Their chicken is not de-boned, unlike many other Hainan chicken restaurants that I have tried. Granted, all the other Hainan chicken places were either Thai style or Singaporean styled. Nuro's chicken actually reminded me a lot of a Cantonese styled chicken 貴妃鷄 ""Empress chicken."" So I just assumed they were Canton styled and judging from the owner's comments, I was right. 

Each Hainan chicken dish came with three sauces: the traditional ginger and scallion sauce, a soy based sauce, and a vinaigrette? I only used the ginger and scallion sauce as that is my favorite sauce to eat chicken with. Nuro's version of the sauce is delicious -- it has just enough salt in the sauce. Their chicken, however, could be considered on the dry side. A lot of other Hainan places that I have had, the chicken was always juicy and tender but Nuro's was not. It's not necessarily bad as my family is from Hong Kong so their style is very comforting. Their chicken rice is pretty good as well -- although I just wish the rice wasn't as mushy. I prefer rice that's more towards the firmer side. 

Their HK styled lemon ice tea was a little on the disappointing side. HK styled lemon ice tea needs to be SWEET. Nuro's version, however, lacked the sweetness to their tea. If they could just make it sweeter and had more lemon slices, it'll be perfect. 

Overall, Nuro is good. People won't be used to it though. My husband did not appreciate the bones in his chicken. I enjoyed my meal but would have preferred the chicken to be more tender.",2018-02-20 00:25:01

Vic has told me for weeks that I need to get the Life Changer. I don't want to say a hot dog changed my life, but hot damn I do believe it did. It definitely deserves that name. Cheese, chili, Chili Man's designer taco sauce, homemade spicy mustard, jalapenos and onion. HOLY. Like, holy should be in 72 pt font. I also got a dog with kraut and homemade spicy mustard. It took a lot of restraint to only eat two hot dogs.

Things to know: don't see something on the named menu you like? Don't worry, you can build your own. Dogs come with unlimited toppings. Say what?! He does take a credit card. Don't work uptown and need a place to park? I like to park a couple blocks away on Poplar between 3rd and 4th streets. There are meters here and it's way cheaper than the parking decks. Don't have change? Use the park mobile app. Takes all of maybe ten seconds to park and pay. And trust me, you'll be thankful for that little walk back to your car after the dogs.

- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business (you won't find your neighbor's 16 year old kid working here)
- Free hors d'oeuvres at the start of your meal (pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)
- Reasonable prices (all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day... a good amount too)
- Parking is a plenty and free

I've been to this place for lunch several times, so my review is based on the experience in the front bar area, rather than the dining seating in the back.

FOOD:

I can honestly say that this place makes one of the best eggs-benny's I've ever had. Just the right amount of runniness to the eggs, and drizzled with their oh-so-buttery hollandaise sauce. Their reuben sandwich is also fantastic with an ample serving of corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut, and the buttery bread - do you see a pattern here? I like butter...That being said, the sandwiches are a bit too pricey given that they don't even include a side dish.

SERVICE:

At the front bar during lunch time, the server is almost always an older gentleman who covers the bar and surrounding tables. I suppose I shouldn't call him a gentleman though, as he's frequently a bit too cheeky, with a bit too much sarcasm for my taste. He will also frequently pass you by despite seeing you waving him down. On one occasion he forgot to bring something I asked for, and then proceeded to blame me not actually asking - not ok.  

Even though this place does not get overly busy, don't expect to get in and out if you don't have more than an hour for lunch, as said gentleman is very slow with facilitating the payment process. 

VERDICT:

A couple of fantastic dishes offered here, but probably not enough to ignore the shoddy service and go out of my way to dine here.",2017-01-19 06:56:41

That being said, I really wanted to like it and based on all the positive reviews I was hopeful. Unfortunately it didn't live up. Maybe I should've went with the dragon breath drink since that's what it seems they're raved for but I was in the mood for bubble tea. 

They have a small list of flavors, missing are the typical fruity flavors and lychee. I chose strawberry to play it safe and regular boba. My drink had a very artificial strawberry flavor to it nor was it pink - brown in-fact. It was also expensive but realize your paying for their rent inside Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops. 

The gentleman that made my drink was nice however he didn't engage in any small talk or recommend anything for my first time there. There was a punch card sitting in front of his register for taking however I had to make reference to it and ask. He wasn't going to give one himself. There was another gentleman that came in shortly after I did and the employee never acknowledged him. The customer walked away. 

The location is tucked away in a corridor of the shops so I would reference the map. This is likely the only bubble tea joint in the entirety of the shops. They have some breakfast bar style seating. 

In addition to their drinks they serve deserts and fresh juices. 

Given the price and my experience, I don't plan to go back unless I'm in a state of emergency for bubble tea. Driving a couple blocks east puts me at I-Tea and Chewy or west at Cloud.",2018-04-19 11:05:06

The ambiance is trendy and a bit froufrou. It was full of yuppies and DINKs (just being descriptive and not perjorative because we actually fit into both these categories, lol). 

The menu is only in French, so good thing nous sommes bilingues because otherwise the server would have had to explain the whole menu to us, like he did for the pair sitting at the table next to us. Why not have a bilingual menu and save the staff the hassle?

Anyway, I had the green beans, mushrooms and bacon salad ($8) and my husband had the egg salad on toast with a side salad ($11), he added bacon to this for an additional $2. 

My salad was tasty but really tiny. I should have also asked for the dressing on the side because it was drenched in oil. Also the menu said there were potatoes in my salad but there were no potatoes of any form in my salad. Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed my salad. The saltiness of the cheese and bacon really complemented the sweetness of the green beans and the different textures in the salad were excellent. 

My husband enjoyed his meal, although I noticed that his toast was burnt. The bacon was thickly sliced and looked delicious. I had a taste of the egg salad and it tasted whipped and fluffy. 

My husband had a coffee ($2) and the sugar they give you are cubes shaped like card suits (although mostly hearts and clubs). I thought this was super cute.

It's really loud in there though, but I'm great at tuning other people out, haha, so we still had a good time.

They had a $75 minimum, so to eat up the remaining cost, he also removed a few other small stains, cleaned the hall carpet, as well as my master bedroom (and he cleaned the entire carpet where the original large stain was). He treated my house with care by covering my floors so his equipment wouldn't scratch anything. He wore shoe covers & also provided me with some so I could inspect his work after he was finished. After all was said and done, he provided me with a bottle of spot/stain remover to help me in the future for free. There are so many scam artists out there - especially in this line of work.

The staff really tried hard to make up for the problems I experienced, but there's only so many times and so much they can do before you question things. I still greatly enjoyed my meal but it was filled with errors all night long. 

We came at 10pm on a reservation but weren't seated until 10:45pm. Considering we had a reservation, that's fairly ridiculous. I do understand they can't seat us until a table is open, but don't offer me the reservation option in the first place then. It's an easy thing to honor.  We were offered a free drink ticket to compensate us for the wait, however, which was a nice touch. 

The food and drinks were very good during the meal. To drink we had the woodsman (bourbon based, little too sweet), the electric avenue (strong, old fashioned type, very good), and the bubbles and berries (fruity, boozy, great). To eat we had the tomato tartare, sliders, fish tacos, and ratatouille. Here's where the biggest issue came - the pace of the meal. The only explanation I can think of is the kitchen forgot about us. The tartare came out fast enough. It was exceptional; it was one of the better dishes I've had in Vegas actually. It had a sundried tomato taste with a small runny egg on top. Our next dish, the fish taco, came out literally an hour later. The fries on top were exceptional while the actual taco was just fine. The sliders were quite nice and actually an ok deal at $8 each. The ratatouille came last, a little out of order if you ask me, but was very good. I wish it came out wth the sliders to make that a full meal but whatever.  The presentation of all the dishes was a nice touch. 

Because we waited so long for our food we were again offered free drinks and dessert. The staff was really trying to make it up to us but at that point it was getting kind of funny that our meal just kept getting wrecked and fixed nonstop. So in the end we tried the donuts and root beer float. I would say the donuts in chocolate sauce were great but the float and the rest of the sauces were a pass. Very good coffee here as well. 

So after a good meal and all the free drinks and dessert, the meal only cost $75. That's a ridiculous steal even after a 3 hour atypical food excursion. I would come back because I really think they were having an off night and they deserve another chance. They do try to make it up to you if they mess up so I appreciate that, but my advice is, as a customer, give yourself time, don't make plans right after the dinner, and expect a long meal.",2017-05-21 16:11:27

Based on the many positive Yelp reviews and the socially conscience message of the restaurant to provide for those that are less fortunate, a friend and I dined at King's Kitchen.  We arrived at 5:00 pm, the restaurant was practically empty with only three patrons which to me meant we would have the best service.  Outdoor dining is provided and absolutely I love dining al fresco, so we ate on the covered patio.  The restaurant is lovely with lots of windows so the natural light just flows in, the décor is simple and rustic but very inviting, the windows feature transparent recipes that is eye-catching and clever but that is where the compliments end.

I looked online at the menu and photo gallery to get an idea of what was offered.  The menu had several options that I liked and the photo gallery featured delicious looking food that I could not wait to try.  While the service was okay, the food was horrible.  I ordered sweet tea and thought I was going to get a sugar high.  It was entirely too sweet, someone must have put in a bag of sugar.  I asked for a glass of ice to temper the sweetness which helped.

We ordered biscuits which were heavy, thick and dry but for the accompaniments of butter, honey and jam, followed by long swallows of our beverage the biscuits would not have been eaten.  The biscuits were described by the server as light and fluffy, they weren't.  

I was torn between the salmon, catfish and fried chicken as an entrée but ultimately decided on fried chicken - white meat with two orders of macaroni and cheese, green beans and cornbread.  The macaroni and cheese was the worst I've ever had, it was runny as if it wasn't completely baked, the pasta was al-dente; it should have been allowed to cook longer.  I traded plates with my friend because the macaroni and cheese was so fluid that it spread, it began to touch my chicken and corn bread.  My friend also ordered macaroni and cheese as a side but his was in a small bowl, so I took that but it was the same only compact so that it was not fluid.  I sent the macaroni and cheese back for mash potatoes and gravy.  It was worse than the macaroni and cheese.  The potatoes which I believe were Yukon gold were either waterlogged from sitting in water or cooked too long and absorbed too much water because they looked gummy and had a sticky texture, and the gravy was bland with a heavy taste of flour.  The cornbread was heavy, incredibly dry and bland even after putting butter on it.  I ate the chicken and green beans.  Although the chicken was fine, it needed to be moist and I found myself using the flour tasting gravy to dip the chicken.

My friend ate about three forkfuls of the macaroni and cheese before he gave up on it.  He had the catfish and said it was bland but he could tolerate it.  He also had the potato salad what was not good and did not bother to finish it.

The online photo gallery showed amazing desserts, so we both ordered coconut cake.  When it was served, it looked beautiful with tall stacked mini-cakes, coconut icing and a drizzle of something.  However, at first bite it was incredibly cold, as if it was stored in the freezer, taken out to defrost and topped with fresh icing and drizzle of something.  I love coconut and would have devoured that cake but it was disgusting.  I asked for it to be removed from the bill.  My friend said his was too cold but would take it home to eat at room temperature, he threw it away.  What a waste of $10.00 for something that he did not eat because of the taste.

I cannot cook well and enjoy eating out but when the meal is horrible like this, I have become more patient at learning to cook at home whether than waste time and money at a restaurant with subpar food.  We did speak to the manager about our experience, he removed the charge of my dessert and I thought he said he credited my meal but he didn't.  Instead of addressing the matter, we just paid and left, never to return again.  I also learned from the server, that Rooster's Wood-fire Kitchen is its sister restaurant.  Rooster also has a lot of good reviews and was on my list of restaurants to try.  However, out of fear that the food will be subpar as with King's Kitchen, I will stay away from Rooster's.",2018-05-27 20:29:56

They take your order, watch them slice it up, piled neat and nicely into a box then cash out.

They didn't have much meats left but I did catch the last batch of BBQ pork and roasted pork. BBQ pork was good. 
Roasted pork was tasty and tender, the skin was crispy and had a crunch when you bit into it. Crispy and seasoned well. It was so good with other sides or just on its own! 
I prefer the roasted pork as it had equal parts of fat to meat and crispy skin.

Always happy with the outcome but today I went back to get my truck washed and the price has always been $24.99 and today it was $29.99. I mentioned to be person who greeted me that the price has always been $24.99 and be said there prices have gone up. I get price changes, but for that price I can pay someone to my house and wash my truck there. I left. 




Came here on a whim. Nice guys. All were hustling and no one was kicking rocks like a normal car wash. No jack ass trying to fix my window either. 

Truck looked great when they were done.  I did ask them a couple times to wipe off some the tire dressing and they sort of did it, but not really. I drove down the street to Home Depot after my wash and the tire shine stuff had spun up all over my truck. When done at Home Depot I went back and they came right over and asked me if something was wrong. 

They cleaned it off and wiped the tires down. A gentleman came over to me thank me for coming back so they could make it right and he told me ""we are not perfect, but we are trying "". Hey, that's all I could expect. I'll be back and would recommend. 

Note : there is really no where to sit, except two older chairs, but they move very quickly. I think I was maybe 25 minutes in and out, which is quick for a busy Saturday morning about 9 am",2018-02-19 03:51:40

We hadn't tried this one yet because of the mediocre reviews but I decided to take him there for Father's Day.  That was a mistake.  We waited a long time for a table even when there were clean tables ready to go.  I don't know why they weren't seating people at them.  The waitress was nice but told us the kitchen was backed up -- so basically we were going to wait a while for our food -- which we did.  When the food came, it was delivered by someone other than our waitress.  The bacon we ordered crisp was nowhere near crisp.  They didn't bring my husband's milk, extra butter, or jelly.  All of our scrambled eggs were over-cooked.  His food was barely warm.  He had to leave the table and go to the counter to ask for his milk, butter and jelly.  They gave him his milk but were supposed to bring the other items.  They didn't so he had to go back to the counter to ask for them.  By the time he got them, his food was cold.  We called over the manager and told her we wanted the food remade.  She took it back and returned a short while later with new food but he had ordered his potatoes plain (which was clearly obvious in looking at them on the plate) but the new order came with peppers and onions in the potatoes.  He refused the food and she apologized and took it off the bill but still charged us for the rest of the food but gave us coupons to come back.  It was Father's Day and he didn't even get to have breakfast.  We went to Jack in the Box afterwards.  To be honest, they shouldn't have charged us anything for the inconvenience.

On second visit I had the El Mexicano and Grandfather. The Grandfather was my favorite with pork belly, onion, aioli, mayo, pickled mango, and a quail egg on top. The El Mexicano also featured some unique sauces including cherry pepper relish and fresh avocado slices. Both dogs had buns that held all of the yummy toppings and sauces.

I went to Mastros tonight for the first time and I convinced my wife to try Restaurant Week, too!  We were very pleased with the meal.

We got a nice bread basket with several types of bread.  I really liked the pretzel rolls with salt.  There were five choices in the basket.

Course 1:  We each got a salad--my wife's was a Caesar and mine was their spicy mambo salad.  They were both the same greens but my dressing was made with some wasabi, hence the spicy.  Both salads had a good amount of freshly grated cheese on them and they were very tasty.

Course 2:  I ordered the Scottish salmon and Andrea got the 8 ounce filet cooked medium.  I had several preparations from which to choose for the salmon and I chose the blackened option.  The salmon was delicious.  The filet was very good, too.  

With their Restaurant Week menu, diners can choose two sides.  We each ordered garlic mashed potatoes.  My wife ordered the creamed spinach and I got the creamed corn.  The sides were huge.  Since we each ordered the mashed potatoes, we got a regular portion which is their standard size for sides.  The corn and spinach were smaller versions.  All three were very good.  I needed salt, but then anything needs salt.  Samantha started us out by giving each of us some of the sides so we each could try everything.

Course 3:  For dessert, Andrea got the chocolate layer cake and I got the Key lime pie.  ALong with the desserts, we were brought a large bowl of freshly made whopped cream--lightly sweetened.  The chocolate cake was huge.  My Key lime pie was more a normal size.  Both were outstanding!!

We ate in the Tree House overlooking the shops at Crystals.  Service was superb!  Our server, Samantha, was excellent.  The staff cleared tables promptly, cleaned the table cloth between (not that I'm a slob or anything), our iced teas were refilled often, and the pace of the meal was perfect!  

I am so glad Mastros participated in Restaurant Week.  It gave me a chance to try it and I will be back.  What a fantastic start to RW Fall 2012.",2012-08-28 03:10:08

I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but it's WAAY off the beaten path for me, so I waited until I had to pick up my equally adventurous niece (hereinafter referred to as ""Rosebud"") from the airport, and we decided to search it out for a late lunch. (""Search"" is no exaggeration - thanks to whoever posted that handy little map!)

Once you find it, it's a pleasant little place with an absolute sweetheart (Olivier - the aforementioned Frenchman) behind the counter. Selections were on a chalkboard. I went with the curried chicken sandwich and zucchini parmesan soup. The bread was great, and the chicken was hot, juicy, and clearly freshly cooked. Rosebud went for the four-cheese special, and wound up having to scrape off some of the gorgonzola because it was too pungent. I had zero sympathy.

Because dessert is mandatory, she went with a croissant stuffed with Nutella, which she would have preferred heated.

It was silky and rich, and it was mine.

I didn't get the guys name, but I know he's from Carolina.   He asked us if we had been here before.  We hadn't, so he explained how it all worked.  There are several different sauces!  I went for the spicy.  You can calm it down if you like, by having him mix it!  I didn't need that!  Then you get to choose your cheese! or several cheeses!  I did Mozzarella and another one.  Then they have the toppings!  I did a lot of toppings, they even have sun dried tomatoes and sauteed onions and a I think it was a fried eggplant!  I passed on the eggplant!  My 11 inch pizza was so heavy I had to use a fork, because all my toppings kept falling off.  I love this place and I love the concept! And it's only $10.00, 2 people can eat this pizza, and add a salad for $2.00 (I think)  Is a fabulous deal!  I don't mind driving 30 miles to get a good pizza!   We will be back!

Awesome ice cream and sorbet, made from seasonal, local ingredients, it's definitely some of the best I've had in town. It can be a little pricey, but you pay for quality. Personally, I'd rather pay a bit more and know I'm getting the good stuff, then head over to 31 flavours for a ton of corn syrup, dyes and artificial crap. 

Recently I've had their sweet corn, sea salt caramel, lavender, mint, lime basil sorbet and strawberry sorbet. All were incredible. I had their 'smores sundae, with the sea salt caramel ice cream instead of the chocolate... Ridiculousness! The toasted marshmallow was the icing on the cake. And don't let the slightly odd texture of the sweet corn ice cream put you off. It's worth a scoop. I used to get sweet corn ice cream in Bangkok all the time, and loved it! Their lavender and mint ice creams are both made with actual herbs, so they're both a little strong, a little herby, but my god they're good! I loved the lime basil sorbet. I mixed it with the strawberry sorbet, and it was exactly what I needed on a hot summer day. 

If you're looking for a great local business to support this summer, and a place where you and the kids can have some great ice cream, I definitely recommend Sweet Republic. Oh!

Before you walk in to the trail head, you walk through a welcome center area of sorts.  There's a map of the trails in the preserve with a model to show you where to go.  It also tells you the difficulty levels of the trails so you know what to expect.  That was very cool.

There were a couple of volunteer guys greeting people and helping them figure out where to go.  If they weren't there, it would've been very confusing to find out where to go.  It's not intuitive.  Despite the models and maps, it's not clearly marked until you walk into the preserve for 1000 ft or so.

Once we got on the trail, it was pretty cool.  The Gateway Loop Trail has some nice views of the Valley.  Camelback and Mummy Mountains are easily seen.  On the North side of the trail, you can see the Troon and Pinnacle Peak areas.

However, there wasn't much else to look at.  Except for a lizard, we didn't see any animals or wildlife.  We heard a few birds squawking to warn each other that people were nearby, but we didn't see them.  It gets kind of boring if you don't have anything to look at on a trail.

And note they're more than just big square brownies in appearance - each has it's own professionally crafted elegance, from the lattice of dripped chocolate atop one, to another that gave me the impression of small waves of rich dark chocolate on top.  

Note that it's a small shop with a single bakery counter out front and not a lot of inventory on display or presumably on hand, but they do much more than cupcakes and brownies BY SPECIAL ORDER, including all manner of tarts, pastries, danish, turnovers, cookies, cakes, and wedding cakes, etc.  They  cater and deliver as well.

My first encounter with the Strip was way back in '75, as a young boy on a trip with my parents. Then, when a group of my high school mates all turned 21, we came back to truly enjoy all the Strip can offer....drinking, gambling, and acting a fool. Good times. We made this trip several times before moving away to LA, where frequent weekend road trips for golf, gambling, and drinking occurred. Then in 2000, I moved here.

I've seen the Strip go corporate, which has really been disappointing. No longer are there cheap room rates, cheap eats, and affordable minimum bet table games to play. The days of coming for 2 days with just $300 are no more. Service levels have dropped, free comps have all but disappeared unless you are a high roller. 

Still, you can find a ton of things to do and see that are free. Almost every casino has some musical act where you can sit and enjoy a $15 cocktail and listen. Conservatories, gardens,  fountains, canals, impressive art work, glittering lights are all abound. People watching will always be #1 here, anything from the homeless to people dressed in tuxedos and fancy dresses. The other day we saw what was either a bachelor party or a fantasy football group with two huge tattooed guys wearing dresses. Won't see that everyday!!!

With the $2.99 steak and egg specials gone, the Strip has become home to some great restaurants, many bearing the names of celebrity chefs. Its definitely a great place to go and eat. Each casino seems to have 4 or 5 fine dining choices, and another 10 regular places to eat. Shopping malls like the Forum Shops have popped up and are filled with not only stores but interesting eating establishments. Dining on the ""patio"" at the Palm watching shoppers and tourists is great fun for myself and a couple of my friends, followed by a short walk to a cigar lounge for cocktails. Simple pleasures can be found. 

Enjoy the Strip...its crazy, its crowded, its filled with visual delights.",2017-01-09 16:53:04

xtTsQglZMKSi2K6WKDVESg,oF_vwmhGi-JechfnimM60Q,-H3hHmLfDmXQyuAlb3qFfg,3,2,1,2,"I visited this restaurant twice, once with a friend, and once with a large group. I had a similar experience both times, and I there are some points that I think are worth mentioning. Firstly, the location I think is quite convenient. Independence is nestled quite perfectly in Cuyahoga County, and is just close enough to the center of Cleveland to make it worth the drive. In addition, because this is off of busy Rockside Road, it doesn't get quite as much traffic, and therefore seems as though it's never fully crowded. This makes it convenient if you're looking for someplace central that also isn't too noisy (as many of the larger chains on Rockside can be). All that being said, I have to say that the service here can be incredibly slow, albeit very kind and friendly. The first time I went here with my friend, we chatted for quite a while and after a few subtle attempts to hint that we were ready to order, we ended up having to physically flag the server down to get her attention. The next time I went with a large party, they were very accommodating and had the dining room set up and ready for us as per our reservation, however it was really difficult to get in and out quickly due to the fact that we had to flag the server down every time we needed something. I think this may just be a stylistic difference in service style, but I think it's worth mentioning as many folks coming here are likely on lunch hour from work or coming for a quick dinner after work and therefore will expect somewhat quicker service. All that being said, the server and chef are really friendly people and are eager to ask you how everything was and accommodate requests. You can tell that it's locally owned and that they are very invested in the customer experience. 
As for the food itself, I love that they have a traditional Indonesian menu, but they also have more of a pan-Asian menu for those less adventurous, which includes things like sushi, hibachi, Thai dishes and otherwise. The first time I came, I went adventurous and ordered the Pempek Palembang, which is a really traditional Indonesian dish that is a fish cake made with tapioca, served with a hard boiled egg as well as a vinegary kind of soy sauce and noodles. This was a very unique dish, unlike anything I've ever had before, and while I enjoyed the fish cake texture, I am not sure it's a dish I'd crave to order again. The next time I came back, I ordered the basil fried rice, which I found perfectly average. All this to say, I think the food here is good if you want to try a new type of cuisine, but I don't think the pan-Asian dishes will be a great departure from other similar restaurants. However, I will say when coming here with a group, everyone was able to find something that they liked and enjoyed. Between the location, the service and the food, I would say I recommend others to try this restaurant, as I think the experience will be enjoyable and you're sure to get friendly service, however I think the fact that many of the dishes will be unfamiliar to most people and also that the service can be a bit slow might be a deterrent for people to come back.",2018-02-08 15:54:11

I tasted her risotto, and it was excellent. Creamy, and meaty-tasting. Great texture. The plating was great too. But my friend on the right who had the salmon, her plating was awesome. They put her salmon on this little wax-paper box and covered it with another wax-paper box. Very unique presentation! My bison tartare came and I dug in. A lot of tartares run the risk of being flat or one-note. Not so at Home Tasing Room! The tartare was fresh, tasty, and had tangy notes and texture coming through at all the right times. They definitely did the bison justice! It was served with crostinis slathered with truffle mayo. YUM!
I finished my tartare entree with a glass of Tempranillo, which I must add, was also fantastic. 

The food was fantastic, but I wish the wine was a buck or two cheaper. I also wish there were more people in the restaurant, but that's not their fault, despite the great location.

I will totally go back and try more stuff from their menu!

I saw on Yelp (what a helpful little site) that they had closed in November for remodeling, so I was eager to check out the new digs. 

It's true! They have new orange paint and new furniture! My butt was no longer hesitant to take a seat. The set-up is still the same, but paint and new furniture goes a long, long way. 

I ordered one of my old time favorites: broccoli and tofu served in a brown gravy. I must say I was a bit saddened by the broccoli to tofu ratio.

As others have noted, they do some things well and in other ways, fall short of the mark. 

I ordered the mojito they had on the cocktail special list and I have to tell you, well made. Lots of muddled fresh mint and lime, not too much sugar syrup, and plenty of ice, it was really good! It was so good that when I had a mojito the next night at Cheavrant (I know I spelled that wrong), even though it was twice the size all I could think was...wow, wish it was as good as the one I had at Regions. 

Service...a stunning female bartender (and when one is having a cocktail, it never hurts to have it made by a beautiful woman) who when I asked about the jerk chicken on the special menu admitted she had not tried it yet, and I ended up ordering the shrimp and grits which I have had before. Note to Regions staff, if he haven't tried let the customer know you will check with someone who has tried the dish, or say, I haven't tried it but everything is quite good and if you don't like it we'll get you something else. When I got my order she noted she had not tried that either. So Regions management, at least give your staff a tasting when the new dishes come out so they can have an honest chat about the items with the customers. 

I did have a second cocktail, a gin and tonic with Henrick's gin. The gin was lovely though no limes were squeezed into the drink. Regions, consider muddling a lime piece or two as part of your G&T. 

So......as others have mentioned, in a land of beer and wine it may be the best place for a cocktail on mill. As for the Shrimp and Grits, it came with a ton of grits this time and well.....more is not always better. The best places to eat in this area - Caffe Boa, House of Tricks, etc, generally serve a modest amount of really good food, I recommend you follow that practice. 

Notice my rating has gone down a notch though they have added an e-mail list. I would like to see beers on draft. Consider linking up to Sleepy Dog Saloon, right down University, which brews its own beer, and it is way better than Gordan Biersch. 

So, good to see you trying but...try harder and, read and respond to your Yelp comments since the people here care enough to give feedback, let them know you appreciate it, good or bad.",2010-02-07 19:00:29

Apparently it was written up as the best fast food takeout place in sauga as posted on their wall. Thus, I had high hopes of heaping, tasty food delivered quickly.  I feel jipped. It was delivered quickly, but the brisket no rice for 9,95 included broccoli filling up more than half of the container. They should say for two dollars more substitute rice for broccoli, but I saw the actual rice and meat dishes, there was less meat.  The menu did not say I was ordering brisket with broccoli. Similarly, the deep fried squid was actually half of the container was filled with white noodle things with no taste.  They should say instead, for two dollars more substitute rice with noodle straws.  The squid itself was so bland and a bit chewy. I had to add my own salt, onion, garlic and pepper to make it taste ok.  The yang chow fried rice was the best dish, although it was not a heaping portion, it was tasty and had good amounts of BBQ pork and decent sized shrimp.  I would definitely order that again.  Overall though, I prefer maceys for beef brisket, but sometimes maceys beef brisket have the hard muscle tendons? While noodle wok's brisket is all soft.  At maceys, It is fifteen bucks with the tax for a large, but you get pure meat and can feed a family of four easily.  I wouldn't discount this place though, at least I got some veggies in my dinner, but I wish it wasn't half the container and it wasn't a surprise!

-they provide food but we brought our own just in case

Now on to the very most important part. From the front desk employee to the owners, I got exceptional service! I got multiple daily pictures texted to me and replies to any questions I had about my dog. When we dropped her off, she was comfortable right away. She went away and didn't even look back. When we picked her up she was jumping all over the owner and seemed like she wanted to stay. That made me soooooooo happy!! It told me she was well taken care of.

They have doggy massages available and a little doggy gym. 

I really can't say enough good things. I'm just very happy to see them hire good employees who you can tell love dogs and who take care of the place when the owners are gone away on a vacation.",2016-02-08 06:02:14

UYoSCKgEId4Mc5UqldaeSw,P7OjR3fKVg-4b0mfYuNU5g,IjeyNYr4kefZ2uZfrtJqZg,5,19,15,6,"Went out with wife and dog today to this park. We love this place. I can let the dog off the leash and let her play. Being a black lab, she heads straight for the water and never leaves. 

This park is not the cleanest. And yes, for some reason, pet owners don't seem to clean up after their dog. REALLY, how hard is it. Grab a little plastic bag, wrap it over your hand, bend down, pick up dog poop, pull back over hand, and throw away. While your bending over, try picking up one other pile while your at it. If you use the ""1 +"" rule, the park would be clean all the time. 

But my biggest complaint, as are most of my complaints about places, are the humans. It amazes me how some of the most rude, most inconsiderate, thoughtless people bring their pets there. Or the fact that they have dogs all together. Combine those with the people who think that this is a play place for their children also, you can only imagine the comedy of people and errors that can develop. 

Been a life long dog owner I have several rules about dog parks. Thought I would share: 

First --- DOG PARK!!!!! 
This is a place for your dog!!! If you bring your children, expect that they will get dirty, knocked over, run into, jumped on, wet, and anything else that can happen when allowing dogs to run freely. 

This is not a kid park!!! There are any number of other places kids can go to play on the equipment. The obstacles, jumping ramp and all other things in this park are for the DOGS!!!!! 

If you can't control your kid, PUT IT ON A LEASH!!!! 

SECOND -- The obstacles are for the dogs!!! 

Unless you are actually trying to work with your dog to help them learn how to negotiate them stay off them... Let the dogs play.. 

Don't stand in the way on the jumping ramp into the lake. When your big butt stands there, others can't throw things for their dog to jump off it... Get out of the way!!!! 

THIRD --If you have to carry your dog to the end of the ramp and throw it in the lake to make it go in the water, maybe your dog is not ready for this park or the water. 

I know you may think it is fun, but it really ruins the experience for your dog. Maybe you think this gets your dog used to it, but from a training stand point, if it makes your dog scared and it is less likely to want to do it again. Start from the edge, your dog might learn to enjoy it.. 

FOURTH --Dog fights will happen in an environment like this.. 

When it does, try taking control of your own dog rather than rubber necking to look at the dog fight. Ever notice that a small fight can turn into a large one as the other dogs join in. Take control of your own dog and let the owners of the fighting dogs take care of their dogs. 

FIFTH --If you know your dog is aggressive before you enter the park, DON'T BRING YOUR DOG IN IDIOT. 

I can't tell you how many owners I have watched who have a problem with their dog just getting from the parking lot to the dog run area. Maybe this is not the place for you.. 

FINALLY --Ever noticed how a pet will assume the personality of their owner. 

If the dog is a nut case, there is a good chance the human holding the leash is too. If the dog is rude, bullish, or just all around a disturbance, chances are the one holding the leash has problems too.. 

We usually have to have a license for dogs. Maybe a dog owner should have to get a license first. Let's limit the idiot dog owners of the world!!! Probably can say the same for these same bad pet owners that have kids too though!!!! 

THIS IS A 5 STAR PLACE. I TAKE MY DOG THERE. SHE HAS FUN. NOT TOO MANY PLACES I CAN TAKE HER WHERE SHE CAN PLAY IN THE WATER AND INTERACT WITH OTHER DOGS. DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH FOR YOUR COMFORT. AFTER ALL, IT WAS NOT BUILT FOR YOU AS THE HUMAN... SO YOU MAY HAVE TO SUFFER THE HEAT, SMELL AND DIRT FOR AN HOUR OR SO... BUT IT IS WELL WORTH IT!!!!!",2010-04-12 00:37:39

I ordered their ""Dillon James,"" which is basically a Margherita Pizza. However once I saw they had Pesto. I thought I can have a fancy cheese pizza anywhere. So I decided, I must seize this pesto pizza moment. Sadly enough pesto pizza is becoming an endangered entree.

So I played with the Dillion James recipe by subbing and adding with a caption cloud above my noggin of me wearing a lab coat, safety goggles and holding beakers looking smart and such. The red sauce..gone, in is the pesto and tagging along was his friend ricotta.

Washed it all down my gullet with a pompous craft draft San Tan Devils Ale and it just couldn't stop there. I also had a pretentious can of San Pellegrino Blood Orange bubbly agua. This pizza deserved the beverage theatrics. I'm like this most of the time dining out....okay all the time, Happy now!!

Very spacious and clean. Not as many seats as you would expect at a cafe though, less than 10 tables for sure. There is an area by the window where there's live performances every Friday or smth but it's off to the side so it doesnt take up that much space. There's also a large communal table right when you walk in, which is really a waste of space imo; you can get a lot more seating if that was exchanged for a few smaller tables. My sister and I pretty much took that whole thing over since the place was empty except for 2 other tables already taken, but it is right by the door so when it opens it does get chilly in the winter. There's also not a lot of outlets available (hence we had to sit at that giant table because the plug was right there) so if you're planning on a date with your computer, you better bring an extra battery or an external charger. 

Service was meh tbh. And that's what brought down the rating for me. Barristas were not too friendly and the girl working the till was the same. They're not rude to say the least, but don't expect them to be friendly or cheery like those at other cafes. Ie. The cashier looked like she hated her life while taking the orders... expressionless, and when I personally brought my finished mug back to their side counter, instead of saying thanks to the customer, the barrista just glanced at me and continued whatever he was doing. Great customer service dude, keep it up. 

Prices are what you would expect. Nth out of the ordinary. Had a muffin and the London Fog and that was pretty good, at least you don't find these everywhere. Came in a large mug with the tea bag hanging over the edge; light yet aromatic. The muffin was a teensy bit on the dry side. Their menu has a good selection and judging by the number of people sitting versus getting take out, I'd say take out is a better option. 

I did notice though that while sitting there for a bit, there was a strong smell at the place... kind of like burnt stuff or coffee or cooked/fried food. Not a pleasant smell like roasted coffee or pastries at other cafes. As soon as I left I knew I would reek of it... and I did.

Mixed feelings about this place... not sure if I would be coming back any time soon.",2016-03-17 13:35:10
gU_9NTx6JrIVQIMpeiMfQQ,sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,kLKtlA3s4Z6wPefSLKDHmA,4,3,0,0,"This review is for the office staff and my doctor, Dr. Tyre. 

This was my first visit to this doctor's office as I recently changed my provider. I didn't think my last one was taking my concerns seriously, so I switched based on the recommendation of a co-worker/friend. 

I arrived at the office and didn't have the suite number with me, so it took me a few minutes to find the office (there really should be a directory with so many offices... or I should really learn to bring the suite number, not just the street number). Once I was in the office, the front staff was friendly, however, seemed a bit - irritated/uptight - about the fact I wasn't there at least 30 minutes early to be sure to finish the intake paperwork before the appointment. It wasn't a big deal, but the delivery of her statement could have been a little less cold, to be honest. I understand, and was told, it was because ""the doctor DOES run on time"". 

I finished the paperwork before my appointment time, I waited a few minutes and was called back for my vitals and such. The person who took my information, Aricelli (sorry if I spelled that wrong) was very nice and informative, letting me know what she was doing and why. 

I was then taken back to the room where I saw the doctor. She listened to my needs, concerns, etc and provided me with a lot more referrals and additional check-ups than my last provider. 

The only thing I would say is that her reaction to my blood pressure worried me for the rest of the day - and it turns out it wasn't an issue. So, a bit on the ""over-reaction"" but I would rather have that than have something go unaddressed. 

So far, my first experience with her was positive. I will have a follow up after a couple other tests and see how it goes. 

Oh, and I was told her office would send a referral and be calling me to follow up so I can schedule an exam, but I have yet to hear from her office. It's only been since Thursday (today is Monday), but I didn't think it would take this long - that might be an issue if someone just isn't getting it done timely.",2014-07-21 18:05:33

We went early evening this last Sunday.  We walked in, and were immediately greeted and sat.  The place is really cute, very very comfortable chairs, very cosy.  Good for a romantic evening if that's what  you're looking for (I wasn't).   Our waiter was very attentive, but not very personable.  He could smile a bit more, though we never lacked for anything.  Certainly not going to mark off because the waiter never smiled, just an observation.

We ordered chips and salsa (they charge for it) and small salads.  Good on both, not great.  

Then Megan and I both got burritos.  Mine was a pork with chile verde sauce on it.  Megan's was a steak with the same sauce.  Here's where it got fantastic.  They were probably the best burritos I have ever had in my life, and I've had A LOT of burritos, being an Arizona native.  The tortillas were huge and very very fresh, the chili verde sauce was also fantastic, so good that I didn't  use any hot sauce, and I ALWAYS use hot sauce.  And the filling, oh, the filling.  A mixture of wonderful tender meat and some kind of corn mixture.  I don't know what it was, but it was fantastic.

The ""T"" stops pretty close to this mall, but it is a bit of a hike across the parking lot if you are laden down with packages.

The mall has the usual selection of stores.  The department stores are Boscov's, Macy's and Sears.  The garden variety mall stores are here-- Aldo Shoes, Ann Taylor Loft, Apple, Banana Republic, Bandolino, Barnes & Noble Booksellers, GapKids, Hollister, J.

- Outrageous prices. Too much hype for *Must try
- How can you call yourself a Thai restaurant without Pad Thai!? It's almost like saying ""Viet restaurant"" without pho. haha..okay, yes, there are exceptions. 
- All dishes were plated wonderfully! 
- Tiaga shrimp* was disappointing. Tempura style shrimp without the tempura and wrapped like a lumpia, then tied with a crispy noodle. 3 pieces. 
- Garlic pork and pepper* rice tasted like a meal from Guppy House (or equivalent taiwanese restaurant) with japanese rice with a fried egg on top. Almost like a fancy Big Wongs. Few salty pork bits with too much rice. Garlic pieces were hard almost like rocks. More of a let down bc it was a must-try.
- Beef panang was alright. The beef was cut in CUBES, not sliced. Inconsistent texture, some tender others hard. Curry could be creamier with more coconut. Unique lychee in curry! Great combination! 1st time and was successful. Sweet balanced the spice. 
- I'd stick with Ping Pong Thai down the street for Thai.... 
- Friendly service. Free thai tea with Yelp Check-in!! 
- Homemade soy sauce! Excellent! Not too salty with a hint of sweetness.

You're gonna need to drive to Meskerem, and the ambiance of the restaurant won't blow you away or anything, but the food is authentic Ethiopian (a rarity in Charlotte) and extremely tasty. I'm not a big fan of the bread on which the meal is served (it's sort of like a sponge, without much taste), but most others I've been with do. And eating with your hands (you rip at the sponge and dab and dunk into the rest of your meats, veggie and sauces) is a fun way to put grub in your mouth. 

The Chicken Tibs is the best thing on the menu, but it's all pretty good. The various vegetables that come along with most of the dishes range from potatoes to green beans, and they compliment the proteins well.

As usual, they have menu options for just about everyone (the skinny, the big and the rich and the poor). The hockey championship game was playing so the bar was full. There was also a 21st birthday party there which was pretty cool. Our waiter was great. He was also waiting on the party, but he made sure to check in with us as often as he could. He check in with us a few times about our food which was a little weird. I guess the way it works is if we order an appetizer it delays the time our entree's come out which is fine. We were in no rush. We had made it just in time for the last 30 minutes of happy hour. The one thing that was also a little weird about our waiter is that he mentioned that he used to work at TGI Fridays and that they all closed down because business was not good. To me, that's not a small talk topic for a party you are waiting on. I ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas. I didn't realize that it does not come with rice on the side, but the rice is really not needed. They give you the chicken, shrimp, peppers and onions plus all the fixings for the fajitas (cheese, salsa, sour cream and softshells). That filled me up.

Granted, the iWatch just came out this week and I am here on a Sunday. But I have been in Apple stores that have been very busy before. This is the first time I've ever had such an incredibly bad service in an Apple store. I went over to one person who appeared to be a sales person who was not helping anyone at the moment and he let me know that he was there to register people for the Genius Bar only and he couldn't help me with sales. He handed me off to a woman who seemed not to be doing anything. She also told me that she was there strictly for registering people ( she had just finished helping someone else with a sale when I walked up to her). She went on her handheld device and registered me to speak with a sales person and let me know there was only one person in front of me. I saw her go over to a sales person and tell her my name. I figured I would be the next person that sales person would help. How wrong I was! She went on to help two other people and never came over to help me. I found another sales person who appeared to be doing nothing. I asked her for help with buying a laptop. She let me know that her job description included only setting up new iPhones. I pleaded a little bit and she said she would see if she could help me with some questions. I was fortunate in that I had done some reading ahead of time. So I was able to see that she gave me inappropriate answers to some of the things that I asked. She finished by pointing to a counter on the other side of the store and telling me that there are laptops over there, why don't you take a look.
I know that this is a new store. But you come to expect a certain level of service and knowledge from the people working in the Apple Store. The personnel working in this store does not compare to any of the others that I have been in. In the other stores the Apple employees are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. In the Summerlin store, the emplpyees went 0 for 3 in those areas. The Summerlin store has a long way to go before they should allow themselves to be considered a real Apple Store.

In that regard, Canyon Creek is one of the, if not THE, best restaurants to visit in the City Centre.

My friends and I ended up coming here this past Friday on a bit of a lark. Faced with long lineups and hour-long wait times at Scaddabush and Jack Astor's, we were pleasantly surprised when a server whisked us inside and sat us down at a booth (without even asking, to boot). Despite the presence of a large group of guests right next to us, the atmosphere was peaceful enough that we could easily hear ourselves talk.

I ended up ordering the bandera tacos, while my friends ordered the shrimp ravioli and a steak sandwich. I was looking for something light, and those tacos hit the spot. Nice mix of flavors, just the right hit of spice and a good serving size, although I found them to be extremely messy and nearly resorted to using a fork-and-spoon to finish them off like a heathen. While I decided to decline dessert, my friend had one of the brownies (at my recommendation) and reported that it was delicious.

I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with a Canyon Creek, and after getting the best veggie burger I ever had at the Front Street location in Toronto, I knew that any follow-up that got close to that would be well worth the trip. If anything, this visit made me disappointed that I didn't go for the prix-fixe menu. Maybe next time.

Our server was great too. The kind of woman who loves Mad Max: Fury Road and doesn't suggest things she hasn't tried. Respect.

In the end, this remains one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I just need to go there more often than on my birthday and the occasional family dinner.

The galleries are impeccably curated and beautiful, and you will never, EVER go wrong with catching any specialty exhibits. For me, the newly revamped contemporary art collection is my favorite. Andy Warhol lovers--flock there, now!

While these are obvious things to do in the museum, here's how to make the most of a trip at CMA:
- Eat brunch at the Provenance restaurant and sit in the Atrium to enjoy it. You'll thank me later!
- If you love art books, don't skip the bookstore. I live by this bookstore.
- Stop in at the front desk and inquire about docent led tours. These guides know what they're doing!
- Plan extra time to play in Gallery One. Gallery One is the intergenerational experiential educational initiative right near the entrance. The millions of dollars invested in this high-tech area shows. It's a blast for adults and kids to learn about art through play, touch, feel and games.
- If the weather is nice, take a walk around Wade Oval Lagoon and enjoy the sculptures by the water, and for the frontal view of the museum--the best.

The Cleveland Museum of Art is an institution, and regardless of how often you think you'll go, I highly recommend becoming a member.

We are local and live very close to this restaurant so we were very excited to give a new neighborhood restaurant a try. The design of the restaurant is stunning! But that's all I have for a positive note.

We went to the restaurant this week on a weekday and the restaurant was not busy, mostly open tables. We walk in and hostess is just starring at us, no greeting. Then waiter doesn't greet us for quite awhile once seated, when he does, he says he will be back and he has another assistant server helping him. The second server comes no greeting just places water and chips and salsa. The salsa was actually awesome! The waiter took at least another ten minutes to return then takes order, I got a beer, I kid you not it took 30 minutes to get a beer, and I was watching the bartenders doing side jobs and relaxing, um can I pour my own beer at this point? Server just kept coming to the table saying your beer will be right out...the whole time this is happening I am watching the hostess walk back and forth through the restaurant space eating chips....back and forth eating chips in the middle of the restaurant! The manager is just walking in circles doing nothing, when all guests around us looked irritated with the experience.

Ok fine, maybe I can ignore all of these service issues and the food will be fine. Food comes, I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos, he ordered the Al Pastor Tacos. My tacos were so over cooked they tasted more like chicken strips than fish. No flavor on either taco just bland cheap ingredients, not even plated well. When we are paying $21 for a plate of 3 tacos with one bite of beans, rice and corn on the side you expect it to be at least semi flavorful. 

Too expensive, poor service, horrible food quality.

I have to admit that I was excited to finally come check out this place.  When I arrived, I was disappointed to see that parking was so difficult.  There are very few parking spots between each building and many with restrictions.  The buildings are not well marked either, so it was a bit difficult finding the right building once I parked.

When I finally walked inside, I was pleased to see a modern building that was well ventilated.  There were a lot of young people who looked like students walking around, so I'm not sure if there's a college campus here.

We went in and ordered a couple dozen, including half a dozen Boston Cremes. It looks like they had a trainee Finisher working today, because only one of them are frosted right, and the other 5 were done by someone incompetent. I have pics to prove it, available upon request.

ATTENTION FINISHER: when the chocolate frosting is too thick for the shells, you're supposed to thin it out with hot coffee, then continue frosting the shells in the correct manner. What you are NOT supposed to do is use a frosting knife and try to spread it on the shells. Two things happen when you do it wrong: the shells tear, and you have to throw away a bunch, and the shells don't get the right amount of frosting, and they look awful.

Also, several other of the filled donuts were not filled, and only had a blop of the filling on the outside where the fill hole would normally go. This newbie Finisher was really awful. I know of which I speak: I was a weekend graveyard Finisher for 2 years in my mis-spent youth, and as a Finisher, I would never have trayed up this crap.

Anyway, when my coworker tried to call and complain to the manager, what she got was a snotty ""well, they have frosting on them, so technically they're fine"", instead of something like ""I apologize for the bad food, here's [something to appease you].""

This location normally has good products and good customer service, but not this morning.

They have set the bar high and their cupcakes are awesome.  Every time I try cupcakes from somewhere else, I am always disappointed at the lack of flavor and moisture.  I expected the same thing from Z Bakery based on the first reviews. I am happy to report that was not the case here.

I got an Andes cupcake that had chocolate chips, Andes mints, and mint icing.  The first bite I took from the outside was dry so I expected the rest of the cake to be dry too - it wasn't.  The cupcake definitely tasted like Andes mints and it was good. I love mint and chocolate and thus love Andes mints, so much so that people always give them to me on Christmas and my birthday. The cupcake was slightly smaller than Cupcrazed, but the same price as Cupcrazed special flavors - $3.  I like at least enough icing to cover the cupcake too, and the icing on these did not completely cover the top.  The icing also helps to act as a seal and keep the cake moist and fresh.

It's a much different atmosphere than Cupcrazed.  It's in an old house that has hosted several business, most of which have failed because of poor business practices such as only being open a few hours each day for only a few days a week - you can't pay rent with that.  The lack of a shopping area also makes it difficult to generate customers here.  Z Bakery also does wedding cakes and things like that so that should supplement their business if they do them well.

That is what saved my first visit from being a disaster. The menu is straightforward, but I immediately wondered the distinction between Latte Tea and Milk Tea. The cashier seemed confused herself. After asking the question three times, I finally got the answer I needed: Latte Tea is served with their Sea Salt Crème and Milk Tea is made with a non-dairy creamer. Next, I had my eyes on their Matcha Milk Tea, but I was determined to order the famed Sea Salt Crème. I asked if I was able to order a Matcha Latte Tea or any tea with Sea Salt Crème instead of non-dairy creamer (Latte Tea rather than Milk Tea). I was told a definitive ""no"" before that gentleman (I'll dub him ""The Brewmaster"") overheard and stepped in. He said that we could order whatever we wanted since the tea would be freshly-brewed and they could add whatever milk you want. Therefore, I got my Iced Matcha Latte Tea (with boba, of course). The Matcha and Sea Salt Crème wasn't the best combination, but still good.

I was much more prepared for my second visit and knew I wanted to try a different Latte Tea. I saw the Lavender Tea, so I wanted to give that a whirl. Again, The Brewmaster came to my rescue and suggested mixing Lavender with Black Tea as the Sea Salt Crème would overwhelm the delicate floral tea. Of course, it was delicious! Since Ruben loves coffee, The Brewmaster suggested their Cold Brew Coffee with Sea Salt Crème and it was AMAZING. We had a group of five and out of all our drinks, the Cold Brew was a clear favorite. Really delicious and amazing with boba!

I recently learned that the Sea Salt Crème is intended to sit on top of your drink (not mixed in), so you get a little bit of that salty creaminess with every sip and it intensifies as you drink.

Also, The Brewmaster's name is Sou. He's fantastic. (As is everyone there!)

What you need to know: 
* Latte Tea ALL THE WAY (it's all about the Sea Salt Crème). 
* Freshly brewed loose-leaf teas. 
* Sweetness level can be adjusted in 25% intervals.
* The latte teas are sweetened with sugar (unless you specify differently).
* Their fresh-brewed teas are sweetened with honey.
* The boba is aaaawesome! 
* Stamp card: 10 drink stamps equal one FREE regular drink.",2015-12-30 17:39:04

So many old books, books by subjects, laddered walls and old squeeky beautiful wooden floors...I felt like I went to another dimension or back in time before big corporate chained book stores took over!!! It gave me a nostalgic feeling being in there. 

This is a store you need to have at least an hour if not more in. There are 3 levels to the store.

I have to start off by saying that our waiter was very knowledgeable & attentive. He was able to answer all of our questions & he brought everything to us in a timely manner. His timing was perfect. His name was Steve. But, I'm pretty sure everyone there is nice. It is a fancy place, so, it is a little bit rather expensive. But, definitely worth every penny! Plus, they give you a couple of complementary items. Such as their french fries. There were three different batches & each one had that their own dipping sauce or ketchup. That was a nice touch. In addition to the fries, we ordered our usual shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were fresh & tasted very delicious! The cocktail sauce had a little bit of a kick to it, but it was not too spicy at all. Although, they did have a little tiny bottle of Tabasco for those that really like it spicy. The cucumber Martini was excellent. It was not watered down, but it didn't have too much alcohol either. I know for some, that could never be possible. I also had their hot tea which came in a cute little Asian style teapot. The sugar was in a separate shiny brass container. Very elegant. I ordered the 16 oz. ribeye. I was a little worried because it did not have the bone in. That is what I am used to. But, it was still very flavorful. I also asked for it to be extra well done & extra charred. Some restaurants are scared to do this. So, I always add the sentence ""I promise I will not complain if it's burnt."" Some like it rare, I like it that way. Different strokes for different folks. It came out perfectly. I was very happy with it. As for the sides, we ordered the broccoli, the gratin potatoes & the truffle mac & cheese. I did not particularly like the truffle mac & cheese. I like truffles, but to a minimum. As for the potatoes, they were absolutely delicious. They do their gratin quite differently from other places. I like their version very much! (I did not personally try the broccoli, although I heard it was good.) We got stuffed rather quickly. The food was filling, comforting & very delicious. For dessert, I wanted to try their famous beignets. I read about them, they sounded & looked amazing in the pictures. Unfortunately, I didn't have anyone to share them with. So, we had some ice cream. Cinnamon toast & mint chocolate chip. I loved the mint chocolate chip, but I didn't care for the cinnamon toast too much. Lastly, when Steve packed up everything to go. We were surprised with another gift. Their absolutely delicious caramel & chocolate popcorn. One for each person. Once again, such a nice touch. Overall, I really love this restaurant. They treat their customers in a special way, kind of like family or close friends. And, we like that. I hope to visit this establishment again. And soon.",2016-12-03 03:08:33

The first time we tried Beckett's was for their first birthday.  I'd been hearing about the restaurant and signed up for the newsletter.  My husband couldn't say no when it was 1 dollar entrees for their birthday!  We had a fabulous meal!  The only complaint I had that night was that my chocolate dessert wasn't quite what I expected and too rich for me.

We went again with friends visiting from the UK.  We needed a place to go for dinner on a Sunday night and our pickings were limited.  A reservation was made for Beckett's (and the Sunday night half price Arizona wines special) and we went.  Everyone loved their food.  My hubby wasn't feeling too great so he didn't eat much, but he enjoyed what he ordered.  Every plate was cleaned as best each person could.  I even got to enjoy the chicken the next day for lunch because one of my friends couldn't finish.  It was divine reheated!

No desserts the second time round, but we did start with the charcuterie board and it was delish!  Especially the housemade cranberry preserves.  We even bought a jar to take home with us!  We're looking forward to going back again.",2011-12-26 17:20:14

Service was fast and friendly, orders were taken promptly, and food showed up quickly!  They were a little quiet on this Wednesday night, but there is plenty of room for large groups here!

Some notables :

The Soft Shell Crab...AMAZING! Loved every bite...this was the highlight of the night for me!  It's not limited to 1pp either!!  Maybe I can just fill up on these next time, without them giving me the evil eye!

Nigiri : Garlic Tuna, Hamachi, Super White, Amaebi, Unagi, and Scallops were all great!  Lots of these have little additions to them, so be sure to specify if you want your fish ""naked"" or how chef prepares them!  

Most of the nigiri had such a crazy fish/rice ratio, that you could wrap the fish all the way around the rice if you wanted to...end to end.  It's like AYCE sashimi with a touch of rice!

Since we came in a large group, I was able to try some of the rolls too...everything was pretty good!  They have lots of good appetizers as well, to stand out from the heavy competition in Vegas.

I am sure we will be back :)

Good heat from the jalepenos, though I wound up adding hot sauce, too.

This review is about the location next to Boston's pizza which for some reason doesn't seem to have an account with yelp anymore... maybe because of how bad they are.
ANYWAY

Used to always come here to get my piercings, got my snug and rook here.
This was about a year ago and everything was fine, the people there were awesome and very professional. I had no problem with either of those piercings, they heeled perfectly in a timely matter.

However this time around it was the completely opposite. The staff that used to be there is no longer there. Came in for a jewelry change for my rook and a helix piercing. The staff all there is completely rude, no hello or how can i help you. Lady was super rude and just said ""what do you want"", reallly? what kind of customer service is that? i processed to tell her what i wanted and she gave me paperwork but didn't ask for id to validate my age. She went to smoke outside and came back 10 minutes later, she walked to the back of the shop and i followed. She didn't wash her hands after smoking she just put on some gloves and processed to TRY to change my rook piercing. She seriously tried to change it for at least 20 minutes and kept cussing because she couldn't get it. She made my ear bleed badly and still couldn't get my jewelry changed....... REALLY??? i should of walked away then. But i stayed to see if maybe she could get my helix right. WRONG, she put a hoop that was pointed out to the top of my ear which was so unconformable. Left the place and went home, it looked so bad that i decided to take it off.

SECOND floor he had a small stall situated beside clothing stores, bubble tea shops, and snack shops.  He stood out from all others because of his background and his unique offering much like how Belgian Waffles is now the attraction at Pacific Mall.

He was the guy that gave me the first taste of this tasty snack and I wish to THANK him for that.  He always had a friendly personality, great smile and offered HOT & FRESH Walnut Cakes upon every order.  He did have problems with his machine from time to time but you can always see him hard at work fixing it with a smile.

Coming to Hodo Kwaja reminds me of how much I really MISS him.  I wish I didn't have such long-term photographic memories, which make me depress.  Nonetheless thanks for the great memories, Mister!

Hodo Kwaja here offers the same product however getting here on a Sunday evening the place was QUIET with no sounds of sweet Walnut Cake machinery to be heard.  We got the Potato Walnut Cake as well as Red Bean Walnut Cake which were all placed in the display case awaiting for future patrons.

My only criticism is that there isn't the variety that most sushi places offer, maybe the menu will expand over time. The sushi is great, the rolls were limited and mostly krab or spicy tuna. Would love to see some veggie rolls make an appearance. 

I love that rolls come in similar portions to the sushi, this allows you to sample without committing to a full roll. Another great thing is that sauce comes on the side. Anyone who is not a sauce person will understand how awesome this is lol.

On my most recent visit, the server checked with the cook (thankfully) and confirmed that the curries have fish sauce, but the stir fries other than pad Thai would be entirely plant-based if ordered with tofu/veggies. I've pretty much given up getting Thai curry at most places now except for Chon Thai, which goes out of its way to make sure the curries are vegetarian/free of any seafood ingredients. I wasn't too hungry anyway, so I just ordered the fresh rolls with no shrimp.

The fresh rolls were a disappointment. They were mostly iceberg lettuce with a bit of unflavored, uncooked tofu. The sauce wasn't what I'd consider to be a peanut sauce - it was more of a thick sweet and sour sauce with crushed peanuts on top. I won't be ordering them again. I've had the red curry and the panang before and liked them, but didn't realize I was eating fish sauce.

My dining companions got a few items that were vegan and looked good -  both were stir fried noodle dishes with tofu but I don't remember what they were called. I think one was the Pad See Ew and the other was the silver noodles but am not certain. My friends said they were okay but not great.

They were so good I finished them all.. psst, if you're health conscious like me, their fries have even more calories than their burgers - which are already pretty high (Just a FYI). But you're probably telling me, who cares, right? Yup. You probably shouldn't eat this more than twice a month.. but go indulge! 

Prices are a bit steep for a burger and fries, and unfortunately they don't offer any combos for the faithful. Although I didn't pay $18, to get away with their 'little' fry and a normal burger for $12.75 isn't too shabby nowadays!",2017-05-18 22:15:11

eFz1QO5ycXoep8KzLLceYg,VCMYANRTxn1euOqZgB4dEQ,_ZfjpSEO5ntk-1hbnwCR4g,2,7,1,1,"Really awful first experience here. Bought 3 nights at Palms Place when I figured out it was the Jetsetter ""Mystery"" hotel. Paid $65/night instead of $159 for a studio suite. The Palms Place tower is a far trek from the casino/restaurants/food court/pool. Allow about 15-20 minutes to get over to the main building, thanks to slow elevators.

Check in was a rude awakening. The person was nice, but their policies SUCK! On top of the $22.40/night resort fee that is due upon check out, they charge your card for $100/night up front for ""incidentals"". And, yes, they charge it immediately. The charge stayed ""pending""  for the length of our stay. The person at the front desk said that credit cards get a ""hold"" for the amount, while debit cards are charged outright and then are refunded upon check out. The resort fee ""includes"" free wifi, though it was slow and runs on an unsecured network. Thanks, but no thanks. I don't know if the resort fee includes anything else. It wasn't explained to us. EDIT: Apparently, the resort fee includes free drinks? Wasn't mentioned to us!

Our room looked impressive at first glance. As we got settled in, we realized it was actually gross. There was water damage on the ceiling above the bed. Neither TV worked. We called downstairs once and they replaced our cable box, but that didn't solve the problem.  The TVs are also broken or locked so that you can't connect your laptop to them. I tried on both screens. My computer recognized that it was connected, but there's no way to change the input on the TV. The light above our couch was missing the knob. When I called to get it fixed, the person at the front desk made a joke that I broke it by partying too hard. Nice try. How about you don't stick people in a broken fucking room? Had to get it repaired at midnight just so we could go to sleep. The bathroom's main light was broken. How did housekeeping miss that? The bathroom also had little piles of hair/debris in the corners. Ick. 

Worst of all, the dishes and silverware and pots/pans/bowl were left dirty in the cabinet. Dishes had grease on them. The silverware was rusty and crusty. The pot and pan had hair and grains of rice in them. The mixing bowl was smeared with something. Seriously? Did I walk into a Motel 6 by mistake and not notice? Am I being Punkd?

For those wondering, Palms Place is not kid-friendly. The TV had none of the usual kid channels. Just Spanish-language channels, some outdoor channel, several tourism channels, MTV, VH1, etc. Very random selection. That is, if you even get a working TV.

What was up with the patio door being locked? There was a placard on door saying not to bring furniture out onto the patio, so it's obviously supposed to open. Whatever. It was 100+ degrees during our stay. I wasn't about to leave the air conditioning.

Room service was GROSS. Spent $50 on a breakfast sandwich (McDonald's seemed gourmet next to this pitiful thing), french toast (No sides included) and coffee. Room service gets an 18% gratuity charged automatically, plus a $5 ""delivery fee"". Um, is there any other way to get room service? The point is that it's delivered, geniuses. We also tried a $9 slice of cake and $9 pint of Ben & Jerry's. You read that right. $9 for a pint of ice cream. The cake was disgusting and tiny, of course.

This is not a room to share with people you don't want to see naked. The toilet does not have a door. The shower door is completely clear. There is only frosted glass around the tub and you can see through it both ways. 

As we were leaving, someone came up to take our bags downstairs. He asked if we enjoyed the stay and we said no. He ignored us and offered to have the valet get our car and said he'd put our bags into the car for us while we checked out. We get outside and our car is parked, but our bags are on a luggage cart out where anyone could grab them. We got our key from the valet and loaded our luggage ourselves. Only then did the valet come over and ask if we needed help as we were already inside the car starting the engine. My mom summed the trip up best: ""No service. Par for the course at Palms Place.""

PROS:Very comfortable bed and the bathtub was HUGE with awesome jet action. Other than that, skip this place. I'm really upset that Palms Place would team up with Jetsetter and sell their rooms as ""Luxury, AAA 4 Diamond suites"" when they obviously planned on giving out their worst rooms. Our relaxing mother-daughter vacation turned out to be a complete disaster.

The food came out pretty fast.  The Edamame was very good, The Potstickers were delish.  The Meatloaf Sliders was the one that I was most interested in, but it came up short.  The Meatloaf was a little bland, lacked a full flavor that I was expecting.  The Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good and full of flavor.  The best item though was the Firecracker Chicken w/Broccoli....nice Spicy flavor and the Sauce that the Chicken was cooked in complimented the dish well.

Overall, it was a decent experience.  There are many more items on the menu I'd like to try.

Their burgers and sammies are all very good. I think I've had every sammich on their menu during one lunch or another, and have never given a single one a thumbs down. London Broil and the Cajun Catfish sammich are the best ones. And after perusing the bar menu, I have had to fight off the urge to order a beer to wash them down with every time as well, due to my presence being required back at work. I enjoy pubs that stock such a wide variety of beers, and this one also includes a rotation of fine ales from another favorite spot of mine, Olde Meck Brewery. I appreciate a bar who keeps it in the QC family! 

This bar is quaint...maybe a little TOO quaint. Being that it is in an old, renovated house, the seating can get cramped at times, especially during peak traffic hours. Service gets bogged down too, both by the level of traffic and unwieldy setup.

I love Creole food, which is a rarity here in NEO. I got the shrimp and grits. The rib-eye had a tasty, unique sweet-spicy cajun rub to it, and the veal was delicious.

For concert goers: Say, if your Blossom Music event is at 8PM, try to make reservations for 530PM, expect to stay 1 hour and 30 minutes, (maybe 2 hours if you order dessert, which we did not) be out by 7, enough time to last the stop-and-go-traffic towards Blossom parking. It's really 3.5 stars rounded out to 4 for me.",2015-09-08 14:27:07

I'm from the school where it is just plain dumb to buy new cars...they depreciate about 30% before you even drive them off the lot after purchase. The only reason I was recently shopping for a new car is because my company, in an effort at a Green Initiative, is giving money towards the purchase of a new auto for associates who go with a hybrid...but it has to be new. 

After dealing with several pushy, sleezy, scheming car dealerships, I'm convinced that this place is the last place on earth to buy a decent car and not have an anxiety attack. The salesmen here don't care what kind of car you get, what price it is, etc. They work on flat commissions...number of cars sold, not value of the car. They are helpful and knowledgeable, but not pushy and overbearing. They will leave you the heck alone and let you walk around the lot...unHEARD of in this industry! And the best part...if you DO walk off the lot without a purchase, they don't hound you for days/weeks/months afterwards, wondering why you didn't buy a car from them! They do a thorough job of inspecting used cars; I've driven 4 vehicles purchased from Carmax, and have never had any problems, outside routine maintenance/normal wear and tear. 

My only gripe with CarMax is I feel they lowball the hell out of you when you sell them a vehicle most of the time, sometimes way below Kelly Blue Book value. I've taken 3 cars in to get appraised to sell, and only once did I take their deal. I did far better in private placement with the other two cars. I guess that is the price you pay for convenience of being able to walk out with a check in hand, without the hassle of putting ads in papers, time and effort to sell the car on your own, etc. Do your homework before you blindly accept their offer. 

Oh yeah...and don't even waste your breath trying to haggle, either for a better asking price for a car you are trying to sell, or one you are trying to buy. When they say ""No Haggle"" price, they mean it. No...seriously....don't even try. They aren't allowed to haggle. 

Although CarMax deals mostly in used vehicles, they do stock new cars on occasion. Check them out!",2011-05-23 21:21:04

1. I love bar food, cowboy food, and Tex-Mex food.  Roadrunner Saloon carries all three of these types of food and they all taste great! I have tried a lot of the items and my belly is always happy afterwards.  Tasty food makes me happy.

2. Dr. Pepper Tacos!  Yes, you heard me right!  I love Dr. Pepper just a smidgeon less than my hubby and kid, like a paper thin difference.  So when I heard about these tacos, I had to investigate.  They are super duper fantastic!  The soda makes the meat so tender and flavorful.   They are fun to eat and taste great. I know this goes with #1, but anything regarding Dr. Pepper gets a special spot in my book.

3. Great service.  Every time I have been to this location, I have gotten great service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  I love good service because it makes your meal so much more enjoyable.  

4. It's family friendly.  Many of my favorite bar food joints have switched to a 21 and over only, which means I rarely can go.  Sad.  Roadrunner does allow kids and families, so we can all go out to a good meal.  My daughter loves the place too because she is all about cowboy stuff already.

5. The drinks are stiff!  If you are interested in bar service, the drinks are tasty.  I rarely have alcoholic drinks these days, but if you want one, Roadrunner serves stiff!

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that I think the prices are a bit high for what you get.  It isn't crazy over priced, just a $1 or so too high on most of the food items and $2-3 to high on the drinks.  Maybe I am just cheap in my old age, but that is how I see it.  I still love this place and will continue to go, I just wish it was a bit cheaper.",2014-03-12 21:39:22

It really pains me to give any Black Bear Diner such a low rating, but they can thank the male manager on duty during the morning shift on 2/24/18 for taking what would have been a solid three stars to one star and for losing ALL of my future business.  I love the Tropicana location.  The Sahara location is one of my favorites.   I've never had an issue until this visit. Black Bear was always on the top of my recommendation list for my out of town guests.

Short version - Manager wanted to argue over 10% military/veteran discount and told me he will make sure that he tells all of the Las Vegas Valley stores to stop providing such discount.  His reasons for not wanting to provide it were ridiculous and some are provided below.  

This location is always very busy, especially on the weekends.  There were four of us (two military veterans and spouses) and the wait was not terrible.  We were seated within 15 minutes and had a great server named Yessenia take care of our table.  She did a fantastic job and took care of all our needs efficiently.

The food was ok.  A little flavorless compared to the other locations, but not unsatisfactory.

The problem started when the check came.  I had just visited the Sahara location on 2/18 with my husband who always inquires about a military/veteran discount.  We try to patronize the places that do so and encourage our veteran and military friends to do the same. Often times we kick the difference back to our server on top of what the full price tip would be when we get good service.  The Sahara location gladly offered it to us and stated it is 10%.  Our dining companions also made note that they have received a discount at locations in Utah, Oregon, and California.

When our table asked, we were told no by the person who brought the check, who was not our server.  When our friend asked for them to double check, we then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes and no one came back.  I took the check up to the cashier and asked again and was told she didn't know.  I asked to speak to the manager.

The manager said that Black Bear does not offer a discount to anyone.  I told him I was at the Sahara store less than a week ago and there was a veteran discount.I explained that we got good service and it would allow me to tip extra to Yessenia.  Our friends also expressed that they have received the same discount at all other locations.  This started out benign but then he claimed the following:

- No one in the chain does it. Ever.
- But then claimed he gives ""them"" (other stores?) leeway to do so based on location.  Or if they feel they should give it to the veteran.
- He says if they are close to a base they can do it.  Then tells me that he allows it in St. George, UT and Layton, UT.    Last time I checked, Nellis AFB is here and a hell of a lot closer than St. George.
- He said he would make sure he lets ""all of his stores here"" know to stop offering it.

I told him that I'd be glad to let all of our military and veteran friends know to stop visiting.   He begrudgingly gave me the 10% off which I did indeed tip back to our great server.  I hope she sees this and considers finding a better work environment because her manager's attitude could definitely cut into her money.  I hope Black Bear Diner will also see this and check into what is happening in their stores.  I also hope the young soldier who was less than 10 feet away from the cashier stand heard this and decided to go elsewhere.",2018-02-26 16:14:41

Create a menu that would pair well with the show case world class beers. 

The service we experience was very friendly but there where periods that we were wondering what happened to our server. Maybe the layout of the dining room makes for hard work for the servers because it is like a maze if walls to get from one area to the other. 

The mussels we had as an appetizer were sub par and definitely not worth the price. As far as the entrees are concerned there was almost too much ""stuff"" to choose from. All of which I really didn't find too appetizing so I went with the portobello mushroom burger that had some blue cheese on it, it was okay. The special lady had some sort of chicken club sandwich that was also only okay the chicken was cooked a little overdone an the bacon was very undercooked! Yuck that was gross!

I will clarify that I am not interested in Pediatrics and will not be seeking employment by PCH, so do not worry, there are no beneficial rewards that I can gain from this review!

First off, this place gets busy. It is a top 10 US pediatric hospital in the volume of children they see per year. Kids from all over Arizona are flown in if they are in serious enough condition. Many of the kids here are amazingly sick. So many of them had rare diseases/conditions that I had only read about in my textbooks. The thing is that PCH commonly sees the uncommon so they are well versed in those conditions and have no problems getting consultations and working as a multi-disciplinary team to get the best treatment results. I have been to numerous hospitals, and the residents/attending physicians are some of the most intelligent, most hard working doctors around. Common pediatric illnesses, emergencies, and the rare can all be taken of at this hospital.They have above average staff and resources to help get answers sooner rather than later.

The rooms are spacious - these rooms used to have 2 beds in one room, but they converted it to where there is only one patient per room now. So if you want to stay with your kid throughout the night, you will have your privacy and won't be cramped for space. Also, the amount of things to do in this hospital are amazing. There seems to be an art or teen game center on every floor. So many NFL/NBA/NHL athletes come through the PCH doors to greet the kids that it's really a refreshing sight to see professional athletes being so altruistic. Also, many volunteers will bring their specially trained dogs to visit each child's room (if they want)! PCH makes you feel as comfortable as possible.

I ate here for a month and I don't think I ate the same thing twice. This hospital has more food options that a mall food court....and the quality of food is amazing. It's not just ""hospital food."" It's the next level. They have a juice bar in the mornings where you can get freshly squeezed juice. There is a crepe bar, an omelet bar, pasta bar, salad bar, grill, asian grill bar, etc....can't list them all!

The other two times were to have breakfast.  I looked at the menu online before I went, and I was pretty certain what I'd get but I wanted to see any specials they might have.

Soup:  I got the Spinach potage, the name on the specials board.  My waiter described it as a potato leek soup with emulsified with spinach.  It had a goat cheese mousse on top with some Niçoise olive oil.  Very tasty soup.

Main course: Steak frites.  Cooked rare as ordered and tons of french fries.  This is very characteristic of any Bouchon meal with frites.  At some point, you have to decide whether you want to finish all of those tasty critters or save some room for dessert and just let them go.  That's what I opted to do.

Dessert:  The desserg special tonight was Neopolitan French macaron ice cream sandwiches one of each of the traditional Neopolitan flavors.  They're the standard macarons you can buy in the Bouchon Bakery downstairs but they were filled with ice cream rather than the cream the macarons normally have.  These were outstanding.

I really like coming to Bouchon.  I like the room, the nice view to the 10th floor courtyard, and the food is quit interesting.  My server was Brandon, and he was excellent!  The bus person was there to refill my iced tea, and when he noticed there wasn't enough ice, he brought me a new glass of ice, filled it with tea, and took the other glass away.  Really outstanding service.  

It's no wonder that when I have a friend text me that he's going to Bouchon for breakfast and asks, ""Do you want to meet me there?"" that I send a Yes answer back quickly.

Other times one cannot find a staff member or if you could they are all conversing and catching up on their busy lives. Usually ignoring us customers, forgetting that we pay their salary. 

The benefit of this store is that it is open 24/7. Believe it or not due to the economic issues a lot of businesses in Vegas are not open all the time, but they have extended hours and such. So this place is a godsend if one needs something because their prices are great and it's usually in stock.",2018-04-09 04:03:31

Came here to get my Maltese groomed for the summer and they did an amazing job with it since Einstein (our Maltese) was developing baby dreads in the most random places. He came back smelling SUPER fresh and looked like a completely different dog (in a good way) since Malteses are usually the fluffy kind- And to see him without that amount of hair while still being cute is fascinating. 

This is our go-to spot for his food and treats as well. They offer small sample bags for your dog to try before deciding to buy a large bag since the prices are higher than most department stores but let me do add that the selection is 10 times better. You're looking at all-natural dog food similar to what Whole Foods and Trader Joe's would carry. And since my boyfriend and I usually eat all natural and organically, we figure we wanted the same for Einstein. (And he loves it!) 

We also got Einstein's bed here, along with some cool insulated dog bowls to keep his water cold for a good amount of time (yeah, he's kind of spoiled) but the quality of each product was too hard to pass up since Einstein deserves the best for being such a good dog (he truly deserves it). Bring in your dog someday! And he/she will never look at Petsmart or Petco the same way again. (LOL)",2014-11-09 15:30:41

The servers... were fantastic!  They took our orders in a timely fashion and in an organized manner and (I believe) they got all of the orders correct.  That's a big plus for a large group!  They also were attentive throughout our meal, checking in with us regularly and they made sure that our water glasses never went empty.

The food... I had the Chicken Pad Thai.  It was good, but nothing that wowed me.  A little too sweet for me (and I typically go for sweeter foods).  I will opt for the Panang Curry next time.

The drinks... I ordered a Thai tea to go with my Pad Thai and that was very goodA  I would definitely order that from Thai Long-An again.

I had ordered a side of beer battered zucchini, but I never got it. After eating my sandwich I went up to the front to ask the cashier who was on the phone while I waited about 5 minutes, and when another employee walked by and as we made eye contact I said, ""hey man I think they forgot about my order of fried zucchini.."" And then he proceeded to blow right past me and completely ignored me.

Moral of the story is, I paid for food that I never got and when I tried to bring it to their attention I got absolutely blown off. I'm not the type of person that appreciates paying for something I never get.

I ordered three items. Total would have been $21 after tax but I had a coupon from night market so total was just over $14 after tax. A bit pricey for desserts!

1. Grass jelly and Q ball
2. Grass jelly and taro
3. Tofu jelly and Q ball

My favorite is the grass jelly and taro. The grass jelly is fresh and homemade, comes with a large chunk of soft sweetened cooked taro, flavored Q balls (in case you are wondering what Q balls are, it is like a glutinous rice ball, chewy and flavored. You will find taro, sweet potato, green tea flavors here). Tiny tapioca pearls, all soaked in sweetened grass jelly soup. Delicious! I do wish their grass jelly is a bit more flavourful and firm. It tastes a little watered down. 

The grass jelly and Q ball tastes similar to the taro, only difference is there is large tapioca pearls instead of taro chunk. 

Tofu jelly is interesting. Its fresh and homemade so the texture is very soft compared to what you usually get from a tub. Comes in a peanut soup with Q balls. 

Everything tastes pretty authentic so I am quite happy. But it is expensive for Asian dessert so  I wonder how they'll hold up. Ambience in store is nice, modern, clean. Now I have one less reason to buy a plane ticket back home :)",2014-10-23 23:19:37

Ordered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!

A friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more.

Sharky's has some things that make it a little different and a little better than the typical quick service Mexican restaurant. They try to use organic ingredients and locally sourced ingredients. The menu is huge and features a menu with lower calorie lower fat options. The menu has calorie counts for every item to help diners make smart choices.

I had the half order of the Shrimp Power Plate with Yucatan Yams and Mexican Rice. The sides were good, but the shrimp was a little rubbery. I love the idea of the power plate so I'd get this again, but with a different meat. My husband ordered Fajita Chicken Tacos and enjoyed them. The tacos were huge and tacos alone made for a large portion of food. We also shared an order of Chicken Nachos. Even the regular order of nachos was plenty to share. The nachos were my favorite item that we tried. They had lots of yummy toppings and flavor. 

We almost missed it, but there is a chips and salsa bar in the back of the restaurant. There is a nice variety of salsa flavors. Drink options are interesting as well. They offer sangrias and beers, but also fun lemonades and teas.",2017-09-24 14:56:56

- Scallop and pork belly
- Beef short rib
- Valhrona chocolate brownie
- Fruit and sorbet

We all got different meals and everything was delicious. Chef did wonders with the food. Loved the food.  But I found the portions to be small. 

We got the garlic knots, sea bass and spaghetti. 

So something weird happened. My friend ordered water for the table, she specifically asked for 'ice water' 

The waiter brought us natural spring water.  And ice on the side.   All night the waiter was refilling our water glasses.   I was like, wow this bottle is not finishing.  But little our knowledge.....he filled the glasses with three rounds of bottles....in the end we bought three bottles and didn't even realize.  We didn't order natural spring water but he should have asked us if we wanted more bottles of this expensive water.  I would have been fine with tap water.

The poke is served in a like a box that you would associate fries or chicken wings with. This needs to be served in a bowl. 

The sauces are not easy to incorporate with the veggies/filler doe to it not being in a bowl. 

There was no spicy poke option. One of the best spicy poke bowls I had was from Whole Foods in Oahu. I called them up after my trip and they told me how they made the sauce. 

I was going to get the salmon bowl however I noticed that the salmon had that brown part of that stripe down the middle. To me that part of the fish smells like cat food, super fishy. I know some people are into hyper fishy tastes, however most Americans are not.

Tuna quality was pretty good.",2018-03-10 17:10:36

Food - A wide range of food that is both tasty and fresh, I have yet to go with someone who couldn't find something they liked on the menu. Personal favorites are the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Sweet Potato Fries. I also like their milkshakes, though they tend to be more tasty calories than I should be packing these days. Most of the veggies and food comes from the nearby farm.

Restaurant - Retro furturistic farmstead? I don't know where Joe gets his concepts, but they are fun. The building is the old Johnston family house, and the fireplace in the inside dining area still looks like it is from the 1950s. Also, be sure to visit the restrooms.

Outside Area - My one downside to this restaurant is the free for all often found around the building. The grass area is a great place for kids, but too many parents seem to think this is a license to let their kids run around unsupervised. I usually opt to eat inside as a result, which is a shame because it is such a beautiful area.

In fact, I was the only customer there for a while. This place is really new and I wanted to give it a shot because the last car wash that was here (which closed in 2010-11 I think) was really good. Unfortunately, the one thing that knocked off 1 star was when I was pulling in to the actual carwash part. I lined up with the chain that pulls your car and the man directing me approached my driver window and said ""go ahead and roll your shit up"". Look bro, you're working and making money. Leave that talk at home and treat people with some kind of decency. 

Second star was knocked off because I paid $33 (+$5 tip) for a carwash that really should have cost about $20 in regards to quality. It is my fault I didn't thoroughly walk around my car and check, but I was pre-occupied with asking the guy to dry the edges of the trunk lid so I just forgot to check the rest of the car. When I got home I noticed all the spots that were missed, including an entire rim that wasn't even polished or tire-dressed. I'm a bit confused as to how this could happen, being that two guys were working on my car, one guy covering the left side and the other covering the right. Secondly, it was so slow that there is no excuse. I can understand sometimes especially when its busy and they're trying to get people out that spots can be missed.

Their front desk staff is still top notch, the facility is still clean and super comfy and the ease of making an appointment is still intact. 

My disappointment stems from their high massage therapist turnover. Since I've joined, every time I've loved a therapist, they've left after about 3-5 months. It's disconcerting to keep on finding the next ""right"" therapist and after a few less than stellar massages I decided to cool things off with Massage Nirvana and ended my membership. Also, my wonderful aesthetician Maria has also left and that was a large reason why I kept up the membership. 

I will still recommend Massage Nirvana to one-timers (visitors, family) who are looking to get some treatments outside the strip at a nice facility. If they are able to retain their good masseuses/aestheticians this place would be a diamond in Las Vegas. Pity.

It wasn't that long ago that it was almost impossible to find places like this when you're visiting.  Being in a tourist trap like Vegas made it all that much harder.  

Coffee Pub is close enough to the casinos that it's easy to get to if you happen to be staying at one but far enough still that the prices aren't crazy.  I loved the vibe this place had.  Walking in I felt like I had found some secret place only locals would know about.  Being that it's in the back of an outdoor mall with no obvious signage from the street I may not be that far off.  The staff was very helpful and friendly but not in that fake way you get used to when you spend a lot of time in the casinos.  The menu had lots of great choices that made me wish it wasn't a 4 hour drive away from home so I could try them all.  

I'm not normally a coffee drinker but I figured if I'm trying out a place named Coffee Pub I had to try some.  It was very good and I could see myself drinking more of it if I lived closer.

I'll be sure to eat here every time I find myself in Vegas.",2013-10-14 02:33:39

C46vX06XZeLUK7-weKQL_w,0Zswwlz4NzUJoG-skyWzIw,oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ,4,3,0,1,"Came here as a group of 11 for a company dinner on a Wednesday night. At Campagnolo, they require you to order the family style sharing / tasting menu ($65 per person) if you are a group greater than six people. Though the food wasn't particularly fancy, the dishes were well executed for the most part. The service was also excellent - we had two dietary restrictions (one was vegetarian and the other didn't eat beef), and they made sure to accommodate both. None of the dishes had beef, and the vegetarian got separate dishes for all those that had meat.

We started off with appetizers. First came small plates of a diverse variety of warm olives. These were extremely tasty; they were salty and tangy but not too oily and hit the spot. Some very interesting ""bread"" came out with some garlic whipped butter. The ""bread"" was actually more a gougere - it was light and airy. Eaten along with the whipped butter, it highly resembled a makeshift cream puff! 

A little while after, more hearty and substantial appetizers came out. The castelfranco salad arrived - bearing strong resemblance to a creamy Caesar salad, this salad had some bitter frisee coated in a great sauce. There was the saltiness and umami of the anchovies, mixed with the creaminess of the egg. I loved this salad and went back for thirds! Almost simultaneously, the restaurant's signature appetizer of fresh burrata with roasted grapes and toasted bread. The grapes were nice and warm, the burrata was melty, and the bread had a nice honey sweetness on top.

The mains (primi), two plates of pasta, arrived next. First came the potato gnocchi with braided rabbit. To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of this dish. The gnocchi was slightly disappointing - it was a little dense and not very pillowy or fluffy. The rabbit was delicious though, it was so tender. Then came housemade spaghetti all'amatriciana. I much preferred this over the gnocchi. The spaghetti was slightly thicker than usual, but really al dente, and the smokiness of the pork cheek really cut through. I loved the slight kick of spice that came at the end! 

Then came the secondi (the vegetarian received a plate of mushroom ragu in lieu of what we got). There was short rib ragu with veal meatballs, spareribs and tripe, served on polenta. The meatballs were juicy and tender, but I found some parts of the spare ribs (the portion on the short rib) a bit too fatty. I literally bit into it and the entire mouthful I got was fat. I did like the tripe and spareribs though - it was nice and meaty and flavourful. The next dish was seared Norwegian trout, served on a bed of fried brussel sprouts and potatoes. I wasn't expecting the potatoes at first, and was pleasantly surprised when I bit into something mushy. This dish was my favourite - I love fish, and I can say that I had fifths and sixths of this plate! Definitely cleared one of the four plates on our table by myself... I really appreciated the dill and cream sauce, which really highlighted the trout and accentuated the flavour.

Finally, the dolci / dessert came. We were all served a small glass of their salted caramel budino. Unfortunately, the dessert wasn't well received, and it was the only dish of the night that wasn't liked. We all found it overwhelmingly sweet. In addition to the budino, I also got a pleasant surprise. The waitress had heard me saying to a colleague beforehand that I really craved gelato, and brought back two flavours for me - their buttermilk (which was again on the sweet side, but worked really well with the budino), and a vegan chocolate. The vegan chocolate resembled a dark chocolate and was so delicious!

In terms of drinks, we all ordered cocktails and bottles of red wine. I got the settanta cinque - a nice light drink with some lemon citrus notes. 

In conclusion, this was a great Italian place with amazing customer service. Would definitely recommend, despite the fact that its dishes didn't really blow me away - but it was quite consistent in high quality overall.",2018-03-10 00:12:56

I love it. It's one of my favorite things. I've been to many all-you-can-eat sushi places before but none like this. The amount and variety of food they have to offer is astounding.

The decor is very nice. High vaulted ceilings, large windows, clean white booths with light green accents, and green planters. Walking into the restaurant feels light, refreshing, and welcoming.

What's nice about Kaze is you order as you go. Sushi isn't sitting on a train, or at a buffet table. A waiter comes, you order, order more, and more until the act of speaking becomes too strenuous. I find that many all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants have low quality fish and sushi. Kaze's quality even dwarfs some stand alone a la carte sushi restaurants with their freshness and quality rolls. I'm sure that the order as you go method helps keep their quality standards high as the sushi isn't just sitting waiting to be eaten.

They have so many items from beef sukiyaki to popcorn chicken. Their specialty rolls are great. The Fire Dragon Roll is a spider roll topped with spicy salmon and is a hit with those that like raw fish and also those that don't. Plenty of sake is on tap and everything is made fresh to order. Fish shipments come in every morning so freshness is always guaranteed. Their beef teriyaki is a must try. Thinly sliced beef, green peppers, and onions, in a teriyaki sauce that isn't thick or overly sweet.

Overall, Kaze has set the bar for all-you-can-eat sushi places and it has set it very high. Quality, quantity, and price are all very pleasing. Of all my travels, I have yet to come across any all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant of this quality.

I've been frequenting this place for years. I've tried the other Tacos Mexico chains around town, but for some reason the one on the EASTCYDE tastes better to me. I'm probably just trippin.

Located on Maryland Parkway and Charleston blvd.  Grimy. You gotta love it. 

These folks are open 24/7. Late night grinds are great here, but use the buddy system.

Now back to said subject...

Oh their CARNE ASADA BURRITO... I remember when this beast was less than $5.00.  This burrito to me has stolen my heart. I've tried other burritos at other joints.  They were all very good, but I find myself comparing them to the Tacos Mexico CARNE ASADA BURRITO on Charleston and Maryland.  A perfect combination of beans, Spanish rice, onions, and asada. Always comes out solid and greaseless. I always opt for Chile for that extra kick, and then I dump their red hot sauce all over that thing. The girth of this burrito will make you blush!!!

Till this day, I will always support Tacos Mexico's carne asada burrito.

I got the spicy eggplant figuring that would be a good choice since eggplant is in season. It was just ok. I tasted more grease than anything else, but I was missing all those hot/sour/sweet/bitter elements that I expect with Thai food.

The ferry is so inexpensive- I think 6.50? and there is a ton to do! A lot of other YELP reviewers are correct on here that the ferry to Center Island, and Center Island itself, are kid-filled and loud, and I agree, but I think it's nice. I took a fair few trips here last summer! At one point my cousin and I (I am in my early 20s, she is in her late teens) went on a few of the ""kid rides,"" including the Ferris Wheel and the (Skyride?) where we got to look over the whole park. I found it very enjoyable.

The outdoor restaurant on the Center Island part wasn't bad, but I feel I like Hanlan's point the best. I didn't visit the nude beach, but I would swear that I got the best spot in the house in a little sandy pit on the edge of Hanlan'd Point to watch the Canada Day fireworks! It was amazing. Going to Toronto Island is a welome change for me (as much as I love the city, I really like the green! It's a very relaxing place.)

A few more points:

Pluses/tips:
+you can rent a bike for hours, or the whole day
+the bikes come from single, all the way up to.. I think 6 people? Very cool.
+There are tons of beach spots
+BBQ pits!
+Lots of places to sit, even when busy
+Check out Hanlan's point for an incredible view of Toronto
+Water taxis can take you back to the city if you miss your ferry, but ferries are frequent

Minuses/
-Bring a picnic for a day trip. The restaurants that I have tried were expensive! If you eat on the Island, I suggest a full Pizza at Pizza Pizza split amongst you... but there are plenty of places to picnic and that makes it more fun!
- Mosquitos are frequent at night!
-Last ferry leaves at 11:30 ish so you want to be sure to get there by then

With much of their business coming from the office buildings where, they're located, that's probably a goof idea because even though it's along the freeway, it's off the beaten path.

There was no line and I ordered a Moroccan sandwich with chicken, one of their grilled sandwich options.  This sandwich can also be made with eggplant for a vegetarian option.  With it, I ordered an iced black tea.

I sat at a high top table on the side so I could watch the people do their work at the grill and espresso machine.

In a short time, my sandwich and tea were on my table.  The sandwich came with some mixed greens with a little dressing.  The Moroccan is made with goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and is topped with a North African spiced aioli.  The sandwich was quite good and the mixed greens were a perfect amount for a lunch portion with sandwich.  I really liked the North African spiced aioli.  It gave the sandwich a very good flavor.

The cafe has a nice area for outdoor eating between the two buildings or in front where it's shaded.  It looked very pleasant but the morning was still cool m so I stayed indoors.

I would have tried a pastry but there wasn't much of a selection left.  It looked like the pastry people had come through and bought everything in sight.

The restaurant is bright and elegantly decorated, colorful, and all the waitstaff were very professional and friendly. They have several lounge ""cubicles"" to wait while your table is being setup too, which I thought was pretty smart for groups that are waiting - you can still talk and everyone can sit and face each other while you wait. 

We ate:
3 course meal of: 
1) Blue corn pancake: bbq duck + habanero chile + star anise sauce - Pretty good, but a little on the salty side
2) New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: pretty good, light and fresh, came with Mexican spiced fries too that were really good. This is what everyone calls the #1 dish here, but I really think that award goes to the corn tamale (below). 
3) Panna Cotta: SO GOOD - nice and light and the fruit was soaked in some type of liquor and really fresh and ripe. 


Others:
Appetizers: 
Cremini Mushroom Quesadilla: pretty good, but will try something else next time
Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: OMG I could eat this all day, every day, for the rest of my life. The shrimp was nicely seasoned and tender, not overcooked, the tamale was sweet and savory, the white corn was fresh and drowned in this yummy creamy corn sauce. YUM....

Admittedly not the biggest boba fan before, as of late I have become quite the boba monstah and have been alternately going between BTB and my original preferred place Kung fu tea. BTB has quite the edge for me now due to the outstanding service I get from Dennis. He's always there to guide you thru orders, helping you figure out what you want and offers suggestions along the way. Even in times when choices are questionable, he'll oblige and always tells you their disclaimer that if for whatever reason you are not satisfied with your drink they'll remake it until you do. Sou is just as awesome, top notch service always with a smile and aims to please. It amazes me that they remember regulars and their orders because there's quite a lot of us lol. That to me is personalized service and that's what sets them apart in my book and truly deserving of the 5 stars! Thus my loyalty lies with the BEST!

I have since tried Hokkaido milk tea which is like drinking dessert, not in the sense that it's a sugar overload but that it's creamy and decadent, sweetness is customizable of course! This last time I tried Earl Grey with sea salt crème and that my friends is a winner! I have found my favorite drink, although I still have quite a lot to try from their menu, the possibilities are endless here with the combinations you can do! Another big plus compared to KFT's limited flavor customization due to their franchise limitations. The boba has been consistently great which leads me to believe that my taste buds were probably out of whack on my first visit lol. I also got a Strawberry Banana slush for the kids to share, that was a winner in my book as well. I'm not sure if they used powder or real fruits, it didn't taste artificial to me and was quite refreshing actually.

Of course it's not the best quality Chinese food, it is a BUFFET. One thing that's been really bugging me about Yelp lately is how so many people compare buffet food to restaurant food, which just isn't fair as buffets work on a totally different level. /Ramble.
Anyways, the Krazy Buffet is definitely one of the better Chinese buffets. I loved the spot Penda's on Spring Mountain@Rainbow (It closed recently. R.I.P.), but that was pretty much hangover/stoner food, and I'm still upset over the $11.00 I wasted at New China. Krazy Buffet on the other hand is always fresh and good quality. There's quite a bit more seafood than usual to be found here, however, the seafood items are ironically the least fresh of all the offerings in the buffet. The sushi ain't half bad though. 
The service is decent enough, my drink was never empty. 
They also offer french fries and garlic bread. That gave me some interesting ideas to say the least, since Chinese food is something I love to improvise with.

Our pictures does not do justice for the chef, as it was taken by my cheap BB9300.

Make sure you ask for the monthly chef special. It is a cheese roll so be warned it is very filling but guaranteed to make everyone oh ahs as the flavors just melt. Their flying roe is also great as the seaweed does not break when you are attempting to pick them up, nor any other sushi roll.

I do enjoy a good snail, and the escargot was decent. Very buttery and garlicky. It might have been a little bit too buttery as each snail I picked up left a little pool of butter. It tasted more like butter than snails. 

The beef wellington was also decent, though there was nothing special about it. Just a piece of beef wrapped in puff pastry. It came with a side of blanched asparagus. 

The best part of the meal was definitely the macarons. We were able to choose three flavors out of the flavors they had for the day. I chose pumpkin, passionfruit chocolate, and praline.

Our first experience was sweet:  we rode our bikes in search of the delicious nachos we read about on Yelp and were delighted to meet one of the owners (Pam) outside, who told us we could bring our bikes inside for safety.  Inside, we met the beautiful and uber-friendly Cindy, who lit up our Sunday and set in motion our Nacho dreams.
This was the beginning of a never-ending rapport between us and Sago's.  And yes, it IS Say-go's, not Sah-go's.
The nachos are better than you could ever imagine: piles of crisp (not crunchy) chips layered with black beans, FRESH (not pickled) jalapenos, both nacho and cheddar cheese, pico, and the best part of all, chipotle cream sauce.   You have the option of carne asada---which my man says is superb--or chicken.  Of course, we get the meat on the side for my vegetarian wishes and everyone is happy:)
We haven't had much else as we are totally addicted to this chipotle-laden delight and usually go when this particular craving strikes.
The staff here is better than any other local bar I know of.  No matter which shift we have come in on, we always receive superior service.   The bartenders seem to appreciate their jobs and their customers while striving to make you a regular.
Other perks:  Good ventilation, super-clean bathrooms, a few video games (please, oh, please, fix the Texas Hold em' tournament game) and great perks for gamers.

For my meal I usually get the chimichanga with chicken fajita filling, seasoned pieces of chicken peppers and onions, sour cream, guacamole rice and beans.  By the time you pay $2.25 extra for the chicken fajita filling its around a $15.00 chimichanga so it's a little pricey but so good.  Tonight I decided on the Chilequiles since I had never seen it in their menu before.  It is kind of a Mexican casserole with chicken cheese sour cream and green sauce this version said it had corn chips baked in, usually it is made with corn tortillas but I thought ""why not I love their chips"".  Let's start with the good news it was jam packed with shredded chicken that was moist and had great flavor.  Now for the bad the chips just turned into a soggy mush and the green sauce made it feel more like a thick chicken soup than a casserole.  The rice and beans were fantastic so after finishing those and the appetizer I was okay just picking at my soup.  2.5 stars for that dish due to the chicken everyone else's food was good now I just know what I can skip next time.",2018-03-22 18:29:33

JyVRPgrQKcFDO3EVp4BoqA,epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5eV8oUGdBXylwB7HeaDFOA,5,4,2,4,"Two words: Falafel Pita. 

I'm not lying when I say that The Great Greek's Falafel Pita is the best I've had. Bold statement, yes, but I have my reasons.

FOOD
I made my order into a combo and chose a side of fries over the salad (not this time, lettuce). The combo also comes with a drink which I wasn't aware of, because I'm accustomed to dining at Greek and Mediterranean restaurants that normally charge extra for beverages.

+Falafel Pita: Hummus, shredded lettuce, diced onions and tomatoes, and ground falafels all wrapped in a soft, warm pita and topped with a pepper. To say that it was ""good"" would be an understatement, so just look at this photo instead: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BJO8YVuJQo1jVeyGoDovuw&userid=epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg). 

One of the main reasons why I like Great Greek's Falafel Pita is that It's easy to eat. Unlike the ones from other Greek and Mediterranean restaurants I've eaten at, Great Greek breaks down the falafels, thus making it easier to consume. I couldn't help but think, ""Duh, why didn't anyone think of this sooner?!"" while I was eating my pita. It just makes sense! Breaking down the falafels saves me time from having to unwrap my pita and eat my falafels with a knife and fork. 

+French Fries: Originally, I wanted to order a side of Feta Fries, but taking into consideration that this was my first time dining at this establishment, I stuck with my combo's fries. Deep fried, golden brown, and crunchy, the fries are delicious as they are. I can only imagine how wonderful they would taste like with crumbled feta cheese on top. 

SERVICE
Restaurants where the employees greet you with a smile are a plus in my book. When I first walked in, I was welcomed by the kind lady working at the counter.

The food here is quickly made and served right to your table within 10 minutes, so you won't have to wait too long to eat.

OVERALL
Their Falafel Pita combo has won me over, and now I *have* to try everything on their menu, as well as their baklava that's displayed right there on the counter, ready to be consumed.",2012-07-07 15:53:24

Firetrucks came and we were so scared that we would have to pay.  They did ask for ID, and our only form of ID was our TTC student passes. Fortunately, we never had to pay for the false fire alarm.

I came again recently for a friends birthday.  We each ordered the all you can eat meat with liver, salmon, ribs, beef, fish fillet, chicken, and pork.  The beef shank was not the best cut, but it was very well marinated.  The other meat dishes were ok.  The salmon was bland, and I would recommend you dip it or cook it with the table sauce.  The side dishes (bean sprouts, tofu, spicy bean sprouts) were tasteless and I stopped myself at half a side dish.

I would recommend this place if you are a big carnivore and have a big appetite.  Definitely avoid if you're vegetarian and choose the vegetarian pho place across the street.  Remember to ask for your grill to be changed after it starts getting charred.

So I kinda waited around before deciding to leave my folks and walk down flamingo and see what there was to eat cheap. I was starving haven't eaten since breakfasts. Busted out the yelp app and saw a donuts place nearby.  Walked towards the donut shop then changed my mine. Ended up winging it and just walked, passed Roy's and saw 9091. Ok let's do this. Aww closed. Ok what else was there, I didn't want to walk back without anything. Walked some more towards jack in a box, didn't really want to settle for them and hoped there was something on the way. A message place, a pizza place looked like they were closed, a nice dressed restaurant skipped it  i was in  shorts and slippers, walked a little more then turned around to see if the pizza place was open. Ahh Verona Pizza, a girl was cleaning the floors, chairs were up, has to be closed nope they were open. A relief, saw the $3.99 for 2 slices of cheese pizza  and a soda and got it after checking out the menu.  Sat outside, enjoyed the full moon, cool night, pizza slices and soda, fast and friendly service. Pizza was very good, made like NY style but with a better tasting dough, thinner crispy edible crust, light and not oily or greasy which helps a lot because it wasn't a sloppy and saggy mess. The owner or at least what looked like the owner seemed cool too he spotted me the tax cause I only had $4 cash and my card.  The rest of their menu was looked pretty good and at a good price, definitely coming back. 12 wings and a soda for around 6 bucks.

My night here wasn't actually over with the food, it is again Vegas on a Saturday night. During my meal, a guy asked me to use my phone, no problem looked like a local boy from Hawaii probs UNLV student who was stressing cause his friends left um there. Hawaii people can usually spot each other out and always show that aloha when needed. But if he wen dig wit my phone, my slippaz was off and ready fo run lol. Later on there was a customer who walked out of Verona swinging his carry-out pizza box in all kinds of direction and the owner looking guy ran out and nicely scolded him and told him that he was gonna mess his pizza up, probably first time having a pizza in a box lol. Also when I was about done there a guy who was walking back and forth, in and out of Verona, across the parking lot, who I thought was a regular customer waiting for pizza. But then he stood by the entrances 10 feet from me, quiatly speaking to himself, then went all out talking to himself swing his arms, shaking his pocket filled with coins, sounded like he was bragging about how much coins he had. I dunno I was already done and bailed. Pretty good night so far enjoyed my pizza and energized myself. Lol sounds more like a Facebook update then a review but I figured share my experience.

Add they have sitting indoors and outdoots. And a big menu that includes, pizzas, salads, calzones/stromboli, sandwiches, and more. Open til 2am Fri and Sat, 12 am Sun-Thurs.",2011-07-17 17:40:34

I used to travel to Florida monthly for work and got a little spoiled (and addicted) by the great cuban food selection. HC isn't on par with some of those places, but it's darn good and it's the best Cuban food I've found in Phoenix.

The flavors are fresh and robust. Personal favorites are the Pollo Cubano (chicken marinated in citrus, onion, and lime), the Arroz con Pollo (chicken with safron rice, chorizo, and asparagus-with other yummy stuff), and the Paradise Pulled Pork (with onions, sweet peppers, and habaneros).  The Ropa Vieja and Cho Cho are good choices too, but they aren't my favorites. 

My absolute favorite thing at Havana are the Completas. These are full meals for 4 to 6 people (depending on your appetite) that are packed up and waiting for you to take home and enjoy in comfort. There are several selections (http://www.havanacafe-az.com/recipes/index.php) priced between 29.95 and 34.95. Each meal comes with your choice of entree and 
Moros (black beans & rice cooked together)
Cuban Cabbage Salad
Maduros (sweet, fried plantains)
Freshly baked Cuban Bread
Chocolate Bread or Rice Pudding

You can call anytime during the day and order up your choice with a pick up time. IT""S FREAKIN GREAT!!!

As others have mentioned, the mojitos are fabulous and luckily for us, they have been kind enough to publish their recipe http://www.havanacafe-az.com/recipes/index.php

I wasn't quite sure I got my order correct but the girl on the register said she ""knew what I wanted.""  I like the fried shrimp, fires and corn and that's what I've had before (along with the sea bass).  What I got was quite a bit different...there were 6 small shrimp curled up on a plate, heavily seasoned, and with zucchini (yuck!) and some sort of bean and rice mixture and scallions.  When I asked the girl about it she said, ""That's how they come and the NEXT time you can ask for substitutes.""  I ate the shrimp (WAY too hot"" for seasoning) and scraped the zucchini and most of the rice and beans off on to a napkin on the tray.  The best part of my lunch was the strawberry lemonade and cup of clam chowder, otherwise this was a ONE STAR review. .  My sister wasn't too pleased with her shrimp that were far to spicy for her, too.  I had ordered ""bar-b-que"" flavor shrimp for her and I think she got the same thing I did...probably ""blackened"" with Cajun spices.

I came here on a Monday night to meet a friend around 6pm and the place was packed. We were lucky to snag a spot at the bar. The food smelled great so we decided to order a quick bite to eat before heading out. 

I ordered a bacon cheese burger with grilled onions, and my friend ordered a chicken sandwich with a side of waffle fries. My burger was HUGE for the price! When it came time to eat, it was next to impossible to pick it up. I had to ask for a fork to finish eating it because the burger was falling apart. Overall the burger was very moist and not over cooked, it just didn't have any flavor. The side of waffle fries was huge, like a whole heaping basket full huge! My friend said she enjoyed her chicken sandwich.

Some of the reasons why I am giving this place 3 stars.

- Limited beer menu (I prefer craft beers and they didn't have a great tap selection).
- Crowded and loud (it does make for good people watching though)
- Parking can be a pain (they do have a parking lot but most of the time it's full)

We got in around 9:30 to the sounds of live music - the guy was pretty good at singing a variety of covers. It's a little inconvenient to get to by TTC, but if you're driving, there's a very small lot in the back of the restaurant and some parking spots on Avenue Road (Green P). I noticed a patio; I will have to check this place out again in the summer after (gross) winter. 

Drinks - Drums N Flats has both a bar and a dining area. Their drinks menu is extensive and they have daily drink specials. I'm on antibiotics so I wasn't listening to the deal of the day on Thursday night, but it sounded like a good one.

Food - We ordered a pizza initially. My pal and I were chatting so we didn't notice the amount of time it was taking. Luckily our server did and she offered an appetizer on the house for the 'inconvenience' (good service). The pizza came soon after; it was a-okay. Our server came often to see how we were doing and providing us with refills.

Regular margaritas were what was made and we asked the first bartender if they were the Skinny.  He said yes... He always uses sours mix in it (dude- this is not a skinny then, FYI).  We then asked the rude blonde female that was working who couldn't have been nastier to us.  She said it's how they always make them.  Well- apparently she always makes them wrong then because on my previous 4 visits, the drinks were good, consistent and not full of sours mix.  Her attitude was unacceptable. Pretty much was so defensive and nasty that we certainly were not going to order a different drink or get food there.  Actually- we probably won't be back. Ever.

A couple people had recommended Action Comics as a good RPG/boardgame store and we were in the area, so we decided to check it out.

The store itself is larger than many other comic stores. Most of the middle of the store is dedicated to tables. When we walked in on a Saturday there were four or five games going on. It looks like a popular place to play Magic or Warhammer. 

The selection of boardgames was good, and I appreciated the ""Free Boardgames to play"" section, although I didn't take them up on that. I was also ecstatic that  they had miniatures for Pathfinder and many other games. I don't play Warhammer, but they had a decent section of the wall dedicated to pieces from that game.

I didn't purchase any comics, but they seemed to have a good assortment. They also had other bits of nerdery: t-shirts, posters, statues, pins, materials for painting figures and dice.

Granted, it's quite a task to serve a get-together like this, but there's something wrong when I keep hearing the same complaint over and over.

The pub sliders were pretty good (with the side of green beans), but a little overpriced. The goat cheese app was just ok. They sliced up pieces of pita for the creamy goat cheese -- I felt like they took a special spread and made it just avg because of the lack of seasoning or even freshness of the pita.

I came back to visit on a weekday and noticed a huge difference in speed and quality of service. For starters, only half of the restaurant was opened  so the wait staff and chefs can service diner in a timely manner. More items were available than from my previous visit and I appreciated that orders were small so even a table of 2 can try a variety of dishes. It really seems like KaKa is learning from their soft opening and I am looking forward to returning once they've hammered everything out.  
______________

I decided to check out this new location before their official opening, expecting some delay in service and unavailable items. 

We put our name on a waitlist and was told to come back in 1.5 hours, not bad for a Friday night. Once seated, we placed our order and that's when things went downhill. Within the first hour of our seating, we only received 2 orders (8 piece pieces of sushi in total). The pieces came out cold but the flavour was good and we were . Looking around, it was obvious that everyone was experiencing similar slow service. It turns out the kitchen lost our order - no problem we'll order again. Our meal lasted close to 3 hours. 

Quality of the dishes was nothing close to the Markham location - significantly smaller selection, poorly cut sashimi pieces and the table beside us found a bone in their salmon sashimi. With the exception of offering aburi sushi, Kaka is an average AYCE restaurant at best. Not sure if it's worth the $10 premium. 

Don't come here expecting the same quality as the Markham location.",2018-04-10 02:43:35

Perhaps, the best part about this place is their breakfast specials. For $5 you get a giant bowl of congee and a inappropriately large plate of cheun fun.

When we arrived we checked in and went and sat at the bar, we were the only people there and yet still had to wait for the servers to stop talking to come help us ( about 10 min). We ordered drinks and then we went to check again on when we would be seated, while we waited for the rest of our party.

When they took us to our seats we were sat upstairs in a back corner , they set up all our stuff and showed us how to use the guns. however, the area was quite hot. We asked for the air to be turned down and they did but it was still quite warm. The GM ( aurelio/rio) came upstairs visibly annoyed that we had complained. And when I say visibly I mean he looked annoyed and spoke to us in a condescending tone. He stated the generator was down in that area and it may or may not cool down. He stated they had a fan in the booth next to ours and could move it over. We asked to be moved downstairs to which he said "" I can either buy you a round of drinks or move you downstairs"" ,we opted for downstairs and grabbed our stuff to get up..he told us to calm down and to wait as they had to reset everything for us downstairs and find a booth.

When they moved us down no guidance was given..no one told us our time had started and we could start the games. Our set up wasn't the same, upstairs our names had been on the screen and downstairs it only said guest. About 10 minutes after we were seated a waitress came and switched out our guns saying something about the wrong numbers. After another 10 or so minutes, another waitress came and we asked her when we could start. She said we were ready to start and we asked for our names to be on the screen so we could track scores. she took our names and said she would get the GM. Rio returned with his same poor attitude, telling us the names would be set up but it would take a while. As well he stated he added 2 hours to our time, it was about 610 at this time. So we play , we eat, we drink, trying not to be miffed about the way we are being spoken to by the GM. And our time runs out, we get the waitress , she brings over a different  manager whose name I didn't catch. He gives us a gift card for a free hour and that was it.

The food isn't the bland, standard run of the mill Chinese that's often served at places catering an American palate.  It has a kick and their hot chili oil is authentic (if you want to add spices to your dish). It's very clear that the owners and those who work there take pride in the food that they are serving to their customers.  They serve large amounts of food at lunch for a good price. I haven't eaten there for dinner but the prices aren't terrible for the evening fare.

I really enjoyed the sushi served there as well. Very fresh fish.  I was hesitant to order because usually Japanese food served at a non-Japanese restaurant can be of low quality.  That is not the case. 

I asked about gluten-free Chinese menu options and they said it's possible.  Those aren't labeled on the menu. You would need to ask the server.",2018-07-03 13:26:30

The order was perfectly accurate, the food still hot and very nicely organized in containers that kept the heat/quality of the food and lasted the transport home with no issues.

THE DMV: A place where you either spend a huge chunk of your day next to people who are just annoyed as you so no one is pleasant and everyone gives you the eye when your number is called and not there's and then you get to a window with someone you seems not to be able to fully help you with all your issues OR

you end up getting lucky and get called within an hour or two and actually get someone helpful!

Customer service in the pharmacy is HORRIBLE. I would swear the people working there are actually TRYING to get rid of customers. Maybe they have a contest going of how many customers each of them can get to leave every day. They're unfriendly, judgemental, tell you to do things differently than your doctor told you (which reeeeeeally pisses off my doctors), and act like you're bothering them to have to do their job. Really sir? Is it terribly inconvenient for you to put my prescription back onto automatic refill once a year?? I'm soooooo sorry to have to make you do that. 

I have pricing issues about...once every 3 months (even though I get the SAME medication EVERY SINGLE MONTH for the last...I dunno...6+ years?) 

The last time I picked up my prescription I had just brought in a new paper prescription from my doctor so I had to wait. My prescription is in a box, just one box, no pill counting or bottle filling. Just...grab a box and slap a label on it. There was NOBODY in the waiting area, and only about 3 customers in the entire store and I was told ""It will be about 45 minutes because we have to help the other customers who are waiting before you."" I turned around and looked at the waiting area...empty. Not ONE person. I put a picture of that on Facebook and got some good laughs while I waited for ALLLLLLLL those invisible people to get their meds before me. That's good for them, because if I had a disease that made ME invisible, I'd want my medication PRONTO! 

There is a lady pharmacist there that is rude to me for no apparent reason, but I've seen her suddenly switch gears and be nice to others...usually very young thin attractive women. I think it's really strange. Maybe she's a lesbian? Maybe she discriminates based upon weight? I don't know, but she's a biiiiiiiitch to me EVERY SINGLE TIME.

I would rate this as one of the top 3 budget oriented Las Vegas shows/experiences. We got our tickets via Groupon, but without that discount, you can still enjoy this 3 hour experience for under $40 a person (transportation and snacks are provided). 

I went with a group of family and friends. They have a limit of 14 people, and I would suggest going with 13 people you know. We went with a group that included younger kids. While this isn't normally a problem, they were less ""in the game"" and more oriented to getting done with the adventure. It would also be fun to have only people you know as the detective assigned to your group will joke with you. If you are comfortable enough to joke back, it will be a much more enjoyable experience. 

The staff are great, and locations are pretty incredible as they build them out to meet the needs of the story.

While Ginko may have the best in downtown Cleveland, if you're a visitor who is used to sushi, you may not be impressed (but! you won't be unimpressed either! You'll be neutral.)

The decor is pretty good (especially the running-water bar!), but sometimes there is some WEIRD stuff playing on TV. I get that it's Japanese shows or animation, but I feel like it could be better tuned to the atmosphere.

The service was also really amazing! 5/5 Our server was really nice and very attentive to our needs. Didn't rush us out the door when it was near closing and I really appreciate that. 
Their tom yum was the perfect amount of spicy and sour I loved it, and they gave more shrimp than krung does. I also ordered the yellow curry and the portions are big enough to fill you up!

I've gotten gel on my nails many times before so thought I would be out within the hour. After an hour and a half, I was on my way. A day later my nails started to chip. I hadn't done anything strenuous - we just took a trip to Disneyland so I wanted nice nails. 

After we got back I got in touch with the salon to let them know. After much Back and forth with the nail tech and owner I was asked to come back in for a do-over. The nail tech was very apologetic and the owner told me she didn't know what the tech did wrong since her clients have no issues with the product. Since I live about 35-45 minutes away I told them it was inconvenient for me to travel back, wait to have my nails

My hangup with this experience was that I wasn't refunded my money outright. Why make me come back in to do my nails over again if I've told you I don't live nearby? I had the receipt saved and even asked for a refund and was told I would have to come back to get it or have my nails done over again.

Update 2.22.18 - After seeing my review, the owners did try to rectify the situation and offer a refund over the phone due to miscommunication.

The bar is beautiful, reminds me of an Absolute ad of color and things stacked atop of another magnificently, hence that's why I used ABSOLUTE so much.  I can go on and on about Mastro's, the seafood is terrific, and they even have wonderful steaks.  I have heard about the ship to shore to restaurant process, and it's nothing short of phenomenal.

First, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes: creamy, lobstery, and the most perfect mashed potatoes you can imagine (I think they are buttery, too).  They will leave in a state of bliss.  They go perfect with anything you order, seafood and meat dish.  I absolutely adore this.

Second, and without a doubt, the most outstanding thing on the menu, the Seafood Tower.  I've had it small (3-4 items), and I've it large (7-8 items), but I get it each and every time I go to MOC.  They clear the table, fast before your eyes.  Then, they bring out the monstrosity, a tower, 2/3/4 tiers depending on how much is ordered for how many, and the thing is smoking.  Literally.  Served on dry ice (and regular), it's a feast for king.  You have your choice from snow crab claws, crab legs, blue crab, oysters on the half shell, lobster cocktails, jumbo shrimp, lobster tails, among others.

It for sure is culturally diverse. There are many great places within walking distance to grab a bite to eat. They have many events here, so check out the web site and see what's doing. It's pretty big and expands over two city blocks.

Just to the south of the park is the Irish Cultural Center. There is no fee to get in, so you can kill two birds with one stone. Just to the east is the light rail and the massive Phoenix Public Library for you book worms. Often times they have outdoor movies, food trucks and jumpers for the kids. It's in an eclectic part of Phoenix that ruminates with history. So, hop in your bad mahamma Jamma ride and get your tiny buns down here. Good for kids too!

In its former state the store was large and well stocked, but on occasion customer service was spotty. This was rarely a problem for me because I have always worked on my own vehicles, so I usually know the part I'm looking for. That being said there were many times that I saw other customers walking the aisles of the store looking for help. The newly configured store seems to have far more staff than they previously did. There was always one clerk ringing up customers, now there are 3-4 at all times. Because the store is now a warehouse, it has been a rarity to find a part that isn't in stock. 
  Because I do my own work I have only used the service department to get brake rotors and drums resurfaced. The work has always been done correctly and ready when promised.

This is a small restaurant where you enter from the parking lot behind the restaurant. You see grape vines, fig trees and a big Italian looking dry fountain. Inside are all kinds of interesting Cambodian relics.

I had a wonderful meal here last time and was hoping to have another wonderful meal here again. 

We started with a spring roll. The spring roll was large enough for two people and seemed freshly made and was tasty with the dipping sauce.

I specifically came across town to try the National Dish of Cambodia. The Fish Amok. After I ordered it the waiter told me the kitchen wasn't making it today. So I ordered something else real fast and just hoped it would be delicious.

I ordered the Chicken Kreung. It was basically a stir fry with similar seasonings that the Fish Amok was made of.

When I saw the dish I was VERY surprised to find a very large portion of chicken. I'm guessing it might have been eight ounces with fresh green beans and fresh red bell pepper slices. The last time I was here I think they only gave me 5 small chunks of meat that might have added up to only TWO ounces but it was a VERY DELICIOUS two ounces. Last time my husband enjoyed the Cambodian Sausage but it is no longer on the menu.

If you read my reviews you KNOW a peeve of mine is properly prepared chicken. I received CHEWY, RUBBERY Dark Meat Chicken in a Gritty, Paste-like, Oily Sauce that was saltier than I can handle. The sauce was heavily laced with lemongrass and also had lots of turmeric in it. Maybe the sauce is the way it is suppose to be and I just didn't like it?  However I can't justify anyone anywhere preparing of all things dark meat chicken that's DRY and RUBBERY. I don't know how it was prepared but seemed very leftover to me because it is very difficult to make dark meat chicken dry and rubbery. 

My husband tried the Mi Keaw Noodle Soup. It came out almost COLD with two shrimp in it and SOGGY home made pork dumplings that busted open in the soup. (THAT IS A FAIL) My husband had to fish for the dry dumpling centers. The soup was not flavorful and just was an almost cold gooey mess. He also received a side of bean sprouts with wedges of lime in antique bowl that had chipping red paint that didn't seem sanitary to me.

The waiter was too busy to check on us and never asked how things were.

I don't know what happened in the kitchen. I don't think the same caring person was preparing the food as last time. 

Maybe it just was an off day?

Last time was a BIG HIT this time was a big miss.",2014-10-05 12:56:48

I'd driven by here a few times while visiting a friend and last night stopped in for a bite to eat after discovering everything else on the block was closed. We walked in and looked for a hostess stand or something to dictate if we should seat ourselves, when a bartender yelled that we can just sit anywhere. The dining room side of the room was almost full with two large tables and duos of people, but we got a seat and waited.

And waited. And waited. After awhile a clearly overwhelmed server came over and read us the specials, which was our main draw to the restaurant in the first place. From the outside this just looks like another neighborhood bar and grille joint that doesn't take its food too seriously, but the menu is a bit more upscale barfood inspired. Though I'm not sure they hit all the marks on everything they wanted to accomplish, it was better than most comparable establishments I've been to.

After hearing the specials, we ordered the loaded cheese fries appetizer and waited a good bit for menus to be brought over. I'm not complaining about the service--when our server could get to us amidst her 10 or so other tables, she was great. The problem is that she was the only one on a busy Sunday night and clearly wasn't used to that sort of pressure.

I ordered the Regent Square with steak on a baguette and my friend ordered be A1 black strap burger with bacon. We also tried the crab and corn chowder and the cream of mushroom.

The scratch made cheese sauce was great, and you could tell the fries were handmade. The crab soup left a lot to be desired. My sandwich was just alright--the bread was great, but the steak was in large chunks and not sliced which made some bites a bit more difficult to chew than others. The flavors were all there, but again it missed the mark for me. It would have done well with a sauce of some sort.

I heard a table complain behind us about how long their food was taking and the server said she explained before that it is scratch made kitchen and the food takes a lot of time. I can assure you that my table wasn't informed about the scratch made kitchen, but we excused the long wait times because it was clear the place was overwhelmed. There was nary a sign on the menu or posted anywhere that mentioned how long the cooking times would be. I don't mind waiting if that means good food is on the way, but I feel as if that is something that absolutely should be mentioned up front so the diner can adjust their expectation.

All in all, my experience here was fairly good and I wouldn't mind trying it again. I'll just remember to allow myself extra time :)",2015-01-27 03:58:35

Cleveland seems to like a soft pizza crust and this one was at least crispy on the outer part so I was definitely satisfied.

I get excited about free pizza toppings the way someone should get excited about free puppies. All the veggie toppings were fresh and the pepperoni had the right amount of spice. My husband said the pizza was ""like a homemade frozen pizza"" which I think he meant as a compliment as he had three slices! 

We also had the tempura broccoli (pictured below) that came out as giant broccoli florets fried in a light tempura batter with a nice chili oil sauce. Hashtag ways to get your man to eat veggies. He was in love. I enjoyed it as well and they seem to have fixed the cooking issue mentioned in other reviews, no runny batter.

It's a lovely sleek looking cafe with modern rich looking features. They offer mostly counter seating and do have two tiny tables.

They do offer you samples of the ice cream to try. I first tried saffron pistachio and the second one lightly ginger seemed better. My husband only sampled what I tried and just ordered the carrot halwa ice cream.

The ginger ice cream had a texture that was light and very unique. The flavor was intensely ginger and was sort of spicy but refreshing. I tried a taste of my husband's carrot halwa flavor ice cream. Both of us didn't care for this one mostly because of the greasy texture.

The girl working the counter was pleasant and efficient and the cafe seemed clean and spotless.

I had:
2008 Malbec from Argentina $11
French bread with chipotle hummus (complimentary)
Portobello mushroom salad $9
Slow braised veal ossobuco with garlic rapini, butternut squash polenta, and pinenut horseradish gremolata $26
White and dark Belgian chocolate flourless cake with raspberry whipped cream

The portobello salad was perfect. The mushrooms were cooked in a delicious balsamic which cut nicely with the fresh slices of parmigiana. The two items were on a bed of spinach which had a light drizzle of olive oil.

The main was a healthy portion size. I was a little hesitant to order the dish because of the horseradish part of the gremolata but it was really well done. The pinenuts came through with the flavour and the horseradish backed it up. The polenta came as a cake on the side. I would have preferred the ossobuco to be on top of the polenta but it was still delicious.

The flourless cake was great also. If you're a chocolate lover then this is the dessert for you. It wasn't really my cup of tea, but I have no complaints.

We each ordered the Lunch Box and at $10.95, it was a steal! It comes with the four daily curries, rice, naan, and a bonus item. Today, the bonus was pakoras. When I asked for hot sauce (which you should all try IMHO), they mixed up a special sauce ""so that it will blend easier with the curry""...and it was warm! No spooning it out of a jar here folks.

The naan, which for me is a forbidden pleasure, was soooo worth it. It was beautiful! I will certainly be back with more friends! They don't have the largest seating area at the moment, so I plan on owning the room :)",2013-12-17 21:39:30

I thought that was very kind of them even though it was only a part of my order that was incorrect. I ordered an 1 extra cane sauce and 3 chicken fingers alongside my sandwich combo. It is partly my fault for not checking before I leave the drive thru, but if you purchase something from an esteemed establishment, you would expect everything you ordered would be in the bag. When I got home, I open the box of extra fingers for my nephew and there it was-- 3 cane sauce and 1 chicken finger. I called the location and Heather was real nice about it. I decide to go back a few days later to claim my complimentary meal for my incorrect order. I stay in the drive thru line while they check if my complaint is legit. The manager, didn't catch his name but this was in the late evening, gave me some attitude because of what Heather told me about comping my meal. No apology. Just attitude I didn't ask for. Pretty sure I did not order a feisty manager for your staff's mistake, little guy.

This second time, not even that far between (I come here often ), I order the same thing. Same exact order. Sandwich combo + 1 extra cane sauce + 3 fingers. I get home, and there's 1 sauce and 1 finger. Can't be real right? I took a picture and sent it to my brother and he just laughs! I called and spoke to a Derek. I tell Derek what happens and he asks for the rest of my order. My order is pretty specific because I ask for extra lettuce in my sandwich. He places me on hold to check what happened. Whoever put the order together claimed to put 3 fingers in the box. Derek says, ""It must have gotten switched around. They remember your order specifically  because of the extra lettuce and putting 3 fingers in the box."" Judging from the rest of these reviews, Derek, your location is notorious for getting orders incorrect, leaving out the toast, and misunderstanding orders in the line. I told him, ""Do you suppose they just fell out of the sealed box and out of the plastic bag that it's in?!"" I think he sensed the sarcasm and said he would gladly replace the missing fingers.

  Well it's that time of year again to visit the Plaza hotel and Casino. Due to some major health issues we couldn't go earlier in the year. The other night I got a call from my Casino host Nate. He was extending a invitation for a luau they are having in may. I told him I would check the dates and call him back. I called tonight but, Ate was off. They connected me another Casino host. To my surprise it was my old Casino host Curtis. Who had left for awhile but has now returned. Like I said much to my delight he answered the phone. He knew exactly who I was and was able to handle all my needs to book my reservations. I had a few personal requests and Curtis was able to accommodate me with those as well. As I have always said I am by no means a High Roller. But to be able to talk to Curtis and have him remember exactly who I was he sure made me feel like one. He said ok Scott your reservations are all set. We talked for a few minutes about other things and he told me my confirmation was on its way to my inbox. Give me someone who knows all about me and not just a players card # ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. YES, I could stay at a fancier place on the strip. But I like the personalization of the Plaza. As you can see in some of my pictures I've posted from the slot attendants (especially my favorite gal Mo), the Players club desk, down to the waitress at the restaurant remember who I am. So next time your in town on a weekend get away. You really should give the Plaza a try. Especially with their new pool area, and their new rewards points system while playing 1 of many new slot machines. Plus your just 1 street over from the Freemont Experience with live music, entertainment, and other Casinos to gamble at. If you want to visit the Strip it's just a few minutes drive to spend some time there without paying sometimes some ridiculous room rates that your hardly ever going to be in.

Right now this place is taking cash only, so that is something to keep in mind. 

The Poke Guys set bowls are probably the better value here - since the build your own does add up - as they charge by topping. 

I do like the different types of marinated sashimi they offer 9 varieties from spicy to classic soy.

Service is friendly and they are extremely patient with you, while you try to decide what kind of toppings you want if you want a make your own bowl.

The staff is polite and friendly. Apparently you don't wait to be seated, you just walk right in. The upper level have tall booths that look quite spacious and private. The lower level has a sun room type of feel with tall glass windows, perfect for sunny days. 

order: 
veggie spring rolls - myeh.. I'm a tad biased since I've had it better in cheaper places. The difference is in the pudding. There's corn, bean sprouts and clear noodle type strings. This changed the taste completely. 
veggie penne pasta - Possibly the smallest pasta portion ever!
regular beef burger with onion rings - burger was 5/10. Onion rings 4/10.

Ask for something called the 6pack. They give you shot glasses of 6 diff types of beer, Any 6 you want.

My boyfriend picked the green beans as a side and I wasn't expecting anything special but I was wrong.  They were seasoned delightfully.  All the staff were extremely friendly.  The only disappointment was when the food was all gone!  We consoled ourselves by resolving to come back soon!!!",2017-02-18 22:04:07

I eat here 2-3 times a month and it helps get me through the morning grind when I know I'm heading here for lunch.  It's pretty much a ""to-go"" type of establishment, but they do have a few tables out front.  I usually try to eat this stuff outside as the aroma is way too strong for the office.  I don't want to make my co-workers too jealous!

I usually stick to the vegetarian options (it's cheaper and you can get a lot more food for the price), but everything I've had has been delicious.  Indian food just has that 'POP', and Nirvana delivers it at a good value.  Yes, the naan is just pita bread as others have mentioned, but it's still good.  Make sure you also know your limit when it comes to spicy food because they usually have 1-2 entrees that deliver a big kick.  They'll let you know if you ask.

So what better way to fill my tank up with my favorite Thai restaurant. I actually drove down the street to drop off my clothes to the dry cleaners and next to it was a Thai place to eat, but even that couldn't stop me from driving another three miles to eat where my heart tells me.

I was greeted ever so kindly when I walked in and it wasn't surprising that almost every seat was taken. Luckily it was only me, myself, and oh yea I that wanted to dine here this day. The server asked what I wanted to drink, unfortunately they didn't have the Chrysanthemum tea, so I did my usual hot tea, but even that is soothing and delicious... tasted like a light caramel tea, but it's really jasmine tea. I was debating on the Duck Fried Rice, since Lily (server) recommended it when I ate there a couple of months ago. But I wanted some soup for my soul, because today was a very chilly and windy day. I ordered the Chicken Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Flat (fat shoe lace) Noodles, since it just makes it more delicious to me... mild (5) for how spicy I want it and this time I didn't want to torture myself as I usually do ha! and extra diced garlic.. what??!? I love garlic ok it does the body good! The soup came out in zero time and I loved the way it smelled. The steam evaporated in the air in slow motion, made it looks so heavenly fresh and I had to take a snapshot of it against the sun.. it just looked so Food Digest front cover magazine-ish. I sipped the soup broth first, it was like liquid nitrous for my engine.. my eyes lit up and made my facial muscles break a happy smile. I literally said Mmmmm gulping it down... Yea tell me about it... sound good right??!? It tasted so good, my own body melted. It had bits of cilantro, diced green onion, bean sprouts, and TONS of chunky sliced white chicken meat. Loved the flat fat noodles... it was just the right amount to make me a full bear, where I could hibernate right then and there. 

But all that time I was enjoying my soup, I was also craving their Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice. I ordered that dessert right after and when it came out.. I heard from the table across from me whispering.. that dessert looks so good!! And then all this time, two guys watched me devour my lunch and then this delicious dessert... I heard him say to his friend.. Dayam that girl can eat!!! Dayam right I can!??!! I'm not shy when it comes to eating and definitely will eat to my heart's content, bet your butt I will! So I just smiled at the guys and kept on eating. I'm enjoying my meal, so let it be! The dessert was the icing on the cake... the finishing touches of a great phenomenal meal. The mango was riped and perfect to eat. Every bite of the sticky rice was warm, soft, and soothing. Loved the coconut milk that drizzled down every time I took a slice from it. The ratio between the mango slices and sticky rice was even to every single bite I took. Absolutely loved this dessert. It's my favorite Thai dessert from any other. 

Their food has been consistent every single time I have gone here and the service is always very attentive and friendly. Refilled my tea without being asked and always came back to see how I'm doing. Loved the fact that after I finished my dessert, the server asked if there was anything else I would like haha I could possibly go for another dessert, but no I'll definitely be hibernating in that restaurant if I did. I always leave so happy and satisfied... No joke. And off I went to do my errands... it was a great day for another great Thai food experience.",2011-02-11 09:47:56

The decor used now is the same as back in the early 90's that I grew up with (though a bit faded). Somehow, I like that it hasn't changed. After living in California for 8 years, it was nice to come back to something VERY familiar.

The cashiers are friendly enough. Last week she took my order, and said thank you, with a smile, at the end. The male cashier, tonight, was fine too, I don't have high expectations at a fast food joint. As long as you don't spit in my food, we're cool.

The food is good if you are looking for a good cheap meal that doesn't contain a burger and fries. It definitely isn't authentic Japanese food. (Of course, if you think Panda Express is authentic Chinese food, or if you like to douse your rice in soy sauce, this is the real ish.) 

I highly recommend the veggie egg rolls. They are so good I could literally eat them every day. I don't know what's in them, but they are amazing.

The house chicken is great if you're dining in as it will become a bit soggy if you take it to go. The steam from the rice softens the crispy exterior quite a bit. It's a little bit sweet, and a little bit sour - but it isn't like sweet and sour chicken. It has little bits of pickled carrots and cucumbers (I think) mixed in and some green onions thrown on top. 

The teriyaki chicken is great if you're dining in or taking out. If you don't like a lot of sauce on your Teriyaki, ask for it on the side. They really lay on the sauce.

The fortune cookies are hit or miss depending on who is working. Usually the girl cashiers are a bit more generous (or maybe I'm just that cute.)",2012-11-20 03:35:58

We had all three of their desserts: Tiramisu, triple chocolate cake with ice cream and cannolis. Most of the table liked the Tiramisu. My favorite was the triple chocolate cake with ice cream. The cannolis were the least favorite of the bunch.

Our waitress was very attentive even before we asked for Vicki.

El Dorado Express is an offshoot of El Dorado Cantina which is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas in my opinion so I was excited to try it out.  They have a good sized menu, but its about the tacos!  Yelp check ins get you a free taco and on Tuesdays street tacos are $2 each.

I had one carnitas taco, one cochinita taco and one al pastor taco.  They were all yummy and I cannot pick between the al pastor and the cochinita for my favorite... they both had delicious elements.  

Overall, I see myself coming here pretty much every time I'm in Vegas.  I highly recommend it as an affordable place to eat a quick meal.  Seriously, the tacos.",2018-03-08 18:42:32

YOU are meant for the magnificent seafood in a bag seasoned just the way you like it, just as spicy as you like it, with as many little potatoes & mini corn cobs as you want!

My personal favs after multiple test runs:
Mussels in Pacific Rim, with 2 potatoes (trust me, scoop up that sauce)
Shrimp in the trifecta, with the corn cobs (really complements the sweet corn)
Snow Crab in the Traditional Boil (doesn't overwhelm the perfect crab flavor)
NOTE:  Sauce is One Level Hotter than you would expect.  I LOVE hot food and Mild is just fine for me at this place.  Don't overwhelm the natural flavor of the seafood by kicking it up a notch!

I love H & M clothing. Every time I'm at Fashion Square, I have to go in. Is the quality all that great? It depends on what you're getting. I love the jeans there, they fit well. And most of the clothing is true to size-which is great in my book. I love their Divided line! Some of the clothing borders ridiculous but the same can be said for Forever 21 or any other store like it. 

I would say the store is pretty well organized, aside from the clearance which is a total effing nightmare. The clothing is inexpensive enough to not even warrant sorting through all of that mess. Also, the shoes... They are scattered about through the store. Can someone please tell me how that makes sense? Put them all in one section!! Sometimes I find a pair of shoes randomly that I like and just can't figure out where the other sizes would be..could it be that only one pair exists in the store? 

Customer service wise? It's alright. I never see staff walking around asking if you need help-you're pretty much left to fend for yourself if you're looking for something. I've never had a problem with the cashiers, they're usually friendly and quick.",2013-03-12 21:47:13

The whole place is pretty much a nice background to take a quick snapshot of your little ones or yourself even. The time and and effort they put in the decor shines thru and it was nice to come and not only enjoy our drinks but the interior as well. 

Now what brought me here was the fact that I wanted to try their brûlée boba milk tea (without the boba of course).  Definitely something I never heard of so I was pretty excited to try it. The drink itself was sweet and creamy. The brûlée milk tea is a definite winner along with their uji matcha. My kid and I love matcha and their matcha was pretty good.

Never having eaten here, my husband and I decided to give it a try for takeout.  We were told 10 minutes on a to go order which ended up taking about 25 minutes.  Seriously 3 other people placed to go orders, received their food, and left in the time we waited.  The staff was very apologetic and threw in an order of egg rolls for free in spite of the fact that we had not complained at all about the wait time.  So service is good, but what really counts is the food.  I really had a good idea when we unpackaged the meal and took out the glow in the dark pink sweet and sour sauce.  If a restaurant is going to serve over processed, sub par condiments there isn't much hope for the food.  The egg rolls were extremely greasy and rather tasteless.  The pork fried rice was over all rather bland and had a previously frozen quality to it.  Nothing tasted remotely fresh.  Finally the coconut chicken we ordered was inedible.  The chicken was stringy and so hard you could not stab it with a fork let alone chew it.  The sauce again appeared to be processed but since we couldn't eat the chicken it was hard to really gage it's quality.  To sum up we paid over $20.00 for some rice that tasted like what my mom used to make from a box in the 70's and greasy egg rolls.  We could have gone down the street to Panda Express for half the price and twice the quality.  Pretty sad when the fast food option is better than the sit down.",2011-04-04 10:13:33

I had all sorts of fears that I think the typical person whose out of shape would have. Needless to say, I was plesantly surprised. This gym is relatively roomy, has a lot of cardio and strength training machines, and has good hours. I also noticed that it has significantly less people than another competitor, LVAC, does, so therefore, you can usually hop right on to the machine you want to use without waiting.

The reason I rated this place a 4 instead of a 5 is for the following minor reasons:

-I really wish this place offered classes such as Zumba, yoga, etc.

-The location is in a pretty bad/nasty part of town. I would feel safer if this gym had security in the gym itself and in the parking lot, especially at night.

-Lastly, I overall don't agree with the corporate's ""pizza nights"". I think it sends the wrong message. They are there to try and help you get healthy and in shape, not to provide you with greasy food. If they had protein shake night, or salad night, that'd be awesome and understandable, but pizza night is too much of a stretch in my opinion.",2014-01-10 06:45:24

As soon as I walked in, expecting to be greeted and guided to a table, I was confronted by a woman who handed me a menu, told me to sit anywhere, and to come back to the counter when I was ready to order/pay. I was a little taken back. 

I already had an idea of what I wanted, and knowing that I needed to eat and then be on my way, I ordered immediately after only a quick peek at the menu. I ordered South Beach Benedict, and asked for some type of modification to eliminate the glutinous English muffin. The cook suggested a bed of spinach, which I thought was an excellent idea, and has merited a star for the sake of this review. 

I paid for my meal, and in exchange was handed my receipt and a buzzer so that I could be notified when my food was ready. Let me be clear, if I'm speeding $20 on breakfast + a tip, I expect to sit down at a table, and to receive wait service. At the very least, deliver the food to my table so that I don't have to get up every 10 minutes. 

The coffee was pretty good, and offers bottomless refills... if you're willing to get up and refill it yourself, of course. It is self-serve after all. 

The food: it was good. Nothing is write home about, but it was good. I sort of wished my bed of spinach was cooked, not raw, but I guess beggars can't be choosers. (Then again, I didn't exactly beg, I paid... hummm.) One thing that was my fault, and not the kitchen's, was that in my haste to order, I forgot to mention that I like my eggs poached hard, so I had to deal with the nasty runny yolk. The smashbrowns were good. They are potatoes that have been expertly deep fried to a golden brown shell which is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, like any good French fry. I suspect this is the result of choosing the right potato, and the right oil, plus keeping the oil clean as a whistle. Degree of difficulty: 3/5.

Between the tasty coffee and the good food, I've given a second star to the review. I believe this restaurant appeals to hipsters, and as it is located directly across from MEC, they are conveniently located to cater to their crowd.",2015-05-09 16:38:00

Several of us ordered the Steak Frites, which is basically a flatiron steak with a pile of french fries.  They were all cooked per taste, but in all, it was just a well cooked steak that you could get just about anywhere.  

One of us got the Pan-Roasted Trout in a browned butter sauce with almonds - that was amazing.  The trout was cooked perfectly and worth every penny.  It was very delicate and light, and fairly large portion.

Another got the bouchot mussels, which comes with frites.  Nice creamy white wine sauce that was good.  Large serving, too.  

I ordered the Leg of Lamb in garlic and thyme, which was also fantastic!  The lamb was so tender and juicy, cut off of the bone for you already, laid over a pile of vegetables.  

The service was a little slow - it took over an hour from when we ordered until our food was delivered.  Our server was nice.  However, one of the bussers spilled au jus all over a leather jacket and purse, which was a little bit of a downer.  

Of note, I'd been there before for the brunch menu, which is much more tastier than the dinner menu.  The famed chicken and waffles is exactly that - roasted chicken and waffles and I was not wow'ed by it.  The best dish was french toast made from brioche - a must try.

The reason Bouchon gets only 3 stars is b/c though it is very good food, I expected more from Mr Keller, especially for the price you pay and the hype that you hear.

* Pretty Decent Food
* Close
* Pretty Good Martinis
* Close

We generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the door:)

I do enjoy the corn bread...like corny, bready candy:)

And the martini's are big and chock full of vitamin V (and priced somewhat less than the marti's at AZ88:)

The food has always been good, the short ribs, the rotisserie chicken, the prime rib...you know, just good, solid, all-american fare:)

Bandera is probably nothing you'd go out of your way for, and certainly nothing that I would queue up for a 90 minute wait for (during the winter months), but worth the stroll over this time of year:)

Factoring in the ""free"" thing, I'd go four stars... but let's be objective a bit and forget that we didn't have to pay our way.

As a sports venue, Ricoh is very good -- not really a bad seat in the house, and I'm honestly left wondering why anyone would pay the extra dollars to be rink-side when the better view is a little higher up.

As an ""other"" venue, however, I have my doubts.  As many have observed the sound quality isn't up to snuff.  The hockey announcer was clear enough, but other announcements and in-game fluff was fuzzy and, at times, difficult to make out.  I can't imagine watching a favourite band at the Ricoh if the sound quality is going to be worse than my own system at home!

Otherwise, it's well laid out, spacious, with comfortable seating and a good gradient so as to prevent obstructing views.

Food options are limited, with the ubiquitous pizza pizza and stadium hotdogs, cotton candy, etc.  Smoke's Poutinerie operated a little kiosk, though, which was a nice touch, and their prices weren't grossly inflated ($7 for a basic poutine, $8 or $9 for pulled pork, bacon, or both).  I had a big, gnarly gelatinous blob of ""gravy"" mixed in with mine, though, which was kinda gross.  The $9 Steamwhistle beer made me forget about it long enough to enjoy the rest.  $9 for a beer?

All-in-all, a fun experience.  Not one I'd necessarily pay for (I'm neither a Marlies nor a Leafs fan -- go Habs!) but I'm glad we got to go and I'm grateful for the generous complimentary tickets.

Came here with two friends to check out the restaurant post-renovation and not much has changed apart from the fact they removed the corner party room.  I've been here a few times in the past and enjoyed their food so I was interested in seeing what changed on the menus.

We ordered the following: 
- Nori Tsukudani x 2 ($17)
- Carbonara ($16)
- Matcha crepe (to share) ($10)

The pastas were delicious.  The Nori Tsukudani appeared to be a new item and it was really good -- the added poached egg on top was great.  The Matcha Crepe was fairly easy for the three of us to split since there were three pieces of crepe on the bottom, topped with azuki, whipped cream and the ice cream.

Overall, the food remains the same (maybe not the price, ha) but definitely coming back because I'm interested in seeing the changes to the lunch menu.",2018-08-12 17:29:20

As a first time Red Lobster customer, I was surprised by how expensive it is. I mean, I'm fairly sure they are farmed in some pool somewhere, so, like ""market price""? Gimme a break. But I went for their big platter or ""Ultimate Feast"" anyway. It came with a lobster tail, some crab legs, shrimp and I chose the mash. It was good at first, but so, so salty that it gave me a headache, like, a bad MSG-style headache in the end. 

I know this is a seafood chain restaurant, but for some reason I expected more. Or, at least for it to take itself less seriously. This location is dark and decorated like a suburban chain steak house. Ugh, I get annoyed when I pay so much for crap lobster. Even if I know what I'm getting myself into.

Luckily, we had reservations for the night so we were good to go.  It looks better and cleaner on the inside than it does on the exterior, and the food was better than I thought it would be. 

The good: I didn't find the food overly salty, the fried shrimp was served hot and crispy (deveined as well, thank goodness, I think it's lazy when restaurants leave them in).  Not amazing, but OK.  I say it's OK because they really seem to try but sometimes miss the mark. 

For example, the black bean stir-fried clams were fresh and full to the shell brim with plump clam meat and not a single closed or bad clam was served.  On the other hand, the sauce was a little too goopy, as if too much cornstarch had been added.  The crab was nicely put together with ingredients but was also a bit overcooked so that the crab meat itself was a little dry. 

On that very busy night, I'm sure the kitchen had more than their share of work to do that night.  Plus the prices are on the low-mid end and I would say that what you get for it is more than fair.",2015-08-28 17:39:19

This is a small, Korean-owned Japanese restaurant and it was our first time coming here! We were a bit concerned about the freshness of the sashimi when pulling into the square (it's located a small outdoor strip mall) but re-assured when we saw a decent number of families here on Labour Day.

We took our time ordering off the menu (they do not have lunch specials on ""holidays"" - this includes Stat Holidays) and I ordered the Bulgogi + Sushi + Tempura Bento set ($16.95 @ time of writing), while the rest of my family split the Small Sashimi Combo (can't remember how much this was) + a Fire Dragon Roll ($14.95) + Mixed Veggie + Shrimp Tempura ($6.95).

The food came out amazingly fast, and was very fresh! We were all served sides of salad, miso soup (with tofu, mushrooms, and seaweed), and noodle soup (with a clear broth and tempura bits sprinkled in) along with our meals. 

The sushi that I had in my bento set was of adequate freshness (a bit smaller than I expected), but the tempura was lovely - not too greasy and very crisp (my bento also came with a side of japchae). The quantity of food was more than filling enough for me!

The sashimi combo was very fresh - an assortment of lightly seared white tuna, snapper, salmon, salmon belly, tuna, and even cooked octopus! The Fire Dragon roll was also outstanding - a very thin layer of rice of seaweed was used to hold the contents together, and the seared salmon + bonito flakes on the top lent the roll a nice smoky flavour.

My boyfie, whom I owe everything to now, SURPRISED me with dinner here for being a kickass girlfriend. Am I lucky or nah? 

Beyond lucky. :))))

We both ordered the full tasting menu along with the wine pairing. There are 3 tiers for the wine pairing @ $295, $595, and the premium. The sommelier goes over the difference in each price point without being pushy at all. Everything we ate/drank was just absolutely amazing. I can honestly say it's the best meal I've ever had in my life along with the best wine I've ever had in my life. This place was also accommodating to my pescatarian needs, which wasn't that many substitutions since their menu is majority seafood.

Favorites of the night:
x Quinoa and red pepper amuse bouche
x Oscetra caviar served atop of king crab and a crustacean Gelée
x Langoustine ravioli
x Lobster wrapped in spinach
x Some kind of corn soup/puree (my favorite of the night)
x ALL THE BREAD from their bread cart with their ridiculously good butter. I usually hate filling up on bread anywhere, but the bread here is on another level...

Everything was just so over the top, but to perfection. Full tasting menu is the way to go. I highly recommend the wine pairing as well.

Service was great and they were are so very friendly. The only thing I was EH about the entire night was when the boyfie spilled some of my wine and they didn't think/offer to refill it... a fluke perhaps?

The new menu seems to be shorter and has some interesting items.   Notice they still have the Sopa Azteca, really good last time but decided not to order since not real hungry.  Ordered the Lomitos Majahual, a marinated port in a red sauce served with rice, beens and a salad.  Received 3 tortillas, so you can stuff a tortilla or eat it off the plate.

My girlfriend and I both got a sausage on a bun. I was tempted by the game meats, but I thought I'd try one of their cheaper offerings first before I went all in. The buns they use are great. Lovely consistency and love how they are toasted. You get two toppings for free out of (sauteed onions, sauerkraut, jalapeños, and sweet peppers). Mustard and ketchup is at the table. You can also get the sausage without a bun with curry sauce. (They do not recommend the game meats this way).

The best part of the meal was the dirty duck fries. They are fries done in duck fat so they are extra crisp, and they are loaded with all the toppings you could get on your sausage on a bun, plus the curry sauce. A reviewer said they should add cheese and make it a poutine.... But I'd be against that. It already has richness from the duck fat, and a nice acidity. Cheese would just turn it into a hot mess and would make the fries soggier. They really have something with these fries.

Terrific in spots, lagging in others, overall just okay. Kudos for carving out the pleasant open interior, but the service, atmosphere and even the food here dont consistently match the flagship. That somewhat reluctant observation hardly rises to the level of condemnation, more like mild disappointment, and is based on a handful of visits to both locations.

Servers downtown are/were hip and more importantly, sharp, anticipating needs, recommending condiments, invested in their guests' satisfaction. At Otro, it feels tenser and more transactional, like you're a tab instead of a guest. There's just less professional and personal confidence here and you're less likely to get your iced tea refilled or thanked on your way out. I realize they're going for casual, but casual should be a personality or flair, not a tangible reduction in customer service. Not in this market and age, especially not with Gallo's pedigree, 

I also prefer Gallo's menu, although there's considerable overlap. Companions claim food here is comparable, so maybe it's what you order and who you are. Otro's homemeade paella had too much salt or onions, for me, and tasted more packaged than savory. I had a torta there where the filling was fine but the bun evoked McDonalds, like they ran out of better buns. The chiliquiles here is rojo and the lopsided tower tended to fall apart.   I prefer (adore, is more accurate) the expertly assembled verde downtown.  Our party agreed the  biscuit, banana and plaintain dessert was awful. Not expensive, but the least satisfying dessert we've had out in a long time. 

I like the big, thick chips they serve with the guac. They pour a big glass of wine. There's quaint, thoughtful seating in the foyer in case there's a wait.

My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.

A spur of the moment, ""Thursday night out"" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.

The wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.

The appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.

For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.

The braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.

The prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.",2012-03-16 10:39:29

1- go to CostcoAutoProgram.com
2- research your vehicle
3- find your dealership
4- contact a Costco Auto Program Representative at your dealership 
5- print your Costco Auto Program Certificate 
6- go to your chosen dealership, present your certificate, pick your new vehicle, ask for Costco pricing
7- GET PRE-APPROVED FINANCING, I cannot stress this enough! Most likely a dealership will match your pre-approval. It has happened twice for us do yourself a favor, it has saved me thousands!

It is literally that easy, and I can not even tell you all the BS the Costco Dealership Program has saved us on two vehicle purchases now. 

We had the pleasure of meeting Costco Sales Associate HERB RIVERA I must say I just love this guy. He made the entire car buying experience at Earnhardt Toyota enjoyable. You could not meet a nicer unegotistical guy. We were given a fair price for our trade in (which honestly I thought we were going to be seriously low balled on, because we were using the Costco Auto Program). We were given a fair price on our Toyota Tundra purchase. 

So here is the only negative we waited over two hours for the finance department which is absolutely unacceptable, and then by the time we waited until 10:00pm the finance ""customer service"" person Marty was extremely rude, then he tried to excuse his behavior. Like they say in the Army how far will an excuse get you? The answer is zero millimeters Sir! 

BUT... after our finance experience we reunited with Herb and he took us through all the ends and outs of our new truck and we ended on a positive note. Overall our experience was very positive with Earnhardt Toyota. Go see HERB RIVERA and tell him Garcia sent you.",2017-04-01 11:01:48

First off, the place is quite classy and elegant.  It has an upscale ambiance with seating divided into small cloistered sections by iron and wood partitions.  Cushioned half-booth seating features different colorful Chinese dragons embroidered on off-white expensive-looking fabric.

For the appetizer course, a Steamed Dim Sum Platter featured a woven basket holding big bite-size morsels of Har Gau, Scallop Shumai, Chinese Chive Dumpling, and a Black Pepper Duck Dumpling.  The fat dumplings were all very well made by hand, and delicious.  I liked each one, as well as my bite of Diane's Crispy Fried Prawn Dumpling that was rich with prawn meat, enhanced by fruity and sweet but not overpowering Plum Sauce, and decorated with Fried Rice Paper Noodles sprouting out of the prawn's top.

An add-on of Vegetarian Hot & Sour Soup was excellent, suitably spicy, and filled with delicate thin noodles.  But in retrospect, I wish I had instead ordered the Hot & Sour Soup with Chicken because I was later informed that it was identical to the vegetarian variety with chicken added, and both soups were priced the same.  To help wash everything down, I enjoyed excellent house-brewed Mint Decaf Hot Tea, with the tea leaves blocked by a tiny strainer. 

My entree of Roasted Chilean Seabass with Chinese Honey, alongside a few fried Enoki Mushrooms, was very tasty.  Sections of well-cooked moist white fish burnished by the honey flaked off nicely onto a fork.  Fine, generously portioned sides of glistening, stir-fried Pak Choy with Garlic and Egg Fried Rice rounded out and embellished this portion of the meal.

Inventive Summer Exotic Cold Watermelon Soup with assorted berries and Lychee Sorbet brought our memorable dinner to a refreshing close.  Service was exemplary throughout the night, and wet towels were produced at meal's end for a nice final touch.  It was a great Restaurant Week meal.

In sum, Hakkasan offers a very refined Cantonese dining experience that is expensive, but worth it!  Now that I have had a taste of its stellar cuisine, I will surely be back to enjoy more.",2014-08-29 18:12:26

If you have not tried Hot Pot, you're in for a treat (Google: ""sichuan hot pot"" to get up to speed). Head to the food court. Hang a right. Stop at the host/hostess podium and tell them you are there for Hot Pot.

In so far, I have found Hot Pot at Mekong is the best Hot Pot venue in the Valley. It's not much on ambiance, but the taste is out of this world. Come with friends and have a nice relaxing social meal. 

If you're new to Hot Pot and you didn't Google it yet, just know that Hot Pot is like Chinese fondue but with a tasty broth/soup. The food is brought to you raw and you cook it yourself. 

""Awesome"" you say? Indeed! It's very awesome. 

You also get a bowl for additional ingredients/spices (e.g. Green Onion, Jalapenos, Cilantro, Sesame Oil, Sesame seeds, Satay Sauce, garlic, etc.) for dipping or to tailor your broth.

I typically get the following: Rib Eye, Chicken Breast, Headless Shrimp, Bok Choy, Napa Cabbage Udon noodles, and Shiitake. Sometimes my son and I get lobster. Be aware, it you get the lobster, it's divided on a plate... and still moving.

Hot Pot is a social culinary experience. So, just settle in for 45-75 minutes of spectacularly tasty Just-In-Time cooking, by your own hand, and neighborly discussion.

At the end of the meal they bring a cube of bone-pale gelatinous goo. I assume it's some form of bean curd. I don't care for it. My son loves it. I always forget to tell them not to bring me one. What can I say, the after glow of the meal just leaves me mindlessly, stupidly happy.

There are many other restaurants in Mekong. Shame on me that I gravitate exclusively to the Hot Pot (because it's just that DAMN GOOD) and have not tried any of the other fare.

The Market is nice and handy too. Check it out. It's only slightly less awesome than Lee Lee's, so it's def worth a visit if you are in the area.",2017-08-24 04:42:31

I ate here during the soft opening of the restaurant, with another vegan, a vegetarian, and one omnivore.  The chef (at the time, he has since left... hence only 4 stars), was totally accommodating, and the pastry chef also made us a special vegan dessert.  

I was amazed at the fluidity of the service (especially since the place wasn't actually open yet, from the cocktail servers to the sommelier to our main server.  Everything was perfect.  

The dishes the chef created for us were perfectly seasoned and made the most of highlighting fresh veggies.  The specialty cocktails were terrific as well. 

I will also add the the meat eater at our table looooooved his Kobe carpaccio, tomahawk steak, and all the dairy-laden sides and bread.

The chipotle sauce tasted more like BBQ sauce. Still delicious of course. The burgers were adequate. Patty was a bit dry. Perhaps a little overcooked? The buns were awful. It was like chewing on rock. 

The rest: 
It's your typical pub atmosphere. Not much to say. They have decent selection of beers at reasonable prices. It's a decent place to chill and talk about whatever.

We were the only eat in customers but that didn't dissuade us. As others mentioned the service was very good. And the menu must have changed from the older reviews as the owner let us know that the only meat served is seafood and all other meat is faux. Also she said that all of their sauces are animal free. I had Kung pao tofu and the wife had garlic veggies. We both had brown rice and veggie wontons. The veggie wontons were hands down the best fried wontons I have ever had. No cream cheese here just veggies and an amazing sauce. They were lightly fried and not oily. My main dish was great. Plenty of flavor and good spice (could have been a hair spicier). Veggies were not overcooked at all. The tofu was good. I prefer fried but this wasn't which was fine because it is probably healthier. The wife greatly enjoyed her dish. Also a bit spicy. The serving sizes were huge and we both have lunch for tomorrow. The main dishes (non seafood) are around the $8-9 range and the wontons were $6ish. We will definitely be back.,2010-07-01 04:01:35

The atmosphere is really friendly and welcoming, and the place fills up quickly on a Friday night, but the food really wasn't that great.

My friend ordered the crab cakes, which she said were mushy on the inside, and weren't crispy at all, probably due to the creamy gravy on top.  Personally, I would have set the cakes on the gravy so you could have the crunch, but that's just me. Tastewise, she gave it a ""meh"".

I ordered the pickerel, which came a little dry and overcooked and erratically seasoned. Some parts of the fish were bland as hell, and others had a big dollop of lemon pepper seasoning (you know, the kind you buy in the store) on it. The vegetables that came with it were a little too raw for my liking and were basically just a big chunk of carrot and broccoli roughly 1"" x 5"", no joke. If they were going to leave them so big, they should have cooked them softer so I wouldn't be trying to saw through them with my butter knife.

A spot of tea with those dumplings?

This morning I had dim sum here with my family for Lunar New Year.

The first thing I noticed was the decor.
A victorian mansion full of gold, glitter, and gleaming chandeliers.
The servers had these maid like uniforms which was cool.
The teacups were English style with handles! And the teapots were so fancy and decorative.  It was like having high tea, but with chopsticks.

The food was above average but nothing to really rave about.
They had a large variety of dumplings and some nice veggie ones too.
The sticky rice came in smaller than usual cute little packets, tasty savory goodness.
The crab claws were massive!
Noodles came in giant portions.
Egg tarts were flaky, sweet, and delicious.


I gave the place 4 stars because of the restaurant's efforts to transform dim sum into a fine dining experience.  The food was not quite 4 stars worthy.

But really, I wouldn't come here unless someone really wanted to eat here.
Double the price of regular dim sum, but not double the enjoyment (in my opinion).
I found everything a bit stuffy and slightly pretentious including the clientele.
I'd take someone here if I wanted to show them how fancy you can make dim sum, but it's not the place for an authentic dim sum experience.

You ever walk into a restaurant and realize theres nothing on the menu youd even both eating ie Public House at Venetian. Well here I wanted to order everything. The food reminds me of a step above Stack at Mirage and Beauty and Essex at Cosmo. The only saving grave Beauty and Essex has is the name, location and ambience. 

Anyway, on to the food because the sevice, while present and cordial they dont really excel at making you feel at home. So, that leaves the food to carry this restaurant. I ordered the beet salad which was cute and dainty and really well seasoned and delicious.  At this point in restaurants everyone is going a beet salad and its kinda hard to screw it up. Im a sucker for fried chicken and honestly it was a toss up between that and the braised ribs with jalapeno grits. I went for the chicken because the menu just made it sound so delicious and it was probably some of the best sit down fried chicken ive had on the Strip. To top it off most entrees at Jardin come with sides and it feels like a whole menu. 

Id go back for sure but i wish they had this menu as a quick service concept somewhere. 

They lose a star because they served a moscow mule in a dinky little glass. For $16 they need to find copper mugs and sprigs of lavender. What a joke!",2018-08-11 03:13:27

Through my typical dumb luck, which I am blessed to have in spades, I was able to get tickets to a show on this particular night that I needed them. 

I showed up late and what do you know, I walked down and took someone's seat in the front row. 

The singer, a blonde woman, age unknown, is like ""I'm gonna free style. I hope you don't mind."" So, of course, the crowd goes wild without knowing what's coming. 

And she starts sing a Toby Lightman song:

""Did I see you winkin' or is that me thinkin'? 
Should I show affection to the guy in the front row? 
Did I see you smile 'cause you been here for a while 
Should I make a connection with the guy in the front row? 

""But you don't know where I'm from, where I belong
All you know is my name
And you only know what you see and that really isn't me
But I'm glad you came

DALLAS here again interrupting my own story:

Now I'm thinking, is this a coincidence or am I the guy in the front row? Cause, you know, I'm the fricken guy in the front row. 

Ok back to the story:

Her still singing...

""Are you makin' passes while I'm pleasin' the masses? 
Well, I know all about you, you're the guy in the front row

AND THEN I SWEAR SHE LOOKS AT ME! WINKS. SHE WINKS! I of course am bright red and embarrassed. 

""Are you trying to distract me, while you're tying to attract me?
But I what to do, about you in the front row""

OK... So here's the part you're all hoping for... my emotional devastation. 

She finishes the song in which she say's she's glad ""I"" came... Asks lyrically if ""I"" want to hang... and at the end... She's like come here, guy in the front row. 

She wags her finger in the exact way you want a relatively attractive woman to wag her finger and I get up... and she bursts out laughing hysterically... and she can't stop. She's like dying of laughter. That fucking bitch is crying laughing at the stage and everyone saw me get up... fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. 

She was fricking wagging her damned finger at the guy next to me... who like got up and smelled her knee. I'm sure she would have made out with him but she was still laughing. 

So anyway, if you want THAT kind of relationship with the artists. That's what you get. you can like see their cloven hooves if they're devil women like her. Or whatever. 

It's quite literally the best place in town to see a show or be the show and get seen or watch trendy people in their natural habitat.",2012-02-20 05:18:49

The food was only okay not doing anything too wrong but lacking any real flavour or seasoning (we ordered sandwiches and wings). The service was good though.

I strongly dislike the fact they have a girl sitting in the girls washroom in front of the sink that hands you towels for your hands and expects tips. Nothing against the person, just the concept really irks me at a far from upscale pub. It somehow seems degrading too.

Little bit of information that won't be relevant to most of you but the bouncers were actually pretty nice. By the end of the night we had some pretty intoxicated friends in our group and at no point did the bouncers throw anyone out, just politely and patiently ushered people out.

The hotel isn't cheap and tacking on an extra $25 per night seemed too much. It seems that anyone can park in their parking lot too so it's always full.

After that unpleasantness I proceeded to park and join the queue to check in. Soon after someone came from out of nowhere, introduced himself, and offered to help me. I received multiple apologies about my wait (which couldn't have been longer than 1 minute) and seeing that I was with my family offered to drop the parking rate to $15/night since I obviously wasn't travelling on business. The paid internet access ($13.95/day) was also waived if I joined their loyalty club. Then, the gentleman gave me his business card and told that if I needed anything, I was to give him a call. It turns out he was the front office manager and I really felt welcomed. While waiting for me, the kids were happily munching on some free popcorn and digging through a wagon of crayons, colouring books, and little toys.

The rooms were clean and comfortable with flat screen telvisions and an iHome radio (very handy) and I slept really well in the beds. There is a workout room (approx 20 machines) and a pool, hot tub and sauna. The pool isn't huge and it's more for frolicking than swimming but we enjoyed it. There's also a lot of nice Western art in the lobby and throughout the hotel. We had a few minor problem and requests over the 3 nights we stayed which were all dealt with immediately and happily.

Despite the wonderful service there was one detraction that drops this to a 4 star rating. Both Friday and Saturday night, the parking garage was full from about 8pm onward. We had the option of parking at a nearby lot or parking in the hotels lot but in the lane. Neither were good solutions for me.

I know- bad idea to dine at China Town during the weekend after Christmas and before New Year. The entire area was packed and our originally choice Pho Kim Long had a 12 names before us wait. I am very level headed person so I tried to keep that in mind in rating this place but what I experienced was just.. Disappointing.

So the pho was good IMO. We all got the house special pho dac biet. My comparison pho is PhoKim Long and I thought the broth was better and it had more meat. So I did think the food was good.

So we come in and I know what to expect at most establishments in the China Town area: the service is spotty and it can come off as rude.

This was like the worst experience I had dining somewhere.

So we walk in and a man simply asks how many and we say three and he starts to seat us. Out of no where this other man who was bussing starts yelling at the man seating us and makes these wild hand gestures i.e. Making an ""x"" with his arms and shaking his head. It is hard to put into words what happened but it was not welcoming at all. Apparently the guy was trying to tell his coworker they only have soup, the pho dac biet. No other food items. No sandwiches or any entrees or appetizers. That's what we came for anyways so he could have spared us the theatrics.

I have no idea why it took them ten minutes to come back to take our order. THEY ONLY HAVE ONE THING AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT! I was about to leave after thinking about the rude seating situation but the guy comes to take our order. We are told they have the other soups also. No worries! We all wanted what they told us they had anyways. So we wait for soup. Two other tables are seated by us while we wait. They are also told in a not as rude way that they only have soup. They all get the same soup as us. 

So I'm never one to bring up the race card but we didn't appreciate that the 3 gentlemen seated 10 minutes after us some how get their soup before us. My table of 3 didn't speak their language. My table of three which consisted of my Mexican best friend, and my half black cousin, and myself. We get ours a few minutes later. I tried to think no.. Maybe they ordered something else... But the guy who seated them spoke a language other than English to them (which is how I know they spoke the same language) and the rude busser guy took their order but told them they only had one size of the house special dac biet pho. So I know 100% that we got the same thing and they were seated after us and got their food first. 

Needless to say we didn't leave a great tip but we did leave a decent one even considering the experience. 

I didn't one star the place because the other guys were okay and I surprisingly liked their pho.

I looked back at when we came in and wish we left. I'm not one to complain. I feel like if you are able to control the situation by leaving then you should. We just really wanted pho! 

The whole thing just made me sad. Maybe that guy was having a crappy day but he was constantly yelling across the restaurant, constantly frowning, and just being rude to his coworkers and his patrons. He should have went home. Many people chose not to be seated once being informed of the only soup. The owners should really check out the reviews left by everyone.",2014-12-29 06:58:13

I wanted to get their take on it.  Before this place, China King down in Chandler was always my favorite dim sum place.  They had a great variety, the dim sum was not greasy, and the service was decent.

Mekong Palace does what China King does but even better.  There are more varieties of dim sum to choose from.  The restaurant is also a lot bigger and much cleaner with their tile floor.  China King's carpet has gotten really dirty over the past few years.  The usual chicken feet, har gow, siu mai, chow fun, and congee, which are my standards, are excellent here.  Also every time I go, I always seem to find some new item I've never tried before.

Price wise, it's as cheap as it can get.  With 4 people eating all the dim sum they can and hot tea, I think the bill is usually $40-$50 total.

To top it off, you can go grocery shopping next door after you're done or grab a boba tea at the taiwan cafe in the mall.

Maybe this stuff is better when you're either drunk or hungover?  When totally sober, you should definitely opt for something else.  Even just sticking with Starbucks would have been a much safer option (and cheaper, too!).",2013-11-07 18:52:20

Such a SHADY business. I specifically asked about fees when signing up and was only told about the cancellation fee. It's not even about the money, but I can't stand shady businesses!

We love breakfast foods and this place has such a variety of options. They even have a seasonal menu.

A nice mix of orange, lemon, turmeric, ginger, agave and beet. Not too sweet, not too spicy.  We also had to try the Millionaires Bacon which featured some cayenne, maple syrup and brown sugar. Bacon, made even better! I decided to order from the Summer menu and went with the Heirloom tomato and burata toast. What a light, great tasting summer breakfast item.  I loved it, except I think it would be even better served at room temperature instead of how cold it was. The tomatoes would have been even more flavorful that way.

The mushroom meringue was enjoyable - I'm not a fan of meringues in general and bought it only because it was so cute.  The lemon square was just the right balance of tart and sweet.

The prices are as you would expect from a boutiquey dessert joint and with the many coffee and dessert places down the street there are plenty of people in the hood ready to treat themselves to a $3 square or cookie -  myself included since I seem to consistently mess up desserts when I try to make them.

Created my own BLT burger w/ smash sauce and smash fries.  At first bite, the burger was good - maybe I was really hungry.

Not sure if this is the taste they are going for - it's not my preference.  It was good to try, but I probably won't be back when I need a burger fix.  Two burgers and two fries w/ one drink totaled a little over $20 for me and hubby.  For the price, it is not worth it - for that price, red robin quality is what's more on par to fit that bill.

This place sucks. I went with a couple of friends to try this place out since it was nearby and we've always passed by it but never actually went inside. My first impression of the bar when I walked in was it was very spacious, with alot of televisions. It sort of reminded me of Real Sports Bar with the huge TV in the middle ( but no comparison to RSB anyhow) 

After we got our seats, and decided what we wanted to drink and eat which didn't take very long, the waitress that was suppose to be serving us didn't even bother coming over to check up on us or take our order after a good 20 mins. Also when she did finally come by, she looked utterly bored and dis interested in even serving us. 

When finally our drinks and food came, we didn't have utensils or any plates, so we asked our waitress to give us some, and which that took another 15 mins for her actually give us everything. The nacho's we ordered weren't even good. It was cold and it just tasted like it was like left overs. 

When we decided that we had enough and were ready to leave, we had gotten the bill and placed down our money and were waiting to get change. And again, our waitress never came by to see if we were ready to pay and take our money. We saw her sitting down at another table with other customers chatting away and clearly not caring about her duties or responsibilities. I felt that she was very unprofessional and lacked the courtesy towards us but showed interest to other customers instead.

So I gave her a call and she was SUPER nice to me and asked how she could help me? We talked for awhile and got to know each other. As with all the players club members she was very accommodating. I told her I wasn't ready just yet to make my reservations. If anybody needs any questions answered about the players slot club and it's perks. Give 1 of the players slot club members a call.

The juke box has a phone app that allows you to pay for songs, definitely an added perk. The bar is pretty neighborly so most of the people that come in are regulars. 

My prime reason for the five star review is the fact that for a ""dive bar"" it is exactly that. Step back into the 70's and enjoy the pool table and some games. Meet your neighbors for a quick round. It's not littered with kids so it's a great place for an older crowd.

This particular McDonald's is new so it's very inviting and clean. I haven't had the pleasure of trying it out for myself but my daughter ensures me that the playground is good to go. Far away from civilization, this McDonald's has a double drive-through so either they're expecting a major boom out this way or there's some serious McDonald's lovers close by & they wanna be ready for anything.

I was pretty devastated considering I feel they are somewhat healthy amongst the wide variety of potentially fatty carnage. Not to say that they are, but after years of having negativity drilled in your head about the unhealthiness of these fine establishments, you tend to start believing it. Feeling doomed for all eternity, I was recommended to try the new breaded chicken wings aka mighty wings. Low and behold, these meaty bite-size morsels hit the spot. They have a little bit of a flair to them as well! I like them so much that I forgot about the dipping sauces.

OX-3LwOkA5valtCJT_Z0aA,cZMn2p8HbzEkFknbvM8e9A,v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg,3,3,1,0,"One of our favorite places that we go to enjoy Happy Hour on a regular basis, sometimes 2-3 times a month, almost always on Sundays. We made our regular trek to Tomo yesterday for their ""daily happy hour"" and arrived at 4:30pm only to find there was no happy hour due to it being Mothers Day.

I'm ok with them not offering happy hour on mothers day since it is their business and they can do what they want, however, I was not happy with the experience we had and paid full price for. Surprisingly it was not very busy which is even more of reason we question the slow and poor service.

First, we placed our order and every item arrived one at a time from the kitchen. About the time one person would finish their item the next persons item would arrive (there were four of us) so we all ate our meals one after another. Two of the items, which we paid full price for, were not the same size that we normally get from the happy hour menu at a discounted price. The Shrimp Tempura only had 5 shrimp which normally has 6 and the Mixed Tempura only had 1 shrimp and normally has 2.

Even worse, we completed all of our kitchen food and then sat waiting on our three rolls (that we ordered the same time as the rest of the meal) which came after the meal was over. When the three rolls arrived the waitress pointed out that they were not the rolls we ordered but she would give them to us at a discounted price. Since we came to Tomo for Sushi we wanted to eat some sushi but didn't want to wait any longer for the correct rolls so we agreed.

Overall a disappointing experience at one of our favorite places.",2012-05-14 16:50:13

The food is fresh and they have a great salsa bar. Hubby and I usually order the steak nachos to share. This time they didn't really impress me. There were a few little scattered steak pieces on the $18.00. + pan. We asked the young lady to come look and she did and went to ask the cook, he said he had put the required ""3 scoops"". She did order extra steak at no charge and had it brought out to us. The presentation was nice but it appears they are very tight with the toppings now. I think for what they gave it was overpriced.

1.  It's kid friendly only if your kid can sit by himself in a chair.   There are no high chairs in this place -- probably because the tables and booths are fairly high (booths are on risers, tables are tall bar tables) so you either have to tag team with another person in your party to hold your kid while the other eats OR bring your own portable high chair that attaches to one of the booths OR hire a babysitter and have a parents' night out.

2.  Prices.   Prices are fairly reasonable considering all the food is local, but some of the specials seem a little bit over-priced.   I mean, Monday's they have a Chicago style hot dog.... $6.95 for a hot dog seems pretty steep.  As well as the beef stroganoff....we ordered a takeout order of this and it came in one of those small takeout soup containers.  It rang in to around $11.95 if I'm not mistaken.... YIKES.   I would stick with the sandwiches for $6.95 with one side.  A platter is $11.95 -- basically the same thing (minus the bun) + two sides.   The price jump from a sandwich to a platter doesn't seem worth it to me.

Those are my two issues.  We eat here at least once a week and I LOVE the pulled pork sandwich, the Cuban sandwich, and the burnt end sandwich (although the last couple times I had it, it was dry).  My side of choice is either the potato salad (to die for!) or a side salad (all local,fresh vegetables....so refreshing!!!).

UPDATE:  they now have highchairs!  The kind that attach to the table.  We actually bought a Phil and Ted portable high chair to specifically bring with us to BD, but they beat us to it....  So now i only have the one issue about their prices.  BTW -- their smoked chicken is WONDERFUL as well as their pit beans.   If you're wondering what to feed your 10 month old baby, try little bits of chicken, pulled pork, the sweet potato and some beans!",2011-03-03 16:51:11

Food arrives quickly to the table and usually orders are not forgotten, everything is accounted for. Their menu is very extensive and features a lot of different items to suit a variety of different people. 

Recently, they've implemented a new ordering system. Previously, they had a typical ordering system where you just tell the waiter what you'd like to eat but now they provide every table with a booklet of sheets that can be marked and ripped out. Each sheet has approx. 10 different menu items and a little box beside it to mark the # you'd like. This is a LOT easier than their old way. 

Also, being a vegetarian, I appreciate when restaurants put a little green leaf/broccoli symbol next to items that are vegetarian friendly. It saves me the trouble of questioning them on all their dishes. Sushi doesn't have too much rice, and tastes fresh. Tempura always arrives hot to the table and it isn't too oily. Large selection of desserts as well, my personal favourite it the mango pudding.

3h0pH3YAtKXFFjMN2tAyZg,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,4,8,6,6,"This was surprisingly good a few years back, and it held up on this long-awaited revisit.

Flour & Barley is a pizza-focused Italian restaurant that's been holding down the 1st floor space below Brooklyn Bowl in the middle of the Linq Promenade for quite a few years now. Considering their location, they do seem a little pricey, but their $20 Restaurant Week menu was affordable enough to entice a small group of us here today for lunch. Nobody delved into the craft beer (about 6 on tap and many in bottles/cans) or other alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages, so we managed to keep costs down.

Kale & Arugula Salad: almost certainly a reduced portion compared to the regular menu salad ($12), but still a masterful showcase of delicious, fresh arugula. They really do not mess around with the arugula here, so if you don't like its ubiquitous flavor for some reason, then avoid it. The toasted pine nuts were the most notable of the accoutrements, for texture of course.

Meatballs: smooth, seasoned well, juicy spheres of beef, pork, and veal. Salsa verde is an interesting choice and works for me. Two meatballs for the Restaurant Week menu, compared to the three meatballs on the regular order ($13).

The Big Apple (normally $15.50): traditional pepperoni pizza and no skimping. Every bite will have pepperoni. The grease really adds up though, and it softens up the crust a little. It's the heaviest of the pizzas which we shared and made me want to dig into a salad.

Mushroom Pizza (normally $16.50): a better showcase of the crispy crust. Delicious mushroom and restrained truffle oil usage, and more delicious arugula. Definitely would consider getting this again.

Verdure Pizza (normally $16.50): it's as meat-deficient as the Mushroom, but this is a lot more boring. There isn't really a sauce or anything other than the base of tomato sauce. I wouldn't get it again.

Mini Cannoli: great flavor and texture between the crispy shell and the fully cream-filled interior. But why was one end dipped in just pistachio and the other in just chocolate chips? How about making each end half and half so that I don't have to do pull off the weird lengthwise multiple bite play to get both in one bite?

One interesting twist to the meal was that we had one person suffer the misfortune of getting two full glasses of water spilled all over her by one of the servers. Fortunately, the staff was quick to clean up and General Manager Ryan threw in some meatballs and several other comped food items to make up for the indignity:

Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($12): an amazing, balanced bowl with crispy deep fried individual leaves of the Brussels sprouts, nice and soft diced potato, smoked bacon, and a sunny side up egg on top to boot.

Calamari Fritti ($14.50): I like the calamari and the accompanying roasted tomato aioli. The battered peppers are kinda fun, but after a while, you realize that they're so common that they're being used as filler. However, I'm actually okay with the frisée at the bottom of the bowl for the added texture. It was the only component that held up in a to-go box.

Pizza French Toast ($14): honey ricotta and cream cheese instead of mozz, maple syrup instead of tomato sauce, and plump, ripe berries as the toppings? Oh my. It's a brunch menu item (Saturday/Sunday 11-2) that's as good as it sounds, and it's not too sweet.

I will add that there was one more service concern: it kinda took half an hour or more to get the mini cannoli out for whatever reason. I wasn't in too much of a hurry, but others at my table were irked and it's just not a good look.

I'll have to consider coming back to Flour & Barley if I have a pizza craving and am stuck on the Strip; perhaps happy hour deals and other offers would work too. It's a pretty good restaurant that hasn't stuck around for no reason.",2018-06-25 05:42:42

I will say try to go before or after typical lunch time on the weekends because the lines can get really long. The area outside is large and great if you have little ones that like to run around. After your meal, I suggest getting a coffee or a cupcake at the coffee shop that is right next door. Then walk around the farm area after. Its a nice escape from the busy world and soak in some quality time with your family. Enjoy yourself! I always do there.",2016-02-03 22:06:07

The restaurant is right in the heart of the Strip, so convenient location but parking hell on weekends. Inside, it's a very simple, no-frills type of pizza joint. I was not impressed with the level of cleanliness, but I guess I've seen worse. 

Bella Notte offers a good variety of hoagies, wraps, and salads, but I'm not one to pass up an opportunity to chow down on some pizza. My boyfriend ordered a 16"" Ranch Steak pizza (all to himself). Very good size and clearly meant to be shared. Being the more reasonable one, I ordered the Build Your Own Monster Slice with onions. These are pre-made and reheated, so you don't get that ""fresh out of the oven"" experience, but a good size for a single serving. Way too much cheese for my preference, but other than that, it was very tasty. The crust (my favorite part) was full and crispy, just how it should be. A little cup of ranch comes with an extra $0.50 charge...I should have brought my bottle of Hidden Valley. Each slice is $3 and $0.75 per topping, so overall, it was a cheap meal.",2016-07-25 01:26:13

Ordered a burrito bowl, chicken, no rice. Very little chicken and black beans, approximately 1/4 c. each. Little cheese, maybe 2 tablespoons. Since I don't get rice, I asked for extra lettuce, it didn't happen. In fact the paper bowl was slightly less than half full. I noticed the burritos have almost a full cup of rice in them, filler? Ingredients are still fresh and tasty, but I'll probably not go back to any Chipotle due to experience and value, pretty expensive. The initial server and cashier were friendly, the toppings guy, not at all, in addition to not listening--had to repeat items twice.

Then by miracle one day, a coupon for a FREE burrito of your choice from Chipotle hit my apartment mailbox.  No joke!  I guess it was because my apartment was close to UNLV and they wanted folks to come check it out.  I kid you NOT...I was searching in our mailroom trash can for extra coupons.  I found like a half a dozen of em!  For 6 bucks a burrito I was definitely saving me some moolah.  I even took my gf out for lunch one day using these coupons (heh heh).  I was a dirt poor college student, not cheap!

Anyway, I finally get to go to this place.  I was a bit weirded out because the line was out the door.  I was like, ""What's going on?"".  Come to find out that you stand in a line to 'craft' your own burrito, and you can see what goes into it.  It was a cool concept, although a bit strange at first because I was expecting a few cashiers like Taco Bell.  The decor was nice, more modern, lots of steel, fewer colors and more monochromatic.  

I get to the front of the line and it's my turn.  It's like creative freedom kindgomness (if that's a word).  First I get to choose if I want a burrito, soft or hard tacos, or a burrito bol (burrito with no tortilla).  Then I get to choose my meat or veggies, rice and beans, then my goodies on top.  I go for a burrito with grilled chicken, cilantro-lime rice, black beans, pico di gallo, tomatillo salsa, and extra romaine lettuce.  This sucker came out HUGE.  The lady could barely close it and wrap it in foil.  I was so happy I could barely contain myself!  Big food for big boy!  It was seriously over a pound for this burrito.  After I kindly handed over my coupon I was on to the main event.   

It was sooooooo good!  I love this idea of your meal all nicely wrapped up.  It was great with the rice beans, moist chicken and the salsas.  The lettuce provided some 'snap'.  I smothered this beast with green tabasco at every bite...MUY DELICIOSO!  I finished it...barely.  It wasn't until later that I found out EACH of these burritos carry over 1100 calories with all the fixin's.  No wonder I slept like a baby afterwards.  

Eat one.  Or half of one and save the rest of it for later.  You won't regret it.  Unless you eat a whole one with extra beans and hot salsa, then you might.  But probably not.",2008-06-12 19:40:42

First of all everything came out piping HOT, including other diners dishes, you could see the steam rising throughout the restaurant!

My husband always orders Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and he said this was his Favorite and best he's ever had!
 I had a few bites and  it was truly delicious with the fresh pasta and roasted pulled chicken and just the right amount of sauce, it had great flavor!

My Gnocchi was no exception, those tasty little morsels of cheesy mashed potatos if you will and the Tomato Cream sauce was excellent as well although I wish there had been just a tad more sauce.

Our ceasar salad was large enough to share, fresh greens dressed just right but unfortunately no croutons or parmesean?

We didn't want to go with another chain, after having such a great experience at another Non-chain pizza place a couple weeks back.

Fat Moe's opens at 10:30am, and we called right at 10:30.  We were politely asked to call back in 5 minutes, but received a phone call within 3, saying they were sorry, and they were ready to take our order.

We ordered a 14 inch Fat Moe's Special:  Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, and ham, with onions, green peppers, olives, and mushrooms.  

We also ordered the ravioli with beef. 

35 minutes later, we had our food.

The ravioli was awesome.  Filled well, and cooked perfectly, and seasoned well.  I enjoyed them a lot, as did my fella.

As I recall, the noodle bowl was very spicy, so that was slightly tough for me, but the Hubs thought it was amazing. The small plates we had were so good, pig face dumplings were top notch.

We choose a selection of appetizers along with a plate of the carpaccio which were tasty. 
For my entree I choose the steak. 
It was a bit over cooked to my liking and really dark on the outside however it was still tasty. 
They lacked in presentation on this plate even though that was the only thing on it, they could of added some colour or garnish that would of made it more appealing (first pic). 
I ordered brussels sprouts (which looked charred and not appetizing) and mashed potatoes on the side. Again the presentation wasn't there on these plates but the mashed potatoes were still edible, unlike the brussels sprouts they were clearly over cooked as the green lacked a vibrant green hue. 

In the end we ordered the frozen baked Alaskan. Now that's a presentation on it's own!! And delicious!! Definitely a sharing plate.

Food was whatevs, beers were meh.  Was surprised that Oktoberfest was still on the menu so I tried to order that, heh.  It wasn't--they should update their menu or say something like ""seasonal""

Disappointed at how the hostess had no idea about birthday desserts as their menus advertised.  Told them while we had a few drinks, that we're here for a friend's bday and we'd like to get the birthday dessert. She had no idea what I was talking about.  So I had to track down our 20yr-old waitress who was able to get a dessert for him.  

Doesn't their menu say you get your choice of dessert for free if it's your birthday or something?  I really didn't get to choose, she just brought out an average chocolate cake slice or something without a candle, just a slice, very unceremonious.

End of the night, I told her that I'd be paying for the dessert (as a joke, bc she acknowledged to me that it was free).  I find out later from a buddy that the cake wasn't free and that HE paid for it. 

So: (1) it wasn't free; and (2) the wrong person got charged.  Yeah, it's not like the premier place to celebrate a birthday, maybe just grab drinks after work - like we did.  Shouldn't say that dessert is free if it isn't though :/

Rest assured that those who did go to Scraps will be happy with the boutique that has replaced it. Much has changed, but I feel these have been good changes.

The shop has moved a few suites down to make room for a self wash, bakery goods and the usual foods, treats and accessories. I didn't get pictures for the profile, but will on my next stop. It's triple the size of the old one. 

Obviously other than the food, I was drawn in as a customer to Scraps for the friendly and approachable staff. The new staff is just as nice and talkative so I feel good about coming to this place. One of the girls has the most mellow and sweetest frenchie/boston as the stores new resident doggy that rounds out the welcoming feel of the store. 

 The prices are about the same and reasonable (not huge markups on foods- shipping some ""cheaper"" items online will still cost me more in total than driving down here) and selection is good. Hopefully with this change, the selection might even get better. I took a trip to their SW location and there's a lot more variety than Scraps had and more than this location currently stocks. Variety is a plus to me since I like to rotate foods and treats to keep the animals interests up (and keep food allergies from happening). The only new ""must have"" treat I have to go to the SW location folr are Merricks hooves since these little pugs need big dog sized challenging chews. All of the basic foods and  treats for the dogs and cat I can find here. 

The bakery goods are a welcomed addition. The dogs love the parmesan bacon muffins (75 cents each) the best but enjoyed all the cookies we have brought home and the cat ended up liking the cheese cookies (75 cents each) the best crumbled up into bite size pieces. 

The dog wash in the back seems stocked well and kept clean. I saw a sign that it is $9 for any sized dog which is cheaper than a lot of places I've seen. I nearly pulled my back trying to wash my dogs in my little ass stand up shower so it's something to consider. 

The business/staff are associated with a rescue; the owners also run Heaven Can Wait Sanctuary and many of the staff are volunteers and fosters. That makes me happy since it's basically full circle of helping out animals: they help them find homes, aid with population issues by offering low cost spaying&neuter clinics, help with feral cat populations, then providing a place for those owners to get good foods and services to keep animals happy in their new homes.

Another plus is that they're open 7 days a week. Weekends are our only time to be able to shop for the animals together and sometimes it was difficult to come on Saturdays and  Sundays were closed. 

I'm a big fan of local business in general but I'm very enthusiastic about this place since it enables me to be the kind of pet parent I want to be. Good selection, prices, nice staff and business owners with a heart for helping- what's not to like?",2011-02-07 02:53:35

I wish I had a drink here, as they all looked great, but I had plenty the day before, so I wasn't feeling up to it.  I even saw Bob the Bartender slinging drinks from behind the bar, so that is always a great sign.

We tried to go here a number of times, but the place is small, there is always a long wait, so get there early, (i.e. before dinner time) if you want to sit immediately.

I started off with the Pork Belly Tacos, and they were amazing.  I would suggest splitting these, though, as they get heavy on your stomach pretty quick.  Especially if you are going to sample other menu items.

The fried cheese was also great.  I ended up just eating by itself, rather than on the bread.

The service was slightly below average, as it seems like they serve their food in batches (e.g. they make a large batch of pork bell tacos and everyone gets it at the same time regardless of when you ordered), and our server was mostly absent.

The big down sides are 1) getting a seat, and 2) sitting on the lap of absolute strangers once you do get a seat.  I really hate cramped seating, so next time I would try and get their 1-2 booths that have.

I was here for lunch two days ago, and last night for dinner. The seems to be only two waitresses here, both in smart uniforms. The younger waitress had her hair tied in a bun, and moved with great efficiency. The other waitress was more friendly. 

The place was fresh. The gift baskets of fake flowers with cards of congratulations were placed at the front door, and the counter. The walls had glass lit sections displaying..nothing. They didn't even pick the art to put on the walls yet, that's how fresh this place is.
Two cylindrical chandeliers, an open ceiling that makes no sense hanging chandeliers from, lightly decorated walls of printings of bamboo, cream coloured everything. Not tacky though. So far so good.
 I ordered pho both visits, and honestly, whole heartedly...the best soup base I have ever had in the city of Toronto. The rare beef was quite raw, but cooks in seconds in the hot soup. The deep fried springs rolls was delicious. I ordered the mango juice, but it was more like mango slush. Too cold and thick for the flavour to come through. I couldn't finish even half the glass. Menu's full of things, so if you don't like Vietnamese noodle soup, there a lot more to choose from.
I could say this place was very clean and the service was good, but the restaurant is new, and hasn't settled into this hole in the wall which used to be my old dry-cleaners. So...so far so good.

Essentially, The District is an open-air mall next to Green Valley Ranch Station Hotel/Casino. It is wide and spacious, but not so huge that you can really lose your way. It isn't uncommon to see people coming here walking around for exercise, and even sometimes walking their kids and dogs. It is nice to see a place that is welcoming to this sort of thing. Live music is often played here, and there are even movies shown in the open air near the carousel during summer months. 

The place has several restaurants, from more casual ones to straight-up dine-in ones. Amongst them are Balboa Pizza Kitchen, Elephant Bar, Lucille's BBQ, Crazy Pita, and several others. I haven't eaten in all of them, but where I do eat you can expect me to review on there.

If you're looking for movies, music, games, or pretty much anything fun, leave your expectations at the door.

Furthermore, the parking sucks. If you've ever tried going to Lucille's you know what I mean. They have blocked off a huge portion of the parking lot for valet parking (unnecessary), and blocked off the old dirt lot that was used for overflow parking.

Pretty Cool Themed Truck/Trailer and Owner was delightful and Convincing as he briefly explained his inspirations for his creations of Korean Fusion Tacos and such..

Here is what I got roughly an HOUR after I placed my order:

Pork Taco & Beef Taco

Both the tacos had their version of korean inspired kimchee/saurkraut spiced with a twist. UUmmm.... Okay, I'm always up for new takes on food. First off, there wasn't much meat in either of the tacos and the tortilla made them look even more skimpy (especially for the price). Secondly, the beef was very bland, pretty chewy (not in a good way) and all I could really taste was spicy/heat?! Where's the flavor? Pretty much the same with the pork.. except it was a little juicier with a bit of flavor?! I couldn't comprehend what they were trying to accomplish here..

El Korean ""Nate"" Dog

This looked interesting but wasn't much different in regards to its flavor profile compared to the Tacos. The hot dog tasted like a regular hot dog and bun was no different. The only slight upside to this was the texture from the same kimchee/saurkraut thing that accompanied the tacos.  

Disregarding the horrendous wait (which was the dagger), the bang for the buck, and the slight edge the hot dog had over the tacos, I cannot give this place much justice. Sorry",2010-12-12 08:19:57

The food is always fresh and if I have to eat out I choose panera because of their healthy, delicious choices. 

A couple of my favorites are their Turkey BLT with avacado on sourdough bread, the Greek quinoa salad, and their green passion smoothie that has spinach and fruit juice in it. 

Whenever we have to go out to lunch for work, I always suggest panera because I know it won't be greasy and make me feel gross for the rest of the day. If you are looking for a healthy ""fast-food"" type of restaurant, then this is your choice. Don't forget to do rapid pick up and order online. It's a life savor. 

So this is the beginning of my edited review. The first couple trips I have had there were great. But lately, it's gone down hill fast. It started with doing an online order and two things getting left out - my cookie and the dressing for the salad. I ignored it because people forget all the time and I'm not a hard customer to please but then two more incidents have occurred. 

The first since that is I can't have cheese so I ask for spinach instead. When I opened my breakfast sandwich, I kid you not here were 4 or so pieces of spinach that didn't even cover the whole piece of bread. I know this is lame of me to call this out but come on. 

The second thing is when I ordered my salad, it was less then half full in the box. Panera is not cheap and I expected to be full after one of their salads and when I opened the box to eat it for lunch, it was unflavorful and disappointing. 

I really hope they start stepping up their game again.",2016-11-03 19:41:33

I opened up the accompanying soup container and got instantly punched in the face with a heavenly fragrance of spice and herbs. Inside the soup were slices of pork hock and blood jello. I put it all together and may have had the best soup noodles I've ever had in my life. The soup was a little salty, but all is forgiven as everything else surpassed my expectations.

I can't wait to go back and try out the other stuff on their menu, including the giant pancake that some lady got, stuffed with... I don't know, I didn't want to stare.",2011-01-31 19:09:29
QAcODI5RRrPximhZ18ISMA,IlRmNuOSy9HMoxMMa6zhbg,ESzO3Av0b1_TzKOiqzbQYQ,4,0,0,0,"Rock Bottom has a sizable menu with all things one would expect at a brew pub that is a full service restaurant. The number of Mexican cuisine offerings seems to be growing. The food seems to be reliably good.It's also excellent for groups! I've been there several times with groups. While the most recent time was only seven, some in the past have been large groups (one of 20, and another with over 30) on weekend evenings and I'm thoroughly impressed with the friendly, efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups. Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they've always chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), They also managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch. My only complaints are related to the beer -- both the taste and attempting to choose one. Choosing one was difficult as the large menu chalkboard didn't have ABVs listed on it  , the beer on cask condition was not the one listed on the menu board and there was at least one other discrepancy between the beer list on the table and the menu board. And what's listed on the restaurant's website for this location isn't even close. In addition, the server was not able to answer a fairly simple question about one of the beers (but she went and asked a bartender), which was surprising for a brew pub, but it should be noted that otherwise, the service was flawless. I wasn't impressed with the two beers that I tried (and I'm not remotely a beer snob).The Good Neighbor Kölsch wasn't as smooth as I'm used to getting from any Kölsch, including ones that I've had here in the past. The Life's A Peach wheat with mango and peach had a bit of a bite to it as well.",2017-07-13 03:14:58

It's clean, the staff is courteous and friendly, very reasonably priced, and it's oh so comfy. 

Key steps to success:
  1. Buy advance tickets using the Fat Cats online ticketing to reserve optimal seating
  2. Arrive 15-20 minutes ahead of screening time*
  3. Buy Popcorn and Drinks
  4. Find your seat.
  5. Recline and prepare for transport!

Yeah baby! Wash, rinse, repeat as needed.

A note on the food ----
It is convenient to be able to order food and have it delivered to you as you are reclining in the theater. But, in truth, I have found the food to be lacking on the 3 occassions I have ordered some. Give it a go. Your mileage may vary. The chicken strips are OK, if a bit overdone and rubbery. The Pizza, however, is down right awful... exercise caution.

To Fat Cats Owners and Management: The deficiencies cited above are very correctable. You guys could really knock this gig out of the park with an increase in food quality. I'm just itchin' to give you that fifth STAR.

These days the only justifiable reasons NOT to go to FatCats are: 
 - IMAX format preferred for the movie 
or 
 - Movie not Showing at Fat Cats.

In conclusion: Thank you Fat Cats for being so awesomely awesome. I forgive you for your nasty pizza. Love ya bunches anyway! See you soon.

The suite was beautiful, but was kind of sad to see the damage it's suffered at the hands of the various guests. Some of the damages we noticed were the ""imported hardwood floor"" was all dinged/scratched up, the Sub-Zero fridge had a ding on the door (what kind of animal does that?!?!), and one of the closet doors had a HUGE chunk missing where the latch used to be. Some issues we had with our stay was that the highly touted jetted tub in the room didn't work (the jets, not the tub). Some of the lamps in the room were also busted. The TV in the bedroom didn't work, until the husband fidgeted with the cables and stuff for like 10 minutes. We didn't report any of these issues, as we were lucky to get the one-bedroom suite, but if we had paid full price for the room, we would definitely have reported them.

Didn't really interact with the staff and we were fine with that. The casino was nice and quiet.. we each won a few hundred bucks, which always helps!

Not sure if we'd return, as the neighborhood is kinda... dicey. Not outright sketchy, but definitely dicey. The location was great, as we went to have drinks at Golden Tiki and dinner at Hachi (x2!) on Spring Mountain.

After the Mass ended, it was around 12:30 and Amelie's seemed like the perfect place to grab lunch. 

I walked in and have to say it was somewhat confusing. There's a really big open area when you walk in and my eyes instantly went to a sign that says ""LINE STARTS HERE"" indicating a hard right upon entering the door. Well I took a hard right and the only thing there was seating and eventually the restrooms followed by an exit. Oooookay. So I walked back up to the front and saw other people ordering by the counters straight ahead from the entrance. So I went there to put my order in and it worked out. But seriously why in the world is that arrow telling you to take an immediate right to get in line when the line starts literally right ahead of you?! 

Anyways I got in line which was also weird because some people were ordering from the pastry case and others were in line to order actual food (but it was all one line going to two separate things. Just weird.) I knew I wanted a pastry but since I also wanted food I just figured I'd get to the main register and order it all at once. When I got to the register to put my order in, the woman told me that pastries had to be ordered ""over there"" (same line I just waited in to get to her....). I asked if I could just pay for the pastry and show my receipt to the other associate and she said it was fine. She was definitely unapologetic. So I put my order in and she handed me a buzzer, which I figured would go off in 5-10 mins. But as I'm standing there waiting to get my pastry, it starts going off! What do I do?! Get out of the pastry line to grab my food? Wait for my pastry and then find an associate to tell them I missed catching my food when it came out?! Ugh WHAT A MESS! Anyways I got the damn pastry and then heard someone yelling my name and sure enough it was a woman with my sandwich. 

So about the actual food. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich on a croissant, a hot chocolate and a salted caramel brownie. I took a seat at the bar once I had all my items. That's a good place to sit if you're solo obviously. 

The chicken salad sandwich was good. The best part was the croissant. Very light and flaky. I normally eat chicken salad on regular bread but I really enjoyed having it on a pastry type bread like that. Might have to make that my new thing. The chicken salad had good flavor but was too chunky in my opinion. I would have liked to see the chicken cut up a bit more. 

As for the hot chocolate, I should mention that I was standing right there as she made it and I watched her take a ceramic mug and fill it up HALFWAY with hot chocolate and then put whipped cream to fill up the rest of the cup. So you are definitely not getting your money's worth. I'd say I probably got about ten gulps total out if it. Which was kind of okay since it was way too chocolatey (and I LOVE sweet stuff). What I didn't like was that I could tell they used dark chocolate and not milk chocolate which I prefer. It did taste like expensive dark chocolate though, so at least I felt fancy I guess. 

As for the salted caramel brownie, that was the star of the show! Not your typical brownie. Much more thin, but great flavor and perfect amount of sweetness. The caramel blanketing the top had the perfect amount of coverage, great caramel consistency with just a hint of salt. It was delicious! I wish I would have gotten a few more to go! 

All in all, it's a place to try at least once. But the confusing setup and ordering process with an average sandwich and ""meeeh"" hot chocolate gives it a 3 from me.",2017-11-17 01:35:30

- Gobo ($7.00) - burdock root deep fried. I've only had burdock one other time. These reminded me of daikon. Interesting spin mimicking fries.
- Gyu tan ($10.00) - miso marinated cow tongue. Delicious! It take a bit longer to chew but it's well worth the effort. My favourite dish of the night.
- Takoyaki ($6.00) - you get 6 pieces of octopus balls. I'm not a huge takoyaki fan but these were hot and crispy. I appreciated how it was lightly sauced and had just the right amount of bonito flakes.
- Kaiso sarada ($8.00) - seaweed salad with sesame dressing. Wasn't expecting this to be a mix of salad and seaweed. 
- Agedashi ($6.00) - tofu in fish broth. Lightly deep fried but oh so soft on the inside. Really nicely done.
- Pork yakiudon ($13.00) - noodles had a great chewy texture. We would have liked more pork slices.

The menu is a somewhat small list of over-priced hipster drinks and basic bottled beer. After being told that they didn't have the ingredients to make a couple drinks I requested at the bar (which btw were nothing super fancy or unusual for Las Vegas or any reputable big city bar) the female bartender handed me their menu and said ""pick something off this"". WTF. I chalk it up to lazy and unskilled at your craft. 

Being local, I would definitely bring friends & family here for the view, but I would save the drinking for another spot. Someplace that stocks something other than bottled Corona beer and can only make you a basic martini. Which is sad, because it would be an amazing spot to sit and watch the sun go down with a great drink in hand.",2016-06-30 15:27:50

The menu is reduced for restaurant week and it can be reduced for group events, that depends on whoever coordinates it, I guess.  You still get the salad bar and as much meat as you want, you just don't get the most expensive cuts of meat.  The last time I went for a charity dinner, they also had about half the items on the salad bar as they normally do.  

The salad bar is great!  Chima probably has the best salad bar I have ever been to, to this date.  There could be a better one out there but I have not been to it yet.  There are so many items, cured meats, many cheeses including fresh mozzarella, soups, and many more things.  I recommend walking around the salad bar to plan how you will allocate your plate because you will probably not want to go back for seconds once the meat starts coming around.  

The service here is pretty good.  If you want something you don't see, let your server know and she will gladly send it over.  However the first time I came to this place they kept serving(without asking) bottled water and charged us for it.  That only happened once but you need to be careful, especially if you are thirsty.  

It will be hard to stop eating.  After a few visits I learned to pre-plan to not over eat.  Planning and patience is the key at this restaurant.",2012-11-20 03:13:06

The staff was incredibly pleasant. They all were quite interested in making sure you find the tour, find the exits, and find Jesus. 
The exhibits were rather well done, taking you through Billy Graham's early preaching life, his meeting with rich and powerful people, and writing his weekly newspaper column. 
I was taken aback a little bit by how extravagant this place seems. It seems a bit prideful to build a museum about yourself, especially when the subject is still alive. I kept asking myself how many hungry mouths could've been fed instead of building this place. 
But the grounds were really nicely kept, and the whole place seemed to be like hanging out at Ned Flanders' house. 
The tour takes about an hour or so, with movies every several minutes that you're forced to sit through. They close the doors up, so you don't really have the option to be bored and race through the museum.

The Wiener Schnitzel is on the House Specialties list for a reason. It is battered and fried to perfection and the speatzels don't come in some wimpy portion size. Comes w/the perfect amount!! The Chicken Paprikash...tho isn't my grandma's...is pretty darn close and the dumplings are a must. My 3rd pick would be the Hungarian Goulash. Really you can't go wrong here!! WAIT!

At least this place includes them to the price and their massage chairs work. However, be prepared to wait in line. The place gets really full and there's really no place to sit.

Before you read my review take this into consideration, its $7 for lunch & $12 for dinner ALL YOU CAN EAT Asian-ish buffet....WHAT DO YOU ExPEct? Definitely NOT gourmet food!? THat would be one helluva KRAZY idea! In a nutshell salad looked unappetizing, chicken wings were good til I discovered it was because of the MSG that they use on it, egg drop soup tasted like scrambled eggs swimming in cornstarch soup, kalbi beef had an after taste as well as the baked green mussels ( I can taste/smell meats etc when they have been properly washed or cleaned, they have a certain stench to them even after they are cooked) the sushi looked unappealing and the fish did not look fresh, the desserts consisted of canned fruit of the lowest grade possible, almond cookies, chocolate mousse etc., they did have a chocolate & vanilla soft serve yogurt machine but bananas smothered with red sauce? Interesting.... At least they had sliced fresh oranges. They did have crab legs for dinner as well as seasoned crab pieces. The ok dishes for me were the chop suey, the pot sticker and the fried rice. Hey at least the food is edible...not a total waste of money. If you are looking for a place to just satisfy your hunger that is within your budget that can give you the variety you crave then you have come to the right place!

My husband had gone to his concert about 20 years ago in Portland Oregon.  He wasn't as excited about it as I was.  

There were long lines to get into the area, it was packed with crazy people all in a partying mood.  As we funneled through the doors, we were herded through metal detectors.  Once inside, we helped to our seats and spent a fun night watching the crazy people and rocking out to the same old Jimmy tunes.

As with most Charlotte Breweries, I have already tasted their beer prior to my visit. This was my last brewery in Charlotte that needed an ""official visit"".

The Brewery Restaurant complex that is Heist, is quite extensive. A large patio/outdoor seating, two bars and a main indoor dining area. My initial impression was that it felt very dark and cave like in here. There was a private party in one area, so we sat at the bar by the brewing tanks.

As I've already tried the majority of their beer, I settled on the closest thing they have to an IPA which is their San Fran Disco, a hoppy American Ale - it was drinkable and refreshing but nothing spectacular. 

Our bartender was not friendly at all - she was ""short"" with us and didn't really seem like she felt being at work. She was all business and wanted to get the ""job"" done and move on. When I asked questions, she answered so quickly, it felt like she couldn't be bothered.

While sitting at the bar another server/bartender (?), tall and blonde, helped an AA family waiting for their table with drinks; the server was really very rude to them. Yes, they ordered 4 Sprites but that shouldn't matter. She filled them all with the soda hose, dripping soda everywhere and almost slammed them on the bar. ""Here you are, four Sprites!"" she sneered. I couldn't believe the family didn't say anything - I certainly would have and almost did on their behalf. So A) the server was having a bad day and took it out on the customers B) she is rude all the time and shouldn't be a server C) she felt like the customers were being cheap and refer back to A or B - D) she doesn't respect people of other colors. The whole ""sour"" staff ruined the experience for me. Maybe it was ""bring your personal baggage to work day"". I don't care if your beer and food is just okay or awesome. If your staff doesn't represent your product well, no one will buy it.

All the pictures I've ever seen of their food look awesome. I would probably be more likely to come back here for dinner than for the beer next time.

I highly recommend the superfood salad or the mega life or the phytosalad for something a bit light. (The phytosalad has a beautiful presentation). The tangled thai is something I also recommend if you want something satisfying but guilt free. Don't skip on their hot sauce (the brownish looking one). It tastes amazing and unlike any other restaurant I've been too. Seriously, Fresh is worth going to for the hot sauce. My boyfriend and I also order onion rings which are huge and crunchy. 
For dressings, their peanut lime sauce and 369 sauce are definitely filling. Carrot miso is oil free and excellent if you don't want to feel heavy afterwards. 
Serving sizes are quite big, and are always presented beautifully. Whoever said salads were boring?
If you have doubts about getting full off a salad, try their fresh bowls. They're pretty big as well and are excellent, but my friends usually can't finish them. Something in between is their fresh macrobowl, just order the vegetables without the rice or soba noodles for something a bit heartier and warm and more filling.

KBBQ came with a couple of sides: Soybean soup, egg, green onion salad, lettuce and Korean sides. The egg was delicious, it was more flavourful than most places. The soybean soup was really bland and watered down. There wasn't much taste in it. It was just spicy with a hint of soybean taste with some soybeans in it. 

Must order: Soybean Paste Soup & Rice for an additional $2.50! This soup was definitely better than the soybean soup. Much more flavourful! You can only order one per table though.

Okay, why a 5 star?  Let me explain:

  My girlfriend has been dying to eat at Johnny Smalls ever since we passed by it on our way to Vanity Nighclub for our birthday.  I wanted to surprise her, so I made a reservation on the 25th.  The girl on the phone took my name and the time for my reservation request.  
  The afternoon of the 27th, I wanted to confirm my appointment at Johnny Smalls to assure everything was good prior to going (I'm paranoid with reservations).  When I called, I was told that my reservation did not exist.  I told her that was impossible and that she even took my name down alongside a phone number.  She looked again and said that there was no record.  She then asked how many were in my party.  I told her 2 and she told me that was the problem.  They ""supposedly"" do not take reservations for a party of 2.  Only larger parties were allowed to make a reservation.  I then asked what the point was of taking my name and number down.  She told me she has no clue why the hostess recorded that information, but there was no record and reservations for 2 are not possible.  A walk in was her suggestion.  
  Being a little peeved and ready to raise a ruckus upon arrival, I decided to go ahead with a walk-in.  When I walked up to the hostess stand, I was asked if I had a reservation.  I started to explain that I made a reservation for 2, but someone over the phone told me it was nonexistent.  She cut me off and said, "" oh, I'm sorry; there's a change with the policy.. we DO accept reservations for 2 now.""  As I gave her my first name, she finished my sentence and gave my last name (without even looking at  anything... she totally remembered!)  That was pretty darn impressive!

On top of the excellent hostess that recovered my bad experience over the phone, we had an amazing server who came to us as soon as we finished our 4 plates and took our next round of orders.  The bus boy was on top of his game too, clearing out our table as soon as the plates began to tower.  

 The creativity of the food selection (and the twist of flavors) was very intriguing.  Not all the flavors worked for us, but it was definitely different and I would totally recommend this place to a friend.  My girlfriend and I tried to get through the entire menu, but it wasn't an easy task.  We'll be back though and try the rest out.  Till then, check out below what we had ordered and what we thought of the dish:

Round 1
Complimentary Cheese Bread (amazing, but don't stuff yourself on it)
Street Stand Fish Tacos ( one of our favorites)
Jack & Coke Skewers (another win for us)
BBQ Oysters (unique flavor, great taste.. one of our favorites)
Teriyaki Salmon (you gotta try it.. yummy ! )

Round 2
Tuna Sashimi (I'm a big fan of sashimi, but this is way salty)
Cow Pie Sliders (just what it sounds like..meat. Nothing special)
Octapussy Calamari (we're a big fan of calamari.Nothing special here)
Nutti N Honey Shrimp (not what we expected, but worth a try)

Round 3
Gentleman's Guac (big mistake. no thanks)
Lobster Taquito (this was more of an eggroll.  it's okay)
Sea Bass Skewers (amazing... a must have !)
Chicken N Waffles (its friend wings and criscut fries. what the heck !)

Round 4
Meaty Balls (this tasted pretty nasty)
Mac & Chees daddy (mac deepfried in slider form. cool but yuck)",2011-04-06 05:01:21

The restaurant is huge with plenty of booth seating, 2 massive bars, and hightop seating in the separate bar area. The bar area in the back is actually very nice and seems like it could open to their outdoor patio when the weather is good. It's kind of a wood cabin feel and although it's kitschy it's not really my thing. Both times I've visited they've asked if a high-top table in the bar area would be OK, despite having many open booths and regular tables. Why are you holding out on me if the place isn't packed? How about the real deal seating? 

Service has been pretty decent, albeit a bit slow at times. The drinks haven't gone empty at any point, which is definitely a plus. My husband and I have been ordering from the lighter portion menu. He gets the 8 oz filet and I've tried the chicken breast meal. For the price, these are solid, filling, and not horribly unhealthy options. They both come with red potatoes and a veggie. My steamed broccoli was ice cold when it arrived, although I couldn't complain about the chicken. The waitress was quick to bring me a new side of broccoli. We also order the side tossed salad, which hasn't actually been tossed with dressing either time we've ordered it. OK, so I like my salads tossed. There. I said it. 

There are plenty of televisions and, from what I understand, they show the UFC fights for free, which is a big deal to some.  If you join their email club you'll get a free captain jack dessert on your birthday. I didn't bother since this isn't something I'd be interested in. 

It's close by so I'm sure I'll wind up here every once in a while. But this will be one friend I probably won't call on very often...",2014-07-05 02:43:21

No knights or dragons. Just an inline skating rink on its last legs, a snack bar at least fifteen years out of date and ever-permeating smell of dirty socks and failure.

Somewhere in the Phoenix area there must be a dilapidated old fitness center with a dungeon and a silly-looking man with a goblet screaming ""I SAID MORE WINE!"" instead of any exercise equipment.

Oh, I'm sorry, were you reading this for factual content? 

CSC taints every event held inside of it with an aura of fail and apathy.

That's right. It's Michael Bay in building form.

The ceiling leaks whenever it rains, the A/C is MC Hammer (get it? Broke? Fuck you, I know I'm funny), and the floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned or repaired since it was laid down.

The league fees are so expensive that you keep looking around the building to see where the money went. Do they actually pay the referees? Are the toilets made of gold? 

Well, are they? I'm being serious here, I didn't go in them. I almost did, but this three hundred pound guy with a coffee stain down his shirt stepped out with this feeling of accomplishment on his face and I thought ""hey, I got that empty 7-11 cup in my car...""

It's only a matter of time before Castle Sports will be hosting dog fights and illegal steel cage matches. Which might in fact be a step up for them. 

It's a shame, though. All this potential fun to be had wasted on such a crappy venue. Makes you wish there was somewhere else to go.

The Hostess greeted me in German attire and took me to a large picnic style table.  Picnic style table also means you share with other people.  Luckily, we were seated on a end and the other people at the table were men who could help move the table so I could be seated.  I had to ask the gentlemen at the table to help move the table so I could get out and go to the Ladies room. The LIVE band, dressed in Lierderhosens, was fun and try to get the Guests to participate in singing and contests.  I met a few bandmembers and they were nice gentlemen.  We did try the Micro-brew beers.  I had a Lager, light in color, nice taste.  We split a Bavarian cheeseburger (hamburger and pork) with french fries.  The burger was good and the Brown Mustard on the table was good and went well with the beer.  We think the food prices were a little high. The ambience is the closest to Octoberfest that we've experienced.  Parking is $10:(",2018-01-29 19:59:19

Nice little kick and very tasty. Wasn't as big of a fan of the Rich and Famous roll. My daughter enjoyed her veggie rolls too.

My brother and I shared the  karaage, tuna avocado tartare, beef tongue and the spare ribs.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I liked that it came with salt so that you can put as much as you want on it. The avocado tuna tartare was really yummy and it came with garlic bread but there was not enough tuna in my opinion. The beef tongue was fun because it came raw and you had to cook it on a black rock. It came with garlic oil and a chili paste.

It's close to the bus stop I regularly takes, which makes it super convenient.  A cute joint with very friendly staff.  Open kitchen, open market, grab stuff to go, bakery counter as well as plenty of tables to sit down.  Some of the smaller tables are a bit too close to each other for my taste, but guess it's quite common in Montreal restaurants.  It's almost like eating with your neighbours with 2 inches away from their tables.  

I had the ""speculoo latte"", which I was very excited to see.  After spending one summer in Belgium, Im totally in love with Speculoo and was very surprised to see they offered it.  Well, I was quite disappointed.  It's more a latte with a lot of cinnamon powders on the top, I didn't taste any speculoo at all or no signs of speculoo anywhere.  

I had the very popular Brunch Atlantic, which is a smoked salmon heaven.  The 1/2 bagel with the smoked salmon was perfectly crispy and right amount of cream cheese.  The salmon scramble was great with very fluffy eggs and bits of smoked salmon.  The salmon cake was unnecessary since it wasn't great.  It's very dry and hard.  It's a pretty bad salmon and potato croquette.  Fresh fruit and salad on the side was refreshing and nice.  And even comes with a juice.  For $19, it seems a bit steep, but with the free juice and the quality overall, it's a pretty good deal. Plus the staff was all very friendly which made the experience even more enjoyable.  
Stopped by the bakery to get some of their almond cakes to go.  The matcha almond cake was to die for.  Perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and nice flavour inside.  Definitely try that if you can.  The chocolate cherry muffin was too sweet for my taste and not a lot of cherries inside.  

Overall, a place that I'd return and I think its'a sold place to go for breakfast/brunches.

The brand is excellent and everyone always loves the gifts (at least that's what they say, which is fine because it's not the gift... it's the thought). 
That being said, for me this place seemed to be more about bringing back a taste of old time nostalgia than the chocolates. I loved that when you walk through the door you are offered samples of their little chocolates and a big smile by the staff who is always pleasant and welcoming... Until today. 
I realize it's the holiday season and the place was reasonably busy... but when a concept is built on a 'feel good' experience, I think they just lost sight of the goal when you leave feeling worse. 
I can buy a big box of Godiva chocolates at Dillard's or even something at the mall while Christmas shopping. Myself and others like me took the time and went out of our way to make a special trip to your facility. 
See's is a destination, not a convenience. 
As I was waiting in line yesterday the little elderly lady in front of me was finishing up her purchase and said to her husband, ""I know we spent a lot, but I got something special for us and we also get a little free 'treat' at the register"". 
I was really sad to see the gentleman at the register, in true 'Grinch' fashion, totally ignore her and not offer her the little sample nor a smile. 
I'm on a diet, because I've been eating like it's a holiday all year and Im too fat to fit in my cool clothes. So I wouldn't have accepted a sample either way... but I did have a bill of approximately $700 and Mr Grinch did not offer me a little sample with a smile either. 
So I have to assume he was just not doing it that day. 

See's staff... When it's the little things that separate you from the masses of competition out there, you probably should pay attention to those 'little things'. Breaking that poor elderly lady's heart , even just a little bit, made me very sad and disappointed with you.",2016-12-11 15:17:25

Incidentally, I have some good friends who used to frequent this place who are now boycotting it because Red Bowl has started cheaping-out on everything including their sushi specials.  They are definitely losing some of their loyal customers with some of the changes they have been making. 

Before this, Red Bowl was never my favorite spot, but it was cheap & quick.  The quality was always hit-or-miss, and on this visit, the food was so-so.  My flower chicken was ok (bland but not gross), the brown rice was meh, and the chicken egg roll was downright gross (it tasted like a frozen egg-roll that was not very fresh or warm).

First, there is no direction when you get there. As my first time they should ask if it's your first time so they can tell you what to do and what to expect. Nobody told us anything. 
Second, we were outside on the patio waiting the whole time. Never once did I hear my name called, until I suddenly see my car sitting to the side. I ask and it turns out to have been done for over 10 minutes. They need to make an effort to notify the owner. Some people were waiting inside and they'd never know.

Third, there was still dust inside and they did not throw out trash. Our car is only 4 months old so it wasn't bad inside, and I have a trashcan in the car. The trash was still in it. 
Fourth, the outside wasn't spotless. My side mirrors had water spots which I didn't notice until I was driving, and there was some dirt left on the outside. This wouldn't bother me if I had done the regular express car wash, but when I pay for full service I expect that to be taken care of.

I first discovered this place getting food for my wife and I one night at the Palms.  We ordered the Tom Yum Kai w/chicken.  The noodle soup was fabulous!  The amazing flavor combination of the soup was intense.  One can taste the sour, sweet, tangy and a bit of heat all in one taste.  The flavors are intense.

had to meet a client here.....yes she had kids, so had to keep them busy!

this location was a lot smaller than the one that was by the MGM, but was a good place to meet....especially since they have alcohol!

ordered a pretty pathetic looking pizza, with game card of course!
....looked bad, but the kids scarfed it down, so who am I to judge, right?

for adults, we ordered a salad with ranch....just ok
a philly cheesesteak sandwhich....again, just ok, meat kind of dry

service was good, and we got to let the kiddies run amok in the game area, so that made it nice

Let me start by saying that the service was exceptional! The bartender seemed to be the one taking care of us. I want to see her name was limit or a net or something that sounds like that. Extremely helpful even though she had a lot of tables and a lot going on. Very professional, I knew the menu, and always kept our coffees and our water is filled. The three stars just for the food.

I want to head and started off with a traditional bacon and egg combo. Bacon look like it had been cooked way early in the day and simply reheated on the flat top. Dark and caramelized in color but extremely soggy and cold to the touch. Ordered the eggs over medium and well it's kind of hard to mess up eggs so those are pretty good. Went ahead and chose the biscuit as my side and did a side of gravy. Didn't want to fork out the five dollars for biscuits and gravy. The biscuit has a weird consistency. The outermost layer is flaky and Chris while the inside has a very dense and chewy consistency to it. Not in a good way. Tasted more like flower than buttermilk. Highly disappointed. The gravy, sausage gravy, was well seasoned and very good. Went well with my soggy potatoes. Potatoes are also called. I'm used to country style potatoes being crispy on the outside and nice and cooked on the inside. These were soggy all around.

We also had a pancake combo. Pancake with eggs and potatoes. Same thing here. Can't really screw up the eggs so those were OK. Potatoes, or the same. Soggy. Pancake were slightly disappointing.  One side have been cooked a little too long. So while the majority of the top part was nice and soft and tender, the bottom part had a thicker harder chewier layer. Couldn't really get past that.

But for some reason, this mall has never been able to live up to its potential.  Maybe it's the throngs of wannabe thugs that hang out here or the cheap, crappy clothing stores that make it one of the worst places to shop. The last time I went, one of the clothing stores had one big dressing room for everyone to change in together.  What the hell? 

I know they've tried to class it up by bringing in different stores, and they have to an extent.  But it still attracts the thugs and my god, whatever you do, don't go to the Walmart.  It's the dirtiest, smelliest, most god forsaken place in the mall.  Stay far away. And if you happen to park right outside of it, be prepared to be accosted by a lady selling tamales and another lady selling creepy dolls. And while I can appreciate their entrepreneurial spirit, they're also more than a little pushy and aggressive. And it's also a little disconcerting to have someone follow you to your car wielding a pan of tamales. But trust me, if you park here, it will happen.

It's quite a step up in pretty much every way.

First of all, the staff is super friendly and they all remember me and my coworkers from week-to-week, which is nice when you're away from home a lot. They offer great features that I've actually never encountered at a hotel before, such as boarding pass printing and the ability to text message them with any of your needs, like towels or soap or something. How fun!

The amenities of the hotel are great, too...the pool, the lounge, the restaurant (Sushi Roku)...even the gift shop, where they sell Juicy couture, is pretty cool! When you check in they give you a 20% off coupon for any Juicy couture in the gift shop, which is awesome. In addition, they have a Bliss spa in the hotel, and all of the products in the rooms are Bliss, too!!! For a girl, this is pretty much as exciting as free hotel shampoo can get. I saw a little Bliss travel set in a store recently that had all of the products that I get free in my room selling for $25, so I LOVE that I'm getting 3 sets of these a week...love it!

I think the mod, crazy layout of the rooms, though, is what W's are really known for, and I can attest to the very cool, hip feeling that the rooms just ooze out of every pore, from the tandem bathroom-sink-shower set up to the iPod dock located on the bedside table. I think that, although not a conventional room design...it works, and I like how open it feels without the typical bathroom hallway. I get that it may not be for everyone...it is a little bizarre.

But, I use to enjoy visiting their long 5 or 6 rows of movies that are now squeezed into the former music section. Wow! That was a shocker for me. From what I could tell, the cameras and PS3/ X-Box sections were the main beneficiaries at DVDs expense. 

The other shocker was the prices for most items. In a few exceptions, I found I didn't see many bargains -- that is the prices I've seen advertised online and elsewhere were as good, if not better than Best Buy! Again, WOW. I had always viewed Best Buy as the low price leader, not anymore! Now, even Walmart has gotten into the act. 

So, I was left to wonder if the demise of Circuit City was viewed as an opportunity by Best Buy management to boost prices? If it was, then I believe management may have made a huge miscalculation.. Why buy a HDMI cable and plug for over $35 at Best Buy, when you can shop elsewhere and find it for just $10. Sorry, what am I missing?

They have plenty of beers on tap or in bottles, and offer a full menu worth of food.

It can get a bit loud when they have their DJ's making it difficult to chat with anyone more than one seat down, but during it's quieter hours (before 10 pm) I think it's the perfect place to have a drink and settle in, maybe play a round of darts or pool with the posse.

I'm part of the 25%. I have memories of eating at Jordan's and ordering cheese crisps off of the Kids' Menu, and then promptly engaging in bitter fights with my sister about who got more pieces, invariably ending in one of us throwing ice cubes and/or utensils at the other. Good times. 

However, it isn't a place I take out-of-towners all that often because, frankly, it isn't the best Mexican food around. Or the most authentic, for that matter. (No offense to Jordan's, PHX has some ridiculously tasty comida mexicana.) 

My favorite way to describe why I still go here is the salsa. I remember trying it as a kid thinking it was the spiciest salsa known in western civilization and I was among only a handful of reckless Arizonans that even had the chance or the guts to taste it (I had never had salsa before and, well, those are the sorts of things I thought about when I was four). Needless to say, it's not spicy at all, but going back I feel like an official badass grown-up now that I can heap it on my chips without flinching.

You ask for native Lao spicy they will give it to you, I ask for a step below, and used to have to reassure I like it fiery - but now the sweet older gentleman who delivers has my address memorized and knows me, he also knows the spice level to ask the kitchen for for me. Maybe I'm too sentimental but that really made me smile when he made it clear he knew me and what I liked after my third time calling in three weeks. 

Anyways, I've moved through the menu quite a bit but have been stuck on the beef gang gallie as of late. It is a yellow curry base with a great spice balance, along with carrot, Thai eggplant, green bean, onion, and potato. That combo with the thin slices of tender beef over jasmine rice just hits my taste buds perfectly. I also love the veggie spring rolls with no meat added. So fresh and crunchy and addictive. The warm spring roll wrapper and the cold crunchy veggies inside strike this perfect chord with me. 

And then dessert... Although I am more inclined toward black sticky rice with mango I have really grown to love their sticky rice made with the white glutinous rice, topped with a sprinkling of crushed sesame seed. You get an entire mango half cut for you on top of the rice sweetened with brown sugar.

A lot of the Malaysian Standards... particularly Malay Chinese standards...  I just got back from Singapore 3 months ago, so my comparisons are still pretty accurate, I think.

So... Rendang (Beef), literally curry beef.  Too sweet for my tastes, but a good effort.  Not spicy enough -- I guess they didn't believe that I REALLY ate spicy.

Roti Cennai.  The effort was okay.  Curry was still too sweet, not enough coconut for my tastes.  Consistency was a bit clumpy for me.  The Roti was a bit more like chinese chive pancakes in consistency, rather than the flaky, doughy Roti that we know and love.

Cocunut Rice.  MMMMMMMMM.  :)

Char Kway Teow.  This was good.  Best of the things we got.  Well prepared and flavourful.  Not too oily and fresh consistency to the flat noodles.  Excellent.

When you enter, you're immediately greeted by the smell of cooked meat. Normally the smell of meat is not a pleasant one for me. As in, makes me lose my appetite. So, it's a huge compliment when I say, the smells coming out of the open kitchen are mouthwatering. When one of my dining companions received her short ribs, there were yet more mouthwatering aromas. WTH kind of alchemy is going on in that kitchen make this vegetarian salivate over dead animal? 

No matter, fellow lovers of the plant plate, there's options for you here. For starters, you *must* order the Brussels sprouts (they do come with panchetta, but it can be left off). DIEvine. Seriously. As are the roasted root vegetables. I love when something simple is so delicious.

I normally never eat mac and cheese because it's so two-note (duh), but Beckett's Table makes it so that I finally *get* why people are all gaga over this stuff. It's very subtle, but those mustard seeds take the dish to a whole other level of delish bliss. 

My entree, the oven roasted vegetable tower was probably the least exciting thing I ate last night night, but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated. I'm just not a fan of roasted peppers and onions which comprise about half of the stack. I'll leave this tiny meh at that, because the entire experience blows that away into the ether. 

Next up, dessert. Although thoroughly stuffed at this point, I managed a bite of the sweet potato pie (incredible), the berry cobbler (delightfully tart, balanced with a sweet ice cream) and the piéce de resistance, fig (yes, I said fig) and pecan pie.

I'd be remiss to not mention the cocktail list, which seemed quite creative. It was hard for me to choose, but I had the Az Farmhand, which has Hendricks gin, soda, ginger, lemonade and honey, many of my favorite cocktail ingredients. It did not disappoint. Fabulous selection of wines by the glass, too.

My friend and I spotted this place last weekend, as we were about to pop into Swaddee's for an early dinner -- it's in the same strip mall. It looked brand new and really cute, so we peeked in the window.

I was hesitant at first --  mostly because I'm really suspicious of strip mall manicure shops. I really hate the salons where a bunch of poor middle-aged Vietnamese women are huddled over some snotty girl's nails, wearing face masks, spray-painting on polish and little tacky flowery designs - sorry, but it makes me feel really guilty and slimy, if not exploitative. So, if I ever get a manicure, I generally pay up the whazoo and go to a fancy spa.
My friend dragged me in here, though, and it was a great surprise -- bright, and decorated in this whole pink-black-white 1950's glam decor. They used only OPI nail polish, which I really like, and they had a great selection. They played Frank Sinatra over the loudspeakers. The manicurists were friendly and took their time to do a good job. There were a few oddities -- like what looks like a bar in one side of the room. Also, some of the decorations were a bit odd. But overall, it was a really nice -- what other nail salon has granite countertops for you to put your hands on? Very cool.
One of the women at the front desk said they just opened a few weeks ago and were ""trying to do something a little bit different.""
They definitely succeeded. I don't remember exactly how much my manicure was -- I think 12 or 15 bucks. It was well worth it.",2008-02-03 21:22:03

The decor is very Western and not at all what you'd expect of a dim sum restaurant. Walls adorned with replica paintings of medieval Europe while chandeliers hang from the ceiling really make you feel like you're here for high tea.

The dim sum servers are dressed in (tasteful) French-maid-like attire (this ain't Hooters boys!) and even the China is very European.

You will pay a premium to have dim sum at Casa Imperial but it is worth every penny. In addition to the standard dim sum items you will also find premium/specialty items such as Swallow's Nest Egg Tarts and Dried Scallops (Conpoy) sprinkled Fried Doughnut wrapped in Rice Noodles for example.

The premium you pay is reflected in the ingredients as well as the filling (e.g. more shrimp than wrapper in the dumplings), quality and service.  Dim sum restaurants usually are not conducive to having a conversation that is not publicized because its usually very loud but Casa provides for a relaxing experience, especially if you get put in one of the smaller dining areas.

The hostesses were friendly and beautiful as usual. Our waitress was very cordial and attentive, and our glasses were never empty.

-Spicy Tuna
-Philadelphia
-Crunch (love it!)
-Spider (this or crunch would be my favorite) 
-Spicy Salmon
-Tekka
-Salmon Skin 

-Cajon Albacore sashimi (nice flavor, fresh) 

Everything was delicious all for just $48. Relatively inexpensive for what you get at similar restaurants. We were pretty full and took the remaining couple of rolls to go.

And from the menu down to the seating, everything in the restaurant just exudes ""cool."" But, cool enough or not, I gave it a go and I'm happy I did!

I've been hearing about Fred's Sunday brunch since they opened. With a Bourbon Street brunch menu and live New Orleans jazz, it sounded like a perfect spot to take my Mom who was visiting from out of town. And it was! As we entered, I noticed how the restaurant is bright and open and allows you to look down into Old Town. The decor was cool (of course) with blacks, whites and grays. We sat down in a comfortable window seat booth near the live musician singing and playing jazz on the piano. The staff was immediately friendly and the menu offered us our choice of a variety of options ranging from salads, to brunch to pizza. In honor of Sunday brunch, I went for the Italian's version of huevos rancheros made with their homemade bruschetta and my Mom opted for the Chicken Salad. The iced tea was refreshing and I could have solely focused on the variety bread they brought out and I would have been satisfied.

My meal was good but a little too rich for my appetite. It was flowing with a sauce that resembled marina sauce and it came with a side of potatoes. If you like huevos rancheros and you like Italian food, this would be a good choice. Unfortunately it just wasn't exactly what I was hoping for but still quite delicious and it's not Fred's fault that I ordered something just too rich for my appetite this visit. I ended up having some of my Mom's chicken salad which was light and fresh. The dressing was a little light but it still had a nice taste to it. I really liked it and secretly coveted her decision.

I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Fred's and it's a perfect place to relax and catch up. Next time I return, I'll go the salad route or possibly the Bourbon Street Brunch which sounded amazing.",2010-11-01 06:27:01

This really is a wonderful dive/hole-in-the-wall if you could ever pick one. Mostly below ground and seating for maybe 20-25 at best. The decor also looks pre-restaurant makeover. Hey, if keeping things the way they are is required to keep the prices low then I don't care. The servers are so friendly that you really get a ""where everybody knows your name"" vibe while there. In fact, they seemed to have regulars there, who didn't mind singing Whitney Houston and NKOTB aloud. 

We ordered 2 pounds of wings: one pound was the chef special, the other was a chipotle/maple. OMG, so delicious!  The chef special is a top secret recipe, and so you'll just have to try these - which may be the best I've had. They're the XL-sized wings, which have a nice crisp on the outside. It came with fries, which were fresh-cut, delicious and served with aioli. We also ordered a jerk chicken wrap (half the menu is Jamaican food - the chef is Jamaican) with a side of salad. The chicken was delicious, and coleslaw inside was pretty good - but the bread was so-so and could've used more sauce or even jerk gravy. I still won't allow that to bring down the rating however. We shared a chocolate cake pudding dessert which was also perfect.

The store is easily laid out and always clean. Their selection of merchandise easily dwarfs that of the aging K-Mart on Boulder and Racetrack. Their prices on items are solid as well.

In addition to a good selection of merchandise and a fine store layout, there are some dining options as well. A Pizza Hut Express is up front, and a Starbucks Coffee right next to it. Little things like this really do impact my experience.

As a new shopping center, I have no problem coming here in later hours. It's a very nice area, given its proximity to Downtown Henderson. I honestly wouldn't be uncomfortable coming here at night, they way I would be at the Wal-Mart down the road. 

This store will pretty much take care of all your department store needs - electronics, clothing, supplies, toys, you name it - it's all here.

Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, this high end restaurant is a great place for dinner.  If you're price sensitive, this is not the place for you....don't even bother.  Our reservation was for 6:45 pm and it was jam packed, good thing we called ahead.  We were promptly seated in the main dining room.

After browsing the extensive menu, I decided to order:

Baby Iceberg BLT Wedge - (Bacon, Maytag Blue Cheese, Buttermilk-Chive Dressing), $9
Twin Lobster Tails - Broiled, MKT Price
Truffle Mac 'n Cheese, $6 (for small portion)
Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream

All of the food was excellent.  The Twin Lobster Tails were perfect and came with Butter to dip them in.  They were so good, I used very little Butter.  I enjoyed the broiled flavor on it's own.  The Truffle Mac 'n Cheese was very rich & creamy, amazing.

The BLT Wedge was very good too, but the portion was too large and I had to leave 1/2 of it because I didn't want to be full when my entree came out.

At the urging of my colleagues, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was awesome, but very rich.  I had to split it with everyone because there was no way I could finish it after the big meal.  The hot Godiva Chocolate oozed out of the center of the Cake....and the Vanilla Ice Cream complimented it perfectly.

A library branch with Flying Lotus, Beck, Michelle Shocked, Hooverphonic - I'm impressed. I didn't see much mainstream pop or rap music, and maybe that's the secret, since this branch is not as urban as my prior branch. Perhaps its proximity to Metro Center Mall ensures more teen traffic (and they have a huge teen section upstairs) and thus my alternamom music is more readily available because...well.. they just don't know what's good for them. ;)  The staff is also very friendly at this branch - while the staff at Burton Barr or Acacia were always helpful, it was always with a slight irritation.

The Soft Shell Crab Roll was amazing! Not fishy at all! I think my other half could have eaten a ton of those. The Las Vegas Roll was definitely different than you'd get at most sushi places. It had some sort of green sauce rather than the typical eel sauce. Because I am so use to the average Las Vegas roll, I was a bit taken back at first, but after each bite, I rather enjoyed it! Man I wish I could remember the other roll we had because it too was fantastic!

The second visit was not during happy hour. It was by far, not as busy. We sat at the bar as we usually do and was greated by Sean. This guy should be in comedy! He kept us entertained with his humor which was refreshing since most sushi chefs are so dang serious! On this day we ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Rose Royce Roll. I'm not even go into reviewing the Shrimp Tempura Roll. Don't get me wrong, it was delish! But I have to tell you about the Rose Royce Roll....can you say spicy? No.....spicy does no justice to this roll. Hot? Hmmm....no. Let's see...how about a nice subtle heat that turns into a punch in the throat like sneak attack from highly trained Ninjas! Yep that'll do! This roll was so delicious! Packed with fresh cut habenero, If you are a novice to hot food, you will never get through this roll! This thing had us both sweatin' to the oldies! But we loved it! Sean was gracious enough to let us try some jelly fish. The marinate was very tasty but the texture was like eating soft plastic. Very cartilage-y lol! The service was great! Never had to ask for drink refills since they were on top of that. We will definitely be back here. So far this is our ""sushi place of choice"".",2015-05-10 16:24:56

I had high expectations and when I got to the spot, I thought the concept and ambiance was cool! I could totally hang out here! We ordered our food: two vanilla lattes (one with almond milk), double stacked pancakes and the chorizo burrito. The employees were friendly and they tell us they've been open for two weeks. We sit down and I started looking out the window, picturing myself sitting at the patio (on a nice day) with my vanilla latte and chorizo burrito loving the idea (at this point, I did not receive our coffee or food yet). 

So after ten minutes or so, we get our coffee and food. The vanilla latte seemed a little bland so we asked for a little more vanilla. The chorizo burrito was good, but it was the spiciest burrito I've ever eaten and trust me, I like spicy food. Even the hubs said it was really spicy and he loves spicier food than me. It was so hot, that I could only take two bites. My mouth was on fire and I was moving on to the pancakes. The problem was that my mouth was numb from the spice, that I couldn't even taste the pancakes or the syrup so I can't even tell you if I liked it. We leave...and I was at a lost for words because I have no idea if I like Sip or not. 

Should I give Sip a second date? I noticed they have happy hour and live music on certain days so I'm keeping an open mind to come back to see if there could be something more than a cool concept and ambiance for me. 

Who knows? Maybe I'll fall in love with Sip some day....",2015-12-18 04:07:41

I see that the previous pictures here on Yelp showcase a clean and organized store but that was not the case the evening I visited. The store was packed with children and families so naturally, the kids trashed the store.

I made my way (downtown walkin' fast faces past and I'm home bound dun dun dun dun) over to the noodle aisle and like some of the reviews had mention, a lot of it were Filipino products, not a bad thing just something I'm unfamiliar with so it was difficult finding something I've previously eaten in the past.

My dining companion and I arrived right at 12:00 on a Sunday, and after waiting for the restaurant to open (15 minutes late, I might add), we found a booth inside.

I knew walking in I wanted the Jack'd Up Grilled Cheese, which the menu describes as ""Jack Daniels infused pulled pork with beer braised onions & red pepper, enveloped with white and orange cheddar with Monterey jack on Cobb Fresh pally Thick Sliced Bread."" I also ordered the creamy slaw and chili on the side. My dining companion ordered the Signature Smoked Brisket sandwich, which is ""18 hr 'low & slow' Smoked Angus Brisket. Sliced, chopped & piled on a Cobb Fresh Daily bun.""

So the grilled cheese sandwich was very tasty. It didn't arrive piping hot, though, which was a big disappointment (clearly it had been sitting around as the other food was being prepared). Anyway, it was full of delicious cheese, meat, and peppers, although I found it odd that there wasn't a hint of smokiness in the sandwich. I chalked that up to the overpowering nature of the item's other ingredients.

However, my dining companion's brisket sandwich, which is presented without any sauces or distractions, was also distinctly lacking in a smoke flavor. The meat was very good, to be sure, as it was quite tender and juicy, but there was simply no smokiness at all. It seems that finding actual, authentic Southern BBQ in Toronto is a lost cause.

The creamy slaw was definitely a step above most other slaws of this ilk, but it was the chili that was the big winner here. Packed with chunks of meat and full of delicious spices, I could've eaten this chili all day. A true winner.",2015-08-04 13:54:58

A good muffin is hard to come by, especially a healthy one, but the ones at Le Cagibi are the best I've ever had in my life.

They'll be strawberry chocolate one day or pineapple coconut the next. Not feeling it? Don't worry. They have an all vegetarian menu (they can veganize most things), they offer comfort foods and tasty sandwiches made fresh. They always have a soup of the day.

I've tried almost everything on their menu (I'm a big fan) and would say their burritos are some of the best in the city. They tend to remix it everyday. I once asked to skip the eggs on their breakfast burrito and they added sweet potato (winning!). Their Morning Rumble is pretty amazing as well, and I'm never disappointed in their quesadillas.

Sometimes they host bands (I've never been) which I'm sure can be a good time. They do have a liquor license but you need to eat in order to drink.

The Peking duck is hit and miss. I've had it where it's been amazing and the duck, even sans skin and stuff, was my favorite part of the meal because it was super tender and delicious, and I've also had it where it's been on the dry side, and the crepes/pancakes for wrapping the Peking duck has been on the thicker side. 

A nice thing for this restaurant is that they usually have a few kinds of sweet soup to choose from. We're fans of the black sesame sweet soup, and the tofu flower. 

Do make reservations before coming. They're quite busy.",2016-12-30 20:38:33

He has been doing nails for 40 years he says.  
He buffed and did not polish them.  A bit of an old school approach and he also was very particular about cleaning the cuticle area with a stone to get a good deal with the acrylic.  The nails are very even and symmetrical.  He was very nice about asking which shape I preferred.  

He does take his time and does an excellent job. He is not the nail professional for someone in a rush.

Anyway, I was walking off the calories from a Smashburger I'd had earlier on this particular Saturday, when I came across this new place. 
I cannot say no to boba, so in I went to try them out. The menu is simple enough because I always get the same flavor, Thai tea. So even though my tummy was saying, maybe you should keep walking off the burger first, I couldn't help myself..
So I got the small size, and sat at their cool yellow stools, to sip my drink. 
It was just ok, nothing to rave about, the texture of the bubbles was a bit off. 
So on I kept walking the mall, I needed to get back to the HOME store where I started..to get back to my car. 
Well I got done shopping as soon as I hit the parking lot, BOOM!..a wave of uncontrollable nausea hit me. I had been holding the boba tea down for the last 20 mins and could not hold it in any longer...out it came..all of it, along with some of my smash burger.

We went on a Saturday night and got to hear some really (and I mean really) good jazz renditions of some pop songs old and new. It added great ambiance to very classy looking place. I am not sure if this a weekly thing or not but I'd hope so.
But people don't go to a restaurant for the jazz, so on to the food.
They have a really good Mediterrainian menu and I hae never heard a waiter be so enthusiastic about the food. We decided it was either his first job in a restaurant of this caliber or the food was really that good. We hoped for the latter.

He sold us on a hummus plate, the short ribs and the lamb burger. All of it was out of this world. They were packed with flavor and cooked perfectly. The funny part was there were no less than eight other items our waiter was enthusiastic about. I guess we will have to go back.

While I was with a group and not on a date, I think a found a great new date spot. Terrific food and ambiance at a well reasoned price (it is more upscale but you can get out of there for $12-22 a person).",2014-11-24 13:43:49

N&K gave me issues. BTW the dinner with the extras was mine.  The food was ready in approx10 mins. The Chicken Koftas were huge and very delicious. Two big pieces with salad and bread. The Sea Bass Dinner plus extras came with a full bass (lol) chicken kofta, Chapli ,rice, salad and bread. I got through all the rice and salad, half the bread and half the bass, half the Chapli and all the chicken. I was pleasantly stuffed at this point. Let me speak about Watans Chapli. To sum it up using as few words as possible, delicious.  They ground up the good meat and spiced it up nicely. The Chicken  Kofta was also very delicious.  Spiced nicely and cooked to perfection retaining its moisture. Finally the sea bass. I wrote that it was a full sea bass and truly it is.  I got two full sized filets. I even had to ask the waitress if this was a regular portion and she confirmed it. So much for me thinking I was special. The fish was spiced just right and cooked my standards.

After waiting in said line a half dozen times, I'll given Coca Cafe a solid meh.  I don't get the hype.


THE WAIT:  Seriously, plan for a 40-75 minute wait even if you show up 15 minutes before it opens.  On the plus, they will text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait outside the door.  This would be somewhat okay if it didn't take another 45-70 minutes to get food after being seated.  I'm all for ready-made food, but don't seat someone and then make them wait an hour for a mediocre omelet.  


THE DRINKS: Eh.  I was unimpressed by the chai latte--not spicy enough.  The raspberry soda was pretty good.  The cappuccino tasted burnt.  And, the kicker, the one time I just ordered hot tea, the water was lukewarm and I had to ask for hotter water--and I hate being that person who complains about water temperature.  I'd stick with the Italian sodas.


THE SERVICE: Pretty good, other than the insanely long wait.  Once, we came back after 90 minutes and were like, ""Seriously?!""  And the girl at the door had lost our number and given up our spot 15 minutes before that.  We were seated next, but an apology would have been nice.  Otherwise, the servers were good.


THE FOOD:  Let's start with lunch, which is the meal on the shorter end of the wait.  The California Cobb salad was fine--it was everything you could hope for in a salad.  The spinach and artichoke tart needed something--spice, sour cream, I don't know...but it was pretty bland.

On to breakfast.  The omelets let me down.  Never before in my life had I said, ""I should add more salt to this.""  Never.  When I'm baking, I usually put in much less salt than called for or none at all.  But, man, do their omelets need kick.  Both the avocado and the four cheese required salt and pepper.  Either would have also benefited from cilantro, but that's just my opinion.

Now, the herbed goat cheese French toast is the only menu item I've ordered more than once.  It's excellent.  Is it worth $8 and having to wait a total of 2 hours and 25 minutes?  Nope.  Was the fruit fresh?  No, the blueberries were wrinkled.  I solved that by re-creating the recipe at home.  I do thank Coca for the inspiration, and that's why it was worth two stars.  I won't ever need to wait in line again.


ETC:  The restaurants seats around 40.  The one-stall bathroom is right in the middle of the front room.  This is weird for two reasons.  First, there's usually a short line of people pressed up against the table closest to it.  Do you like people doing standing over you doing the pee dance while you're eating?  Me neither.  Second, you can HEAR people peeing while you're eating at said table.  I actually have terrible hearing, so if I can hear it, others can too.  It's gross.


Overall, I was pretty bummed that it wasn't better.  I kept hoping that at some point it would live up to my expectations, but it never came close.  So long, Coca.",2013-06-20 13:22:15

The Country Club Dr. store in Mesa, AZ is small for the customer base they have. They sell a lot of meals at this store and it gets so busy that their is a line to the door for customers to be served at the single cash register on the counter. The Church's Chicken Corporation should do several things, first realize that they have an almost a cult following of their product and honor that in a way the reflects in their stores, by second; updating their facilities, restrooms, and expanding their dining areas and service counters. That's probably a hard sell, but with the volume of business that is done, certainly taking a leap forward and building stores that are more roomy, modern, cleanly, and have more space for employees to operate in kitchens should become a priority.  I can easily see Church's Chicken become a nation wide franchising operation, as they are not currently operating in my state.

Two complimentary bottles of water were included in the room, and there was also free wi-fi (though I suppose this is covered in the resort fee).The rooms have privacy doors in addition to your room door.  The room was immaculate.  I had a king size bed, living area, kitchenette, strip view and a HUGE bathroom with a shower and jacuzzi hot tub.  This was my favorite part!

The modernness of the interior is pretty cool, they sure managed to squeeze a ton of tables into a tight space! I would actually recommend this place for lunch over dinner. You get a nice soup or salad and much more reasonable prices for your money. The menu selection is also mostly the same during lunch as dinner so you won't be missing out on much. Make sure you get a certificate from restaurant.com before you go here, it'll save you quite a lot.

The first time I went here was for dinner, and good thing I made reservations because this place was crowded up with at least an hour or so wait! The single slice of complimentary naan is not enough for most people so we ordered a serving of garlic naan, and boy was it good! Paired with this was a variety of chutneys that were very tasty. I especially liked the mint chutney. For my entree I had some sort of lamb curry which I did not each much of because I thought the lamb was fairly tough and the curry was really just too strong to eat by itself. My date kindly shared his chicken tikki masala with me which was much easier on my palate and easier to chew. The second time I was here for lunch with fellow yelper Adam R. and this time I just went for the chicken tikki masala to be safe, while my dining partner decided to be ambitious and got some sort of peppery lamb curry. It looked very hot so I didn't touch it for fear of having to run to the bathroom on a quest for water. One thing I miss about lunch here is instead of naan and chutney they give just give you soup or salad. The salad looked decent enough, but being the curious cat that I am I opted for soup. Well this soup I think could've been used for pizza sauce and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. I just spread some on my naan and ate it like that.

Our waiter was perfectly decent and kept water glasses refilled the majority of the time for both visits, and duriing lunch it is pretty empty and we got to sit in the nice sun room instead of crammed into a corner at dinner.

Two hot dog combo: Sonora dog and BBQ dog. 

Sonora was excellent, though mine didn't come with bacon. Baked camp beans piled high on kosher beef with cheese and jalapeños. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and an especially good lobster role fried to perfection. Second was a pulled pork: exactly as it sounds. Pork was a tad dried out, but not big deal. 

The day we went, they were running Super Bowl specials. Seattle special (go hawks) was a seared salmon sandwich. This is the first place we had salmon that was 1. Pacific and 2. Not cooked to oblivion leaving behind gum textured fish swimming in its own oil. Absolutely fantastic. 

Lastly, there was a shake with ground up chocolate covered espresso beans. Best shake I have had. 

Again, go hawks. I could think of a no more annoying fan base than Bostonians drowning on about the ""pah-trah-aits"".",2015-01-26 05:43:10
PCnUAeytwSMa-bIIcglF0Q,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,_iGvLfEsqDwPUxRUAe6tUw,3,3,0,0,"It has been exactly one year from this day that I signed my Chevrolet lease with Findlay Chevrolet. Writing a review on a car dealership is much harder than writing about a hiking trail. In a years time, I have had time to reflect on my experiences with Findlay Chevrolet. 

Service: 

  In the final months of my Saturn lease, Findlay Chevrolet was the authorized dealership performing Saturn service. Findlay Chevrolet shares some of the greatness of the Saturn dealerships. The lobby is a place where you could go on the computer while drinking a fountain beverage or coffee. Car washes are standard with service. There were other advantages of coming to Findlay Chevrolet for service. For oil changes, Findlay Chevrolet provides customers with a beeper that goes off when the vehicle is ready. And for all day repairs, Findlay Chevrolet provides a shuttle service. In general, the employees are professional and friendly.

Leasing or buying a Chevrolet:

     Being a loyal Saturn leasee, leasing a car from the defunct Saturn's sister division Chevrolet from the dealership that serviced my vehicle seemed the way to go. In hindsight, I slightly kick myself for not shopping around. I will get to that soon. 

   Until you actually finance the car, the Findlay Chevrolet experience is top notch. There are no swarm of car salesmen circling you like vultures. This allows people to contemplate the decision they are going to make.

  The salesmen I dealt with: Nicholas and John were personable and did not pressure me. A day later,  when I wanted to exchange my vehicle for a model that actually accelerates (when test driving a car I recommend going on Rainbow Boulevard instead of an open stretch of the 215), John put me in the better car. No consequences. Kudos to great salesmen.

   This is the part of the review, that I write why I should of looked around. For all the kudos I give Findlay Chevrolet on customer service and an attractive dealership, I give dimerits on their pricing (financing) To put it bluntly, I feel that I was grossly overcharged. I am leasing a Cruze LT, a vehicle that is approximately $19,500. A 39 month lease including the maintenance package costed me $2,000 in cash at $299 per month (not funny). My last lease was a Saturn Aura, an upgrade car; same exact lease. It costed me $1,000 down and $257 a month. And my first lease was a Saturn Ion, similar to the Cruze. It costed me $1,000 down, and $207 a month. Something is very wrong with the picture. After filling out my survey, the customer service rep read that I rated the pricing poorly. She said that she does not want me to think  they did this to me and that the manager would call me back. Exactly a year later, I never got the call. The silence is deafening.

  If I were to do it all over again, I would of spent the time to look around. Maybe a different car manufacturer. At this moment, I have the maintenance package. Chances are that I will rate service experiences at Findlay Chevrolet with references to this review.",2012-06-14 04:52:18

Akron is small and great and only a few gates, which means, if you get stuck... you get stuck.  There is no REAL places to eat, get gas for your rental, etc. 

Cleveland is a grown up version of Akron... I don't mind the hustle and bustle of this airport.  Its not Denver, or Dallas, but there are plenty of little places to chose from to eat, shop a little, etc.   

Not so big that security takes for ever, but big enough to never make you feel all alone there.... you have a bus that takes you to the rental cars, taxis waiting for a fare, shuttle buses for hotels... you get my drift.

You pay for what you pick out and put on your tray, but you can't do little portions as you could in the buffet - so do you really want to pay X amount extra for that macaroni 'n cheese?  The new theme of pre-sorted menu items and portions is a loser for me, and I'd wager it will be for many who liked the old format.  Plus it is incredibly confusing as you look at the menu with some items having large price tags like $7-9 but then some having smaller ones like $2 or so because some are add-ons and others are straight up entree portions.  They've gone so far as to have a dedicated explainer working at the front to help you understand it, and offer you a walk-through the restaurant in case you're still confused.  The fact that they anticipated this problem and had to come up with this as a solution is itself a problem.

Drinks for $6, aps for $6-10, bottled beer for $3. When I got there, I discovered it was only 4-5:30. Pretty crappy considering all the restaurants that surround it had 4-7 happy hours with $5 drinks and aps.  Also, the happy hour food options did not match the website.  I did not see Kobe Cap Pastrami Slider, Baked Crab Dip, or Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho as options.  But you can get hummus. For $6.  Yay.

Happy hour drink selections were also very limited but they did have 3 wines by the glass at happy hour prices that were not listed.  After I had a crappy melon mojito, the server informed me that there were secret wine selections.  I got a pretty awesome glass of sparkling wine for $6.  So make sure to ask about those specials. 

Since I went, it looks like they've at least partially updated their website to the right hours.  But the happy hour food selections were still wrong as of today.  This is a big pet peeve of mine.  Why can't restaurants keep their websites accurate?  Is it that much of a chore?  Do they forget that they have websites?

The patrons that were leaving was what really sold us in giving Epicure a chance. The restaurant very much had a classic local feel to the place. It's not pretentious at all and I liked how it felt like a neighborhood favourite... a place that people go to simply relax and enjoy good food.

We were seated quite quickly and the waitress was very friendly. We were told that the burgers were a favourite amongst regulars and that the pastas were good. So with that.. who better to try out their burgers than yours truly, Brian Yee of the burger blog right? =P. So I ordered the California burger with traditional garnish and fries. My friend got the Shrimp Carbonara and we ordered it as a a rush order. And mann they didn't make us wait long. From ordering to getting the food was all about 10 mins or less. We got our drinks, a coke and an icea tea 5 mins into dinner with a basket of bread with cold butter... that might be my only complaint.

So the verdict on the food, the burger wasn't bad at all. It was a pretty solid all around burger. They claim to be made from freshly ground beef everyday, and yes tho I can taste it they did overcook the burger from my standpoint. Cooked it where the outside of the patty might have been a little burnt. But if it wasn't for that, it's a solid burger. And if I'm back, I'm tempted to either try a very traditional cheeseburger to finalize my verdict butttt... the pasta is quite good so I'm caught in the middle, continue reading. My friend's shrimp carbonara was definitely tasty. I mean the sauce was a little watery, so maybe they need to cook the sauce longer so it'll thicken.. but the flavour was definitely there. It was well balanced, not too creamy or anything, just needed to simmer longer to thicken. Shrimp was a little on the low side, but the taste was all there.

Overall, I liked Epicure Cafe and Grill. Seriously, no real complaints here. I liked the atmosphere quite a bit, it's quaint, friendly and a classy place to be in. To be honest, a comfortable spot that I can imagine coming quite frequently if I lived in the neighbourhood. The food wasn't amazing, but it was definitely better than average and at prices like this where it's less or about the same as Jack Astor's, etc.. I would rather come here. I don't necessarily like being in the crowds too much.. my only concern is the extensive menu must be hard to maintain. So I hope it doesn't affect their freshness or anything cause I like Epicure Cafe & Grill.",2011-06-21 20:03:47

However, they have some really good food with apps and nibbles leading the way. Here are a couple of dishes I wanted to highlight (despite the poor lighting).

Pig's Ears
Orecchio Di Maiale is a pile of pig's ears with wild fennel salt. Crispy and a little chewy, this makes for a lovely start. I've had this dish before and thought it good, but it was absolutely stellar the last time I went. I almost ordered a second round.

Beet Salad
With the creamy Ontario buffalo mozzarella, preserved meyer lemon, and aged balsamic, this roasted beet salad made for a suitable dessert substitute. Really lovely melding of flavours and textures and worth every penny (most of it goes toward those dots of balsamic!). I salivate just thinking of this.

While chit-chatting with our server, he mentioned that there will be a bar-only menu coming up in the side-room where their enomatic lives. Given that there is much love for the appetizers and small bites over entrées on Buca's menu, I'm looking forward to checking that out!

LwOuZNmv9p9IJG0gGQD8aw,RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,4,6,2,4,"Yakiniku is Japanese for grilled meat, and is very popular in Japan, Taiwan and N.America.  in Taiwan, where I grew up we simply refer to it as Japanese BBQ.  Although food historians debates if Yakiniku has its origin in Korean cuisine and not Japan, but regardless of its origin, it is still a yummy barbecue treat in my culinary notebook.

It is highly recommended if you enjoy grilling your own bite-sized pieces of beef, pork, chicken, seafood and other cuts of meat that are considered more for connoisseurs (e.g., beef tongue ""Tan"").  And if you are into drinking ice cold beer served in frosty mugs, it is a no brainer.

The beef served here are good cuts and sliced thin (~1/4 inch thick), so after a short time on the grill will taste tender and delicious. Aside from the regular beef, the restaurant also have Kobe beef as an upgrade.  Upgrading to Kobe beef, just means you get beef that have more intramuscular marbling, which means even more tender meat from a former pampered cow that drank beer, gets regular massages, and generally lived a very good life.  

Since it is a DIY barbecue at your table, do expect to leave the restaurant with the pleasant barbecue smell after the meal.  I know they have pretty good ventilation system, so it is not too bad.  Just something to remember, especially if you have a business meeting to attend after your meal.

Price-wise, it is definitely more expensive compared to some other Asian barbecue restaurants in town. But enjoying yakiniku is generally a pricier treat for your mouth and tummy, and you do generally have better quality and cuts of meat.  But they do offer various combinations, which can feed 2-3 people of normal appetite, or one Tony T (yeah, that's me!).  Selecting the combo is also a good way to try out all the different cuts of meat, until you know which cuts you prefer and can order it a la carte.

The waitresses here are very friendly and attentive.  I have never had a bad experience dining here, whether in a large party or solo.  The restaurant is usually not super busy when I go, but calling ahead for reservation is still recommended.

If you see Groupon or LivingSocial promotions for Yagyu Yakiniku, do take advantage of it.  Which helps make a meal here more wallet-friendly.  With or without these promotions, a meal at Yagyu Yakiniku is still a fantastic experience.

With the Camelback Light-rail construction all but finished, the City gave her a left-turn lane into the property for Eastbound traffic and the nearby Stargate (have to see it to believe it) for convenient access to diners from other times and dimensions. When the light-rail station arrives, the asshole landlord of this eyesore of a strip mail will no doubt double her rent again, but in the mean time, Jenny's place resides just blocks from home.

Jenny (and her family) make you feel like you're sitting at her kitchen table, as she shares with you from the bounty of her generosity and love as your host. That being said, please do not expect a five-star dining experience. As Eric noted, the service can be a bit slow, but It's excellent food, prepared with the best ingredients.

Among my favorites are the (1) wor wonton soup (normally an appetizer for two), made red with spoonfuls of hot chili sauce, (2) the chicken noodle soup (which has nursed me to health through many stomach bugs and influenzas over the years), (3) the bbq pork ribs, and (4) the shrimp and vermicelli clay pot dish.

As of the writing of this article, her niece had just joined the staff as server and helper. She's a bit green, so cut her a little slack.

The Prime is easily the cleanest and quietest Chinese restaurant you'll ever dine in.

I was in need of a very specific item, a black chunky belt to go with a specific outfit. First off I could not find an associate to ask were I could find accessories let alone a black belt.

I eventually figured that the belts would probably be somewhere around the jewelry or the purses so I made my way over to the jewelry department. Eventually I found the belts in a very small corner by the purses. The organization was horrible and I probably should have just looked elsewhere but I was running out of time and I just need this particular item. So I started looking through the belts and low and behold I found a gem on clearance. This is where the real issue began.

I made my way over to the nearest counter that I found and no one was around. I went to look around the accessory department to see if I could locate an associate. No one to be found. I saw one associate assisting a customer with a purse but I did not want to bug her in the middle of a sale. I figured I would just head to a nearby jewelry counter to make my purchase. I noticed an associate at the Fossil watch counter and I approached her. I asked if I could purchase the belt at her counter and she very rudely tells me that she is with another customer and she will be with me in a minute and that I should just stay put. I did not mind that she was with another customer, I fully understand that but it was the tone in which she said it that was very off putting. Also with so many other counters open at Macy's I did not understand why she could not have suggested that I maybe go to another counter.

I did decide that I did not want to deal with that attitude and took my purchase to another counter. This associate saved the purchase for me. She was very friendly, approachable and lovely. She even scanned an additional percent coupon for me that she did not even have to do. So bottom line here that I learned is that there are certain people at this location of Macy's who do not make a judgment on the purchase you are making who are more than willing to help you and also those who hate their job and cannot wait until you leave. Your experience will vary depending on which associate you are assisted by.",2013-09-23 05:48:03

I got the bbq Mahi tacos. The portion size was huge! The tacos were overflowing with yummy. The avacado side  pasta was creamy and spicy. My taste buds were very satisfied.

It is close to my work, in an ""up and coming"" part of Henderson which is always good to see, and my friend has tried just about everything on the menu and raved about it so I don't know why it took me so long.  Let me tell you what though, I'm sure glad I went!  It's more Vietnamese fusion food so you'll get some authentic dishes but most are delicious combinations of flavor and texture!

Getting directly to the food, I had probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever had there!  It was a pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich with spicy pickles (or cucumbers).  I loved this thing!  The presentation wasn't anything to be excited about as it was falling apart and was impossible to hold but that's because the cheese was so gooey and melty so I'll definitely let that slide!  My friend got the drunk a.f. noodles and those were also pretty good but nothing compared to that sandwich.  

I must say I was pretty annoyed though at the time because although the restaurant was almost empty, it still took 40 minutes to get our food.  I was quite upset because I had to be somewhere at a certain time and this caused me to be late.  I later heard the owner/chef telling another customer that unfortunately it's just him and his wife and everything is from scratch so it tends to get a little slow but you can call your orders in so you don't have to wait so long.  I have always said that I would pay and wait for good food so I was a little less upset when I heard that everything was super fresh.  

The owners seem to really want to make their customers happy and do anything for them which is super great.  I overheard them saying that they will make you custom creations or anything at all really if they have the ingredients in their kitchen.  My friend actually put that to the test which imo is pretty amazing!  It is like Tokyo Diner on Netflix!  

So in summary, although I was a little sour at the wait, I keep thinking about that sandwich and can't wait to go back and try their other food.  It also looks like they have an eating challenge which is definitely up my alley!  Go here though, give it a try, and help this business and it's nice owners thrive!",2017-10-09 23:56:38

I think the corned beef and cabbage sliders are my fav tho especially with the sweet bbq type sauce on top... hard choice but I love those things.  The sweet potato fries are awesome and now my only choice of sides.  The Cloudy Day sandwich is great and the Au Jus is killer.  The beef is good and no fat anywhere on it.   The Beef Stroganoff was like mom used to make it.

The inside of the place has cool deco on all walls and ceiling and lots of dollar bills stapled up too.  Lots of flatpanel tv's around showing sports and funny pics from the web that helps keep any conversation funny.  The place is like a long thin corridor - I haven't been there at night but I would assume with a lot of people it'd be interesting walking through that to the back where the bathrooms are.

The waitresses are always nice and the manager / owner seems to walk around a lot and make sure everything is good and jokes around too... nice guy.

There's already been comments about parking in previous reviews... and I agree - not entirely their fault but there's a big gravel lot a 1/2 block away that has ample parking. It's not really that big of a deal.

The bar itself is decorated with many tables so many customers can be accommodated. The back of the bar has a private area for parties, or just intimate setting.  Sofas and low tables were matched with colorful drapes and pillows for comfort.

We came here to watch the Superbowl this year and the crowd gave the place an exciting feeling.  During that day, they were giving away raffle tickets to win bottles of alcohol.  Luckily, my friend and I won a bottle of wine.  Service was exceptional as the bartender tended to us as soon as she saw us sit down.  I was very happy with her.

A couple of years ago, I gave my boyfriend a surprise birthday party here.  I chose Little Macau for the price of their beverages and because of the private back area they have.  We had a successful night with 30 of friends with us.  There was no charge for using the back room, and we were permitted to bring food from outside in to their establishment.  All we had to pay for were the alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks they served, and that was very reasonable.

I could probably get away with never stepping inside a grocery store again. While there is a small section of produce, it's still fresh produce within a short distance of my house. Plus they have a deli section. Also - there is a lunch counter. I've only ever gotten coffee from the lunch counter, but it's cute (how many other places can you get your prescription, flowers, some blueberries, and warm lasagna?). The store selection and general staff is what knocks a star off of my review - the pharmacy is what keeps the stars there. 

It's also worth noting that the store recently underwent a face lift and was expanded. I feel that the store and staff are still getting used to it - things have been moved around quite a bit. While the store was expanded, I'm not really sure how many things have been added, but it feels like some of the aisles have more room I guess. As usual, there is a decent beer selection (I'm used to smaller stores having Bud and Bud Light as your options, so I'm pleasantly surprised to see Stone IPA, Breckenridge Vanilla Stout, Smutty Nose seasonal, amongst others). Depending on the time you show up, the store seems to either have more than enough check out lanes open or not nearly enough. On a recent stop, I had two items to purchase and spent almost ten minutes in line - there were two lanes open (and I could easily see two employees in a closed lane gossiping) and things got worse when one lane needed a price check. Despite plenty of employees putting items away, the check out girl realized it would take less time for her to physically go check on the price herself than wait for someone. I felt bad for the old guy in front of me who only had a box of donuts. He was pretty annoyed, but they were just Entemann's donuts (nothing special). I'm still not really sure why I didn't ditch my two items and just go to the Walgreen's across the street, with its empty parking lot - perhaps the Drug Mart jingle has subliminal messages and I was mentally unable to leave without handing over some cash.

Now about the pharmacy. The majority of employees are fantastic - especially the pharmacist Jim. They've caught errors that doctors haven't (gee, and I wonder who makes more money?), which could have had some majorly negative consequences for your dear Yelper here. They've also handed me discount cards for prescriptions (even though I have insurance - but it still saves me some money, and I have no complaints about that). I've also had them help me with advice regarding over-the-counter stuff. I like that I can re-fill my medications online, and even set up an auto-refill",2012-06-14 02:12:20

They offer a variety of beef burgers, bean burgers, and chicken. They also have salads and a bunch of different sides. My favs here are the deep fried pickles. Soooo tasty! They also have these flash fried veggies that are great for those of you who may be more calorie conscientious. The burgers are made to order, fresh, and only once you place your order. I like the make your own burger which allows you to pick your bun, sauces, and toppings. They offer 3 different sizes. A small is enough for me. The burgers are juicy and flavorful. Oh yum! The home made milk shakes are yummy. Big and creamy. What makes this place different than your average burger joint is that it also serves beer. You can't get that at McDonalds!

I'm only docking this place a star because of the little gift shop with kid height toys on your way through the line.

So, on to the long short of it...

This place is cute and (dare I say) whimsical in décor but sexy at the same time.   Weird.  Anyway, the menu is 100% comfort food.   They indeed fry and throw cheese on items here without hesitation.   Here's what I tried enough of to review:

Bacon Wrapped Bacon and Egg - 3 perfect little bites great balance of flavor.

Inside out French Onion Grilled Cheese - Ooie Gooie cheesy deliciousness combining by 2 favorite things onions and cheese!

Bucket of Crispy Fried Game Hen - Ok, here is the reason for my one star.  This was the greasiest, flattest chicken that I have ever tasted.   It was, in one word, awful.  It is accompanied by a massive clump of shaved celery and carrots on top of the basket...wtf do I do with those?!? I'm eating with my hands here.  It comes in a diner style wire basket and you get no plate which was only slightly annoying after I tasted the thing.  I absolutely regret getting this.

Johnny's Big Dry Aged Burger - This was delicious and as an onion lover, I completely appreciated the added flavor of the Balsamic onions in each bite.  But, its a burger...so yah.

Mahalo Matcha Panna Cotta - Matcha Panna Cotta good...pineapples ok, but the addition of the passion fruit sorbet was just weird.  I don't feel like this combination worked well together at all.  A bite of all 3 at once, let my mouth very confused.  The hunks of macadamia nut tuile...just made things worse.

Peach Cobbler - I'm not sure if this was good or my dessert was so bad, I was happy to taste something that at least worked as one harmonious dish.

Supporting my decision for 1 star, plain and simple is the fact that this place is WAY...WAY overpriced.   I feel like I'm paying for the Moonen name...which is fine, but when this isn't paired with Moonen quality.  I find myself full of regret that I ever stepped foot in this place.  If you insist on trying... get some small bites and some cocktails.  Save yourself the money and the frustration.

Based on the continuous long lines in front of the restaurant, I am clearly in the minority.  Don't get me wrong, the breakfast is tasty, the menu is extensive and the prices are reasonable but it just doesn't knock it out of the ballpark for me.

I always opt for the two eggs, meat, potatoes and toast breakfast, and I'm always ecstatic when a restaurant has a turkey sausage or turkey bacon option which they do.    Where I think they fall short is their breakfast potatoes.   They aren't crispy or flavorful enough.  Since this two egg meal choice is my breakfast staple, I can't help but compare it to the Kelly O's and Pamela's equivalent and it just doesn't compare. 

My husband likes that they have more options on the menu here (country fried chicken and biscuits, biscuits and gravy, etc.). They also have a ton of breakfasts that seem more like desserts (think waffle sundae).   It's certainly a local Strip destination that should be investigated, it's just not my spot of choice.

Mixed greens comes with prosciutto, pine nuts and a cider vinaigrette. This is not ideal for sharing, but the portion is good for one so that is ok.

We tried a few of the wood fired pizzas. They were all tasty. The crust had good texture and flavor. The sauce was tasty and the toppings were solid. These are great for sharing.

All their dim sum are delicately made and presented. Almost all of them have a unique twist to it, so it is slightly different from the regular dishes that you can get at any traditional Chinese restaurant. For example, the rice roll with fried dough inside, they added stuffings to it instead of just rolling up the fried dough with the steam rice paper. The beef ball also taste very good, more tradition, but they garnish with mushroom. I also like their friend shanghai rice cake a lot.  What I like is their food is not as greasy overall and less filled with MSG.

They change part of their menu once in a while...good and bad. If you come here very often, you won't get tired of the items because they will add new items. But, if you do really like certain items and they took it of the list, that can be very disappointing and frustrating.  I like their stuffed eggplant, but they no longer make it anymore...I was quite sad for a while.

Their services are excellent too. I guess its because they are located in a hotel, and more of a Chinese Fine Dine place. If you drive, they will validate your parking ticket, just remember to give it to them when you pay for your bill.  If you pay by cash, they will also give you discount vouchers for your next visit, which is equivalent to 10% of your bill that day. So,it's like 10% off next visit.",2011-11-09 04:07:04

We called them months in advance to make sure that our two rooms were adjoining. We called the hotel on the day of check in to confirm our reservations and they told us that we didn't have any! After a 2 minute mini-heart attack and a transfer to someone else our reservation was found. We also confirmed again that our rooms would be adjoining. Flash-forward. We get to Vegas and check in. Our rooms were not adjoining. The closest that we could get was across the hall from each other, which worked out okay for us. 

The hall carpet desperately needed replaced. It was bunched up in the hallways and was not easy to walk on with heels. The hotel room itself was okay. The TV was turned on once and we could not get it turned off. We tried using the remote and the power button and that sucker was on for good....We had to unplug the TV to eventually get it off. The only other complaint would be the toilet seat. At first we thought it was dirty but turns out it was just yellow stains... ALL over the seat. It was kind of gross.

I think these may have been the best fajitas I've ever had. That is kind of weird. I don't have fajitas that often because they're kind of labor intensive. Also, they're not really that Mexican-y and kind of safe. Who wants to do all that construction for a stir fry taco?

I had to eat my words which was hard because I was also full from eating those scrumptious fajitas. The ingredients were fresh, starting with chicken, peppers and onions. Making a great meal with fresh ingredients is almost idiot proof. The meat and vegetable were seasoned with something different I can't quite figure, maybe a marinade?, but it wasn't the usual cumin and salt overdose. My dining companion ordered fish tacos and I'm sure I could have eaten those as well.

The restaurant has a chic ambiance and is large. However, the hardwood floors and wooden interior give it a friendly and intimate vibe. So despite the size of the dining area, it's not faceless.

Cantina 1511 isn't striving for the ""authenticity"" of an ordinary Mexican joint and that's a good thing. You won't find the standard numbered menu items, 1 taco, 2 enchiladas or plates swimming in enough cheese, sauce and oil to put you to sleep on the drive home.

We had the lentil soup -- very bright flavors, with a lemony tang and poppy seeds(?!?!); aloo gobi -- very mushy cauliflower was not a hit with my cauliflower loving kid, unfortunately; butter chicken -- great curry flavor that was a bit sweet, lamb saag -- fairly tender lamb meat, but I still got out a knife to cut it; raita and of course, the basmati was fine and the naan bread was fresh.  Everything came hot and piping within 40 minutes of ordering and I appreciated that tremendously.  Overall, if I need another Indian food fix, I'd order again from here.

Thanks to my Iphone's hint, I realized I was just minutes away from Bueno Burger which one of my friends keeps on mentioning.

I thought the look of the place was nice. They only have this one location which is surprising but the decor is unique going for a little of the Chipotle look. I was greeted kindly and asked for a suggestion having never been there. 
Ordered the Arizona Style burger ,$5.95, (green chili beef, roasted green chilis, lettuce and sour cream) and added guacamole,tomatoes and cheddar cheese to give it a little extra something.

I'm pretty bland when it comes to anything spicy and was a bit worried about the kick but it wasn't ""too bad"". Too bad meaning I didn't sweat from it but it was hot enough to give me hiccups. Still even though it got a little messy because of the sour cream and guacamole I thought the concept and quality was very good.

Most Red Rock hikes (except for aptly named IceBox Canyon) are best left to early starts or cooler weather. The heat and elevation gains can cause issues even if you are prepared. There is NO CELL PHONE RECEPTION (AT&T did not pop up again till Visitor's Center) 

Spent a few hours exploring this beautiful trail with my hiking buddy, Daniel S. He has such an appreciation for geology, wildlife and nature that we have excellent adventures together. We saw families and several dogs along the journey, just make sure to bring FRESH water for your furry family members: one AssHat was letting their dog drink from the green, algae filled Springs. Ummm, no! 

Anywho, starts with an elevation climb on a mildly rocky terrain. The only time we had to use our hands for position was at the Springs to sit and take in the beauty of the scenery, plant life and surrounding mountains while listening to the music of the running water. There a several trees you take shade under, relax, grab a snack and rehydrate before going back downhill. This day there were no burros or bighorn sheep in sight, though they are known to frequent the area. We did see a blue bird, an elusive yellow bird and tiny Florida sized newt like lizards. 

The colors and shapes of the rock formations are stunning. Daniel really liked a Piggy Bank rock atop a mountain; and we spent a bit debating which order the Beatles would be in on a spot we declared perfect for a ""Fab Four Mt Rushmore.""

There were some desert wildflowers and cactus in bloom and a variety of trees, grass and shrubs to peruse. The hike downhill is pretty quick and not at all steep.  

We are truly lucky to have RRCNCA in our backyard and La Madre Springs is a nice hike to get away from the grind and let your mind relax. Especially as it is warmer now, just make sure to bring fluids (I went through a gallon: 3L w electrolytes & added a Renu to one of my 2L of Smart Water) sunscreen & a hat are a must and there are ample spots to grab shade or take in your surroundings. 

Definitely good times. Looking forward to our next adventure :))

This store has the cooks calling out the orders - a la Startbucks - but there was no real enthusiasm in their voices. It really seemed that they were mouthing the words because they were getting paid minimum wage to do so.

Burgers - The burgers are cooked fresh; but, they are, for the most part, tasteless. I'd cut them some slack if they were dishing out burgers for $2; but at $7 to $10, I expect a lot more. All burgers are cook to well done and the toppings were bland. I tried the mushroom / swiss burger. The mushrooms tasted steamed and no sauted as I'd expect.

We were then served our courses.  I had chose the veal cheeks which were cooked in a thai spiced bouillon with couscous... the meat melted in my mouth.

After our dessert we were spoiled with their candy cart which was filled with all types of goodies from truffles to caramels to marshmallows and cream puffs... yum.  We were also celebrating a birthday and they brought out the best birthday cake ever that was kind of an ice cream passionfruit light flavor that was amazing.

The service has always been good and we've never had an issue. We love the sandwiches and the wraps - my fave is the jalapeno steak wrap, although lately it seems that they've had too much wrap and not enough steak. But it IS real steak, not Steak-ums. That isn't always the case at other places.

But you can't go wrong - the Lot 17 salad is killer good. And the Jerk Chicken sandwich with the grilled pineapple is my wife's favorite. Not to mention the amazing sweet potato fries and the crack-like brown sugar butter dipping sauce.

Since Ocean Prime was right next door and didn't look quite as busy, we decided to stop in there instead. This place has a very upscale ambiance and I immediately thought it was going to be a pricey night and I was right. We went to the lovely bar to seat and I ordered some sort of berry martini, it had a fruit ice ball in the center and it came with enough for 2 drinks so it was worth the $14 price tag. My boyfriend ordered a dirty martini and that also came with enough for 2. We had the best time at Ocean Prime, there was live music and they were singing some of the old jams. When they started singing ""doin the butt"" I ran on the dance floor and danced my butt off. This is the kind of place where you can leave your purse unattended which I did to go dance. I decided to try something to eat so I ordered the ahi tuna tartare with avocado. It came out and looked so pretty I felt like I shouldn't wat it. But I did. Hahaha It was delicious. It wasn't like tuna tartare I've had in the past though, this kinda tasted like tuna sushi. When our friend arrived we decided to try some wine. We both had a glass of Moscato which was absolutely delicious and sweet, almost like a Reisling. Oh it was VERY tasty and I do recommend it.

They have new additions, including a great grilled octopus appetizer that is tender. After several visits, I think there are three things in particular that are noteworthy:

1. The portion size is generous. Every single dish that hits the table has more food than you would expect at a nice restaurant on The Strip. 
2. The Server Assistants are the best around. I know it is odd to note the SAs and not the actual waiters, but that is how good they are. Water never runs low. Dirty dishes are never left uncleared. And, they are eager to help you when the waiter is away. 
3. Local perks! If you're a local, you get a free dessert, and I couldn't pass it up last night. We went with the apple option, and it was worth the sugar splurge.

When I got home I opened up the containers and our biscuits looked amazing!!! I got the pimento cheese chicken biscuit and man oh man the cheese was so creamy! It was perfection! My fiancé had the biscuit with goat cheese and pepper jelly which he was very pleased with as well. I enjoyed tots and he got grits as the side item. We will def return again but it is a little pricey for biscuits. 

I'll also note that they have some tough competition with RISE biscuits so close by. I'm from the Raleigh area and I adore RISE so I think H&D has big shoes to fill! I think I would have enjoyed my biscuit from here if it was a little softer, just a tad too crunchy for me!",2018-04-14 04:42:44

$15.95 for for a tiny salad, that USED TO BE so big, for half the price they charge now...today their salad fills a small bowl.

I sent the chicken, avocado, mango salad back, you cut tiny tomatoes in half??? There were 3 halves.

 I could barely see any ingredients...mixed with that nasty garden greens that cost 99 cents a bag in the store.

I then order another salad that said fresh beets but they were canned, with a tablespoon of goat cheese, pithy tomato chunks, 4 in all, brown lettuce and two pecans.  THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT IT IS ALL THE  SALAD DISHES.

The place was packed.  It is irritating because I hate crowds and I hate waiting.  Pleasing because a crowd like that means this place is doing something right.  Need I say more?  Yes, if I am any sort of worthy Elite ;)

I stood in line for a few minutes to place a take-out order.  I settled upon the Mezze Plate which is Spanikopita (spinach pastry), Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), Falafel (fried chick pea fritters), tzatziki (cucumber and yoghurt sauce), and hummus (pureed chick pea dip).  This plate also came with a small Greek salad and some pieces of pita bread.  Its kind of a great way to sample a lot of good stuff.

The spanikopita was great.  Super flakey and packed with spinach, one of my personal favorite greens.  The dolmades were good.  They are stuffed with an herbed rice. These appeared to have a ruddy tinge presumably from the herbs and oil used.  Different that what I am used but they were very tastey and I would happily order them again.  The tzatziki sauce was fresh tasting and delicious on both the pita and falafel.  Speaking of falafel, this was probably the best I've had.  It was well seasoned and not at all dry like other examples I've had.  The hummus was good and strong with the taste of garlic and oil.  It made me wish there was more pita to dip in it.  Perhaps my least favorite part of this meal was the Greek salad.  The olives, complete with pits, were great as was the dressing.  But this salad had a particularly strong red onion sliced up in it and the entire salad ended up tasting of onion.  Kind of a turn off for me.  I am picky when it comes to onions and this fell outside of my preferred dose of the root.

Waiting the 15 or so minutes for my food ended up being a sort of treat in itself.  It gave me the opportunity to notice how clean the restaurant was even though every table was being used by some couple, small group or family.  I also took notice of the Greek music playing softly over head.  In those days immediately prior to Christmas, I was feeling overrun by Christmas music.  This was a welcome departure to the seasonal norm even if I understood no words being sung in this ancient language.  I was also able to observe the hard and constant work of this Greek family taking care of who would become extended family simply by walking through the doors.

It's located in a great little area, lots of competition though, maybe why it wasn't very busy. Great look, rustic, clean, not too dark, friendly.

They could have stood to have been a bit thicker, but perfectly crispy and the sauce they came with is super good! Then we shared the 1/2 Black Truffle Roast Chicken. Amazing! All entrees come with one sauce and two sides. We are dippers so we up graded to 4 sauces (peach BBQ, true jerk, honey truffle, and jalapeno cheese). The peach BBQ was my fave to go with the chicken! Then we got the quinoa as one side, and the potato bar for our second size. with t he potato bar you get whipped mashed potatoes and then you pick three mix ins, we chose bacon (again, duh!), horseradish and chives. So good. We even had to get a separate order to take home for one of the girls man friend who was at home. 

All the food was delish!!

They even have wine on draft. Awesome concept. Due to the way it is set up the wine stays really well so you can open a $100 bottle and if it sat there for months it would still be good.

Since my fiance and I have never tried any Cambodian food, we thought we'd try a good variety:
Jasmine Tea (hot): Good tea, very floral and aromatic
Spring Roll: It was HUGE and similar to Vietnamese spring rolls. Order 1 and you'll have enough to split with someone else.
Pleah Beef Salad: Never thought I'd ever eat or like beef in a salad but it wad a wonderfully clean and refreshing taste.
Loat Cha: I've never seen this type of noodle! It was serves with egg and beef and one of my favorite dishes of the evening.
Noumpang Pate (Pork and Pate Sandwich): Good sandwich and nice bread for $3...similar to those Vietnamese sandwiches.
Banana Tapioca Pudding: This was a banana with a texture similar to a plantain, that was submerged in a hot bowl of tapioca and coconut milk. Very simple and enjoyable, and a 3$ for 2 people, I can't complain. It's a great dessert to finish the meal off.

So, all-in-all, we got out of there with 3 entrees, an appetizer and dessert for under $30...WOW!

If you couldn't figure it out by now, Sekong has gained two new repeat customers :)

FYI: this place is difficult to find if you are driving west on Indian School Rd and you won't realize you passed it until you see the 99 cent store.

One thing I really like is that you can always count on the food being fresh, they don't have 20 bags of the same thing which means that the product your buying hasn't been sitting.  Occasionally it means that they won't have your food in stock, but if you plan ahead they'll have a fresh bag for you within a week depending on when you go in. We were there on Saturday and they only had a small bag of the puppy food we needed, but like clockwork they called today and had it ready for me when I arrived.

Sadly I really wanted to like this place, because I've been looking for a decent local juice bar...and I apparently still have yet to find a good one! I decided to order 2 juices. but couldn't find one that screamed ginger (I love ginger), so I asked the girl behind the counter what she would recommend and she mentioned that they can add ginger to any of the drinks. I decided to get the Pucker Up! and Berry Me Alive, both with ginger. I was hoping to get a small to try, but the size didn't seem worth it for $4.50 plus extra for ginger, so I got both in a medium size. 

The Pucker Up did make my lips pucker but not in a good way. It was bland and sour and I could feel my stomach acids churning. The Berry Me Alive tasted like a cup of frozen berries. Yes, I know frozen fruits are practical in such places, but I've never had berries that tasted so lack-luster. Also, I don't know how much ginger I get for 50 cents, but it wasn't enough because I couldn't even taste it.

For 2 medium drinks plus ginger, the total can to about $13. So not worth it! Don't plan to ever waste my money here. I'll just drive to Thrive in Gilbert for now.",2011-10-22 20:44:54

The food is excellent, and I appreciate how many vegetarian/vegan options they have, even being an omnivore (sometimes I just like it light, okay?).  I like that they have small and large sizes, and the lunch menu is very affordable with good portions.  You can just tell they really care about their food, and that to me, above anything else, is so important.  When I come here, I feel like what I ordered was made just for me, with care, and with pride.

The other great thing about this place is their flexibility on spiciness. Word of caution: I LOVE spicy food, so one time, like a badass, I ordered something ""Thai hot,"" or ""5/5"", or whatever it's called. Emphasize: once.  Thank god I got it to go, because I cried like a little b**** three bites in.  To be fair, the person on the phone was like, ""Are you sure?""  Hey, fair warning's fair warning.  I ate every bite because I ordered it, and that's how I was raised, cuz there wasn't nothin' in it I didn't ask for. I was just grateful to shed my tears in the privacy of my home.

To the point- Delicious, great place for a date night, but also awesome for a nice lunch or some quick, quality take-out.  Just maybe try the 3 or 4/5 level of spiciness before you go all-in.  The one thing I will say: Malee's Thai Bistro is 5/5, hands down.",2016-12-13 13:04:58

I heard about Samba years back and since then have had several recommendations from friends that it was a place I had to go to.  I wish I had listened to them sooner because this place could arguably be the best restaurant I've ever been to in my life (and I've been to far too many).

We called in to make reservations on Saturday night, but unfortunately found out that they were booked up until an hour later than we originally planned.  That gives you an indicator of its popularity on weekends, but it was well worth the wait.  When you walk in, you're greeted by the Cabana Room, which I'd also recommend although more for the casual bar night where you want to relax with a few friends in upscale atmosphere.

You'll then proceed up to the second level where they provide a free coat check service and seat you in their nice restaurant.  The environment will surely put you in the mood as you take in the aroma of grilled meats, the reddish-yellow candlelight, and the closed-off curtains on the windows.  Your server then gives you a wooden hourglass with a red indicator on one end and a green indicator on the other.  Basically, flip it green-side up and you're advertising that you're hungry, red-side up means you need a break (my group thought it'd be nice to have a triangle with a third side for I can't breathe because I'm so full).

By the time we got done with all the pleasantries, I was starving (I had only eaten one thing that day) so I was a little disappointed when a guy came by with a giant skewer of top sirloin and only gave each one of our party one small piece of meat.  I soon learned though that there was no way I'd go hungry as they kept bringing out round after round of different meats - 8 total, ranging from chicken, parmesan pork, asian steak, flank steak, ribeye, top sirloin, sausage, and lamb.  And they don't bring each one out just once, they KEEP bringing them for as long as the place is open.  I'm normally not a huge fan of all-you-can-eats, but this is the most delicious meat I have ever had and I can only imagine what the real-deal is like in Brazil.  All four of the people in my party were extremely satisfied and easily thought that we got our money's worth.  Even girls that were with me that normally wouldn't eat a lot were chowing down as you just couldn't say no to this food.

But wait, it gets better.  They have an incredible salad bar and hot food line as well.  Often, we'd turn our hourglass over to red to take a break, but then march over to the bar where they had more choices than I've ever seen at any other one before.   There were at least 2-3 types of potato salad, plenty of leafy greens, nuts, berries, exotic choices like maracan almonds, etc etc.  The hot food line had delicious mashed potatoes, cuban black beans, and a tasty broth.  Honestly, it's a shame that these sides and salads are at Samba because anywhere else they'd probably suffice for an excellent meal on their own.  Regardless, you will end up trying some if you can fit it in between the rush of meats.

Lastly, there's entertainment involved too.  The servers bring all the beef over on giant skewers that look just like what greek gyro places use for cooking up their daily loads and you have to use a grabber device to take your meat to your plate as they slice down with a knife.  Make sure to have a good grip though; I didn't see one of the guys cutting mine in time and got a little splash on my dress shirt.  Thankfully, this place is pro, so they came out with club soda and a portable stick of oxy clean to help get the stains out.  Your servers will also be dressed in comical costumes; usually a park ranger hat with khaki oufits and funny-looking pants.  Towards the end of the night, we witnessed some people roll/fall down the stairs from the third floor (they got up and were laughing so nobody was hurt) which definitely capped the night off.

Overall, I can't do this place justice with some words in a paragraph box.  Samba is SO GOOD, and if you can put aside your quibbles in regards to the cost, you will surely not be disappointed in the least.  Budget well, $45-60 a person (you'll probably want drinks, etc), and have a good time.",2009-12-21 17:46:23

2.5 stars and I am being generous.

After spending my days and evenings at the gorgeous Encore, I decided to venture OUTSIDE of the hotel/casino (big mistake) and enter TI.

TI seems so outdated from the ragged carpet, dull colors, and the unhip zombies at the slot machines. Not sure what happened here, but I thought TI used to be cool once upon a time.

Alas, came their Deli.

Ordered the turkey sandwich on wheat with a custard. Meat was dry and bread was not fresh. They did carry a sweet hot mustard which was great with the Reuben or corned beef, but not on my poor turkey. The potato side salad tasted like ass. Something you could buy at Safeway during your college days and pretended you made it. Yeah, you know what I mean.

The deli's ambiance was ok (minus the obese lady in front of me with huge breastesses staring at my custard). It looked clean and minimal with a touch of diner-esque.

The custard was not spectacular either. I was bummed. I was rooting for a TI comeback but noooooooooo . . . it also failed in the food department.

I wouldn't recommend this place. It wasn't awful, it was merely bearable.

For years now we have always rotated our stays from the different Caesars properties whoever can give us the best offers at the time. Now that we've moved back in town we still from time to time check in just to have a mini getaway with the kids. We now gravitate to Flamingo as the kids enjoy their pools. We had family coming in from California so we decided to get ourselves a room as well and stay for 3 days.

Check in was easy enough and thankfully wasn't a circus show partly because Platinum members have a different registration area. We were given the GO rooms on the 25th floor so no complaints there. If you must stay at the Flamingo make sure you request the GO rooms as they are newer and have modern and upgraded fixtures. The bathroom has a separate shower and tub and the mirror has a tv built into it. The bed was really comfortable and clean. The rooms come with a coffee maker as well as a mini fridge. They also have a docking station you can use to play music, our remote for that though was missing batteries and the backing, I had called housekeeping to inform them of the situation and to request a replacement. They never brought it but it wasn't that big of a deal as we weren't planning on staying in the room much anyway but it's the principle of it. Wifi has improved greatly, the kids were actually able to use their ipad with no issues. On the 25th floor we had a great view of the Strip and the Bellagio water show.

The casino offers a variety of food option but none stands out, they have a newly opened food court that has Johnny Rockets, Bonnano's NY pizza, a sandwich place and a Chinese place similar to Panda. They also have a little coffee area that you can grab a quick bite before you head down to the pool. Make sure you also check out the Flamingos and Koi's they have in the garden.

Minor complaints are the elevators air conditioner weren't working and it was warm! Also that the kids pool area with the slides closes early at 4:30 and the other family pool at 5:00 it's strange to me that they would close so early in the summer time. Before checking out, I had to call Front desk services as I noticed an error on my bill, we were charged an extra $9.99 for web services when supposedly that is part of your resort fee.

I actually don't mind the seating - I don't think the store owners really intend for the restaurant to be a place where you hang out indefinitely with your friends.  Could it be that?  Sure.  But by depriving you of proper seating options (which, btw, I can't say has ever bothered me... my husband and I hang out in there with no problems whatsoever) they make you focus on what's important, and that is how freaking delicious their offerings are.  My husband and I talk until we get the waffles, and then there's just silent munching and mooning over the waffles until they are all gone.  And then we start talking again, usually about how awesome the waffles are and how glad we are that there's a place like this in Squirrel Hill.

Parking: it was disorganized, no signs letting you know where to go, and no matter which lot you park at, you still have to walk pretty far. After the show I saw many people having a hard time catching a taxi.
 
Seats: I was in the 200 section and in the center, which was a good view, full view and very close to the stage and screens. I think that anything past 200 section in the 300's and up, it will be a horrible seat, it's not like the ACC where even up in 400 the view and sound is still good) Past 300 some seats are not covered and of course the lawn is not covered and first come first served. I would not know what will happen if it rains, that would be a huge bummer. I don't know how they can see those small screens or anything back there and if the sound quality is any good.

The only thing that I could possibly complain about was how hot my meal was. Having come fresh out of the fryer, the gigantic boite of fries and one and two halves of fish fillets were piping hot.

The batter on the fish had the light flavouring of tempura, but stayed held together as once piece like a crispy fillet bodysuit. I was most delighted with the simplicity of the seasoning. Nothing more than a healthy sprinkle of salt was needed to naturally enhance the flavour and quality of the fish.

I wasn't too impressed with the tartar sauce though. It was more like mayo with some green flakes in it. In fact, I suspect that it was not actually tartar sauce at all, but garlic mayo that was mistakenly served to me. Also, I find Cash Only to be quite the inconvenience. The dude behind the counter didn't seem to mind tossing my order into the fryer while I went down the street to use the ATM though. Warning: If you are not with CIBC, be prepared with cash or be prepared to slap an extra $1.50 onto your meal total. Lastly, they didn't sell any non-carbonated beverages other than water. Where's the iced tea?

Judging from the limited number of seats (which is not conducive for dining in) and proximity to both 7-11 (which has a much wider selection of beverages) and Trinity Bellwoods (can you say al fresco?), I think that the solution is clear:

If you have never read my reviews there are a few things you should know....

First... I am a tough critic

Food is a preference and I can only review on my tastes

And finally... I DETEST paying good money for bad food or services!

Now that we got that out of the way I can continue my review.

I work for a big company that has food trucks most days... I have seen this ROCKSTAR HOT DOGS before at my company but never gave it a try, simply because nobody talks about it .

Being from Chicago I have had my share of a true "" Chicago dog"" and one of the top two important things are of course the pure beef hot dog and the STEAMED poppyseed bun.

I chose today to give it a try.... Boy do I wish I hadent made that choice!

I tried to play it safe an get a basic hot dog on seeded bun and crinkle cut fries.

The price was $8.00 which I keep kicking myself for paying!!

The fries tasted like Roach Coach fries.. Low quality oil that never gets changed... YUK!

The actual hot dog was good however the bun was horrible!

Not soft, not steamed and fell apart the moment I picked it up... Not good!

I had tried to find reviews online prior to trying one but all I could find was their Facebook page :(

I guess nobody has thought enough of them to actually take the time to review it....

UNTIL NOW!

If you see them at an event.... Please save your money and try anything else!!

In closing I remind everyone to take life one day at a time and enjoy!

Being near King and Spadina for most of my week, The Chickery is a common take out I see in my building.  Curious, I went just recently and here are my thoughts:

- If you're a Yelper, you're in luck because you get two free chicken fingers when you buy an entree and check in

- The portion sizes are ginormous! At first, the prices may seem a little high, but when you receive your meal, you're definitely going to feel bloated

- The service is impeccable. The staff members are friendly and have a very ""chill"" vibe to them (in a good way)

- The chicken burger I ordered is a popular item, but I think I will pass on this next time. The bun is softer and sweeter than most hamburger buns, so it added a unique taste. You get a lot of chicken as well, but unfortunately mine tasted bland and dry. Even the sauces, which were excessive in volume, were barely flavourful and thus did nothing for me but add extra calories into the meal.

- The chicken fingers in mild and wild flavour have a more flavourful kick to them than the sandwich.  However, be warned that the breading is thicker on these fingers, so these may not be up to your preference. 

The bottom line is that the Chickery cannot compete with large chains like Popeyes and KFC. The Chickery's chicken isn't as flavourful, moist, and juicy.  It's also more expensive in comparison, so you may want to save your lunch money for your usual trip to the food court instead.",2017-10-19 12:12:30

I have been here a handful of times in the past year and I believe it is the best Ross in Vegas simply because of the great selection they have here. I always compare this to my neighborhood Ross (Yelp! to come later on down the road). This location is great for buying my work shoes, more than anything else. lol (Although every time I walk in here to buy a pair I end up walking out the door with much more than I ever intended.) This is a pretty large store which has a great selection far greater than any other Ross I've ever stepped foot in (which covers several states). Plus the prices are always reasonable, if not downright cheap in some instances.

But, just because of its location alone, it can typically get pretty busy and you will likely have a wait in line. I've never had to wait too long and the service is okay as far as Ross goes. Don't expect to be blown away, but the staff handles everything just fine.

As other reviewers have stated, there are no housewares here. I guess you'll just have to go to your neighborhood location for that.  

Plus its got to be great for tourists who forgot to pack that extra pair of slacks, threw up on that favorite shirt at the club last night, or woke up in a drunken stupor missing several articles of clothing. Ross is here to help during your Vegas experience without breaking the bank!

On ne se rattrape même pas sur les prix avec un bon 23$ pour ce plat de pâtes dégeux, des tarifs abusifs à la parisienne parce qu'on est en terrasse sur Prince Arthur et on arnaque les touristes (c'est bien légitime)
Pour résumer côté nourriture on est encore bien loin de la gastronomie française, mais alors très loin!
Et en ce qui concerne le service, certes on a daigné me servir à 21h50, heure un peu tardive par un charmant serveur venu de la capitale française, qui devrait apprendre un peu plus vite à servir le client quand on lui demande un coke diet (c'est écrit dessus!) Il serait temps de s'y mettre on est au Québec!
Qui plus est quand j'ai entendu sa conversation avec la table de français derrière moi j'étais outrée: Il s'en allait à parler de godemichet et vibromasseur arrg! :S 
Je peux comprendre que la complicité avec les clients (de son pays) est un atout pourboire, mais de là à entrer dans l'intimité, j'appellerais plus ça de la vulgarité salace! Ce n'est pas le genre de chose que j'ai envie d'entendre sur une terrasse alors que je suis en train de manger c'est limite choquant!

kMOPdzD_IeS35j2HmyPttg,sccPVgHWRAww1atzaOfOYQ,cDoo0Pf1d_P79Rq3ZNk-Mw,3,5,1,3,"I followed a chef from one of my usual haunts to a new restaurant - Kirei - located where Young Thailand (then Ivory Thai) used to be. The large and newly renovated space was clearly built for big crowds. Groupings of 6 and 8 are all around. Of note are a number semi-private kotatsu tables along the North side of the room, divided by shoji screens. The decor leans toward sleek but softens the trendy tone with comfortable warm accents nearer to the sushi bar.

Showing some fusion (stay with me here) elements and Korean dashes, the menu is large - almost overwhelming. Nevertheless, we chose a la carte (vs omakase). On order was okonomiyaki, yaki nasu, the kirei shot, kiri tanpo (pan-fried rice sticks), kim chi risotto, and the pollack roe somen.

Some small and very cute complimentary dishes of a sauced vegetable, lotus root, and a fish ball come out from the kitchen, along with some cold noodle, and miso soup. A nice touch to begin and flesh out the meal.

Favourites were the yaki nasu (no crispy skin, but nicely done), pollack roe somen (spicy, cold, hot, very good and different), and kiri tanpo (the pan-fried rice sticks in a sweet soy sauce were quite good). Talking with the chef, most of the items were still very new to the kitchens, so many of the dishes was a first attempt. A fairly decent-to-strong showing for a new place.

I'd go back to try more dishes when things even out.",2011-12-22 03:12:04

It was my first time visiting Mastro's located in the shops at Crystals.  This beautiful and elegant dining can be seen while walking through.  The 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  The wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  

We made reservations for our group and were seated early.  I would like to give a tremendous thank you to Paul our waiter.  I don't think I've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  He went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. 

The table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. I will say their pretzel bread called my name.  I asked for more in which Paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  Fantastic! 

I started with the wedge salad.  Perfect and delicious.  The crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  For my entree I chose the Chilean Sea Bass accompanied by creamed spinach, Gorgonzola mac and cheese and Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  Of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  The sea bass was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  The gnocchi was a disappointment.  I don't think there were any crab pieces in this. But the other two sides definitely made up for it.  They were so creamy.  Anything with Gorgonzola will make me happy. Simply delicious!

If the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  On top of that list is their signature butter cake.  It's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  It's calorie free and fat free... In my dreams! It's moist and delectable.  After the huge meal, I would suggest splitting this huge cake.

I stopped in here at about 10:30 on a Friday night, which is right before Sip closes (they technically close at 11, but they stayed open a good 20-30 minutes past that when I was here), but everything was so awesome in that short amount of time that I'm gonna go ahead and give them five stars!

I've been wanting to stop in here for awhile, and too be honest, I've mostly wanted to stop in the morning or afternoon for a coffee and/or food (and I'll be doing that at some point!), but the opportunity presented itself randomly on a Friday night so I stopped in for a couple beers.

I loved the atmosphere. There's lots of space (both indoors & a patio), with comfortable chairs and couches. The staff is extremely friendly & outgoing. Since it was near the end of the night there were only a couple people working, but the guy working behind the bar (I believe his name was Alex...for as much as we talked to him I really should remember) was very outgoing. He seemed to know a lot about both the beers on tap & bottled beers & made my friend I was w/his own whiskey concoction, which she really liked. Speaking of whiskey, I was actually surprised this place even served liquor (I believe they only have whiskey). I just assumed they were beer & wine, but apparently they're not. 

Like I said, I really need to try some other things here to get more of a feel for this place, but I really liked what I saw & tasted in the short amount of time I stopped in for. 

One last thing I should point out that I really like about this place is the hours. I actually LIKE that they close early (compared to bars). They attract a different crowd because of it, and if you're only looking to have a couple drinks it's a good place to start the night or just catch up with friends for a bit.",2014-08-22 02:39:38

I appreciate that Sephora is here, I like the Macy's Home Store, and was gladdened last month to note the addition of a Teavana, which I hope signals an upswing for this mall.

While the wait sometimes is a pain, I live close enough and frequent often enough, that I know the perfect times to go so we can walk right in and get seated.

Bento boxes with a lot of food for next to nothing, check. Noodles, check. Chicken or meat, check. Fried ball of rice dipped in teriyaki sauce, double check. 

I think the quality of the fish is no better or worse anywhere else in Charlotte so thats never been an issue for us and when people raise that concern, I always brush it off. The entire menu is extremely reasonably priced AND they have a cheap as heck lunch all you can eat buffet. Sure, you might not know what you're eating but hey, you're broadening your pallet. 

It's a loud, fun atmosphere and the wait staff is friendly and almost always on top of their game, they yell hello and goodbye every time someone walks in or leave - it still always startles me, but I enjoy it.

I sat back and enjoyed every last bite while the girls were presented with their third course, a crepe with strawbery jam. In conclusion, don't judge a book by its cover.

Service is quick and efficient, so don't expect anything beyond that.  Overall a good spot to go for if one craves for sushi and doesn't want to spend big bucks on omakase experience.",2015-09-20 20:40:55

Service was slow, we basically just sat ourselves down to a table when we came in as there were servers walking around but no one greeted us. Then it took awhile before a server came to our table to ask us what to drink. After that, it was ok, the server was more attentive to our table. I decided to try ""The Three Ring Binder"" - fried mushroom, chipotle mayo, gouda cheese and three onion rings. I asked for a whole wheat bun but they gave me a white bun, considering it took that long to get the food, I didn't even bother asking to change.

The burger was delicious, pattie was juicy and a bit spicy from the chipotle. It was a big burger, I was struggling to finish at the end. I got the die-cut chips on the side, it was alright, some were soggy but I prefer the crispy ones. It was a good meal but expensive for the food you are getting.

Driver was polite and friendly. I was disappointed with the lasagna. There was hardly any mozzarella cheese in it or on it and I didn't see any ricotta cheese at all. The sauce was OK with very chunky cooked tomatoes and minced onion, and the meatballs were pretty good. But not good enough for me to order a second time. The side salad was normal with lettuce, black olives, sliced onion, and mozzarella cheese. The garlic bread was delicious. Not overcooked, & a good amount of melted butter over the top with parsley flakes.  The carrot cake was typical for this type of restaurant and hit the spot just fine.

But the décor is straight from my beloved Grandma Mae's house- pink, pink, fake flowers, pink, pink, crocheted doilies, pink, and then some more pink. It burns my eyeballs. There IS a way to keep the integrity of a well-known location while updating its style, just saying. 

I still occasionally come here for a milkshake (thick, because otherwise it's like a heavy glass of melted ice cream. There's honestly no point to them giving you a spoon with their regular milkshakes) and they're pretty good. Sugar Bowl is the only place I've found that does chocolate chip milkshakes, so they're alright in my book. Plus, they have a really great selection of all sorts of desserts! Something for the whole family. Husband gets a sundae or maybe a hot dog and we'll sit over at the corner booth next to the window and watch all the out-of-towners walking around with their little maps arguing over which Gilbert Ortega they'd rather go to until they give up and come in to split a Buster Brownie.

5 stars alone for the company...Always a good time with the gang!

I love mochi anything, so I ordered the Mochi Pancakes on the ""Big Plates"" section, and Wifey ordered the Fish Sandwich with Fries and Kim Cheese Sauce so we could share both plates. When the pancakes arrived, it was a Sh-Stack... way less than a short stack! More like 2 small tortillas with a sprinkle of berries and a little dollop of creme fraiche! Although the flavor was good, $11 is definitely not worth it, and I should have gone with a sandwich or burger which was about the same price.(The photo is a zoomed in shot) Either remove these from the big plates menu, or add at least 3 more pancakes to make up for the missing O, R, and T in short stack!?!?

The ice creams we all shared(Miso-Toffee, Lemon Poppy Seed, and Strawberry-Sake, all topped with Kettle Chips) were pretty good, but not too sure if I'd return after a not-so good first impression....still on the fence for Poppy Den...more like 3.5 stars....ALOHA!!!

I was expecting the Courtyard Cafe and it was A-OK finding the Copper Whisk here...good times.

Service: My most recent visits were with the weekend grave shift crew.  The Host team was always friendly with getting our groups seated quickly.  Our server the other night was great, he with letting us try the macaroni salad before deciding between that or toast. The night before, our server got flustered with our drink orders but in the end she nailed it.  Everyone was great with taking care of our group at such a late hour.

Late night eats: My first late night out was a cheeseburger with the macaroni salad.  Ingredients were good and the burger was prepped well.  The following night, I recovered with a Loco Moco that came out on a long plate versus a bowl.  I adapted and the gravy was tasty and paired well with the hamburger patty as it should in a loco moco

Ambiance: Newly remodeled with this colorful NOLA contemporary theme, chocked full of bright colors, iron bars and trumpet lighting to bring back cool memories I had in the French Quarter.  Lots of spacing in the two open dining areas which is 5x better than the seating in the Courtyard Cafe.  Well done on the design and theme execution.

Pricing is pretty fair to the quality and quantity of food received.  However with Vegas becoming a low key foodie capital, you can get much more interesting dishes close by for similar pricing.  Compared to the pricing of other casino cafes, Copper Whisk offers great value.  You get seated quickly, friendly staff and above average cafe food even at 2 AM+. Copper Whisk is open 24 hours and they just made my list of casino cafe possibilities to recover after a great night of partying.

Chef Kenny basically puts out a different tasting menu everyday, 3 courses or 5 courses as well as having a menu you can pick dishes from.

It consisted of Salmon Belly Tartare, Scallop and Duck Confit Crepinette, Lamb Noisette and Shoulder, Fior di Latte Tempura, Earl Grey Chocolate Pot de Creme. The only dish that was a little disappointing for me was the Tempura as the batter was hard as a rock. My companions found it delicious so I must have had a piece that was left in the fryer too long but otherwise the food was impressive, not just for the flavours but the texture of each dish. I often find that texture is a neglected element but not so here at Workshop. The prices seem steep but love and care goes into each dish and every element of a dish has been carefully considered  and put together e.g. The salmon tartare in a decadent leek soubise, the sauce alone was to die for and something that makes you wish you could lick your plate and the puffed quinoa added a nice crunch that just added an element of surprise. My favourite was the lamb Noisette and Shoulder. It's great food when each item leaves you wanting more but at the end of the meal you feel just satisfyingly full.

One had a high chair that a baby had been sitting in and it showed.  There was food all over the place. Tables and floors alike.  Another table still had old dried up rice all over it and a wiping rag just sitting there.  Tables don't wipe themselves.  To top it off there was a man working on the beverage fridge.  Thats fine right?  Wrong.  He was crawling up underneath it and using an acetylene torch.  I could smell it every time he sparked it on and I could hear loud pops every time he turned it off.  It was crazy.  This flame in such a small area was getting very close to the 2-liter bottles stored back there.  It was kind of scary.  I thought the place was going to blow up.  It seems inappropriate to be using a torch during dinner hours and so close to the dining room.  

As for the food, I ordered from the Japanese side for a change.  A chicken katsu bento box with white rice, a salad and fried shumai.  The shumai threw me.  I would expect gyoza in a bento box faster than I would shumai.  Don't get me wrong.  The shumai was fine.  Just not what I would expect.  The katsu was superbly crispy.  I with there was more of it.  And more of the sauce would have been nice too.  As for the salad.  The ""ice"" in the iceberg lettuce must have melted because that salad of nothing but iceberg lettuce was floating in a pool of water.  Luckily I did not go in there for a salad so I was not sorely disappointed.

When we walked in, it was pretty empty.  Sort of surprising for such a high rated place.  I think this just goes to show that LV is pretty saturated with good eats.  Definitely need more of this saturation our way so that not every mealtime need be a test of patience!

Our server was very nice and professional.  Drinks were good.  Brother-in-law even got one in a shark mug.  How whimsical!

We proceeded to order and started with the bento box which seemed like a great idea for the four of us. While some of the elements in the bento box were good, I don't think we were quite impressed with the presentation, especially when I think we paid $75 for it.  So I'm ok with skipping this one next time around.  Oyster toppings didn't really stand out to us and there was quite a bit of shell left in the shucked oyster.

Other things we ordered:
Hearth baked bread - Good bread
Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings - good but was salty; not sure I tasted marrow
Coal Roasted Beef Salad - lovely presentation, a little tough to eat with the huge tuft of pea shoots on top, tasty overall
Campire Duck - fantastic, must have
Halibut - came last; we were stuffed but couldn't help but gobble this one up. Perfectly cooked fish.

The only thing I didn't appreciate was that they basically threw all the food on our table in quick succession. With us still working on the bento box, the runners were trying to figure out ways to fit things on our table and I'd made a comment about slowing down the food and all they did was chuckle and scamper away. But the food kept coming.   

Sadly some dishes got cold while we were trying to eat everything so they're really doing a disservice to themselves when they throw everything out at once.  We finally got our server to slow it down on our last dish and of course he made sure to mention that they had to recook the halibut. Still very nice and pro, though.

a dance competition featuring all-stars from ""So You Think You Can Dance?"" U.S. and China.

Kinda awkward that there's only one way in, and one way out, but luckily this wasn't a big concert which probably would have been worse. Seating is typical arena seats and the ushers are very nice in helping direct you to your seats.

There were different styles of dance displayed such as tap, belly dancing, lyrical, b-boying, popping, locking, krumping, and jazz. What I didn't understand(and what happened for most of the competition) was how different genres of dance were going to be scored equally? There seemed to be more lyrical dancers on both teams, but you would see Belly dance vs. Hip Hop, Lyrical vs. Krumping, and Tap vs. Lyrical??? Dancers Travis Wall and B-Boy Hok(Quest Crew) are the only familiar faces I saw, and when it came to their turns to battle, both Travis and Hok lost!?!? In the singles categories and also in pairs....fixed judging??? Who knows....

After witnessing all of the dancing which was pretty cool, the competiton was close(according to the judges), but I felt like the Chinese came to compete and were more polished in their performances, where the Americans looked like they were treating this as more of an exhibition than a competition. This show was also being taped for broadcast in China, so with that being said, I'm sure you know who won....ALOHA!!!",2013-12-18 16:34:20

Called and booked a reservation for 3:00pm on a Saturday. You are given a two hour limit. Just park anywhere and upon entering they ask you for your licience plate # so that they can authorize your free parking. $20 per person for AYCE. 

The only reason I am giving this a 1 star review is the quality of food and selections available. The only thing I found decent were the sandwiches. They had tuna, smoked salmon and egg salad sandwich. All were pretty decent. Everything else was crap. 

Based off the pictures posted here I saw macarons and what I thought to be creme brule, however there was none of that available. There was a dessert that looked like a creme brule but it was far from it. I think they use to have macarons but not anymore. The cakes were terrible, the pastries were terrible and just taking one glance at what they had available just turned me right off from the get go. There was no turning back at this point and nothing would have made the experience better...lol. As you can tell I'm just hugely dissapointed. To make things worse there is no tea selection just some Red Rose tea bags.

I let the husband go in to take my order because I wanted to see if I'd enjoy my food blindly. You know, food taste better when service is great or food tastes like poo because of poor service. My thought process was...it is windy and I'm hungry. I'd like to enjoy this taco salad without anyone ruining my vibe.

It's a shop located amongst a strip of businesses. You could easily miss it because it isn't quite street view. So when you see 7-11 at the corner--that's your cue to turn in. Lots of parking because it's one of those strips within a neighborhood. It took us all but 2 mins to get here since the husband works around the corner.

It took about 15 minutes and a little longer until my husband comes walking out with two bags of each of our taco salad. They place it onto their Styrofoam plates which obviously can't be closed. 

We ate those suckers in the parking lot because I couldn't risk our food to get the sweating. It felt a little longer than necessary considering it was ""just"" a taco salad.

Opting for the Carne asada and omitting the beans and rice. What....don't judge. I can handle only so much moosh. Anyway, upon opening I quickly discovered why our food took a little longer for jusssst a taco salad.

I completely appreciate a fresh taco shell. Nothing like waiting long for a stale one. But not todaaay-ay. It was salad delight. All the fixings inside is typical of a taco salad, however, everything in it seemed soooo fresh!!! The lettuce, pico, guac, etc...fresh. furrrr-resh. Lettuce was nice and crispy, meat wasn't salty nor chewy, pico didn't look like twas sitting in a container overnight. I will add that the meat seemed kind of skim. They put their meat at the way bottom of the salad. 

Honestly, though...being skim on the meat in a taco salad is alright with me. The meat wasn't even a feature of the taco. 

The Carne asada taco salad is 6.95. We also ordered a horchata. What else would you wash all that down with during a midday fiesta. That large cup came.out to 2 dollar something.

The husband said the horchata were pre-poured into the cups which bare the Pepsi logo, that sits in a fridge waiting for someone to take them home. Their horchata wasn't overly sweet, and wasn't anything special to add. Just your typical horchata.

Blind test worked. I enjoyed my food without any biasness. Not that I'm biased. I woud love to return to try out their tacos or something of interest, and get the full-service myself. I'll update. 

So 4 stars STRICTLY over the taco salad.",2016-02-19 05:14:34

Like I said I opted for just a bowl of soup which to my surprise came with bread and a somewhat chocolate covered strawberry; well the tip of the strawberry had chocolate on it.

Overall it was good, my friend has been here several times and really likes it.  I would really love it if everything was organic but its not, however this place still puts out some great food for eating in or taking home.

Never been in this place but have always wanted to go.  I walked in and thought my senses had hit their max.  In the front I stood and sniffed their lotions and soaps made from olive oil??  What??  Man..that was awesome.  Moving towards the middle, I saw the first olive oil that I could taste.  Mmm..tasty.  Then the manager of the store asked if I'd been in before.  ""no..and yes I'm over whelmed"" She graciously moved me to the back where...there they were...lined up in all their glory.  She showed me where the EVOOs started...where the flavored darker oils where and then where the balsamic ones were.  I stood with my mouth open just in awe of all the silver canisters of olive oil goodness.  I don't know much about olive oil, but I just know how to use it and what I like.  Kinda like wine.  So I just started from one end....and wound up sipping different ones.  Smelling...tasting and thinking of recipes.  The cool thing is that each olive oil has a suggestion on what to use it on and a description of it's flavor.  I figured I'd just end up getting the basil infused oil.  Until she told me that I could mix and match the oil with the balsamic.  I thought ""that's right...I could ...then I'd have a fabulous vinaigrette"" She smiled then let me try the basil oil with the strawberry vinaigrette.  Magic happened right in my mouth.  Sold.  Bought the two and was a happy camper.

When I met my fiancee I was more excited to come and see his mentor, John Ebinger the bassist. I was lucky enough to watch Michael Christie before he left his tenure with the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra. We were very lucky to have him for eight years. I cannot recommend highly enough the Pops series for a bit of fun with the family or friends. The orchestra plays almost 200 concerts every year, so there is always a ton of concerts to choose from. They offer a regular series of Classics, Symphony Pops, Chamber Orchestra, and Family offerings. They also celebrate the holidays with special events and community celebrations. 

I get tickets for free from my honors program, but they offer a college club program where you can attend unlimited Classic concerts for only $30! They also offer a special price of $11.50 one hour prior to performance (excludes special event/family concerts) for students with ID, and 25% off for seniors. Teachers get 50% off any ticket! Yay!

Dress: This is America so you can pretty much do what you want in terms of dress, however, I prefer to dress formally when I go to the symphony, it makes the experience for me. You can dress business casual and feel quite comfortable, though I usually notice that people dress up when they come (conservatively, not Jennifer Lopez navel baring, Versace dress wearing). 

When to clap: look at the conductor's arms, are they down? Good, more than likely the piece is over and you may clap your little heart out. It's always amusing to see people go crazy in the middle of a piece. Woooo! You conduct you little conductee!

Come ahead of time to attend the pre-concert chats before every Symphony Classics, and Coffee Classics concerts, where members of the audience get to interview guest artists, and members of the orchestra! Allow time for parking, the main entrance and will-call window is located on the West side of the building.

I must say, pizza is terrific. Perfect sauce, crispy rustic crust not paper thin but not over thick either. Toppings lively and fresh; had pepperoni and shrooms, great shrooms. Cheese amount good to a little too much, its fine.
2 appetizers that grabbed my gastric attention were the calamari with shishito peppers (good but small portion not worth 20 bucks) and the house wings (very good and different sauce on them, like a bbq/classic buffalo hot sauce fusion). 1 pizza sets you back 25 to 30 bucks; 6 big slices will feed 2 good without need for appetizers, if your a normal couple.

I like to get my hot chocolate here some mornings if its not too packed.  A couple of the girls and guys actually know what I want when I come in and it's already started for me-so kudos to them.

Sometimes they are training in the morning,  which can slow things down... But overall a solid place to get some hot cocoa in the morning. The barista's are knowledgeable and very quick and concise. 

This particular location is always clean, Lots of seating indoor and outside, though I wish there were some big cushy seats like you find in other starbucks. There's always tons of free Wifi-types here doing homework or goofing off on their laptop.

They were booked solid so I was told to try to come in when they opened and I would have a shot of getting a demo. So I arrived at 10am promptly.  There were at least 6-8 artists walking around doing nothing.  So finally this guy asked me if I needed help. So I explained that I wanted a demo because I was getting married  and I need a pink and putter mix. He said I will be right back. Then he came back and said we are not taking walk ins today I just spoke to my manager.  So I said let me speak to her. Meanwhile the artists are still walking around doing nothing and telling customers on the phone that they can come and wait but they are booked. 

So a young lady her name was Scarlett.  She was like I just heard what happened and I can take you we don't have our first appointments until 11:00. She said it's ridiculous that he didn't help you.

Located right at Bay and Dundas. Street parking and paid parking lots available within walking distance. Large dining area consists of many booths, round tables and some bar seating. Interior is starting to feel a little dated. 

SERVICE (3)
Friendly waiters, but very slow service. It's almost impossible to be in and out within the lunch hour. I love that they start you off with their fresh biscuits as soon as you order so there's something to eat while you wait. 

FOOD (3.5) 
The kitchen is kind of slow so be prepared to wait. Food always arrive hot and at the same time, which is greatly appreciated for groups. The crab linguine was tasty but a little heavy near the end. Shrimp tacos are always good as well. Honestly, you can't really go wrong with food at Red Lobster.  

QUALITY/VALUE (3)
Prices are starting go up here. There used to be 8.99 lunch specials but that's long gone. Lunches typically start at 11.99 now, which makes this more of a special work occasion for me.

My husband is pretty much a one-trick pony (always Sweet and Sour Chicken), but I like variety and was totally spoiled by a great little local place in our small town in Cali. Yoko takes its place! Clean, no frills restaurant, with adequate seating; fast (have never had to wait on an order. - usually ready in less than 15 min!), friendly, efficient, and delicious. I have tried many of their menu items  (except for really spicy ones, but they are awesome about adjusting the heat if you just ask) and have never had a complaint. Love their beef and shrimp yakisoba, as well as teriyaki items. Crab Angels always in our order, and the Gyoza is nicely done, too. Their sushi selection is basic, but tasty, prepared to order and always packaged separately; I like the care and concern given each time. You will never go hungry with an order of anything from Yoko!!! My only caution would be that white rice comes with everything, unless you specify none. That said, they always give me as much noodles as they would rice, so I am happy! Price wise, no complaints. As they say, ""You get what you pay for!""

The interior is warm and welcoming.  With exposed brick and white paneling, it looks like it should be a seafood shack. The menu is small but covers alot of ground.  Its mainly an appetizer/sandwich/hamburger joint with some seafood/steak options to choose from.
Always the adventurer, I tried the Parman Patty Melt. The sandwiches are served ala carte so I tried the Chicken Tenders as well.  The Patty Melt contained the normal ""melt"" ingredients (grilled onions, swiss cheese, grilled bread, burger) but also was topped with sauerkraut and a slice of braunschweiger). I have no clue why they decided to offer up such a sandwich (other than to lure suckers like me to give it a try) but overall, the flavors worked. I don't know if I would ever order it again but I did eat it all.  The tenders were hand breaded and were accompanied with a homemade ranch sauce.  They were a solid choice.  Nothing to write home about but also nothing to complain about.  This sums up also the restaurant in general.  Nice waitstaff, nice decor, good food but that's about it.

No in room music or sound machine. Bright lights left on. Table warmer had to be fumbled with for five minutes after I was in the room. I was booked with a male therapist and not asked if this was ok. Was told later it was my responsibility to ask.
Cold towels left on back during the massage and more poking and pushing then fluid massage movements.

Facial starts with cold water. Was left alone in the room because esthetician needed to get tools that weren't where they should have been. Steamer issues and none of the extras listed were done. Sugar scrub on feet? Lip plumping treatment? Wild berry eye treatment?

I stopped in for lunch and after driving by the place twice, I found my way.  The inside is really warm and cozy - not what you would expect from a place that is in a warehouse in the middle of nowhere.  

I had the bruschetta to start - fresh bread with a basil pesto, roasted red peppers, and freshly pulled mozzarella.  There were three decent sized pieces and I should really have stopped there because they were really filling.  I definitely recommend sharing.    This was followed by a salad, which consisted of arugula, tomatoes, parmesan, and a balsamic vinaigrette.  This is the dish I could take or leave, but that's mostly because I don't love arugula.  The tomatoes, dressing, and parmesan were all superior though.  

I followed that up with a seasonal butternut squash gnocchi.  This dish had a hazelnut mascarpone sauce and some sausage.  I initially thought it was on the heavy side with the sauce, but that might have been because I was sort of full from the appetizer.  The portion was plentiful and I barely made a dent.  I took it home and had it for dinner and there were still some leftovers.  The sauce separated a bit upon reheating (as any cream sauce will), but I simply mopped out the extra oil and found the leftovers even more delightful than the fresh dish. The gnocchi were just right and I would absolutely order it again.   

They also added a few nice extra touches.   They brought a little dish of marinated olives to start with.  I hate olives and didn't try them, but I appreciated the gesture all the same.  At the end of the meal, there was a complimentary shot of lemoncello and a little cookie.  Just enough to top off a fabulous meal.   

4 stars instead of 5 because I think if you are going to serve lunch, you should have a lunch menu.  Lunch portions and lunch prices would have made the experience perfect.   For dinner though, it's a winner.  Not cheap, but worth the price and you can BYOB.",2016-10-10 15:59:15

Cream cheese wonton: All it was is wonton wrapper with literally only cream cheese inside, fried and served with sweet sauce. Pretty bland and disappointing. 1/5

Mushroom medly: Just different types of mushrooms that was mixed with melted butter. 2/5

Jalapeño poppers: Pop of deliciousness! Jalapeño sliced in half stuffed with cream cheese and crab and deep friend drizzle with sweet dressing. 5/5

Calamari: Crispy calamari with the spicy mayo dip sauce, average. 3/5

Pork belly: So good, you can never go wrong with pork belly. Slapped this on the grill and once crispy on both sides... With rice it's amazing. 5/5

Beef toro: Basically brisket... My friend enjoyed this very much. 4/5

Spicy pork: Meh 2/5

Chicken cheese fondue: Grilled the chicken and cheese however once dipped into cheese it was way chunky and not good. Aye the chicken alone. 1/5

Overall the food was ok, but I prefer Korean BBQ at tofu hut. The dipping sauces don't really stand out to me, one was sweet and one  is spicy... But I still love my sesame dipping sauce at tofu hut. The quality of meat is better but as far as the taste, tofu hut is way better. I didn't know during happy hour they don't give you rice?

The main course was raw and there was no offer to adjust the bill. She stated that our dining experience was not significantly interrupted while having a mouthful of raw meat. Apparently, I was unaware that raw meat as part of the dining experience is a minor event. It then follows that the new Cibo customer service policy as of yesterday, October 1 is: If you have a significant interruption in the quality of the food served or level of service at our establishment, the customer will not be offered an adjustment of the bill or any other compensation for our error. 

Anyone who pretends that others should accept improperly cooked food and a poor dining experience without some form of compensation, while they themselves would not accept the same is unacceptable. Would like to hear from others who have had to deal with this manager. 

Sorry, but it's difficult to give this establishment future business as a result of this unpleasant experience. The one star rating is extreme and given the lack of vision, communication and problem solving ability on the part of the manager it is warranted.

The ribs were meaty and saucy, we warmed up the BBQ and popped them on for about 12 minutes. The roots were a mixture of exactly that... potatoes, maybe some squash or sweet potato, with some oils and spices and the quinoa salad was the spicy bean quinoa with some corn and such in it.

The lamb was cooked well with onion and jalapeño.  I didn't care much for their veggie platter.  The red and yellow colored been pastes didn't sit well with my taste buds.

I have eaten at their cafe a few times and the food isn't bad at all. I would have to say that the cafe employees were probably the friendliest folks in the entire building.

Unfortunately from food to service, it just didn't deliver.  Save the spring vegetable spaetzle, nothing was good.  Here's what we had...

the acclaimed cheddar bacon biscuits - positively overcooked.  The outsides weren't just crunchy; they were rock hard.  The insides were dry and flavorless.

the zucchini pancakes - tasty but undercooked and greasy.

b burger - though ordered well done, it came medium.  I know some foodies think well-done is gauche, but that's what my mom wants, that's what she orders so just deal with it and bring her what she wants.  And don't act all pissy about it when she sends it back.  

vegetable chopped salad - such promise on the menu that fails to impress on the plate.  As other reviewers have said, it's an amateur salad and utterly lacking flavor or originality.  

grilled salmon with panzanella - salmon was well-cooked but nothing special.  The panzanella salad was an interesting twist that just didn't work for anyone at the table - cornbread croutons that failed to absorb any flavors.  frankly the panzanella flavors just didn't mesh.  you were eating croutons, cucumbers, tomato, and some dressing.    

my glass of Pickett Fence pinot noir tasted like the bottle had been sitting open for a couple days.  

my other comments about the food are get over the bacon in everything and use the raw corn sparingly.  Sometimes it just doesn't work and frankly gets boring when one or the other is in so many dishes on the menu.

Lastly service was poor.  The aforementioned b burger was sent back to be refired.  Should that take 20 minutes?  Certainly not when the restaurant is just gearing up for the peak hours... Beyond that, our server was unattentive and mistakenly laboring under the idea that he was charming.  This is a nitpick, but if I hand you my credit card with the bill, you should probably hand it back to me when you're done not to my Dad.  Pay attention just a bit.

Went last night with my husband who'd raved about it -- it's in the old 808 restaurant location (bad) in Caesars, sort of down from Rao's and Payard...instead of closed (meaning you're unable to see inside the restaurant), it's now open (open kitchen, counters, open, inviting dining room -- and looks like it's draped in a white metal doily... they've created an entrance of fishtanks filled with gorgeous fantail goldfish -- trust me, you have to see it to believe it.  It is beautiful.  

But then there's a master noodlemaker plying his trade in the front window...aahhh...that's the ticket.

We claimed two seats at the counter -- back line -- to watch the other chefs ply their woks.   Service starts out fine -- then the guy vanishes for about 20 minutes.  Not surprisingly, husband gets ticked off -- and fortunately, expeditor and another server (more senior) save the day.  We order every dumpling on the menu, one pancake (the beef), one order of noodles (with eggplant) and see a guy next to us eating salt & pepper shrimp and we have to have it, too.

The dumplings begin to come out first.  The imperial soup dumplings are not to be missed -- not that many places serve them.  Beware  -- you'll burn your lip, if you can't be patient.  This is authentic Chinese -- really fascinating stuff.  I wasn't as crazy about the shumai, but the bao were dynamite, too -- but those soup dumplings....

Everything was delicious -- until the last dish arrived - the shrimp.  The guy's looked much better than ours did.  And our dish was mealy, it had that cornstarchy needs-to-stay-in-the-fryer a little bit more taste -- instead of the snap and flavor that we love.  Husband sent it back (he rarely, if ever does that) -- and the server agreed, you could see it.  Since we were sitting on the line, we watched the server take it back to the Chef Tournant and show him -- he took the plate, walked around to the wok side of the line -  added what was left on our plate (that we'd returned) and put it on another order.  Sent it back to the expeditor to send out to roomservice. 

I swear.  My husband and I watched with our jaws open.  Couldn't believe what we'd just seen.

Never ever ever have I seen a chef do that -- let alone in front of us -- and he knew we saw him do it, too.  

Let's just say my husband will be discussing this in lineup today for sure and I had to yelp it.  

Sadly as a result, this restaurant became a bit too authentic for my repeat business...",2009-01-27 15:22:43

I had been going to another facility for years, and loved them - but they recently went out of business, and my dog's vet is now here at Bethany.
My first impression (telephone) was not fantastic. I understand policies are policies - but some make no sense. My dog has been on an anti fungal for Valley Fever for years. We used to do blood tests every three months, but last year decided to do every six months, due to my dog's slow response time to the meds. She was tested less than three months ago. I have her records from the old clinic. And it's the SAME vet. Even with an offer of me hand delivering her records - to the SAME vet that has been treating her for years, they refused to renew the prescription for meds until she was physically examined at Bethany. No need for a new blood test, it's fine to wait until May for that. Really, just an exam. So I felt it was a ""let's get money for doing nothing"" policy. There were a couple of non urgent issues I was able to address (I was going to wait 6 weeks - when I have to take the dog in for her vaccinations - you know, a real reason to take her in!) but decided to bring them up at this visit, as we were there, anyway.
The office itself gave my dog the creeps - and me, too. Just a really bad vibe from the time we walked in the door. The place is clean, and the staff was friendly, so I can't specify what bothered me about it - but my pooch has never been that unhappy so soon after walking into the vet.

On the flip side - Dr. Afek is just plain awesome! I really like her, and trust her to care for Layla. And while I realize there are many great vets in town, it gives me peace of mind that Dr. Afek has known Layla since I got her, almost six years ago. We got the prescription renewed, as well as some other meds.
The receptionist has given me follow up calls to ensure Layla got the meds that were ordered, and just make sure all was well. I do like the customer service level of follow up - and have no qualms with the care received.
I also like the hours - past 7 most nights - which means I won't have to alter my work schedule for routine visits. That's definitely an added bonus for me!
I'm planning to stay with Bethany for at least a few more visits - and see if it was just that original ""no meds until physical exam"" policy that left a sour taste in my mouth - and truly hope to add more stars to this review.",2015-01-13 03:46:26

The orchestra, dancers, and singers are all very very good.  The sound seemed a bit too loud through the entire show, but perhaps it was just where I was sitting.  Another reviewer mentioned if there are several songs from a show you don't know, you could get a little antsy by the last song and I agree--I haven't seen Cabaret and I thought the three songs from that show were a bit grating.  I prefer music more like Irving Berlin.  And I agree with another reviewer that there are other musicals, say in the past 5-25 years, that could have songs included.  The musicals that are included may be older, but most are solid classics.  The choices of the songs were good about 85% of the time, but a few of them could probably be cut w/o much notice from the audience.  And I agree with other reviews that other songs, from Rent, West Side Story, etc...and even more contemporary ones (say musicals from the past 2-5 years) could be added easily.

I could see how people who don't like Broadway or don't like music theater would loathe a show like this, but if you do enjoy Broadway and music theater, this is a really fun show.  I would say I was most impressed with the details in the costumes and choreography, everyone was spot on 100%.  A lot of reviewers said the Steve Wynn narration was silly or annoying, but I didn't think so, I like hearing the context of the songs and wished there was more history or background infused.  It appears this staff has worked really hard on the show and I think it shows.  I'm not sure I would have been happy paying $100-150 for a ticket ($75 might have felt more comfortable) but I do think this show is upscale and professional, definitely like Broadway and in some ways un-Vegas-like, but definitely worth a look.

To give some additional info and context--I spoke with seven people I knew after the show and they all said they liked it very much, two thumbs up, etc...To give you context, that included two women in their 60's, a married couple in their late 50's-early 60's, a couple around 30, and my husband (45).  This is not a show that would cater to 20-somethings, unless they were into theater, musicals, dance, etc...",2015-06-14 09:37:22

They have a wide selection of bagels and cream cheeses to choose from, with my personal favorite, french toast. They also have coffee, drinks, and even some pastries to choose from as well. During my visit, I had a westerner bagel, and it came with a small muffin with it. The westerner was delicious and the french toast bagel is so good by itself, no cream cheese is necessary. They also sell excess bagels from the previous day for a cheaper price, and that is definitely a bargain worth taking when it is available. If you want to be quick about it, you can select your own bagels from the racks, bag them, and pay to head on your way out.

And the bottled beer is all under $4.50. Now that's my kinda restaurant! Overall, I'm a huge fan of the cozy environment and cheap food and drinks this place had to offer and I'll certainly come back!

My only few complaints is that the service wasn't fantastic - our servers were incredibly nice but they didn't come to our table often at all!

Big things matter, but if you don't have the finishing touches down you are just going to be average. It doesn't matter how well a wall is painted if there's little spots of paint on the trim. 99% of a mirror can be clean, but the one thumb print is the thing that you'll notice. 
V Picasso has the nicest bathroom I've ever seen! Pushing open the ornate wooden door leads you into a place that I felt guilty urinating in. I saw this piece of art on the wall, that made me feel bad for pissing in. The ceilings looked as though they were covered in ornate copper. The sink made me feel bad for having sullied my hands. I can't imagine taking a poop in here, because the door that you shut in the stall is a miniature version of the bathroom door. This must be how kings poop! It's not some fake imitation wood either, or plastic molded to look like wood, this door is heavy and it's artfully crafted. The room was spotless as well. When you care that much about how the friggin bathroom looks, you will definitely be in for a treat for the other things... you know, like the food. 
When I came in, I was offered the food and drink menu. It was my first time here, and I don't think any of the wait staff knew me. I looked at the draft selection, which didn't make a difference to me because it's all wine, and then looked at the bottles in front of me. I decided on a St. Bernadus Abt. 12. An excellent beer. They have others, not too many, probably about a dozen to choose from, ranging from Bud Light, up to the St.B 12. Most of the beers were either 4,5 or 7 bucks. Which isn't horrible. They had Triptych Can listed on the menu, but Triptych won't be canning again until the new canning line comes on. Initially I wasn't sure of what to eat. I thought back to a Smile Politely article from a couple of months ago about how to be a man (or something similar), and it recommended ""get the special"". I asked what the special was, and it sounded great, even though I have no idea the words that he said. When I found out it was some sort of fish... I went with the steak. (probably pictured below). I asked ""who was in the kitchen"" and the bartender said ""Eric M"". So, I ordered the steak rare. ""Eric M"" was just out of the kitchen moments before surveying the crowd before I got there (the crowd of 1 table), and so when an order for a steak rare printed out, he came out of the kitchen to see who the new person was. He smiled as he came over, and told me ""heck, it's probably done already for you virgil"". It was served with a Brussels sprouts and potato cubes in a cream sauce, with some red peppers on top. Cooked excellent, lightly seasoned. It was a big ass T-bone. As I ate, Mookie and I told stories of everything to the giant bartender. Gabe was also in the kitchen. It's a radio reunion kitchen. Executive Chef Adam, Mookie, Gabe... the good times are here. For some reason I was still hungry after the big ass steak, (probably because I didn't pick it up and chew on the bone like I would of were I at the house, (they told me it was ok to do so, as I pretty much had the place to myself) but I didn't, not because I didn't want to be ""that guy"" at the restaurant, so much as I would have needed a shower to get all of the juices and sauces out of my beard) so I asked for a recommendation, Mooke offered a couple of items, until we both settled on the scotch egg. Which is possibly the greatest invention ever. A local egg (not sure which farm), that's basically turned into a deviled egg, and wrapped in sausage. I could probably go broke eating those.

It also tasted sour, was too watery, and was more the size of a cup than a full bowl. The only good part of the meal was my basket of waffle fries, which came in a great portion for just $5 and was delicious. I will definitely come back for another basket of waffle fries, but I'm not sure if I'd try anything else.

I browsed the menu online before we went and was blown away by the choices.  I even chuckled at some of the snippy comments beside some selections.

We arrived outside of the lunch hour so there was no wait for a table.  Our server dropped off menus and took drink orders right away.  I decided against all the gourmet toppings and just go for something basic so that I could taste the flavour of the beouf.  

I chose the Ho Hum #2 beef burger (cheese and crispy bacon) with fries and gravy while my health nut DC chose the Mel Lastman turkey burger (goat cheese, spinach, red peppers) and added avocado with steamed broccoli as the side.

I really love tomatoes and pickles on my burgers but those were only available as an ""upgrade""...hello, $3.56 for pickles?  Really?  Tomatoes not even listed as an option for a side.  And honestly, when my burger already cost $12.74, by the time I request tomatoes and pickles, it's going to be a $20 burger!

The menu advertised a 1/2 lb beef patty so I was expecting it to be huge.  When my burger arrived, it wasn't super big...just average size.  The waitress warned that because the burgers are made fresh, there could be traces of pink which I was fine with and was actually excited for because it's rare that restaurants would serve burgers slightly on the pink side.

To my disappointment, the patty in my burger was dry and overcooked.  Without tomato or pickle, it made the burger as a whole even drier.  The fries were good though - properly cooked and crispy.

Fountain drinks were served in a Pyrex measuring cup for novelty sake and are bottomless.  With the measurements, at least I can keep track of how much liquid I'm ingesting.

Burger prices are a bit on the high side and not really justified.  Lack of pickles and tomatoes on the burgers deters me from going back any time soon.",2012-12-18 21:55:08

We also opted for the fried calamari as appetizer. All dishes lacked salt, the pasta verona was suppose to have chicken, it was the smallest slices of of shaved chicken I have ever seen. We also had 8oz steak, OMG cardboard would taste better than that. It was hard to cut and even harder to eat. No seasoning, no sauce, dry. Just thinking about it makes me want to gag.

Also, I found a stray Labrador a few weeks ago. This beautiful, HUGE dog just showed up at my garage and I had no idea what to do. I grabbed bowls of water and food and let him sit in my house for awhile. I called Arrow Hospital, told them I found a stray and they told me to bring him in immediately. 

They took such good care of him. The lady at the front counter (I wish I could remember her name) found a microchip, but it wasn't registered within Maricopa County. She went the extra mile and contacted several people before deciding to keep him overnight. They found him a foster home a couple days later and they NEVER even considered contacting the Humane Society (which I am eternally grateful for that).

jX7l0iuMr2Dh4I9VmKyIcg,U3Y7xT8KZwQilb__FGHeIQ,4m_hApwQ054v3ue_OxFmGw,4,4,1,5,"Patria is an upscale Spanish restaurant which is located on King Street West and Spadina Ave.  The entrance is right between the Patagonia building and the Condo 478 King Street West. If you see Weslodge Saloon on the right, you will see the Patria gate on the left. I also believe that these two restaurants are owned by the same owner and have the same executive chef 'Stuart Cameron'. I haven't been to Weslodge though. I might try it one day.

We came here today to celebrate my birthday. I asked a few people and decided to follow our Yelp Elite ""Soleil S."" She gave me many choices and Patria was one of them. Glad I came!

I would suggest anyone making a reservation before coming here. 

AMBIANCE (4/5)
Patria is more about elegance and style. The dining room is impressive. It seems to be either a romantic place for having a sweet date with your loved one or a meeting dinner place for business people. Sometimes, it's quite hard for me to distinguish between these romantic and elegant themes. I love how they decorated the dining room with lights and paintings. The high ceiling also brings out the light and space. It is gorgeous when you look down from the second floor. You can see the whole place and grab very lovely shots up there if you love photography. The washrooms are also on the 2nd floor lol. So eventually, you will get a chance to see the view from 2nd floor.

PRICE (3/5)
Do you like tapas? I do! However, I agree with some reviews that mentioned how expensive Patria is. Some dishes have reasonable prices, and I am ok with them. But some dishes seem overpriced such as the Secreto Iberico or the Shoulder Blade Pork (if I'm not wrong). It is $41. Don't get me wrong! I'm not an expert on meat. Maybe the cost of pork itself already expensive!?  

FOOD ($4/5)
Our server suggested that most of their dishes are small and meant to be shared so we should order 3-4 items per person. So we decide to order 2 Paellas and some small plates for sharing.

Let me start with my most favourite items. All prices shown are the dinner prices.

1) Dátiles (4.75/5). Dates + House Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas ($10). Everyone love bacon? Aww..Yummy! Bacon wrapped dates is the winner of the night. I could eat ten of them but I need my tummy for something else too. ^^ .

2) Croquetas de Jamón (4.25/5). Jamón Serrano + Aioli ($12). I know this item looks very simple. They are fried breadcrumbed rolls filled with mashed potatoes and ham. Could you make it at home? Yes, but tonight I love to enjoy these cutie rolls in my mouth lol. They were very crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Simple is best delicious!

3) PULPO (4/5). Spanish Octopus + Potato + Paprika + Olive Oil ($20). Isn't it a habit to order Pulpo whenever you go to a Spanish restaurant? I have no idea. I just know it was always good.

4) Paella Patria (4/5). Seafood Paella ($59 for a large size) comes with Shrimp + Mussels + Calamari + Fish + Snap Peas + Clams + Saffron. The Paella takes about 45 mins to be ready. They have small and large sizes. It is good for sharing.

5) PAELLA DE CARRILLADA (4/5). Pedro Ximénez Braised Beef Cheek + Black Garlic + Bone Marrow + Artichoke ($34 for a small size). I couldn't make a decision which paella was better than the other one between the Seafood Paella and the Beef Cheek Paella. I don't really eat beef.  I can eat everything on the same plate or little pieces of beef if it is mixed with something. But I'm not the fan of beef. I like the rice on the Paella plate though. It was very tasty! Oh My God!

6) PATATAS BRAVAS (3.75/5). Crispy Potato + Spicy Tomato + Fried Egg ($11). It was a very simple dish but it tasted good lol. It came with a fried egg on the top of potatoes and spicy tomato sauce. Then, the runner (a person who served our food) will mix the egg, potatoes and sauce in front of you.

7) BRUSSEL BRAVAS (3/5). Brussel Sprouts + Spicy Tomato + Aioli + Chorizo ($12). I love to eat brussel sprouts whenever I go to a bar or restaurant. It's a good pair with beer, I believe. This dish was a-OK for me but I won't order it again though.

8) COCA TRUFA (3/5). Rapini + Winter Truffle + Fontina + Roasted Garlic ($18). It was crispy but nothing special.

9) SECRETO IBERICO (2.5/5). Ibérico Pork Flank + Piquillo Pepper Jam ($41). I enjoy eating pork, pork hock, pork neck and any pork products. However, the Secreto Iberico wasn't my thing. It was pricey and a small portion.

DRINK ($75)
- BARAHONDA 'CAMPO ARRIBA' ($75). I know nothing about wine but I love this wine lol. Glad that we ordered it!

SERVICE (4/5)
Excellent service. Food was a bit slow. We thought that they forgot our Secreto Iberico because it didn't come till we finished our paellas. So we had to ask our server to check it for us. It came out a short time later but it wasn't worth the wait.

Totally different atmosphere and dining experience. It's a pretty romantic setup. When we went (around 8pm on a Thursday), there weren't too many people there.  I felt like the service was good. They didn't treat us like second rate citizens even though we were in casual clothes and I was carrying my backpack (typical student outfit).

We had the tuna tartare, which was lovely. Then, we tried the duck with gnocchi and spinach which was also delicious and a great blend of flavors. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, which was just ok. It looked pretty, but the flavors weren't anything special. Oh, they also had really nice house made bread that came to our table warm, crusty and crunchy outside and soft inside.

Overall, Casbah was a good experience, but I'm not drooling as I think back to the meal. I'm not sure I'll go back because there are other places to try and the price point makes it somewhere I wouldn't just go to on a normal day.",2015-03-14 23:09:34

My second visit I had the El Diablo burger and a couple of cocktails. Both were quite good, but again the staff did not at all seem like they wanted to be there, no smiles, fairly inattentive.

Checking in was a breeze and after a few minutes I found myself on the 26th floor of a 1 bedroom 1200 sq foot suite.  I was disappointing to find that they lock the balconies so you can't access them.  They said it was for security purposes but I've stayed at other hotels in Vegas with balconies and have always been able to use them.  The 1 bedroom suite had a huge tub in between the bedroom and the living room.  There was a full kitchen and 2 bathrooms.

Charleston Festival is a dinky strip mall located across the street from CSN Las Vegas anchored by a WalMart neighbourhood market store. 

Chipotle is a soulless chain of faux-Mexican, originally invested in by McDonald's, conceived by some guy from Colorado. 

All this shit is off the top of my head, so if it is incorrect, don't blame me. 

Blame yourself for not already knowing the correct story. 

I come in -- sometimes, I just skip passed the dumbasses studying the menu board -- and, a few minutes later, I am out with bag in hand on my way to jaywalking back to CSN. 

They hold promotions at the start of most semesters (buy one get one free) and for Hallow's Eve during fall (1$ or 2$ burrito when one wears a costume)(Medical/dental students: quit trying to fuck it up for everyone by arguing your dumbass uniform is a costume. Corny ass clowns).

This location has a lot of turnover (is it called that?) with its assembly line crew.  Perhaps -- similar to CSN students -- they graduate to bigger pastures. Or, even, more likely, drop out.

In any case, it is as dependable as CSN, and similarly makes one wonder why is it that the charges end up being so damn high. (Because, the rent is always ... too ... damn ... high!) - E",2013-12-01 15:49:13

I've never had a bad meal here, and the food is always interesting. The menu changes constantly, which is fun too. They have a stable, non-changing menu (well, it's seasonal, but it doesn't change very week), and a list of items that change almost weekly up on the wall chalkboard.

I have to admit that I've never had any of their non-rotating menu options, but hear that the kobe meatloaf is quite good. Because their menu changes constantly, I cannot tell you what to get, but I assure you that you'll be pleased with your meal, whatever your choice. The servers are also very willing to give advice (indeed, sometimes their opening description of the options can get a little TOO involved).

My only complaint about Avenue B is the noise level. If you come in around 5:30 to 6:30. the noise level is perfectly acceptable. Or, come on a weekday. But, once the dining room fills up, it can be hard to hear a table-mate across a four top. I personally find that unacceptable, and am disappointed in the number of new restaurants in Pittsburgh that share this problem (Cure is another example). I understand that acoustics are difficult to manage in old buildings, but there are solutions that can be used.

Ok... you you kept reading, so I assume you want to hear the rest of the story. I have been to this place twice before because of Groupon deal of a year worth of oil changes for $60. The service had been ok-to-mediocre before, but today was truly the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Let me start from the beginning. When my GF purchased the oil-for-a-year deal, and I took the car in, I was given a flimsy paper card with handwritten notes on the backside and that was to be my 'proof' that I had paid for this service. I kept this card for the first two oil changes (roughly 6 months) but I misplaced it and could not find it for today's visit, so I was denied service. Now, they have a computer system that keeps a record of the services offered, car make and model, license plate, customer name and contact information, but somehow they cannot make a simple note that I purchased the yearly service. Despite seeing I had paid $0 for my previous two services and that there was a Groupon code entered, the attendant still told me there was nothing he could do because the coupon codes were not the same in both visit (what that means..). 

Since I had already made the trip, I decided to look online and see if there was another 'deal' I could buy. I found one and I bought it. That is when things turned ugly QUICK. Here is a short list of the atrocious 'things' that took place:


1) Before buying the second groupon I decided to ask if I could use it right away. The person at the front counter had NO idea how the groupon could be redeemed. She literally said, ""you can buy it but I do not know if you can redeem it right now...that is Groupon's deal"" REALLY? They have a promotion and do not understand or even know about it? She was snappy about it and made me feel like I was a sub-standard customer for wanting to buy the deal. If you do not want me to buy it, do not publish it.

2) The groupon includes a tire rotation. The technician did NOT have the right tools to rotate my tires and somehow blamed me for it. I have had my tires rotated at other service centers but NEVER had to give them a special key for the lug nuts which the technician was asking for. What's even worse, I had been to this place twice before for the same 'service' so either they LIED and never rotated my tires before, or they just didn't feel like doing it today.

3) The technician had ""NO CLUE"" as to how to reset the 'service engine' light and  told me he had forgotten. Really?!? Is this the first time the have serviced a 2010 Totoya Venza? I fail to believe a mechanic shop does not have some sort of reference card on how to do something as simple as reset a service light. I had to go online and do it myself while he was shuffling pages in my owner's manual.

4) I was basically FORCED to buy a cabin air filter from them. As I was ready to pay, one of the shop mechanics comes for the typical up-sell and shows me a filter that looked like it was ripped out of place and has the nerve to tell me it was like that and that I should buy a new one to replace it. Give that it was bent and torn and probably was going to cause damage by having it put back it, I had to shell out $25 bucks for them to change it. Air filters do not bend and tear while in use...unless you bend and tear them up yourself. It is not about the $25, it's about the 'gotcha' principle-- I bought a discounted service, so now they are going to get me for all I am worth.

5) When I was driving away I noticed they had not even placed the normal maintenance sticker on the windshield!!! For all I know they may have not even changed the oil at all. 

I am usually not one to complain, but seriously... STAY AWAY.",2013-02-11 23:29:52

We went at 11:30 because I had read that it fills up at peak times. We were only the second table in there but within about 15 minutes the place was packed so that was a good choice.

We decided to share takoyaki to start because I have been seeing pictures of them and thought that they looked delicious. However, I totally forgot an important thing.... I don't like octopus. I am not particularly picky and usually like most things but on a high school exchange trip to Kyoto I tried it.... And really didn't like it.

I ordered the wonton tonkatsu ramen with extra pork belly and egg and my friend had the kanban also with pork belly and egg. Since I have never had ramen before I don't have anything to compare it to but I can honestly say that it was delicious. The broth was good, especially after I added some togorashi.

Anyways, he kept talking about how awesome this place Hot Feel was. Let me be honest for a second, getting invited to a restaurant called Hot Feel by another guy can come off as a little odd, but he then mentioned that this place has got it going on and you use your hands and get down and dirty. Okay so maybe that is not the best way to invite someone either... Once past the jokes and puns that I'm sure I through at him I replied with a simple answer of Hell Yes ill go to Hot Feel with you. I had seen pictures he had posted on his facebook of the interior and the food and I was down to try it out.

I rolled in to the parking lot to be greeted by a HUGE shrimp on the front of the building which really stands out in the parking lot that they happen to be in and once you walk in it is pretty surprising, the way the booth/tables are set up is pretty cool, It is private yet not too private.... I only say that because me being 6'5 I am much taller than the average customer was that night and I could basically sit in my chair and perch over to see what everyone around us was doing, But the interior was cool none the less. 

Now onto the nitty gritty, the menu came to the table and we were off to the races, Sooner than you could rip the head off a shrimp we had king crab, and hot pots with what looked like an endless supply of sticks hanging out of it on our table as well as spicy beef skewers. I say spicy loosely because I love extreme hot food and according to my trusty taste buds with who I trust with my stomach would have to call out that the ""HOT"" on the menu was not hot enough for me, but to some at our table you would have thought someones long lost grandma just passed with all the tears being shed.

De l'extérieur, ça ressemble à une maison hantée durant l'Halloween. Plusieurs personnes hésitent avant de pénétrer dans son antre obscur. Sa décoration monstrueuse, ses graffitis multicolores, sa saleté, enfin bref, les Foufounes électriques regroupe tous les ingrédients pour créer le bar « trash » parfait...

Le premier étage est souvent plus calme que le deuxième. Pool, grand bar, tables et chaises, musique variée et toilettes au sous-sol. Au deuxième, ça se bouscule souvent : piste de danse et scène pour les spectacles, dépendamment du moment. D'ailleurs, plusieurs grands groupes de grunge, de punk et d'alternatif s'y sont déjà retrouvés (Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Misfits, etc.) Pour ma part, j'étais allé voir Protest the Hero, et bien que la scène fût petite, et l'ambiophonie un peu discordante, l'ambiance de la foule passionnée était venue tout réparer.

Malgré son apparence, les Foufs reçoit des gens de tous les styles, même qu'il a pris un tournant très significatif depuis les dernières années. La semaine est bourrée de soirées thématiques afin de toucher le plus d'adhérents possible. Les nombreux spéciaux sur l'alcool renforcent les affluences de fêtards. Les Mardi à GoGo, le pichet n'est que 5,50$...et vous pourrez vous rincer les oreilles d'un bon vieux Rock and Roll old School. Lorsqu'il y a des frais d'entrée, c'est que ça se passe au 2e étage. Autrement, c'est au premier. Les Samedi Éclectiques sont aussi très populaires et attirent les mordus de punk, de metal et de hardcore (entrée 8$). Assez mouvementé merci...ça peut finir en trash violent... 

Le jeudi, c'est la très fameuse Soirée des Dames, au deuxième (5$). Quatre consommations gratuites à toute personne du sexe féminin (c'est injuste). Inutile de dire que ça se gorge en moins de deux. À bon entendeur; cette soirée attire tellement de gens (dont une flopée de célibataires en chaleur), que ça finit par être vraiment désagréable. L'on est tellement empaqueté qu'il faut prendre son trou pour danser, certains sautillent avec leur bière en main (très brillant) et la renversent, la musique du DJ casse les oreilles avec les pires hits de l'heure, et malheur à vous si votre vessie remplie ressent le besoin de se vider, car la file d'attente pour rejoindre les autres compartiments (toilettes, bars, terrasse externe) commence parfois à même le tourbillon de danse, ce qui complique les choses, non?...",2010-12-22 17:15:19

If you're looking for soufflé, which apparently this place is 'known' for, 1) it's not worth your $10 here, 2) not worth your time either and 3) Google soufflé and you'll probably find much better ones downtown Toronto. Do not settle for any soufflés just because of distance.

Yes, soufflé is supposed to be airy and fluffy... but not to the point that you felt like you only ate air. The airiness of the soufflé here is way too airy with almost no texture to it whatsoever. The only texture I had was the top because it was a bit burnt, and the little glass of mango sauce was just a weird combo. The flavours were also lacking, which justifies to what I said about eating air.

As you've probably seen from the other reviews here, they take a LONG time making the soufflés. And if you wonder why, besides the honest truth that soufflés is best served fresh and that they do take a bit of time to make, take a look into the kitchen and notice that there is only 'one' person working there. Are they unable to hire an assistant chef or does the chef there really think she can handle the whole kitchen alone?  

Things here are also way overpriced for what they think they're worth. Other dessert places that recently opened nearby are apparently having way more customers. Tsk tsk to the chef/owner here.",2014-12-07 02:44:45

In fact I'm a little irriated it's not already.  4.5+ on Yelp usually leads to little notoriety so thankfully I saw the stellar, spot-on review from Doug T. which lead me to this Phoenix gem.

The P and I were in the Hood visiting her Mother who has lived in the area since the early 70's,  Let me tell you, I'm a whole lot more excited to visit the Mother-in-law now that I know Tacos Kissi is a close-by lunch option.

Lunch consisted of four street tacos, two each of the carna asada and al Pastor.  Both fantastic!  Now keep in mind, these are street tacos, i.e. a couple of bites each-one or two tacos will not fill up a typical male carnivore.  Also, based on a Yelp tip, we went with the Ruby Roll (Mexican Sushi).  I know it's early in the year but I may have already discovered my favorite meal of 2016. Tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, fried rice, more tempura- WOW, amazing!  They bring out spicy mayo, soy sauce, and I think hoisin sauce-not sure but I can tell you it was fantastic.  On top of the hoisin sauce I drizzled some of their best-in-class salsa from the salsa bar.

Did someone say Salsa Bar?  Aside from the Pico, the salsa is hot and hotter with some of the  best flavors I've ever enjoyed in any salsa.  Clearly homemade with excellent heat, notes of cilantro and lime- they should bottle it and sell it. The bar also has onions, cabbage, pickled carrots, etc to top your chips and tacos.  Chips, of course, are complimentary.

The service was excellent, very friendly and quick to bring out the food,  The restaurant is spotless, very clean and welcoming.  If you're a taco fan, this is without a doubt some of the best Phoenix has to offer.",2016-01-11 02:55:15

I enjoyed the lamb korma and chicken makhani entrees.  Both had lots of flavour and the right amount of spices but was creamy and sweet.

The planes- easily the nicest planes for domestic flights. Seats are roomier, nicer (leather) and each seat gets its own TV and video games- and this is in economy. Also you can order food and drinks to your seat through the touch screen- no need to ring the annoying call button. The planes are lighted inside like a disco in purple and neon pink. You can often upgrade to main cabin elite or first class for cheap the day of your flight if they aren't booked. There are also electrical outlets which are sweet on coast to coast flights. 

The staff- are always super nice and generally quite attractive to boot. Even the people at the check in counter who usually at other airlines are pretty grumpy are always nice, efficient, and professional.

The other boasts a scoop of rich chocolate ice cream and sliced fresh bananas dripping with silky chocolate syrup. The crêpe is huge, so sharing is highly recommended. One notable feature is that some parts of the crêpe are crispy, almost like a biscuit, which some people really like. I personally prefer the usual soft texture. 

I ordered the New York Cheesecake with a choice of purée, and I opted for blueberry. Although they garnished my cake with real blueberries, the ""purée"" didn't taste like blueberries at all!

Second of all, my friends and I didn't exactly have the greatest service.

If you like your tapioca and jellies, I would recommend the 'three guys' milk tea. It comes with tapioca, grass jelly and pudding. When you are done the drink, it feels like you've eaten a meal because there is so much to eat in the cup.

Pros:
Open 24 hours
Food court built right inside

Cons:
Not many parking spots near entrance
Mainly Korean items

When I used to work evenings a lot, I loved coming here after a shift.  There's something about grocery shopping at 1 in the morning.  It's nice and quiet and you can go at your own pace.  Being open 24 hours, it's a very convenient thing to have.

The supermarket is very large and carries a good amount of selection.  It's mainly composed of Korean brand items which is no surprise.  If you're looking for Chinese and Japanese items you might need to look elsewhere.  The produce here is usually pretty good.  The prices are cheaper than the Metro's and the Loblaws type supermarkets in the city.  

There's a lot of prepared food here.  They're made fresh daily and can be bought for a quick meal for the busy individual.  They even have a section of freshly made Korean side dishes. These are the side dishes are like the ones everyone is familiar with when you eat at a Korean restaurant.

Another thing I like is they have a food court built right into the supermarket.  There's are 4-5 stalls that serve Korean and Japanese food.  I've eaten here a couple of times and they're all pretty good.  You will see families come here to have a meal and do their shopping all in one place.

One thing to note is the parking situation.  There's about 25 spots near the entrance.  Once those are filled, you probably need to drive around back to find more parking.  

It's nice to know that no matter the time, this place will always be open for your grocery needs.  They also have a point card which lets you collect rewards for shopping here.  It's always good to get something back for buying things usually need in the first place.",2015-08-06 11:16:36

Everything is made to order, fresh and consistently good.  Like really good.  The gyros are out of this world and the french fries are the best around.  They're those fries that aren't shoestring but aren't steak fries - the perfect thickness on fries without a doubt.  
The gyros are the star of the show here - lamb, tomatoes, onions all in a soft, warm pita and that freaking marvelous tzatziki sauce.  The hubs spices his up with some hot sauce but I like mine as is.  
I've also tried the grilled chicken sandwich - holy mother delicious.  Perfectly seasoned and grilled chicken along with lettuce, tomato, onions and feta cheese (is there anything on earth betta than feta?!) inside a warm pita.  So good.
We usually get a piece of baklava to go and that satisfies our sweet tooth and then some.  Layer after layer of sweet, sticky, flaky goodness that's just too delicious to pass up.  Suggestion: take it home and nuke it for about 15 seconds.  You're welcome.  
The place is always clean, never super crowded and the employees there are so wonderful.  Very personable, cool, easy to talk to and always treat us like friends coming over for dinner, not just random customers.
My only complaint is that they close kind of on the early side (I think 8pm) and they're not open on Sundays.  But at the same time, I can appreciate that they're closed on Sundays to allow employees a day of rest.  Right on.

I have always loved Peruvian food since I had the opportunity to travel in Peru for 2 weeks years ago. It left a great impression on me and I've always loved to try new Peruvian restaurant. 

There are two of us and we shared 5 dishes in total. Overall it's a good experience. For what's worth, the portion is also good. The tastes are a bit of hit or miss to be honest, and the service was good but could be a bit better.

We had two apps. The beef heart skewers app is one of the best beef hearts I've had in life. You have to eat it with the ube, potato, egg and sauce in the dish together. The other app is a Peruvian flavour infused tamale dish - one single tamale topped with bunch of raw onion which I found it a bit bland and overpriced. Maybe the flavour is how it's supposed to be but I do find this dish a bit disappointing.  

We had two main - a stir fry beef with linguine, and a Spanish style seafood fried rice. Portion was good and flavour is great. Wish there was a bit of more cheese on both dish. 

We also ordered the mixed ceviche. It was served in an authentic way - with sweet potato, Peruvian corn (kernel is light yellow and huge) and roasted corn kernels, just like the one I had in Peru. The taste is a bit too citrus to my taste though probably because the whole dish was soaked in the citrus soup for too long. I understand the idea is to cook the fish with the acidity. I think if we have the option to have the sweat potato and corns on the side instead of soaked in the citrus juice so their favour remain sweet and neutral, it might be more balanced when you eat them with the fish together.

The dessert menu is a bit of disappointing to be honest. There are 4 options, a cookie, a brownie, a custard, and sponge cake. Maybe it's just to me but both of us didn't find them sound appetizing so we ended up getting dessert somewhere else.  

The server we had was nice and attentive. The only thing we would say is over the 5 dishes, we had three different servers bring our dishes but none of them offered to explain what the dishes are. I think for a relatively pricy and fusion-ish restaurant with lots of international ingredients, it is sort of expected to have the server introduce the dish to its first time customers. 

I love Peruvian food so I might return but I hope the restaurant can improve their dishes and dessert offering.",2018-01-07 02:50:18

OK now that is out of my system, I can continue. We've been to Buca before (visited the location in Columbus probably about 8-10 times with friends for group dinners) so we know the concept and that it's about sharing and all that jazz. We ended up at this location on Sunday night when we were trying to find *gasp* TGI Fridays. Well let me save you a drive to this part of town and tell you that Fridays is no longer there. Anyway, we saw Buca and decided to suck it up and eat there. We had about a five minute wait and then were led back through the kitchen (as you are at any Buca) to our table. We had some confusion with our service because at one point we were told our waitress got a big party and wouldn't be handling our table anymore, and then she did for the rest of our night. Weird.

Unfortunately the food was not as good as we remembered. The cheese garlic bread was cut into squares and wasn't served in a pie shaped. The caesar salad was under-dressed, but as a plus it held up nicely as a leftover for me to have the next night for dinner. Chris thought the chicken parm was not as good as it used to be (we think they changed the recipe or something). My side of fettucini alfredo was good thankfully and heated up nicely on Tuesday night as my dinner. All and all, the food was a major disappointment even for chain restaurant standards!

The bright spot was that for $69 (includes tip) we got four meals out of the food we ordered. Buca was a 2.5 star experience for us, but I'm rounding down to 2 due to not living up to our standards.",2009-02-12 00:00:07

The one delivered to her school had been cut and deboned and I felt it would be a better for my family. Well upon calling they told me they don't cut or platter turkeys. Fine. Maybe the school was an exception. So I have my husband call and place an order. He calls at 8:34am and speaks with a boy named Jon. He's advised of the different types of turkeys and their pricing. Jon then tells him it's best we order in person. So I go into Smiths and ask for a turkey order for Thanksgiving and was told but some random chick in the deli that they were all out. When I explained my husband had just talked to a Jon 30 mins prior she told me I had been mistaken because he was the department manager and he knew they were all sold out. When Jon arrived to the counter he yelled at me that he didn't speak with my husband because he was in the back prepping orders for the past 6 hours. When I asked, ""then how did my husband get your name then?"" his reply was, ""I don't know. Your husband is dumb because he didn't talk to me."" So I had my husband go up there. He tried to speak with the store manager who blew him off. The store manager told my husband that him and Jon had been friends for years and Jon wouldn't say anything like that. Obviously they're really good friends. In the end the manager must have known my husband was telling the truth because he spoke with Jon and had him make us a turkey they ""supposedly"" were all out of and at a discount.

Maybe it's because I am grateful to say I had never been to an ICU before, but I think there's a damn good reason it's so costly. That room was sterile, but bright, plenty of room, and a nurse was always right outside, monitoring! I visited ICU for about a month. 

PT and OT were great, so patient, so professional, and so compassionate. They came to the Acute unit for about another month until he was transferred to TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) Rehab facility in a different state.

Good prices on drafts from $3.50 to $4.75 depending on imported or domestic beers as well as if there is entertainment. It's pub food, and you get what you pay for. The Irish nachos are addicting as well as fish & chips. The burgers are large and good for the price.

I never imagined that Korean grocery can take up a complete market and I'm so glad I was WRONG.  You probably know by now I've never stepped inside a PAT Central Market when I visit downtown, but I have passed by it many times.

It definitely has resemblance to T&T Supermarket in terms of ORGANIZATION, cleaniness and variety.  I wouldn't say it is ALL Korean products as I do see some Japanese and Chinese as well especially in the Tea aisle where I had to read the product description to realize Korean Tea products don't really have Tea in them.

I even tried some Korean POPCORN that look so much better than regular popcorn as they are puffed like a balloon but they remind me of Breakfast Cereal.

The corner Food Court seems to be an after-thought as it seems to be a run-down area but still have some Korean patrons and a few group of students that keep the 3 businesses(Japanese, Korean, Coffee shop) afloat.

The MEAT section of Beef looks so AWESOME.  I wish I knew how to cook Beef Rib Korean-style because those looked amazing.  I passed by the Pastry section which didn't really peaked my interest as it looked identical to T&T to a point.  TOFU had it's own fridge to itself and I realize it even states ORGANIC.

Vegetable section was A-OK but what I was interested in was something they even put a PRINT-OUT next to, to display a description and how to cook it, SESAME LEAF(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perilla).  It looks like it is simply an ingredient in an omelette as displayed, INTERESTING.

Unfortunately had a terrible experience, which heavily skewed the review. Waited 38 minutes between ordering and getting plated. The beef in the bimbapbap was actually inedible. I had to remove it from the dish, basically paying $15 for a rice bowl. It was not busy but we were forgotten about with no water or coffee refills. Then when asking for a box, they threw out the only meal worthy of boxing to go. They graciously didn't charge for the 2 coffees...

We walked in just after noon on a weekday and the place was empty. The restaurant honestly didn't look like it'd been cleaned in decades, and the surly proprietor didn't exactly allay the decidedly unwelcome vibe.

Still, I was in the mood for a shawarma, so I decided to go with the Chicken Shawarma Wrap with all the fixins. It was ready a few minutes later and it's much, much better than I was expecting.

Everything works; the chicken is crispy but not dry, the garlic sauce is potent but not overpowering, and the veggies are placed perfectly throughout. The joint's even taken the extra step of shredding those pink pickled radishes, which is actually a genius move. (I usually ask for those to be omitted because they're so strong and crunchy.) The finished product's placement in the press ensures that it's hot and devoid of sogginess.

The ambience is fantastic and for being the second night the service was flawless. 

We had several types of margaritas. I really liked the frozen passion fruit but if you like cachaca try the pineapple Batida. The custom guacamole is an awesome concept and adding that perfectly cooked bacon along with mango and pineapple was mind altering. The chips were hot and salty and perfect. 

Next came the wings... In a fish sauce caramel. OMG. They're everything I could ever ask for and reminded me of the first fish sauce wings I had at PokPok. All of the tacos were delicious but perhaps a little spicy for the average palate. I like spicy, so a lot of them ended up on my plate.

We had the worse experience ever last Thurs evening, we went for dinner (that was OK at best) in the coffee shop.

Then we wanted to sit and have a relaxing drink in the bar in the lobby !!!! What a mistake -
Should of been a clue when ALL the tables were dirty except for that 1, so we sat there.  We waited at least 15 minutes no cocktail waitress or anyone came, so my husband went to the bar, he waited at least 10-14 more minutes (the bartender) acted like she did not even see him ""he was the only one standing there"".  OK, so he then got the attention of the cocktail waitress who takes care of the slot machine area (free to those customers I might add), now she proceeded to tell him sit down and I'll be with you soon.  So he did, we waited at least 10 more minutes (with much frustration I might add), especially when there were people with FREE coupons getting drinks from the bartender.

Personally, I still go out of my way for one thing: The Costco. Because I don't have a minivan full of kids to feed, having a membership is pointless for me.

Atmosphere and service were great all-around but there was a noticeable gap between appetizers and entrees.  Of the appetizers, the scallop (one) stood out and the tender squid was fantastic. I'd pass on the dry meatballs. The bacon sounded good but I didn't try it; I just heard the crisp from the other end of a large table. 

Entrees were meh. Portions were tiny for the price. My filet was overcooked and the meat was tough to cut into. Salmon portion was also laughable and I noticed four differently-sized pieces on four plates. I'm sure they go by weight over shape/size but still, perception trumps reality. The red velvet cake I had was dry and bland. Among the worst I've had for the price.  

Halfway through dinner, a live DJ starting spinning house tracks. I don't think it fit the restaurant vibe and average age of patrons. I found it slightly off-putting and made it difficult to hear my dinner party. Another tip: park next door at NM (one minute walk) for free and avoid the valet.

After looking over a few yelp reviews and knowing our deep love for muscles and fine wine, I figured this place would hit the spot. Georges Brasserie is a suave place tucked away in Piedmont Row that is serving up some serious French eats and great French wine.

Our reservations were for Saturday, so naturally the place was packed. We started by looking over the wine list and were delighted to see many options. While more familiar with Italian and California wines, we settled on a French Chianti and were delighted by the Sommelier who helped us make a great informed decision. Moving to the meal, we started with the fiery mussels and the escargot. Let me start by saying the serving of fiery mussels is enormous and amazingly delicious. Seriously though, we spent over half an hour sipping wine and mowing down muscles. Granted, I may have been slowed down by dipping several slices of bread into the sauce. Our waiter reminded us several times that they have bottomless muscles on Tuesdays, so I plan on making a return! The escargot was also as good as expected. After completing our appetizers, we realized we were stuffed and would end our meal on a high note.

I will say the overall experience that night was bittersweet. While I appreciated the decor and arrangement, the tables are spaced way to close to one another which caused issues for us during our dinner. For starters, my wife was hit / had her chair kicked by hurried staff on multiple occasions throughout the night. While I understand the place is busy, it detracted from our pricey dinner and date night out. In addition the overall space was very loud since everyone is on top of one another. I hope to head this off next time we visit by requesting specific tables that were more out of the way. In the end, the meal was amazing and I look forward to visiting this place again soon.

First course was a fresh Au Crudo style fish, ahi with preserved lemon and serrano infused oil.  This presented very nicely, with the additional flower garnish and had a very fresh and simple flavor--pared with the 2013 Chalk Hill Viognier from Russian River Valley.

This was composed of endive, apples, feta and candied walnuts all dressed with a wonderful dijonette.  Exceptional fall season salad and was pared with 2013 Chalk Hill Estates Chardonnay from the Russian River Valley.  The chardonnay pared well with this seasonal salad.  The third course was Hudson Valley Foie Gras Torchon accompanied with apricot puree and toasted points.  The torchon had a wonderful creaminess, and richness.  This was plated extremely well and tasted fabulous.  Matched with 2012 Roth Pinot Noir from Sonoma Coast.  Normally with this course I choose a sweet wine; however, this pinot selected was fantastic--great color and cherry flavors, an excellent choice.  Main course was a wonderful Bison filet with a bing cherry-madeira gastrique (sauce) accompanied with vanilla scented yam puree and Romanesco and chanterelle mushrooms.  Delightful dish, present beautifully and this was pared with 2009 Lancaster Estate cabernet sauvignon from Napa Valley.  This wine was bold, wonderful rich color and enhanced the bison filet.

I get that those things happen, but with this particular Home Depot location nothing is ever quite right.  Finding help is impossible and after your endless search finally locates someone, they typically haven't a clue (paint department is the clear exception, they are great).  When I asked the guy at the return counter how it is that a used product is re-shelved and sold as a new item, his response was ""I dunno, ya want another one?""  When I said yes he said ""ok, go get it"".  

The irony to all this is that on my way to Home Depot I nearly decided to go to Lowes as it's almost a guarantee that Home Depot will not have the right products, stock or assistance to help.  Now I remember why I prefer Lowes.

And the madagascar vanilla- can't describe the flavor all that well...only way I could describe it is to say it's got a more enhanced vanilla flavor.

Service was poor.  Our water glasses were never refilled.

When the food came, the lobster had a fishy, horrible ammonia order.  When we told the server to take it back, she said, ""I thought it smelled bad, as well!""  What?  Really?  So, why did you bring it to the table if you knew it was bad?  Bad choice!  The two fried shrimp dishes were served with a tiny cup of cocktail sauce and fries.  One order had a heaping amount of fries and the second only had a few small pieces.  The fries were lukewarm.  We asked the server twice to please bring additional cocktail sauce.  She said, ""well, that comes from the kitchen!""  Well, go to the kitchen and get it, please!  After at least a 10 minute wait, it was brought out.  By then, the shrimp was cold.  Fail!

The location is easy to access from the 215. Parking is easy since it's in a corporate parkway with plenty of parking. The inside of the restaurant is simple with about half a dozen tables. Most of the seating is outside. It didn't seem like seating was an issue since most people were getting their orders to go. 

The menu offers a nice variety of options. They serve breakfast as well as lunch. For lunch the paninis can be vegetarian with options for mushrooms or eggplant in place of meat. For meat eaters there are a couple of meat options. Even though I'm not vegetarian the option for mushroom or eggplant in place of meat sounded delicious.

Sharing is caring so like usual we shared everything we ordered for lunch. The Tuna Sandwich was the memorable savory item we enjoyed. The tuna was delicious and lacked any sort of fishy taste. Mixed in was olives and the sandwich was topped with egg and some other vegetables. The sandwich flavors reminded me of a Nicoise salad. I loved this and would definitely order it again. The Pesto Panini which we ordered with chicken and bacon was also good. The bread and other ingredients worked well together. I liked dressed on the simple greens to the side of each sandwich too.

For a sweet ending to our lunch we enjoyed Tiramisu and a Chocolate Croissant. Both were excellent. The Tiramisu had the perfect texture and taste. The first bite made me stop and close my eyes to savor the delicious flavor. The Chocolate Croissant was flaky and the chocolate was delicious.

""Don"", our waiter takes our order. We would like the Famous Prime Rib. ""We are TOTALLY OUT of prime rib"". That statement says that there is no more in the vicinity.

Less than 5 minutes later, the salads come out and the gentleman next to me orders the thick cut prime rib from our waiter, Don.  Interesting... 

We get told after inquiring that the prime rib was not ready when we ordered it a few minutes ago, but IT'S READY NOW BITCHES!!!

We felt like we got bamboozled and the management wouldn't do anything to set things right. Don looked at his times on his receipts and said that the couple ordered it a good fifteen minutes after our orders.

In the end, the management would not make things right with their paying regulars. Management gives us a comment card. PASHAAAAAAH!!!???!!!  I'm giving a very low rate because of the management.

Diners, Drive-ins & Dives raved about it! Native Pittsburghers raise it to Untouchable status. In fact, it seems nearly sacrilege to live in Pittsburgh and not love Primanti Brothers.

Quite frankly, though, there isn't much to love. I've lived in Pittsburgh for three years, and everyone who visits demands a trip to Primanti Brothers. So I take them. I've been more times than I care to admit, so I feel more than qualified to bash this place.

I'ma break it down for you piece by piece.

1. The Bread: Folks love the bread! It's thickly-sliced and freshly baked! It makes the sandwich unmanageably large, though; you spend more time mashing the sandwich into a fittable size than you do actually eating it. Additionally, the bread is so thick it overpowers the meat and sticks to the roof of your mouth in a most unpleasant manner. 

2. The Meat: Really bad quality. The ""steak"" is worse than Steak-ums. It's actually worse than the rubber mats that line the floor behind the bar. Saying it has flavor is a compliment. And the ""Big Fish""? Gag. Van de Kamps. If that. 

3. The Cole Slaw: Tastes like cabbage that's been soaked in vinegar. It has crunch, but that's about all it has.

4. The French Fries. Meh. Bland.

The only constructive criticism I could give them is that they need to serve 'sides' (perhaps tuna salad, macaroni salad, cole slaw, etc.) to complement a typical meal there.  They also need to open up the large dining area (when I was there it didn't seem like we were allowed back there), because the main dining area is small and a bit cramped.

Diana's Seafood is located on Lawrence Avenue between Birchmount and Warden.  With a restaurant and storefront, you cannot miss the blue canopy that hovers over their patio.

The interiors remind you of a shoddy imitation of Harbour Sixty with portholes and swinging doors.  Unfortunately attention to detail is lacking as black and white photographs were hung without the use of a leveler (maybe we're on a sinking ship, in which case I may have just lost my appetite), coffees came without spoons or stirring utensils, and a pen not provided for us to sign our receipt.

While I appreciate that the owners at Diana's Seafood have taken a risk and tried to bring higher end dining to suburbia - there is much to be learned at prep school before they reach that level of sophistication.

You walk in to the bar and oyster station as the restaurant opens up towards the rear to a small sitting area.  I can't help but think of poor restaurant design as the layout made for a lot of wasted space.  There is a covered patio, but I wouldn't want to be stuck out there in the dead of winter.

The menu is a single, double-sided laminated page with food on the front and beverages on the back.  A specials page is also provided.

I opted for a glass of Riesling (6 oz - $8) while my dining companion opted for a Heineken (.  My word to the wise - skip the wine here.  The Riesling was undrinkable, and after a few initial sips I abandoned ship.

To start we ordered the Sea Urchin ($14) which is served atop taro crisps and a slice of cucumber.  Sea urchin is one of those things that fall into the ""acquired taste"" category.  It is extremely creamy and rich in texture, with a slight bitter after taste to it which may turn some people off.  I thought the taro crisps were a great textural contrast.

We also ordered a mélange of oysters: Fanny Bay, Kumamoto, and Kusshi.  This was served with your choice of 3 sauces: vinaigrette, spicy cocktail sauce and Scotch Bonnet.

Diana's Fresh New England Style Clam Chowder ($8) underwhelmed.  It was creamy, but lacked any real clam flavour and had a few scant vegetables in it.

The Seafood Mixed Grill ($31) consisted of scallops, Black Tiger shrimp and grilled Atlantic salmon.  The scallops were lacking a seared crust, though cooked to the right consistency.  The Black Tiger shrimp were naturally sweet and the star of the three.  The salmon was flaky, though the outsides were a bit dry - I personally like my fish with skin-on to get that nice crust on the outside.  This was served with panko-crusted Pear William Potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  The potatoes were fluffy and creamy, and definitely more interesting than your usual mash.


To end off the evening we opted for the Apple & Pear Crumble ($8) which was also nothing to rave about.  The crumble topping was bland and the clumps were too big, but the filling with aromatic cinnamon was quite yummy.

V E R D I C T

All in all, I would have to say I was disappointed with my experience at Diana's Oyster Bar & Grill.  The service could've been forgivable if the food made up for it, but both were mediocre. The meal rang in at $111, which at that price, I could think of dozens of more memorable dining experiences than tonight's.

I left with the thought that I would come back for the oysters, but seeing as oysters require no cooking - that's not saying much.",2012-05-17 15:28:33

We got in, and it was, as expected, really crowded. Once we were seated on the much quieter second floor overlooking downstairs, we dived straight into the menus. 

A mix of good and bad, but mostly good. The apple cranberry margarita I ordered was strong, but I could not taste the apple cranberry at all. It tasted more like raspberry to me? We created our own guac to share and added smoked salmon, corn, and onion. We thought the salmon would be raw, but it wasn't. Still good, but a little disappointing. But their chips are tasty!

My chorizo tacos (chorizo, egg, cheese, cilantro) were great other than the mysterious sweet flavor that bothered me a little, partly because I didn't know where it was coming from. The tacos are not large, but I'd say two of them plus sharing an appetizer and dessert are perfectly enough for dinner. The churro/funnel cake we got for dessert was not good. I wanted it to be hotter and crispier, and I didn't think the fruitiness worked well with the rest of it. 

Interesting decor, good service, and good tacos.

They're only open until 2 pm, so you know that the food they are offering has been well thought out for breakfast food.  They offer lunch foods as well, but if you're going to a restaurant specializing in good breakfast foods, why pass up that opportunity?

Apparently this place is always packed, especially on the weekends.  Despite the longer wait for brunch, the wait staff is efficient and attentive.  Our waitress was actually really cool, and probably the best server i've had in a long time.

the coffee is good (they even offer free coffee while you wait for a table), the service prompt, and my omelette with avacado and salsa was huge and filling.

they don't offer any ""brunch specials"" like a full time restaurant, since they only do breakfast and lunch.  but i do think they said they have daily specials..none of which include the big breakfast for cheap including an alcoholic beverage.

that must be a new york thing, which i'm sadly missing.

then again, an alcoholic beverage with brunch is a different type of brunch.  brunch here is like ""hey bubba, why don't you bring on down some more of those fresh eggs for makin' some tasty treats?""  instead of ""you know what i heard about the lastest production of sven: the musical? ...pass me another mimosa...""

different all together.
apples and oranges.

though i like all kinds of fruit.
um...
too many places to take that.

so what i'm saying is..despite how this is an orange when i would like to have another apple, the orange was filling, satisfying, and enjoyable.

wow.  i have no idea how i pulled that one together.  but can you see all the places that could have gone???",2007-08-20 14:49:45

I've had this place bookmarked for a long time now, but never actually got to going because of the mixed reviews I was getting. Four and a half stars on yelp and a visiting friend from New York finally got me to pay this spot a visit. We ordered the gangnam combo for a party of three which was more than enough food. This combo is meant to feed two people for $66. The combo came with five kinds of meats, fresh oysters, quartered sweet corn on the cob, bibimbap or side of white rice, miso soup, and mushroom medley. All cuts were subpar in my opinion. Bulgogi was too sweet and chunks were not cut up. The filet mignon was my least favorite. The chunks were rather large. Putting in work for something tasty was worthwhile, but for meats that did not taste at all fresh, that's just asking for too much. The bibimbap was simply sweet rice and beef. Not much veggies and hot sauce mixed in like the typical bibimbap dish. My favorite part of he meal was probably the soon tofu we ordered in addition to the gangnam combo. Soup was tasty and the seafood bits aroused surprise with each bite. This place also does not cook your meat for you. So roll up your sleeves, tie back you hair, and get cooking!

Would I come again? Definitely not. Not worth the money. You might as well go elsewhere that will cook your meat for you for cheaper with better quality meat.

Needless to say, my spirits were low and my expectations were high. Fortunately, I got a whiff of this Aroma, and walked upstairs to see what it was all about. 

Right off the bat, I could tell I made the right choice. The staff were friendly and set me up with a spot despite the fact that I was taking my food to go. I ordered the lamb korma and some samosas, the latter of which I decided to eat on the spot - and even though they were so hot that they literally burned the skin off the inside of my mouth, I couldn't stop eating them. Arguably the best samosas I've had in the past 17 months. The crispiness, the filling, the sauces. I could eat nothing but these for the rest of my life and I could die happy. I'd probably die early, but at least it would be with a smile on my face. 

I brought the lamb korma back to my hotel and it was everything you could ever want in a dish. Creamy, flavourful and with HUGE pieces of lamb. They definitely don't skimp on ingredients here, which in and of itself merits a 5-star review. 

So anyway, now I'm in a food coma, just listening to the jazz station the the previous guest forgot to turn off. Or maybe the hotel turns it on before guests get to their rooms. I dunno and it doesn't matter. The point is, go eat here. You'll love it.",2017-07-13 03:16:53

They have this cool thing there, it's called ""Customer Service"" Here is how it works. If you have a question or need anything, they have friendly employees who will help you and more shockingly- know what they are talking about. It's crazy- right?

I needed to buy a new front loading washer, dryer, and French-door, bottom freezer fridge. I shopped around like a madman, and I researched like crazy- and learned that Samsung got top marks by Consumer Reports in pretty much all areas. I went to Lowe's and discovered they had 10% all appliances over $300. I also had a moving coupon from the USPS for an additional %10 so I got %20 off!! That adds up when you are buying $5,000 worth of appliances. Justin was amazing in the appliance dept. Super helpful and funny- he made the experience really easy. Here are some tips I learned:

-If buying front loaders, spend the extra dough and get the pedestals. I am 6'4 and every time I use my machines- I am grateful for the investment.

-Buy the four year protection plan. Even if you have a home warranty- it's still better to go through Lowe's because there is no service fee.

-Do your homework, shop around. Find out what is going to last a long time, what is highest rated, not just what is flashy and looks cool. For example, Electrolux stuff LOOKS really cool, but when you research it you discover they break down A LOT. I suppose if you're loaded it doesn't matter as you are made of money- but for us commoners, it's nice to buy quality.

My personal favorite is their chocolate pastries, especially Marquis and chocolate eclair. Another one I really love is the lemon tart. Mmm also, their breads are so delicious too. I tried their sour dough, their French bread, and the croissants. Their Almond croissant is to die for btw. I also tried multiple large cakes, such as the chocolate moose cake, and the pistachio cake. They both are without a doubt delicious. I got so many things here and never once disappoint me.

I guess my tastes are pretty pleb though, as my favourite was the Kranjska, loaded with hot peppers. Perfect with a cold, refreshing beer.

Prices are pretty decent for the area and I could see coming here for lunch. Toppings are fun too, but I'd suggest you get them pretty naked if you want to taste the meats.

I was overall very impressed with the service and quality of food we received.",2017-07-04 21:46:36

honestly, I have never stepped foot inside this place. We typically have our porters grab our orders for us and bring it back to our office.

These sandwiches are amazing.
The rueben is stupid good but the New York Yankee blows my mind.
3/4 pound of insanely good pastrami and corned beef on rye bread that is toasted perfectly.  Literally 3 inches of hot meat and I can't get it into my mouth fast enough.
ugh... I'm hungry for it now.

The soups are great too.. rich and flavorful and quite filling.

Stopped in here on a rainy 2nd Sunday, for tacos with a friend; I got 3, (sorry, I hate being a pain, but a girl wants what she wants) barbacoa, (lamb) el pastor, (pork and pineapple) and chicken (duh), with cilantro and onions. They were quickly prepared, and brought to my table. I also grabbed all three salsa options, and put them on the side. They were all used quickly! The El Pastor was probably my fav, it reminded me of tacos in Cancun on Spring Break, oh so many years ago! But the Barbacoa was good too, nice and flavorful. Chicken is chicken, but still, so amazing. 

Can't beat the deal, or the punch of flavor! Try a Pineapple Fanta while you're at it, you only live once, and it's perfect with the El Pastor taco!

I got there a little before 5 and there was already a lineup! Thankfully my friend got there before I did and secured us a table. The atmosphere is very casual with dimmed lights and very (and I must emphasize the very) loud music. 

She was right, the food was definitely cheap with everything on the food menu costing 4.95$ and the drink prices also being quite reasonable. I decided to go for the BBQ chicken sandwich with a poutine upgrade for 1.95$ and a pink lemonade. 

Honestly, you get what you pay for. At some point I wasn't really sure what I was eating, as the chicken was likely smothered in the sauce with some other toppings. I was hungry though, so I ate that sandwich and didn't look back. I will say though that for that price, I wasn't expecting a full-sized sandwich so that was pleasantly unexpected. The upgrade to the poutine was definitely not worth the 2$ though. The fries weren't anything special and there was barely any gravy or cheese. My friend had the fish tacos and said they tasted better and had more fish the last time she was there. My drink was the highlight of the meal. I don't think it had any effect on me to be honest, but it tasted nice and was fizzy!

Overall, the prices for the food are ridiculously cheap, but expect the quality of the food to be what you paid for. The service was adequate, but it was the sheer loudness of the music that was too much to handle.

So, being from So Cal, i'm very familiar with Zankou Chicken, and am a fan. Chicken D'Lish is quite similar, but not 100% the same. (this is not a bad thing, always!)

Every time, the roasted chicken i've had has been juicy and flavorful, the marinade they use is a citrus-based one, and -much- tastier that El Pollo Loco is, to me. The garlic spread is pretty tasty, if a bit on the mild side.

They fall short on the sides, sadly. It's not a flavor-issue, more of a freshness one. The garlic-roasted potatoes taste good, but look really unappetizing- muddy-grey, and anemic. They are also soggy, no real crust on them. The rice is tasty, but felt undercooked to me.

I love love love the baklava they sell here! I've yet to find great baklava in Las Vegas, till Chicken D'Lish. (and if -you- know a place in Vegas that makes/sells excellent baklava, TELL ME where it is, I beg you!)

Only a person from Hawaii that eats Korean food knows what meat jun is.  Even Koreans from Korea are confused when I ask if they have meat jun on their menu!  Seriously!  I don't know if this is a hybrid of Korean food, a fusion of some sort, or just a dish created by a Korean that lived in Hawaii.  Besides Island Style, the only other place I can get meat jun is back home.  Luckily, the owners of Island Style are from Hawaii so they are in the know!  Doesn't hurt that this place is also less than 10 minutes away from my work.  

Super busy place, so if you come for lunch especially be aware that parking in this little strip mall will be TIGHT.  You may have to park across the street or in the strip mall next door.

Even with the hustle & bustle the service is pretty spot on.  After being seated the treats start.  Usually, if you're lucky you will get a basket of boiled peanuts.  I love boiled peanuts!  Brings me back to when my Dad used to buy bags of the stuff to bring home for an after school snack.  These folks are definitely from Hawaii.  Nice.

Majority of Island Style's entrees come with a plethora of banchan.  In Korea, these are various side dishes that go with the meal.  We were in high supply that day, I think we were given a mix of 7-8 different banchan to enjoy.  Geez, I can't remember them all but we did have kim chee for sure.  It was real good, spicy, tangy, sweet...I even requested a second helping to go with my meat jun.  Wonder if they make it in house or if it's store bought?  Couldn't tell (and I eat my fair share of kim chee) but it was certainly tasty.

On to the main, my meat jun.  What can I say?  It was worth the time and effort!  Island Style serves some KILLER meat jun.  It tastes the way like I enjoy whenever I'm back home on Maui.  Marinated bulgogi beef, lightly battered in egg, then pan fried to GBD perfection.  GBD?  Golden, brown, delicious, DUH!  Island Style cooked mine just right.  Not too heavy, not too oily, but full of delicate flavors.  Hints of sweet, savory, and texture from the egg?  Perfection.  Accompanied by the meat jun dipping sauce, a bed of hot white rice, a scoop of macaroni salad (yep, Hawaiian), and a side of kim chee?  Very good down-home eats.  No pretentions, nothing fancy.  A good meal.  The only thing that could have made it better was if there was an additional piece of meat jun on my plate.

Entree wasn't too heavy on the pocket either, coming in at around $9 including all the banchan that was afforded to me.  Very good value.  In fact, most of the entrees on the menu come in around the $7-$9 mark depending on what you order.  And the choices are numerous.  I'm sure most of it is highly recommendable, but for now I'll be sticking to the meat jun.  My homey Korean-Hawaiian friend.  So take me back, back to da kine!",2013-11-07 20:46:36

Took a bite of my Wholly Grill pork bbq and off came my crown cap.  Finished breakfast (yep, I had pork bbq for brekky- what are you gonna do about it?), and then looked up Ebony K.'s recommendation of a nearby dentist and called Thompson Peak Family Dental.  I mentioned my lost crown, my being a new patient, and could I also set up an appointment for a dental cleaning?  While the next opening for a cleaning wouldn't be in July, I'd have to wait till Monday for the recementing of the crown, since Dr. Dachs ""is going on vacation.""  However, after a minute or two of speaking w/ the rep on the phone, I was able to secure a same-day appointment!

Dr. Dachs seemed friendly and open to conversation (he and his two kids are going to visit a national park!).  He worked quickly to prep the crown for recementing.  I was on that chair for less than 10 minutes!  (Well, OK, maybe slightly longer than that, since we chatted for a few minutes on his taking his kiddies off to their first nat'l park excursion.)

I noticed a wi-fi decal on a nearby clinic door as I headed to the dental clinic, so I asked the front desk if they offered free wi-fi, too, and they were very gracious to offer the password w/o much begging from me.  Just a simple query, and I was able to check my messages and do a check-in update  via Yelp!  :)

The show was A LOT of fun! Frank's opening stand-up was pretty funny. After that there were a dozen plus numbers where female impersonators performed as well-known singers. (Celine, Madonna, Tina, Cher, Liza, etc.). There was really good energy, and I really enjoyed the show.

My favorite part was What Makes a Man a Man, where the performer began as a drag queen and transformed into a man. The lyrics were very powerful and really made you think. Before the show, I heard a couple waiting in line for the show talking about ""faggots"" and ""who was the pitcher and who was the catcher"".

You can make appointments online via their website. I tried last year as a new patient but got tripped up and did the walk-in process instead. 

The check-in process is for you to input your personal data into a tablet at the check-in counter. (As I'm sitting here waiting, I feel empathy for the check-in staff. It's embarrassing how many people who check-in can't follow computer prompts to put in your personal data. The dang screen looks like it was designed for preschoolers.) Then you have a seat until you're called back up verify your order.  The wait times are announced by staff dependent on how many people are ahead of you. Once you're up, they call you back and do the deed. End of exam.

We both had filet mignon and lobster, along with a plethora of sides and exclusive cocktails, and this place is worth every penny. It's nearly half the price of the big-name steakhouses both on the Strip and across the valley, but we felt the attention to the food and the service rocketed Gallagher's beyond the competition.
Granted, this place is not cheap. It's for special occasions, but my god: The meat is aged for nearly a month (both wet and dry aging), and the chefs take special care to cook your steak precisely how you like it. These chefs know how to deliver a first-rate steak.
Superb and delicious sides, first-rate drinks, and an attentive (but not hovering) wait staff make this our new Vegas favorite. And we're longtime locals. So you can trust us.

Speed Read:
1) Good price / value
2) Tofu Dessert
3) Garlic shrimp fried rice
4) Horrible parking

There are lots of dim sum restaurants around the area.  With the exception of a few premium price ones, many value type dim sum places serve garbage, and some time spoiled food on hot summer days.  

It's our recent favorite dim sum place.  
Dim sum are generally good quality.
Average service.
Below average price.

2 highlights are the garlic shrimp fried rice and the fresh made tofu dessert (tofu-fa).

Tips:
Very hard to find parking!!!!  But if you do find parking, usually the wait for table is not very long.",2016-10-20 17:18:30

But last night my wife and myself were in the area and thought we'd give it a try.  And what a very pleasant surprise it turned out to be. First of all, loved the way the place is laid out and the decor.  The menu, gawd was it great to go in a restaurant in Charlotte that's menu wasn't tex-mex, Chinese, Italian or the never ending bar food .  I had the Asparagus and brie quiche, my wife had the turkey and dressing. Mine also came with a bowl of French Onion soup.  Soup was excellent as was the quiche.   Mine also came with some nice fruit and a excellent mixed green salad.  Everything was excellent. Only possible complaint, they brought my soup after the main course.  But still a great change of pace from the usual microwave food served in most Charlotte restaurants.  Oh, waitress warned us not to come on a Sunday morning, long lines and a long wait.  But we're certainly going back there, I have to place it on my ten best restaurants in Charlotte list.

That ended up going in an uneaten pile.  The fried okra were pretty good, but the mac and cheese was straight from a powder and not very good.  FH got the ribs, which he described as 'watery, as if they'd been boiled too long'. He didn't like them much. He had green beans, which were the old fashioned out of a can then boiled with a pork product style, and corn on the cob which was also not great per him.  I doubt we'll be back.

I have been there- done that so I know everything about my own hair- and they did too. The only salon in the world that did not try to straighten my hair or blow it out at the end to make it all look like everyone else, but actually - Brought it back to life.

As usual, I sat myself a the bar.  I was quite impressed with the craft beer selection.  I was looking at the selection on the bar and and the bartender pointed out the additional taps across from those taps on the back wall.  He even read them off to me.  Awesome!!!!

Being that I just came from NoDa and was headed to Triple C, I decided on a Lagunitas IPA.  Really, you can't go wrong with anything from Lagunitas!!!!  Quote me on that!!!

For the burger, I went with the Booty burger which was inspired by the bike riders who do the 24 hours of booty.  It consisted of a turkey burger, avacodo, lettuce, tomato, onions and a mild jalapeno pesto.   Wow.  Honestly, after a few of my other favorite turkey burger places have slacked off, I can now proclaim that THIS is the best turkey burger I have ever tasted.

So why stop at 4 stars.....well, it's the fries.  They did not blow me away.  They seemed to be the quick fried and fried again type of fry.  I would have preferred a more traditional type of fry like maybe a steak fry?

Service wise, I was impressed with the first bartender but there were two and the 2nd seemed to go with being corny instead of being helpful.

My favorite food was the chicken salad sandwich on beet brioche bun, and in general all the sandwiches were great, very detailed and well prepared. Loved the scones as well, and the quiche tart, banana eclair and chili chocolate is definitely not something you see on every menu. 

Service can be improved in the waiting area - no signs or server to greet us, we were just standing at the top of the stairs as it was assumed that was the designated area. Eventually had to go down and try to flag someone down.

So I decided to check this place out. They have a very small parking lot on Jacksonia St which is on the block behind the main building.

I went in, paid my admission, and was told to proceed to the 4th floor to start my tour. I learned that free admission is given to members, students at Pitt, Carnegie Mellon University, and Point Park Univ. All other students are charged $15.00 with their student ID. If you live in the following zip codes 15212,15214, or 15233 then you would pay half of the $20.00 general cost.

Please note no flash photography is allowed in the exhibits but you can bring bottled water.

The artwork is mostly modern art with a different flare to it. For instance on the 4th floor there is this long concrete sculpture that eventually turns into strange metals that include a door and porthole. I learned once I went inside this piece that it is actually used as a small meeting room.

I was equally impressed with the red polka dot room where you must put on those stretchable plumber's shoe covers in order to enter it.

I really couldn't make out what was on the 2nd floor since it was the work of James Turrell. One room is totally pitch black and another has a glowing purple rectangle which must seem to change as you approach it. I was really blown away by the ground floor exhibition entitled ""The ghost train"" by Marnie Weber. I felt like I was seeing some scary things in a dark ride but the piece is magnificent.

They have a small cafe where I grabbed a salad. They give you table service if you are ordering food and prices were reasonable. Next door they have a tiny gift shop. The clerk was very helpful in explaining some of the pieces to me and advised me to check out the two other buildings for the rest of my visit.

I went to 516 Samsonia Way to see a permanent exhibition called ""Trace of Memory"" It was set up in a way that you would see what looked like cobwebs over a whole house where a wedding had taken place.

The final building is located at 1414 Monterey St where there was 3 floors of various exhibitions. I was impressed with the ""ship of fools"" since I had never seen a ship on top of and ox.

Please note that elevator service is only available in the main building. The other two buildings have narrow stairs and you will be climbing two flights. Please be aware of this if you are physically challenged. I was sending my daughter some pictures I had taken and she was completely blown away! She definitely wants to visit this place when she is home from college.

I also tried the poutine and it was decent, not spectacular, but if you're hungry it works just fine. My friends seemed to enjoy their food as well (a burger and mac & cheese). 

There are several options for burgers in Rocky River, you can go the fast food route with places like McDonald's, or mom and pop like Bearden's, or more ""fancy"" like Flipside. I think Red Robin is a solid middle choice that appeals to everyone from families to people looking to get the most for their money to those who need something casual and reliable for dinner.",2018-04-26 15:30:22

I got the grilled chicken steak with black pepper sauce on rice - it was absolutely delicious and it's become my favourite dish there! There was plenty of sauce covering the chicken, which was perfectly cooked as it was tender yet had nice crispy edges. For $11, you get a giant portion and I could only finish about half of it. 

The baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce comes in a large dish but it does take some time to cook. It was very good - the crispy pork chop pieces were tasty and they certain don't skimp on the meat portion compared to the rice. 

Lastly, I never pass up the opportunity to get their HK-style milk tea. It's a nice balance of the slight bitterness of the tea and creaminess of the milk.

Yeah yeah - so there was that one time on Mother's Day when the waitress messed up our orders, gave us cold food, and was an all around, less than delightful server - but I tell you what - years of being fantastic will help me look past that.

There's one reason to come to this Swiss Chalet - and I'll tell you what it is, their burgers.

Which I don't.)

The point is - don't think of this Swiss Chalet as a chicken join.  Think of it as a burger joint.  Now, I don't want you to go there, have the one time they're not cooked to perfection - because as I said above, I - too - had a bad experience once.

Then on top of that to make matters worse they had metal lids on all the food.  Yeah I am seriously not joking..  So you had to open the lid and see what special surprise was in store for you with 20 people behind you chomping at the bit for your ass to hurry up...  
Oh and it gets better, so I am sitting there and the one lady that is sitting people who doubles at the only waitress comes to the table with my coffee.  So I said you guys look a little overwhelmed.  And she explodes with her life history on how they are leaving her out to dry..  Right in front of the poor kid who just wants to see Santa...  My jaw hit the floor..  She was practically screaming how terrible they are treating her in this job...  I almost said something like hey we got little kids around here to see Santa, lets hold our composure..   But I felt her pain because this CLUSTER FUCK was obviously the soul responsibility of the restaurant manager, not her.  And she deserved to vent.

Total price with tax almost 40 bucks for 2 adults and one kid...   NOT JOKING once again..  

If I was the GM of Bass Pro Shops I would fire the sorry son of a bitch that is managing that restaurant ASAP....  Whoever it is shouldn't even be managing a hot dog stand...   Pathetic.",2015-12-12 23:56:49

If the entire terminal has a tendency to be pretty calm, compared to other busy airports, well then it becomes as useful as this lounge. 

Perks:
-Decent washroom. Better than Terminal 1 washrooms, anyway. 
-Snacks, liquor available. Check timings for complete info.

Downside:
-Uncomfortable seats
-Bad service

Kumi was one of the restaurants they were really excited about trying, so we joined them for dinner here. In short, the food was wonderful, but the service was awful. We started off with shishito peppers just for fun. They were so delicious! Only one in our batch was very spicy. Four of us dined here and ordered a fair amount of sushi rolls. My favorite sushi roll was the Fireball Roll. It's sweet and spicy with kimchee flavors. Very different from anything I've ever tried. I did, however, order the salmon entrée and wasn't in love with it. There's just something that tasted really weird about the glaze that they used.  Maybe it was too heavy of a sauce. 

Their service didn't score high points because we were ignored.  Our waters were only filled when we could no longer wait and got up to call the server over.  We did the same thing for the second time we needed our waters refilled.  And of course, you can imagine what happened when we needed our bill.  I so regret that we paid with a credit card.  The worst part was, they weren't even busy that day.

Having had such a great experience at Metro the first time around, I was also really disappointed by the service (or lack thereof) we experienced. The food my husband and I ordered was actually very good (he had the burger with gruyere and I had the quiche as well as the vanilla-scented yogurt) but the service was just bad. 

Given the fact that the restaurant wasn't nearly as full as I've seen places at brunch and the fact that we weren't unusually demanding or confusing, I think that the bad service was unacceptable. Rather than sitting back and enjoying our friend's birthday brunch, we ended up literally spending half of our time reminding the server of things we needed but never got. When we eventually complained to the manager, she did comp a bottle of champagne but the service didn't improve after that. 

I really did enjoy the food I tried and thought the specialty drinks (try the French 75) were well-made but they all weren't good enough to compensate for the service. It seems like the bad service is a common complaint among Yelpers so I would hope the management/owners would take that into consideration and do something to make it better.",2009-02-25 02:07:03

I saw they were remodeling and that provided us with some glimmer of hope. But it seemed so long between the closing and the eventual re-opening. It was disheartening to say the least. Nevertheless they did open the doors once again and we have resumed our ordering of their sandwich masterpieces. Recently I took my dad in for his first Jimmy Johns experience. I've got him hooked now. We both got the same sandwich. A Jimmy Johns Gargantuan with all the fixings including hot peppers. The roast beef, turkey, salami, tomatoes, lettuce, onion etc all crammed into the chewey bread is a hard sandwich to beat. And with the new expanded store it is a pleasure to dine in now.

I thought parking was going to be a pain because the few times that I've driven by, it looked like there was only street parking available, but it was actually a breeze. There is a tiny parking lot in the back, and since the area around the cafe is mostly residential, there is a lot of street side parking to be found. (: Awesome.

I ordered a 12 oz mocha and a sweet potato, shiitake, and provolone quiche. The mocha is a little too foamy for my taste, but it's strong and the perfect wake-me-up. The quiche was light but filling, which I really appreciated. I'm not a huge breakfast foods fanatic, and I hate really heavy breakfasts that weigh me down for the rest of the day, so I thought the quiche was a perfect compromise. Serving the quiche with a side of greens is a nice touch too, though I'm not a big fan of the salad dressing.

There is ample indoor seating, and outdoor seating on their patio, if you prefer to dine alfresco. We were greeted with huge smiles as we entered, and since it was our first time in, the hostess took time to explain how things work. We looked over the menu, and found a table. The menu has a variety of different burgers made with organic angus beef, and topped with fresh ingredients. There is also a choice of ahi tuna burger, turkey burger, and even a vegetarian burger! There are sides, drinks, milkshakes, and salads. I chose the classic burger, they asked me if a ribbon of pink in the burger would be okay. I said yes. My burger was cooked perfectly, and was topped with a fresh tomato slice, lettuce, onion, and sassy sauce (don't worry it is not at all hot). I opted to have cheddar cheese added to my burger. The burger is served on a toasted bun, and was delicious!! My husband and I ordered some fries to share. We ordered the regular fries, and they were thin, crispy and not at all greasy!

So after seeing all the reviews here, I definitely wanted to try this out.

I ordered the awaze lamb tips, which the waitress tells me is the spicy version of the lamb tip dish.  And I order the dark version of their Ethiopian beer.  The beer isn't bad.  I decide to try the light version and did not like it.  And honestly, the dark beer really isn't true dark beer.  Give it a try.

My plate comes out on a plate but on top of bread plate.  I was really excited after seeing the waitress bring out this enormous plate for another table with tons of food on the same bread.  The bread is spongy and cold!  I was a little shocked at the bread being cold.  I've eaten at a lot ethnic places that uses bread plate and it's typically served warm to hot.  This was the 1st time I've had it cold.  So obviously, you don't get any utensils to eat with your meal.  My lamb was really tough which definitely took away from my experience.  And I kept on thinking that the meal would have tasted better if the bread had been warm instead of cold-but what do I know?  I guess this is the culture.

First I would like to add most of my visits here have been 4 & 5 stars but something was off tonight. I was excited to dine here because their food is usually outstanding. We have been dining here for the last 9 years and this is my first review of this place because I am still a yelp rookie. 
I recommend making a reservation through open table to get your points and request a booth when 2 people are dining. If not they sit you at a 2x2 sized table with little to no room for your stuff, and the small tables are parked right next to a wall. The restaurant will accommodate. 
The appetizer, blackened shrimp and cheese grits came with 4 jumbo shrimp (oxymoron, yes I still think it's funny) that were barely wading in a small bowl of grits. Those were 5 stars. Salads were excellent, I ordered the roasted beet salad and wife had the hearts of palm with heirloom tomatoes. 
I believe the server made mistake when he brought us our steaks. We both ordered the house specialty, 28 day aged NY steak. This is where they loose a star. My wife received my medium-rare and I got her medium. She was brave and wanted to try it. If hers was medium then it was not cooked properly and my steak was a bit overcooked. Not as flavorful as in the past and they stopped giving out the garlic to squeeze over the steak. Now you need to request it. Waiter told us because most of the garlic was never used by 80% of customers so I get it. Steaks here are usually done right. I have had the Porter house in the past and it's a lot of meat if you can handle it. The grilled onions were just okay and the mushroom sauce was a nice addition to my slightly overdone steak. The brussel sprouts were just tossed in some sweet sauce with a little bit of spice (reminded me of Panda Express', orange chicken sauce), the yard house does the brussel sprouts better and the asparagus was great. 
This is where another star was lost, the drink service was super slow. My wife and I waited at the bar (suggested by hostess) in restaurant because we were a few minutes early. They even have a cool little light on the bar menu that you turn on for service but we were ignored. Then we were escorted to our table and drink service pretty much stopped. It took over 10 minutes to get me a Guinness, the glass was warm, and it was not poured in the proper glass (beer snob, yes I know). Then I ordered a Stella for my next drink and it took even longer. The waiter came by and told me he was going to go get me that Stella I ordered. Don't tell me, just do it. I was a bit annoyed with the service. Stella not served in a chalice. My wife enjoyed her cocktails, sand in your toes, which was very similar to a sex on the beach.  Miguel, our water attendant was great, he made sure we always had water and cleared the table right away. Christopher, our waiter was really nice too. He even brought out a little B-Day ice cream for me with a candle, my wife filled them in. It was nice to see some familiar faces in there. My wife and I always look out for the wait staff we have had in the past. We usually spend between $150-$250 here depending on drinks, food, and service. It can be pricey at times. I usually tip generously but left a $40 tip, which was %20. I hope the steaks are done right and the drink service improves for next time. I am a big fan of Gallagher's, so I will give it another go on my next visit to the desert. FYI- if you stay away from the heavy starches you won't feel as full when you leave.

Currently, the pastry cases & bread shelves are a little bare, but hopefully, that will change in time.
We ordered a 16"" pie with mushrooms to take home. While I wasn't entirely crazy about the red sauce they use, the crust was crispy and very well done. The cheese was hot and perfectly melted and good quality. Best part were the mushrooms, generously sprinkled on the pizza, and FRESH. You could actually taste the earthiness and depth. Impressive. All too often mushrooms on pizzas are tasteless slivers tossed on a pizza as a second thought. If it wasn't for the sauce being closer to a marinara, I'd give it 5 stars for being a perfect NY style pizza. As it is, it was pretty close.

Do the math. Your expectations can't be too great. In order to accommodate such a wide spectrum of flavors, some ingredients -- like peas and carrots -- are frozen goods. Let that set the tempo and then you won't be disappointed. 

Friendly service, adorable ambiance, clean bathrooms, a little pricey for the quality of food. But remember: the cost of ambiance is built in the cost of the food and this place is located in Tivoli. 

I got the two-crepe combo, pick one savory and one sweet ($22.80) and I also got a macchiato ($3). The waiter alerted me: ""It's the real Italian macchiato."" Great! It was Lavazza. 

My savory crepe as the India (cheese, cauliflower, peas with yellow korma). It was tasty. I really liked the house crepe batter. They serve all of their crepes not wrapped up like a breakfast burrito, but more like they put the crepe spread open on your plate and then just cover it with whatever your desired ingredients are. 

For my sweet crepe, I got the Paris (European flan), which looked like albino diarrhea, but it was yummy. Super rich. Huge. I wouldn't advise eating one of these by yourself. Share with one or two more people. 

There is inside and outside dining. Indoors, there is a little art gallery (hobbyists) and a place for kids to play with plenty of toys, and the stairway up to the Market shops and restaurants. 

Pay for your meal up at the POS. 

No liquor license yet. Still working on it.

I was recommended to try the sambal sauce with the sandwich which was a house-made sauce that they sell as well. It was mildly spicy and went really well with the sandwich.

anyways...this restaurant came very very VERY highly recommended from a co-worker. as far as im concerned, when an Italian tells you something is good, don't question it. he really had me at when he explained to me ""they make their own mozz..."" 
i wanted to come here on a very special occasion, so i decided to go for my first anniversary with my girlfriend. 

finding this place was a bit ackward, on google maps it has it listed on the intersection of yonge and gerrard, it is infact just a bit north west of the intersection.

we did not book a reservation(my line of thinking was, its the Thursday before Easter...no ones going to show up...WRONG!) 
the wait was very minimal, 15 minutes at the most. very very intimate setting, dim lighting and very romantic setting(candle light). 
we were greeted by our server named Jeff, Extremely friendly and amazing with his professionalism/manners. asked us if it was our first time within the establishment, and all sorts of other formalities. he also explained that they make the cheese everyday as a niche of the restaurant (and he wrote the name of the guy making the cheese...the name escapes me, as well side note my back was to the cheese making so i missed the whole thing) we wanted to celebrate and get a drink to celebrate the occasion. i was very impressed with Jeff's honesty, Jeff had explained that he needed to get back to me with what brand whiskey they had, due to a vendor change they had earlier in the week. drinks were ordered and we were looking at the menus. i couldn't help but notice all of the nice accents to this restaurant, the old school light bulbs, the exposed ceiling, and the jars of sauce/peppers designed and placed so properly balanced throughout the place. jeff returned with our drinks and we ordered the food, obviously i went with the fresh mozz...being a cheese lover that i am, it would have been pretty foolish to pass it up. when the app's came, i was blown away by the sizing, it was a decent size, but by the time i came to finishing the app, i was feeling satisfied. the mozzarella is amazing and should never be passed up.(i am also aware that they only offer it during 5-11pm) no sooner our apps were done, and jeff was back with our mains. i was slightly disappointed in the sizing, being a big guy i always worry about a main being enough food, however by the time i had finished the main, i was done for the night. my significant other had an issue with her main salad, which we had brought up to jeff, when we brought it up, jeffs manager deducted that main down from full price, which was a very nice gesture, considering the main was perfect, it was the side garnish that was not. 
we contemplated dessert but were too full to partake. 
a side note to my story as well: i was approached 3 times, by three different workers (managers i assume) asking if the service was up to a good standard, and if i was ok. this is how good business is done. 
im very proud to say, jeff worked his butt off for us on this amazing evening, actually took the time to know us, and congratulated us on our very happy year, with more years to come. 
i have no problem saying i gave jeff the biggest tip i've ever given to any server. 
just perfect from start to finish. 

pros: very romantic, fresh cheese, good portions, excellent quality
cons: wait time, a bit loud, all cheese sucks if not fresh :)

I was a weekly regular, that is how much I used to love this place. In the beginning this place was kind to me. It knew exactly what I wanted and always exceeded my expectations. If I was having a bad day, I could come in and be greeted by the servers who were always so welcoming to me and would serve me up a big bowl of delishness.

You know how you hit that 7 year itch in a relationship? I guess that is what you say happened to me. The service went down. The quality of the food went down. They had a couple of bad health inspections and to me, it just never was the same.

So I slowly stopped going. However, just like that bad relationship that you keep coming back to, ""because just maybe it'll change and go back to how it used to be"", I kept going back. And some days, I would be like ""Yes!"" this is why I love this place. Yet, more often than not it was like slow torture. The broth would get worse and worse, the meat would be tough and chewy. The last of the last was when I went and it tasted like there was soy sauce in my bowl of Pho. Definitely not okay. Just more often than not, it would be bland and flavorless. How fun is that?

I should give this place a 3 star based on the fact that I was a die hard fanatic for years but considering that I have visited this place in the last couple of months and it's still poor quality, I just can't. 

I remember when I first signed up with yelp and saw all the poor reviews, I didn't get it. I had thought to myself these people do not know what they are talking about. Kinda like, when you have that bad relationship and everyone else keeps telling you need to leave but you just can't, not until you are ready. 

Well, that chapter is closed and this relationship is no more. Onto better Pho!

I took my mom and dad this past Sunday to the Pirates game.  We decided to go out to dinner afterwards so we rode the Gateway Clipper boat over to Station Square.  Now granted I had me a hotdog at the game, but I was in the mood for a good dinner afterwards.  Besides, why load up on $4.00 hotdogs and diet pops when you can go out to a good dinner afterwards?  Dad feels the same way--he'll have A beer at the game, but why spend $6.50 for a Miller Lite when he can get some good Chinese beer later on?

We started off with the traditional egg rolls.  I'm sorry, but I don't consider vegetarian egg rolls ""real"" egg rolls.  We also split an order of pork dumplings three ways.

Their seafood here is really good.  Since I like sticking to the basics, I opted for the shrimp with vegetables with white sauce.  Dad's tastes run a little bit spicier than mine.  He opted for the beef with curry sauce.  If it's strong enough to clear one's sinuses, Dad loves it!  Mom's a lamb lover--she went with the lamb with vegetables.  Mom also put away a Coco Loco.

I ordered the ""Burger Flight,"" which consisted of three cute little sliders that were accompanied with separate condiments of thousand island dressing and caramelized onions. The buns, which tasted brioche-y, were nicely toasted. The meat was a little bit dry, but it wasn't too bad. I have a little problem with their calling it a ""flight,"" though, because I think of flights as being an assortment. It would be a flight if each of the three burgers were different. But, whatever -- to-MAY-to, to-MAH-to.

I also ordered a side of poutine -- my first on this visit to Montreal, and I thought it was fantastic (especially the braised pork on top -- wow!!), barring one weakness: the cheese curds were really big, and some hadn't fully melted. Thus, it was hard to get a good ratio of gravy-potato-cheese-pork. Granted, my poutine experience is quite thin, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. ;)

My husband ordered the sea bass, which I thought was going to be awful -- I mean, the place is called Mechant Boeuf, not Mechant Poisson. ;) However, the fish came out cooked PERFECTLY: moist, with nice, crispy skin. The accompanying fingerling potatoes were nice and buttery, with a touch of mustard. Yum.

Con 1: LOUD music. It was an acoustic band that was playing on the Wednesday night we went, but my husband and I practically had to yell across the table in order to have a conversation. Not pleasant. 

Con 2: Service was spotty. It took about 15 minutes for a server to come over and take our order after we were seated; we were seriously considering walking out when the server finally arrived. Glasses were never refilled. i'd actually rate this place 3.5 stars due to the service, but since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I'm rounding up.

When we were seated it took quite a while for a waiter to come and receive our order, and after that, it took 22 minutes before we were served our water (yes I counted). We were already dying of hunger, and then they could not quench us of our thirst!! I believe that every restaurant should not make this costly mistake of forgetting to serve the customer water.

This review may seem long, but I believe that if you're going to give a review, especially one that is less than stellar, then you should give a detailed explanation.

Upon first entering, the place is normal- barking dogs, a little shop and the self wash area. Alex, the front desk girl was friendly and took our dogs without incident. The dogs are all allowed to mingle unless they're aggressive or not fixed. I felt good about finding a new place and set off for the 2 hours that we were told it would take.

Unfortunately one of our dogs suffered a short seizure due to stress during his bath- something not common when he's bathed at home but not surprising given that he is a dog and that sometimes happens. I wish that we had been called and notified that he was having a seizure rather than him being left with panicked staff (the girls said that he must have gone into shock and that they were worried but that it wasn't as bad as some that they've seen). They didn't blow dry this dog because they didn't want to stress him more and offered us a towel to take so that he could be further towel dried.

Both dogs looked good, though the one who had had a seizure was clearly upset. He was bleeding profusely from his front paw, a sign of a cut too close on his nails. The other front desk girl was not concerned about it and just said that it should stop soon. I've never dealt with a bleeding nail, that's why we go to a professional, but I figured that they knew what they were saying so we paid (receptionist said she gave us a discount, that was nice, though we didn't get an original quote on the wash and brush so it's not clear if we were and for how much), left a good tip and went out to the car. 

On our way out to the car blood spots were increasing as he walked so I took him back into the shop and asked if they could do something. The receptionist said sure and out came the nail tech with some Quick Stop in a container. The nail tech apologized, saying that it must've been too close to the root. This is taking place outside of the shop, in the parking lot as she tries to put the powder on my dog's paw as he winces and yelps- further stressing him while she said it wasn't bothering him, after about 5 minutes of this we feared another seizure was going to happen so my husband picked him up and placed him on the towel in the car. The receptionist said to keep him from knocking his nail so it won't bleed more and to just put flour on it if it does. We thanked the tech for her help and left. There are blood stains all over the towel and through it onto the floormat. I'm not happy. He's not happy, and his brother is stressed out because of the commotion too.

I understand that things happen, but notify the customer and give proper care to alleviate the issue. Our dog should have been taken into the store, cleaned up, and bandaged so as to keep him safe and comfortable. Customer service and compassion are not a strong suit here

We came home and luckily our neighbor saw our dog's paw and offered to help us to stop the bleeding. Both dogs are now laying on the rug, exhausted from their misadventure and the husband and I are getting ready to clean up the mess in the car. Figured I'd jot this down while it's still fresh. 

I hope that this is a fluke in their business and that they service pets better normally- it's a stressful situation for both us as owners and especially for our dogs.

I hope the owner contacts us, I would appreciate a response.

~In Response to Ruth S.

Thanks for more professional insight- I see where you're coming from, though I stand by what I wrote for my experience. I acknowledged the fact that accidents happen- especially when a dog has dark nails- but these are professionals trained to handle it. I made it pretty clear that the service was fine, I'm not satisfied with the way the situation was handled. It's not a good practice to send a dog out bleeding without treating it, you shouldn't wait for the customer to have to come back in to ask for the quickstop. I'm a little confused about the tip bit you responded to, I would never go and take a tip back- that seems strange. I tipped because I thought they did well, until I walked out and saw the pain my dog was in. One dog was fine, the other had a bad experience, I as a customer left unhappy and I believe that this review was fair. As for your review, it's a response to me, not a review on the business, perhaps it belongs in a different area.",2013-01-11 22:34:19

I headed to Spring Mountain Road to do some exploring.  As I came alongside the Pacific Asian Plaza, I remembered a friend saying there was a great Malaysian restaurant there.  There was Penang on the second floor.

I got an order of Curry Puffs for an appetizer.  I wondered what was taking so long. The puffs are 4 good-sized pastries filled with a very good ground potato, chicken, tofu mixture with a curry seasoning.  They were very hot from the oven - hence the wait.  They were excellent.

For the main course, I got the Homemade tofu with scallops and lobster sauce.  There were no scallops, but there was a good amount of shrimp.  The tofu was absolutely sensational!!  

I decided to give the Malaysian iced coffee a try and it was good.  Not something I'd get every time, but it certainly was worth a try.

* Boutique-y: They have tons of natural, organic, hard-to-find items you won't see at places like Petco or Petsmart. They have all kinds of natural proteins and animal parts for gnawing--some I never knew existed! They also carry a lot of lesser-known, boutique-like brands that come with a heftier price tag. You definitely feel like you're getting quality, healthier merchandise here. Just know that you'll pay for that feeling with your wallet. 

*Big Box-y: The layout, size and mass selection of the store definitely reminds me more of a pet mega-store rather than a local boutique. However, this is a regional chain. I just wish they have the deals of a big, old pet store. They do offer a rewards program--but I heard three people in line before me complain about it, which I found rather strange. 

*Local Brick-n-Mortar: I've been to plenty of these around the CLE+ area and PetPeople definitely has the helpful staff of a local shop, without the overly-hippie vibe. I mean, my dog likes meat. Is that a crime? Haha. Where they don't remind me of the local shops is again, in the price tag. I've been to at least 4 other local shops that have better prices on the same merch.

Overall I just can't see myself going out of my way to shop for my pup here. The two times I have bought things have resulted in immediate self-kicks when I see the same things at other stores and shops for much cheaper. But that's not to say that I wouldn't stop by if I were around Rocky River--their selection definitely makes up for some short-comings.",2015-01-12 21:48:14

When my friend told me we were staying at the Flamingo, I thought - okay semi crappy hotel but close to the strip.  When we pulled up I was surprised at how nice they had made it.  We went to check in and noticed a line, so I waited there while he tried to do self check in on the kiosk.  Unfortunately, it said his room wasn't available yet, which was a bit crazy since it was 10PM.  So we went and checked in with the lady in front.  He mentioned his dilemma with the kiosk and she said it was because he booked through Expedia and that particular room wasn't available - king bed, non smoking.  She said that we could have a smoking room with two queen beds.

Long story short, after asking to speak with her manager, the lady begrudgingly gave us a non-smoking, 2 queen bed room and got our resort fee ($40) waived.  We asked about a late check out and apparently there is a fee.  Check out is at 11, but to have a 12, 1 or 2, we'd have to call in that morning to get the price.  It was an extra $20 for 12, $30 for 1 and $40 for 2.

Finally got the chance to try,  

The place is renovated for fine dining, however the food wasn't worth the fine dining price.

We had a table of 8, tried the Geo duck, lobster, and king crab combo, it really was nothing special for fine dining... I've been to other places were we ate the same type of food for a cheaper price and bigger portions...

I would say that the fried oyster (separately ordered) was really really good and the fried rice at the end was really really good, those two dishes were the highlight of the evening.. Crab legs and lobsters were just regular Chinese food

We didn't have anything to drink, the bill was $120pp, for that price, you can actually have fine dining downtown... Not just regular Chinese food in a fine dining environment..

All in all, I would not go back, but didn't regret the experience.

Lol, my brother ended up going to McDonald's right after dinner.

I had reservations for two at 6 pm. Our flight arrived in Vegas at 3:30. My friend, who was traveling with me, arrived without his bag. They said it would be around 10 that night before he got it. The big problem - my friend only had shorts. The restaurant had a ""no shorts"" policy. I called the reservation line and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I went directly to the restaurant and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I understand policies. I have them in my business. My deal on policies is that, if circumstances dictate, I make exceptions. This is not the theory for Prime Steakhouse. At least for us, it wasn't. 

I saw many of the patrons of Prime later that night. I have to say I couldn't effectively gauge the dress code. There were hookers with body parts spilling out of all parts of their dresses (that's using the term ""dress"" liberally). There were men in ripped jeans (which they said they had a policy against) but I guess when you pay $400 for ripped jeans, it doesn't count. Shorts are not okay but T-shirts are???

I am comparing it with what I had in Beijing and Hong Kong, so that's how I conclude. They hand pulled their own noodles, make their own dumpling skins and knife shredded their own noodles, and the qualities of the noodles are high. I don't care that it's a pricey place when the high quality is delivered.

We ordered Xiao Long Bao and Lan Zhou La Mein with Knife Shredded Noodle instead of Hand Pulled Noodle. The noodle was awesome. The noodle texture was just like what I had in Beijing. The Xiao Long Bao was awesome too, the skin was so thin and there was a lot of juice inside each of them. And each was huge too!

The service was good too. Everyone was polite and nice. And I like the fact that they don't always come asking if we are okay, as that's actually not good for us Chinese to be asked for too many times, asking too often is a gesture of rushing someone to leave instead. So if you are in a Chinese restaurant and you are not always asked whether you are doing fine, it's not because they are ignoring you, they are actually letting you to have your space, take your time to relax and chill. I do notice that they always keep an eye out for every table to see if anyone is waving their hand asking for help. So that's a good service for us already. We could actually wave anyone to come and assist us, we didn't have to wave to the same person who took our order. That's what I like in a good Chinese restaurant.

As being born and raised in Hong Kong, and have been in Beijing eating all over, I consider this place delivering high quality Beijing style noodles and Shanghai Xiao Long Bao.

After we finished our meal, we stood outside and watched the old chef making hand-pulled noodle, and watched his assistant making the knife-shredded noodle. The old chef did make the hand-pulled noodle very nicely. Nice hands and skills. We also saw another assistant chef making dumpling further inside the kitchen. We were happy with what we ate and with the experience. (we went by the previous night and watched a younger chef making hand-pulled noodle; I think the older chef's skills was way better than the younger chef, which makes sense as the older chef has more experience than the younger chef does)

We admit that the price is expensive, but again it's not something we eat every day for every meal, it's okay to pay the price to get high quality food. At least cheaper than flying to Beijing to satisfy our crave of Beijing style Knife-Shredded noodle or Hand-Pulled Noodle. Both kinds of noodles are good, I just personally like Knife-Shredded noodle more because of its shape. You can get probably something with the same name off the strip with cheaper price, but they just don't taste good or authentic (meaning not the same as what I had in Beijing) at all, then what's the point for them being cheap if they don't even taste right.

We will go back again.

Note: they offer Total Reward price ($1-2 cheaper for each item) when dining with your Total Reward card. Harrah knows how to do business. This makes me dine more at his properties more than at MGM's. I got discount dining at some other places that are in Harrah's properties, too.

This is what we ate! 

Crispy Duck Salad with pomelo, pomegranate and pine nut: AMAAAZZZIIING!! I don't even like duck. EVER. Like i DISLIKE it. And this was SOOO damn gooooooooood!!! Holy shiet. It is a definitely MUST TRY!! 

Sesame prawn toast with foie gras: This was VERY freakin' good! Just be careful! Do NOT bite directly into this prawn ball AND when cutting into ti also be careful because it will SQUIRT!! 

Spicy prawn with lily bulb and almond: I loved the sauce with this dish! Nom nom! Just a hint of spicy heat. Loved it! 

Stir-fry udon noodle with shredded duck and XO sauce: Again, i am not a duck fan but this duck stir fried in with the noodles wasn't bad at all. 

Stir-fry black pepper beef ribeye with merlot: This was good. Rj super enjoyed it but it didn't really stand out to me. 

Scallops: I was actually cravings scallops but I was not impressed with this dish. The flavor was aiiiight but I felt the scallops were a TINY bit overcooked and I think that makes quite a big difference! 

Steamed red snapper in spicy assam sauce: This wasn't bad, but it didn't really stick out TOO much and it seemed kind of dry. 

And this is what I drank! 
The Hakka: Belvedere vodka, Masumi Okuden junmai sake, coconut, lime, passion fruit and lychee juice - It was GOOD but it was VERY sweet, The lychee was REALLY good.. Actually the whole drink tasted like Lychee... Later I switched to some Circoc Peach! 

And this is what we had for dessert! 
Chocolate & black sesame crémeux black sesame Florentine, yuzu ice cream; This was interesting. The chocolate was good and the sesame thing was kind of odd. Not at all your typical dessert!

The beesting cake, cheesecake, and Black Forest cakes were the most tasteless, dry desserts I have ever served.  Fortunately my friends were candid and expressed their very negative opinions of the pastries.  We suspect the products were baked at least two days prior to purchase.

In fairness, the apple strudel was ""good"" but nothing special.

What an expensive waste of money spent at this supposedly ""fantastic"" bakery.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Positive reviews of this unattractive business should be considered suspect.",2017-08-21 16:52:57

I've been to both this location and the BevHills location, and although I would say I favor the BevHills location this one still does a good job.  I still haven't made it to the one in Yountville yet!  Anyway, I have had both bunch and dinner here, and I have to say they do a great job of fancified French bistro food.  Personally I think dinner here is a better value. 

For food, I recommend the steak frites - their fries are delicious (and the steak isn't so bad, either).  This time I for some reason got the vegetable gnocchi, and they were a nice departure - I wasn't looking for something super heavy and it delivered, with lots of fresh veggies and pan seared fluffy gnocchi.  Since it's Vegas, I also got the opportunity to get my foie on.. I got the terrine of foie gras - which I unfortunately was not able to finish (but they packed it up for me for later!).  One of my friends got the pan-seared foie gras which I thought was a better choice flavor-wise.  Anyway, no real complaints for me.

Service was good - my water glass was never empty and the waitstaff was efficient enough.  Decor is upscale-bistro style, classy but nothing special.  There is a nice hustle and bustle inside the restaurant but you can still talk to your friends, which is nice.

The property itself is a series of two story buildings arranged around a couple of cozy pools that are very nicely landscaped. While the property itself is not huge ( like so many of the other resorts in Phoenix), it's smaller cozy side was part of what I really enjoyed.

Our room was in the 200 building on the ground floor and was very quiet. Our room faced the pool/lagoon side which was nice but next time I'd try to get a room on the second floor to enjoy sitting out on the deck.

Perhaps they weren't full but it was great to get a good nights sleep after a couple of long days prior.  When you arrive you will enter a very stylish lobby and be greeted by helpful staff to check you in. Since the property allows dogs, you will notice the bowl by the desk with doggie treats along with some water.

One of the highlights of the place is the pool area.  There are actually two-one designated for young families that has a zero depth sandy beach and one for everyone else. There were plenty of chairs with bright colorful towels waiting for you. There were also several pool attendants roaming around and checking in to see if they could be of any help or to take food and drink orders. Another nice feature of the pools are the landscaping.  There are plenty of tall trees so finding shade is quite easy to escape the hot Arizona sun.

At night the property is truly spectacular with cauldrons of blazing fire illuminating the property as part of their earth, fire, water theme.

I found the food here better than brunch for sure. At $5 for small plates, that could only be shared by max 3 people is nice, but found them not as original or fresh as it could be. We got the Pigtail Torta (pigtail sandwich between two puff pastries), Mushroom Tart (a little cold, as if it was reheated), Fries (big wedge fries with homemade mayo). Note: I'm just speculating.

As for mains, $12-20 we got the boar and mushroom parpadelle which was made the way I like my creamy pasta (cream +mushroomy). However, it was so spicy which overpowered the boar and mushroom taste. I mentioned it to the server as feedback who really didn't do anything about it. 

In the back curtained off area was a live band playing which was nice for music. $25 cover to get in, not sure about that unless you're a fan of the actual band that was playing. Noticed the crowd was some trendy older folk and families so this might be the place to be. 

They have some vintage old boardgames which was a nice diversion. And one of the pinball machines kept giving us free games.

Service was okay, the table was wobbly and kept spilling our drinks. Nothing was really done about it, nor did we press on about it either. 

May or may not come back. I really want to like it here, and I would suggest it again especially with a group.

* Their food is definitely fresh (you see them making it right in front of you)
* They have a good selection of food
* Prices are reasonable
* They have outdoor seating
* Food is delicious
* Owner is onsite & is really friendly


CONS:

* Since they're very popular, sometimes they run out of things (i.e: quiche, chocolate tarte)

* They get busy right at noon, so sometimes the line would be out the door & tables would be full

We got everything he recommended other than an old fashion because im pregnant and every item of food we received was just amazing. 
Another server by the name Kelley overheard us talking about our anniversary and went out of her way to inform Gino, he then took the liberty to go the extra mile and offer us a desert on the house to share.

Nice but casual atmosphere. I like how there were TVs to watch the games but it didn't have that dirty sports bar vibe. 

Fast, nice, and efficient service.

Reasonably priced beers. And really good selection of bottled beers. Wish they had a bigger selection of drafts.

We had the fried mozzarella which by husband loved and I thought was okay. I loved the texture of the breading around the cheese but I wish the breading was a bit more seasoned. 

My husband had some wings which he thought were really good. And he was happy they made them ""extra crispy"" for him. I liked that you can order them by the half dozen for just $5. Most places you have to order them in larger quantities which sucks cause I'm a vegetarian.

We ordered a large pizza with Kalamata olives, artichokes, and tomatoes. We liked the pizza for the most part. The cheese tasted delicious on it. I liked the texture of the crust, just wished there was a little more flavor in the sauce. Luckily if you order tasty toppings it makes up for it.

The value of the pizza was amazing. $12 for a large, $2 a topping. 

They only had 2 specialty pizzas on the menu, both chicken, which I found puzzling. I was hoping for a few veggie varieties.

Me and boo thang did the AYCE (of course) and I was immediately excited when the server told us we're allowed to do half orders for rolls. Instant like. One of the first few items we ordered is salmon nigiri, which is the criteria by which I judge each new sushi spot. And the verdict is......it was aiiiite. The good, there was a whole lot more salmon than other places usually offer. The bad, it wasn't as fresh as I'd hope for. But I can't complain because the level of freshness is pretty much the same as Yama Sushi. 

They offer a good selection of rolls, however they all seem pretty mediocre. But to be honest, I don't really care much for rolls anyway. A plus is that they will allow you to add a quail egg on a masago or ikura nigiri free of charge -- I've had run-ins at other restaurants where they charged me extra as part of the AYCE D':

Death in Venice is located inside Constantinople Bakery. 

This place has unique gelato. My classic-loving self was surprised to not see a plain vanilla on the menu. That's my favourite, what will I do?! Try new things I guess. 

I got a Mexican chocolate gelato. It had some savoury spiciness to it and tasted rich in chocolate. Loved it. 

I also sampled some others. One unique one was hay and goat's milk, and honey I think? (Or maybe it just tasted like honey) Very unique flavour and process--something about soaking hay in goat's milk for a long time. Uh huh, yeah, whatever, I thought while it was being explained to me, but then I tried it and it was delicious. I felt confused and weird at the same time but I'm into it. 

I paired my Mexican spicy chocolate gelato with an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie from Constantinople Bakery, in the style of an ice cream cookie sandwich. Very delicious. I made a huge mess of myself on the walk back to work--gelato in my hair, don't care!

I came back another time to do some work. They have wifi, and serve coffee and tea. They make iced tea from brewed tea which is amazing! A rare find anywhere that isn't a specialty tea shop. 

They're open till 7 which is great for after-work meetings as Early Bird across the street closes early. Being open just one hour later than the rest is amazing. Don't change unless you stay open even later.

I have curly hair.  I have thick hair.  I have lots of it.  I have lots of thick, curly hair.  
I suffered from triangle head.  If you don't know what that is, you clearly do not have curly hair.  An example of triangle head is the comic strip ""Dilbert"".  Yeah, that's a gross exaggeration, but it gets the point across.

So most stylists don't know how to manage lots of thick curly hair and they treat it just like they would straight hair.  Many times over the years I've heard from stylists, ""Oh yeah, I totally know what to do"" and then gotten a cut and left miserable.  Thankfully hair grows.

My hair had gotten to the point that it needed a cut and some styling.  I consult with several stylists and salons in the area.  I consult with Todd and I have to give the man credit for calming my fears.  Yes, I am very defensive about my hair because yes, I've had people mess it up horribly in the past.  So I have this consult, we discuss curly hair and the physical composition and reactions to products and cuts, and I leave later with some more information to make a decision.  

A few days later, I call and make an appointment for a cut.  

I go in and meet with Todd and we go over again my fears, concerns, and the method for the cut.  Curls are combed out and I look like circa 1970s Diana Ross.  He then proceeds to cut my hair dry.  Heads-up curly-haired ladies, this is a wise method!  When the curly hair is cut dry, the stylist will know where your hair will fall once the cut is done.  This is as opposed to someone cutting your hair wet and when it dries, it is now several inches shorter than you thought it would be because curly hair springs back and up when dry, since it no longer has the weight of the water.  Simple physics!

Seriously, I fell asleep in the chair sometimes.  This is a good sign.  This means I'm trusting the stylist.  Kudos Todd. 

After the cut, I get a wash.  Very pleasant scents.  

Now, to the moment of truth, the product application and the diffuse dry.  Silhouette says... no more triangle head!

The silhouette shows the layers and is rounded and the curls are all over the place (in a good way).  My initial reaction is cautious because yes, it's going to take some time to get used to the change.  Todd isn't offended by my not jumping up and down being excited, which kudos again, because some stylists are very arrogant and demand appreciation.  

All in all, I'm happy with the cut.  There is no more triangle head and I didn't lose much length at all.  I will be back in about three months for another cut.  

So curly haired ladies who have been horribly wronged in the past, I suggest gather information, get some consultations, and consider Platinum Entourage.

Udpate 03/2012:  Reception really needs to be trained here.  I was told that I couldn't make an appointment over the phone (which I had done before) and that I *had* to make an appointment on through a third-party online booking service.  What?  You mean to tell me that you don't have acess to schedules and you don't have access to third-party online booking service so you, as the receptionist and appointment setter, can make appointments for clients?  That's absolute crap.  That lack of service will lead to lost business.",2011-12-17 22:40:02

I walked in stared at the menu, asked for a suggestion..
no one seemed care to give me any profound suggestion.  You would think as a new restaurant they would be excited about a customers experience.  but whatever thats fine, i asked about any eggplant dishes and the girl told me there was a eggplant dish ontop of a bed of rice.  So thats what i ordered with a yogurt drink.  After waiting 10mins take out which wasnt too long of a wait the young girl who serviced me handed me my order and said ""oh by the way it comes with bread and not with rice underneath im sorry"".  lol first of all, you dont even know your menu and after you get a customer to pay for what you describe then you tell them their order is different after its done and in a take.out bag.  lol

i laugh because it humours me that ppl can be so nonchalant. disapointing as a first experience.  and to be honest for 15$ small.portion of eggplant and a flimsy piece of bread.  Underwhelming to say the least.  Absolutely nothing ""fine"" about the taste at all.

The building is quite beautiful; the inside is a popular backdrop on Instagram. Conveniently located, you can access the AGO via TTC easily. There's also a lot to do before or after visiting, including checking out Kensington. I like the gift shop and think that it's a great place to pick up unique gifts for family and friends.

It's a little far from home, so it won't be a regular stop, but when we're planning to be in the Paradise Valley area, we will certainly make reservations to dine here. Who would have thought, in the dead of summer, at 5:30 pm they would have no inside table available? Okay, granted it is a small restaurant, but like a previous reviewer, I found the ambiance and decor inside lovely. They also have fantastic background music, at least on this night . . . a nice mix of jazz (Diana Krall) and standards. 

Because they had no available tables inside so we opted to sit outside on this sultry evening. There are no misters on the patio, but the little discomfort did not take anything away from the fabulous meal we ordered. 

They have a great tapas menu which gives diners and newbies like us a chance to taste a multitude of items at what I would consider very reasonable prices. (There has to be another word in Japanese instead of the Spanish tapas to use instead.) They also had ""happy hour"" drinks for $5, so we each had a Shochu cocktail - his with cranberry, mine a mix of cranberry and grapefruit. Refreshing! 

We started with the Red Snapper sushi - OMG, it melted in my mouth. It was so fresh. I could have ordered more and just made this my meal . . . the best red snapper I have tasted bar none . . . including Tokyo! 

A total hit was the Bistro Green Beans which were flash-fried (no breading) and had a melding of incredible flavors. The beans were so fresh and cooked to perfection with a little snap in each bite. I have had this dish, or similar ones, at other Asian restaurants, and what set Yasu's apart was that it was not oily or greasy. 

The shrimp noodle skewers were more a novelty than a great choice. Minced shrimp, skewered and then encircled with an abundance of noodles wrapped around them was the only disappointing item we had. Too much noodle to get to the shrimp. I deconstructed the noodle on my plate to get to a bite of shrimp. 

The Snake Shiitake was delicious! It was actually fun to eat as well. It has nothing to do with snake . . . the shiitake is cut up into long pieces which resemble snakes. Very creative naming . . . 

One of my other favorites is the shrimp stuffed Japanese eggplant. (I am an eggplant lover.) The slightly sweet miso sauce was yummy, and the eggplant tender. 

I was full at that point, but my dear hubby had to order one more item, the special roll of the day . . . spicy yellowtail. Beautiful! The yellowtail was so fresh, and the spice just gave it flavor but did not overpower the fish at all. Some sushi places forget that the real star of the roll is the fish and put the emphasis on the spice. Not Yasu! 

A comment on the service . . . our server Liz was top-notch. She answered all our menu questions and made excellent recommendations. She was friendly and attentive. When we go back, we will undoubtedly ask to be seated at her table. 

One more thing . . . there are lots of veggies on the menu so if you are a die-hard vegetarian like so many of my friends, you will be able to have a great meal here, too.",2011-07-17 14:39:18

You know what I do when I need to feel comforted? I make a big ass bowl of pasta and curl up on the couch with a good movie.

Levetto was almost as satisfying. Their bowls of pasta are humungous and allow for lots of room to twirl, dig and slurp. My cavatelli had truffle oil, pea pesto, red pepper and spinach. I was in heaven.

Now, I'm a huge fan thin crust pizza, but I rather liked the focaccia crust at Levetto. I tried both the Peking Duck and the mushroom pizza and they both were delicious. The crust was satisfying yet light and airy with crispy edges that tasted of nice olive oil. 

Also tried the Brown Butter coconut cake and really enjoyed the texture and flavour of this dessert. If you don't like coconut, you won't be won over, but I love it. And I love brown butter. This was unique and refreshing for me as desserts go.

I would have given 5 stars, but I don't dig that I have to return to the counter, wait in line and make another transaction to get second drink and I don't want a bottle for myself (at least not in public when I'm the only one drinking).

I found a small restaurant in a shopping center.  My guess is this place is packed and stuffy if you go at a peak hour.  I was there before 5pm so only a few of the tables were occupied.

The waitress was prompt with menus and drinks.  Friendly too.

Bolognese Ragu was my dinner selection.  The sound of homemade pasta is sauce and six meats sounded fantastic.  I was given a basked of fresh Italian bread while I awaited my dish.  The bread was fresh and tasty (from a local bakery according to the website).  I am partial to oven fresh bread so I was slightly disappointed at first but, hey, you can't always have it 100% to your taste.

I was very impressed with the ragu.  Granted, I have nothing else to compare it with but I loved it.  

So, why only 3 stars?  I'd like to give 3.5 but I can't so it gets 3.  The prices were not satisfactory.  The ragu and a can of coke came out to over $21 with tax.  For the price I paid I found the portion a bit small and $3 for a can of Coke is lunacy.  I understand a local restaurant needing to charge more but I think they could shave some of the cost off.

After having just finished a lovely holiday bike ride, I met up with two of my favorite foodie kiddos, Derek and Petra, and their moms since I knew they'd be off, too.  Long a Yelp bookmark, it was finally a great day to dine here since they're closed on the weekends.  
After zig-zagging through the parking lot, I found the cafe.  Every table was taken and there was a short line at the register to order.  Thankfully, one party vacated while we were in line, so our party of five could sit down inside.  This place is very popular; after I checked in on Yelp, a plethora of recommendations were thrown my way in the comments section.  I was told to get the soup of the day, no matter what it was.  When I got to the register, Olivier, the friendly proprietor, told me the soups of the day were cream of zucchini with parmesan and cream of roasted pepper, but the latter wasn't ready just yet.  I chose a cup of the zucchini soup with a half of the 3 Cheese sandwich with added turkey for protein.  I spied the croissants behind Olivier and asked for one of those, too.  Petra ate the zucchini soup and Derek munched on a raisin croissant; these kids have good taste and that's why I eat with them a lot.  We all enjoyed our food, including the new acai bowl that's been added to the menu.  
There was a steady stream of customers the whole time we were there and, in fact, the line was to the door by the time we left.  Word on the street is that Olivier is opening up another establishment and it will be open on weekends; if that's the case, I will certainly be back more often with the little partners in dine (and their moms).",2014-01-28 05:18:36

My date and I started with a sizable, complimentary bread basket filled with various artisan breads (not warm) including: cranberry bread, jalapeño bread, & jalapeño corn muffin. They had Bobby's southwestern flair and were all so fluffy, moist and scrumptious. 

As our main course, we selected the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Corn Tamale with creamy corn cilantro sauce. It's to die for! The shrimp was beyond succulent and I couldn't get enough of the creamy, dreamy sauce it was swimming in; insanely flavorful, awesomely rich. We nearly licked our plates! Well, to keep it classy, we scraped it clean with our forks. 

We ended our dinner with a creamy vanilla bean flan with fresh mixed berries. The indulgent flan was silky; we were in flan heaven by the end of the evening.

When  you first walk in through the front door and see sight of the skeeball machine, don't get distracted and forget to turn right.  The building is connecting two restaurants, and if you turn left, you'll end up going into another restaurant!  Just thought I'd put it out there.

Anyways, when I walked in, I thought the place inside looked very nice and chill.  I liked how they had an old looking bike set up in the corner of the restaurant, and there was an old tricycle set up in another part of the restaurant.  Some booths that I passed by were wicked cool, and let me tell you why.  For the booths I saw, there was a small TV in each booth!  How great if you're watching a game so you won't have to arch your neck or squint your eyes to see what's going on.  Kudos to that.  But I did not sit inside.  My group decided to sit outside since it was nice out.  The scenery there was not too shabby at all.  There were even ceiling fans out so we weren't sweating too much.

Our server was great the whole time.  Great service!  He was always checking up on us making sure we were happy and had everything that we needed.  Friendly service always helps with the atmosphere.

The food was amazeballs.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Pimento Cheese Fries and they were so delicious!  I had to make sure to check myself and not take more than my share.  Good thing it was on the other side of the table or I would've killed that plate by myself!  My friend and I decided to split an order of wings, and what a good choice we made.  The wings were delicious with the Garlic Parmesan sauce dabbled over the wings.  It wasn't an overwhelming taste at all.  Just right.  For my burger, I chose The Cuban and my friends decided to make their own burgers.  I might have to try that one day for a fun experiment.  My burger was delicious though, no complaints other than it was just so HUGE.  It's definitely worth your money to try out food here because they give you a good amount.

Derek could not have been more welcoming and even arranged my VIP entrance to the Hakkusan Night Club the ending before.

The Las Vegas location is truly on a grand scale. A maze of intimate dinning areas, all with carved see through dark wood panels. The requisite blue lighting cast a hypnoizing hue for each table. The long electric blue bar was equally spectacular with background of cascading lights, further illuminated with bright gold hanging lamps.

Service, of course, is top shelf as to be expected. The staff from the lovely host, to the mixologist, and even the restroom attendant are completely attentive. Derek, the GM, was kind enough to visit with me several times to insure my visit was a five Yelp star experience. 

I ordered the simple plates of Shanghai pan-seared pork dumplings, baby bok choy with oyster sauce, and the fried rice. 

The rice was outstanding. Consisting of Eggs and scallions mixed with fluffy rice, it was like a letter from Hong Kong.  A perfect home style meal.

I indulged a fabulous desert of Carmel passion. A beautiful presentation of passion fruit tapioca, chocolate crémeux, and honey ice cream. Incredible!

  For review #500, I wanted to write on an attractive land that has been my rock. It is Red Rock.

 Red Rock is a land where imagination runs wild and grownups can feel like children for a few hours. A hike on the La Madre Springs and White Rock Trails pass summits that look like piggybanks and bottles. It passes alongside mountains where the imagination can make out the different Beatles. It is a land where the scenery is dependent on a healthy imagination. It is where imagination conquers drama.

 Red Rock is a land where you can feel like a video game character with one life. Maneuvering up and down the peppermint colored boulders on the Kraft Mountain Loop Trail is a video game adventure come to life with a view of the Las Vegas Strip as an award.

 Red Rock is a land with a stairway to heaven. With its commanding views of Las Vegas and Red Rock Canyon, the summit of Blue Diamond Hill is a taste of heaven.The Las Vegas Overlook Trail to the summit of Blue Diamond Hill is the stairway to heaven.

 Red Rock is Candy Land transported to the desert. With its gum drop colored hills, peppermint colored boulders, and molasses colored pond, First Creek Waterfall is a sweet oasis in the desert.

 Red Rock is a land where 13 is a lucky number. Driving or cycling on the 13-Mile Scenic Drive is on a Carefree highway where life's blues is replaced by an upbeat rhythm of majestic red and grey mountains towering over a picture postcard of the Mojave Desert.

 Red Rock is a land that lays to waste the myth that the desert is baron. The La Madre Springs, White Rock, and Icebox Canyon trails are a few trails that travel through a verdent landscape of greenery from pinyon pine to pine trees.

 Red Rock is a land where the rocks are the stars. I felt better than any Hollywood star spending time with the rock stars that include White Rock, Mount Wilson, Calico Hills, and Kraft Mountain.

 When people hike in Red Rock what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas! Especially stress!  When I attended my first UYE at Norm. K's Hike at the Potato Knoll; drama stayed in Vegas. The beautiful landscape created adventure that brought the Yelp CommUnity together.

 Red Rock is a land of goal setting. I plan to return to Red Rock Canyon with the goals of reaching the top of Turtlehead Peak. Ultimately I will return to Red Rock with the goal of more adventure and less drama.",2014-01-27 06:06:03

Water's asked for, never came, we sat and watched our margarita's at the bar ($7.50 each) a good 10 minutes before they made it too our table and my daughters order was completely wrong.  Oh and did I mention the Mexican holiday music and it's not even Halloween yet. Argh. The thing that really burns me about the lack of service is the manager (I'm making an educated guess that the man behind the bar, ringing checks but doing little else, was the manager, never helped any of the servers, who all looked in the weeds the entire time. No one asked how our meal was. We were never checked on. We were asked if we wanted another Margarita when we asked for our check. We probably would have had another 20 minutes ago. Had I left drunk, perhaps today's review would have been kinder! 

As for the food, utterly forgettable. Chips, good. Salsa, so-so. (And don't expect them to come to your table for free, oh no, there's a $2.50 charge for that.) Guacamole ($4), bland (note to Cinco, there are other ingredients in guac other then avocados!) My husband had shrimp fajitas ($15.50) . Meh. I asked if they could make me a vegetarian burrito. I asked for cheese. Nope! I got onions and peppers with a couple of black beans and zero sides. It was beneath Chipotle for twice the price. It also always burns me when they charge me the same as the meat option when I didn't get anything instead. Add a little guacamole or cheese instead of the meat or charge me less. Anyhow... $12.00. My daughter went off menu and asked for a bean, rice and cheese burrito. Sounds easy? Wrong. She got a burrito loaded with onions and peppers just like mine. The second attempt? A tortilla with just black beans. What? Booo!

If you like katsu (pork cutlet), then give this place a try. Crazy Don just opened up a few weeks ago and they specialize in deep fried cutlets, but they also offer other dishes as well. It's near Kinton Ramen. As someone who loves katsu, I was really excited to visit earlier this evening and couldn't wait to try their food. It was packed when we got there but we were quickly seated by one of the servers, and there was a paper menu already placed on the table. 

I decided to order the Cream sauce (it's actually Alfredo sauce) chicken katsu - 13.95. I thought it was an interesting combination so I thought I'd give that a try. My bf ordered the Japanese donkatsu - 12.95. Once we ordered, we were given two small side dishes which were kimchi and pickle. All dishes come with soup, I had a pumpkin soup which I thought was delicious, and my bf had miso soup. 

So it was off to a good start, my bf was served his dish first. And I thought mine would come a few minutes after. We ended up waiting maybe about 10-15 minutes wondering where my food was. Our server came over and checked but never got back to us. Finally, after waiting another 10 minutes my food came. The waiter came and apologized because apparently they missed my order. I wasn't mad or anything because I know they're a new business and they're still trying to working out the kinks. But my bf was annoyed lol.

Anyway, I found my food to be just okay. It was good but nothing mind blowing. It was interesting to pair alfredo sauce with the katsu, but it wasn't creamy enough for me. The katsu itself was a little bit dry though. The Japanese katsu was crispy but my bf wished there were more pieces. Also, one last mishap was that we were given the wrong change and good thing we double checked. At this point, my bf was so annoyed and simply just over it but I reminded him - they're a new business! Or maybe I don't get annoyed or frustrated easily. We talked to the cashier about it and he apologized. 

Overall, service was meh but food was good. I'd come back again because I wanna try their other dishes and I'm sure service and things like getting orders out will improve.",2016-02-29 04:15:41

There are so many things I ate I can't even remember all of them. I do remember the maple glazed salmon from the Vig, and the macrons from Phoenix public market. There was some wonderful chocolate thing from Tammy Coe bakery and lots of wine!

My only complaint is that I wish it was at a bigger location. It's pretty packed in there times, and a few people were a bit rude. I think we needed more space.  Yes it's nice that it's at the art museum but if you're someone who doesn't like crowds how are you supposed to really enjoy yourself?  It gets a bit overwhelming. I'm considering VIP tickets for next year but wow it's so expensive!",2015-03-28 13:36:01

The beef wrapped enoki mushroom tasted funkily bland.

Their spicy handrolls were good though, so maybe their all you can eat is worth it.",2012-08-02 14:57:06

This is a solid Thai spot but hardly the best in Vegas.  Pretty big restaurant with open space makes it a nice venue for a full table and even for live music some nights.  They have a pretty good wine menu and some good menu options, but everything is priced a few dollars higher than the quality.  Dishes are large as the spicy eggplant and beef salad filled up 2 people.  Throw in the appetizer platter and you have lunch for tomorrow.  I ordered a 10 spicy level and it was hot but more of a late burn.  There are definitely hotter options in town.  Fine food but there are better options (some literally right down Spring Mountain) for better Thai.  But still should be on the short list for Vegas Thai food in China Town.",2017-02-17 06:57:41

my coworkers and i came here for lunch.  it was okay nothing to rant and rave about.  i would come back hoping to be impressed the next time.  And i don't usually say that.  I have FAITH that they could get better.  LOL.  Portion was kind of lower than average, stingy.  I ordered veggie bowl.  With that your supposed to get beans, rice, shrimp (or whatever your ""meat"" is, cheese, and obviously the various types of salsas, and sour cream, some corn type thing and guac is extra.  I skipped out on the beans, and the cheese, and the sour cream.  The server didn't start with big portions to begin with and by the time i finished excluding so many options they had due to dietary restorations that she did not expect, its not like she made up for it by saying ""did you want more rice instead of beans or a bit more veggies since your getting less options"".  I had to say, Uhh can you put more of something.  It's little things like that, that make you feel like your getting Jipped off and feel like people are not being customer focused or conscious. The food itself was OKAY.  Not great, not terrible.  It kind of made me feel the sensation of ""whatever"".  whatever that means LOL.  Now when I say I would go back, I would but I would probably try all the surrounding restaurants even if its a different restaurant type, before I go back, I mean...if I was stranded.  LOL",2016-08-18 16:55:25

Unfortunately, it took more than 35 minutes to get our food and it arrived cold and one thing was wrong--I ate it as is because the server would never make eye contact to let her know.  In addition, our server didn't seem to scan the room and my drink sat empty for most of my meal, then when we went to pay it took 15 minutes and asking another server to find out server.  If the food had been warm or the service had been good I would've given it 4 stars.",2016-10-23 14:29:49

I always go in with high hopes, and come out having had a so-so experience.  The beer doesn't really float my boat.  Although, they did have a pretty decent sour when I was there a couple of weeks ago.  The first time out of my 5-6 visits I found something I liked.  The food is okay.  Like most restaurants, they don't have a TON of vegetarian selections, but definitely enough that I felt like I had options.  My partner and I had veggie burgers during our last visit there.  Nothing special.  The fries were pretty good.  Liked how they were seasoned.  One thing that really stunk about our last trip was the amount of time it took to get our food.  It wasn't our server's fault, and she did check on us once to say sorry for the delay.  We were also dining with friends who'd had such a horrible experience the last time they came that management gave them $70 worth in gift cards for the restaurant and offered to comp their last meal.  Geeze!  Kind of stinks that when you give the place another try with the gift cards, things are still lacking.  We'll probably visit again, but this isn't my first choice for dinner when going to the Waterfront.  One thing I will say is it has adequate seating for large groups, and loud children would probably make out okay here as it gets pretty packed on the weekends.  A good place to take family from out of town.",2017-09-26 21:32:07

The office is no frills so don't expect a fancy spa like setting.  The suite is in a small office building.  If you want the ""spa"" experience then stay with the spas on the strip but expect to pay for the atmosphere.  Here, you are paying a very affordable price for a really good massage.

Recommend Stephanie, but if she is booked then Millie is a good choice as well - both have good firm pressure.",2011-11-22 01:44:45

The atmosphere is actually kind of romantic, which I wasn't expecting when I saw it from the outside (it's such a teeny hole in the wall that I thought it would be more dive-y than it was).  

I came here at the insistence of my boyfriend, even though I'd heard many good things about the food from various sources.  The boy and I first bonded over our love of Curry Squash (aww.. ?) and he said that Lao Laan-Xang had the best in the city.  That is a bold statement.  :)  We started out with a *spectacular* Tom Yum Kung soup for two.  It comes in a neat, self-heating contraption and you ladle it out yourself.  There was *way* more than two people needed, which was awesome considering how delicious it was.  We both got Curry Squash, unsurprisingly.  I really liked it, but can't say that it was definitively the best Curry Squash I've ever had.  It was different, though.  Less fatty, maybe?  Either way, I was satisfied.",2008-06-30 16:32:04

We have never had a issue and have always been treated with 110% respect and have always took the time out to go over her medical history. Not once have we not been treated with less then complete and up most concern. They are very caring and treat you like family. If they are busy the wait time can be a little long but that's only because they take time out to listen to your needs. They are honest and do everything to make sure they take care of your needs before you leave. I trust them with my Daughter and she is my pride and joy. I'm a single parent and that means a lot to put my hands in someone's care.,2015-04-25 11:11:55
