The interior is very industrial chic, what with the exposed brick, steel pipes and dim lighting. Bartenders are on point with the cocktails. Comparisons to the late Jolly Bob were made.

BfSS26WHnbKtQNITTUoacQ,Ef-NDzuYpy9Y_ntbk6GUfQ,cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw,4,1,0,1,"I drove by this place 3 times yesterday trying to find it.  They need a much more improved way of advertising there business. I came here yesterday during a working lunch.  My first thoughts while walking through this place was gastropub.  The set up and the decor all suggested my initial thoughts.  After glancing over the menu I decided my decision was conclusive.  We decided to sit outside because let's face it one of the pros of living in Phoenix is that you can have lunch outside in January.  It was a beautiful day.

   My counter part ordered the Reuben sandwich, which actually looked pretty darn tasty.  I ordered the Windsor burger, topped with caramelized onions and cheese.  Even though my burger was overdone to my request of rare I still ate it anyways because 1. I don't like to waste food, and 2. it was still pretty darn tasty.  The french fries could definitely use improvement though.  They were just blah.

   As far as service goes, my server was a pimp!  Very charming and pleasing.  Although it did go a little overboard with the attentiveness of filling up water glasses constantly, not by my server though.  All around I had a pleasant experience with Windsor and if I'm ever in the area again and want to get a solid bite to eat, I wouldn't hesitate to come back.",2012-01-06 20:38:54
i2P-cVOEolzkGKc7_sKcWA,CXLJPkPhqMUysBA9TiPPHw,ChF3epc8u657kyhgnKddbA,1,8,1,0,"I came into the store twice before I purchased the Ashlyn Storage bed frame. Both times the friendly associates explained  that if I purchased this bed frame I would not have to purchase a box spring or additional support for the mattress, so I would save money- since I woudn't need additional support.

I purchased the frame and a new queen mattress ($600 from a different retailer). I received the bed frame on 1/2/2017 and the new mattress on 1/4/2017. I put the mattress on the frame and tried to sleep, but woke up in pain and discomfort. I was not sure what the problem was- but thought could be the mattress, since the store said that I would not need additional support with any mattress I used on that frame. I then purchased a $50 mattress topper- that didn't help.

On 1/7/2017(within 5 days of receiving the bed frame) I went to the Living Spaces store on Bell Rd. and explained that I was in great pain after sleeping on my new bed. I asked again if I needed a box spring or something under the mattress. They assured me I did not need any additional support and thought it must be the new mattress.

3 associate helped me shop for another mattress on the 7th, but I held off purchasing at the last moment, because my body was sore and bruised from my 2 attempts at sleeping on the bed that it was hard to differentiate what mattress would be comfortable in the long run.
I slept in another room of my home, and I waited several days for the body soreness to clear up so I could test the beds again and make a decision. 

On 1/12/2017 I went to the location off McDowell and tested the beds again. I asked the associate if it could be the slats that were causing the discomfort and pain I was experiencing. He assured me that wasn't the case, but at checkout, he suggested I buy a board from home depot and put it under the mattress.

I went home, put the new $1000 mattress on the frame and attempted to sleep. Within a couple hours I had the same discomfort and pain. I started researching on the internet and discovered that foam mattresses should be supported by a flat surface and if there are slats that are more than 2 inches apart, it can cause the mattress to seep in between the slats and make the bed very uncomfortable. On top of this I learned that my bed frame had slats much further apart than 2 inches, and the slats are also flexible euro slats, which bend and move under the mattress- which would also make a foam mattress extremely uncomfortable- Basically- this bed frame is not meant to support a foam mattress, more so a standard coil type mattresses.

I immediately emailed Living Spaces 1/13/2017 in the middle of the night and explained the situation. I received an apathetic response- that their associates are only required to share manufacturers descriptions, and the message suggested trying a ""Bunkie board"". 
I emailed them back pleading to come to resolution, but they did not respond.

I tried the board suggestion, but it did not help. In the meantime, I ordered a low profile foundation support, hoping this would solve the problem (this cost around $150).  I ended up sleeping on the original mattress I purchased for $600, on the floor, as the bed frame was too uncomfortable. I received the support foundation 1/16  and put it under the new $1000 mattress I bought at Living Spaces. Now the bed sits way too high, and after a few hours on the bed it is painful and uncomfortable. The flexible slats are still bending under the weight of the mattress causing the foam mattress to not sit correctly, and it hurts me. 

I contacted Living Spaces 1/17 and spoke with a supervisor named Laura, who told me they would not do anything or allow me to return the frame, because it was past their 7 day return policy. I called back and spoke with another woman who reached out to the store and they said they ""might"" get in touch with me and then another Supervisor named Marshae, took the phone from the person helping me and told me a senior manager would call me back in 1 hour. No one called back. 3 hours later I called again, and was told someone would call back sometime today.

All I ask for was the opportunity to return the bed frame, so I can get something designed for a foam mattress. I asked if I could return the $1000 mattress since I am still within the 7 day return policy,- but Laura said they do not allow returns on mattresses.  

At the end of the day, I reached out to them within 5 days of receiving the bed frame and made them aware there was a problem. It's clear that I have tried everything to resolve this problem on my end and I have reached out appropriately to the store, the website, the corporate headquarters and this began before the return period was up. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and even purchased a $1000 mattress from them- that ended up being entirely unnecessary. I have spent $2500 all together and am sleeping on the floor. After all this- I only asked to return the frame.",2017-01-17 18:44:54

I got off to a really bad start at this place, too, they made me wait for a table at this half empty restaurant.  Which was okay, I guess, because D. Frank Designs is across the street.   Anyway, I come back, the sweet little hostess girl has my table ready, but the poor girl is limping because she fell at home the night before and hurt her knee!!  She even shows me the damage!  So, I guess it's okay that I had to wait a bit.  I mean the poor working girl is maimed!!!

So, wouldn't you know, she sits me in front of a window and it's hot as blazes there.  Geez.  So, I complain to my delightful servers Byran and Melia.  Yes, I get two servers.  I think they can easily identify a tough customer at this joint.  I quickly identified them as Mutt & Jeff.  So, Byran says he will tamper with my ventilation and I think, ya right.  But right away, it gets cooler and so do I.  

Anyway, this place has ""Republic of Tea"" tea.  You can't go wrong with any establishment that serves Republic of Tea.  I'm getting stoked now.  So, anyway, I check out the menu and can't decide what I want.  I mean, I'm starving, but I'm not that hungry.  Bryan convinces me to try the Stetson.  He says that if I don't love it, he will take it back and get me something else.  He says that no one has ever sent back the salad.  That's a challenge I can't pass up on.  So, I've finally made up my mind and then that wonderful Melia  comes out with some incredible hummus, fresh chopped salsa and spinach tortillas to tide me over until my salad come.  The flavors were so amazing together!  So fresh and delicious!

Next comes my Stetson Salad.  I don't need to describe it, because every yelp-er before me has done an excellent job.  But you don't know how really amazing this salad is until you try one yourself.  It is so incredibly good.  It's the first and only time that I have ever finished any salad anywhere.  It was so amazing.

Anyway, the sad part for me was that this was my last meal in Scottsdale.  And it was just lunch.  I wish I would have eaten here sooner and I wish I could have experienced dinner.  I will be back.  And Cowboy Ciao will be my first stop next time.

One of the things that I think sets this place apart, (besides the interesting food),  is the incredible service.  I felt like I was visiting Bryan's and Melia's and they were there to take care of me.  It's a very friendly place, I love that!!",2008-01-24 23:00:39

It also helps to abstain from it when you have a grumpy person cutting it for you. An old coworker once said that when they watched the movie The Wrestler, Mickey Rourke's character reminded him of me. Specifically the scene in which he is working the deli counter and cut himself and then cursed out the customers. I guess I could see where some of the comparison is but I don't like seeing blood and I wouldn't do that. I could understand where he was coming from. His back was against the wall and cutting the meat was symbolic of the world cutting into him. Giant Eagle charges too much than they trick you into buying gas from them too. And to continue on, I have been shopping at that 7-11, now Moon's corner store for years and they put that massive Get Go across the street. That is the last straw! I want Tops back! Or Finast!

its a home store but not like you would experience at home outfitters or the bay.  though those places and ones like them, small and large, have very many things from which to choose, they do not have the unusual takes on the same objects.

for example one of the pictures i took was of these espresso machines. each machine was shaped like an upside down pyramid and the choices of colour are all bright and bold.  youll find similar takes on espresso cups, vases, etc, a lot of which are made with ceramic and are also very colourful.  i imagine those smaller items people might buy more often as little additions to their home gear, for a special dinner or something.  i imagine that if your style is explosive with colour, then things like the espresso machine above would suit you well and youd have many more things to consider buying when you arrive because there are lots of them.

some things are not only cool in design and functional, but are, because of their durability, potentially more environmentally friendly.  there are these place mats that i saw at the Art Gallery of Ontario as well, which were about 25 bucks each, made of some type of durable rubber and are purported to last longer.  the designs are pretty cool though.

you can also find some jewellery and other items more geared towards design than function, so if you have the extra cash to spend it on a functional item that is coupled with more adventurous designs this is a fun place to get something neat.",2008-12-22 20:35:59

The thing that really bothers me about this place is the staff. They are hyper-vigilant, almost militaristic. I watched a staff member last night tell two children not to sit on a bench. It was clearly a bench for sitting so what is the problem?  She returned 10 minutes later and told them it was okay to sit on it.  This episode, combined with a woman telling me I couldn't wait in line without my husband and that I had to wait to get in line when he returned from the restroom really, really irritated me. Seriously?  These people need to lighten up.  Even the security guard when we walked in asked us if we knew where we were going after I paused to put my parking ticket inside my purse so I wouldn't lose it.  My husband was wearing a suit (he came straight from work) and I was wearing a dress. Clearly we are not riff raff.  We are responsible, 45+ mature adults just wanting to see a popular art exhibit. Quit being so condescending and militaristic in the way you manage people who PAY an annual fee to be members. I am not going to renew my membership after this year. Not a single staff member smiled or greeted us warmly. They were more concerned with YOU CANT DO THIS, YOU CANT DO THAT, DONT SIT THERE, DON'T TOUCH THAT, etc.  it really is a shame that the staff has a chip on its shoulder. I have been to some incredible museums all over the world, and the attitude and behavior of the staff here is appalling.  5 stars for the exhibits the museum has throughout the year. 1 Star for the staff.

I liked everything and the soufflé didn't really need the sauce, but I tried it in a bite anyways. Never tried matcha creme brûlée before, I liked the flavour. The earl grey macaron was fantastic. The lady working said that the colours of the shells of the macarons are just colouring, the flavour is the cream between the shells. The sweet pearing tea unfortunately didn't have much flavour and by the second time adding hot water to it, there was practically no flavour left. On the other hand, the wellness booster tea had a little too much flavour, so unless you like it strong, don't leave your teabag in too long.

Have been back numerous times. Food is great but service continues to be an issue. They are friendly but slow. Difficult to get refills and have a timely meal. I've been quite happy because I only go when I'm not in a hurry and don't mind waiting and waiting.  Beware if you get put in the back end of the bar. It's rough getting service there. Hope they get back on Door dash as we loved getting delivery from them. 

Had been wanting to try this place since it is in the neighborhood. 

Pros
Menu has many options and fun variations. The BLT includes avocado and fried tomatoes. Yummy
Looks like they have an interesting whiskey menu-they had some unique options
The person who sat us was friendly and gave us the impression that service would be great even though he had no idea if they had Hudson Baby Bourbon and did not check 

Cons
We were told when we sat that Kristen or a similar name would be right over-well there was a girl in the bar watching all the other tables and she never came. Made direct eye contact with us repeatedly but never bothered to see if we needed service. We were in her area and clearly had nothing (no drinks, menus, etc. After 20 full minutes we were able to grab a waiter from another area and see if he could get us menus, drinks and take our order. He was very nice and said he would get us started and find ""Kristen"". Again she never arrived so we asked the guy if he could help us. He did and gave us great service. I would have told someone as I left but I couldn't even figure out who to tell. 

The food was good but I prefer to have some service as I can't take my own order into the kitchen. I did figure out the whiskeys once I got a menu. Service is a real issue here. The bartender seemed to be talking to a table of her own friends and that is why she was unable to serve us. 

I would have given the food 4 stars, the menu would have gotten 5 stars but when service is that bad, I just can't do it. Will I try again?  Not sure",2017-03-17 10:01:13

They were still fixing the upstairs room and have no website up yet either. The patio looks sort of the same, but they cleaned it up and put cornhole there now. 
    The happy hour is not unique and innovative as they advertise, it is just dumb. They only have four specials, one drink from beer, wine, mixed and that's all. Only one beer on happy Hour price? Not a really bright marketing team, but maybe they are focusing on food, where they have six happy hour specials (although one is same price as normal).

The cherry filling used in the crumb cake and the strudel was unsweetened and rather bland, and they were both so cold when we got them home and ate them that I wonder if they were frozen at one time.

Sit right at the bar and you'll get instant service. We never had a problem getting our orders to us in timely fashion. The Screaming orgasm was probably the tastiest of the specialty rolls we had. The meat was arranged in a poke like fashion over tasty crispy noodles and tangy sauce. I agree with a previous critic that they rely on sauce a little too much here, but it is tasty nonetheless. The jerry roll went down smoothly, and the crunch roll can be addicting. Dynamite was very filling and a good value pick ( if you don't mind baked rolls). For those who don't know, it's a mixture of scallop and chopped shrimp baked over rice soaked in a creamy sauce. They offer a huge selection of specialty rolls here but they also do nigiri. The yellowtail was very thick-- some of the biggest pieces of nigiri i've ever seen. The squid was as well. You don't have to go AYCE to get a good value here, especially if you're willing to try a number of their nigiri offerings.

And ""the P factor"" (this one is where I rate how the bathroom looked, as it is important for me to see a clean restroom. I take this as a sign that the rest of the place is clean.

This is that kind of place, with a mix of people all making the pilgrimage for the same reason: brunch.

I have been to Dairy Lane a few times, mostly for brunch. I have also tried their burgers on an evening stop over - which are excellent.

As everyone says, be prepared to wait a bit. It's a small resto and the owners know this and do their best to make it a comfy wait. While you are waiting, the staff will hook you up with a hot drink and there is a bit of space to wait in the back of the resto. If you are outside, there are blankets to keep you warm - such a thoughtful touch, I love it!

The food here is always bang on. I have never had a bad meal and this place never fails to please the company I bring.  The menu is littered with local ingredients (Spraggs, Silverstar) and Dairy Lanes offerings just sound so darn good. I pretty much always order the traditional breakfast: 2 eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. I love it every time and always have a big smile after that breakfast. I always say I will try the breakfast sandwich, stuffed french toast or even a special - but it's always one of those "" I'll try that next time"" because I can't resist the traditional and I know I'll be back. I am seriously considering rocking it out hobbit style, with second breakfast just so I can try more of the menu.

We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich which turned out to be the special for the day -only $5 each, with a side. I had the cole slaw while she had Mac and cheese. The sandwiches were delicious and decently sized for the price. Would have preferred that the bun wouldn't have been cold (as in refrigerated). Cole slaw was good, not great. Mac and cheese was excellent. The pork itself was tender and juicy and included some of the crispy edges, which we love. They have four sauces - mustard, vinegar, sweet, and spicy). My favorite today was the vinegar sauce. I suppose I must have been channeling North Carolina. My wife loved the sweet - a real fan of Kansas City BBQ. It really was good, as was the spicy. Mustard sauce, too, but I'm not a huge mustard sauce fan. We will most definitely be back. I have to try the brisket. One Yelper complained about fatty sections of brisket, so it is really calling to me (that's where the flavor is in beef). Then at least another trip to taste the links. Eat. Enjoy. Repeat. Repeat.

Plus No Frills has a great stock on President Choices' items and you can collect PC points here as well.

This store is very spacious and have large aisles where two shopping carts can easily pass one another with plenty of room on either side.

There's an onsite butcher shop with a large selection of meats and looks pretty good judging by the busy crowd waiting.  They have a ticketed number system which is great to streamline the customers waiting or else people will just jump the queue. 

The produce section has improved over the years and they have a pretty decent selection. Everything is organized neatly and there seems to be plenty of floor staff to ensure the clean upkeep of their sections.

There's also an onsite pharmacy and a good deal of health and beauty products.  Also, a good selection of gluten-free products is available.

Essentially all your food products and household needs, plus seasonal items located in one store at inexpensive prices, hence the busy crowds is not a surprise. 

Just don't expect much from the cashiers as most of them are unfriendly and curt with  only a handful of times have I actually received pleasant checkout experience with the cashiers.

Come to this location at your own risk because the shopping experience can be quite interesting and will definitely test your patience at checkout.",2015-03-09 03:59:39

 In Reno I ordered their Huevos Rancheros, a lot of food.... it was good and their hash browns are crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. 
This last time I ordered a sandwich, I think called Alltogether, it sounded like a BLT with egg, green chile and avocado. I never tasted the green chile and the egg and avocado didn't stand out and gave the sandwich an overall bland flavor.

They definitely don't skip the the alcohol, and their Margarita's are pretty cheap. You can get a 48oz (depending on the style) for at least 11$ which is crazy! I asked if they will serve a 48oz margarita for two for one, and they said they would. I think this could be dangerous for margarita lovers..

They have soup and salad bar to go with your order which is nice.  The vegetable soup is pretty good, but I prefer it with the little chunks of tofu in addition to the veggies that most of the other thai places I frequent have.

I think I am missing something on the food.  The two things I have tried here the Pad See Eww and the Drunken Noodles were both much different than I have had before.

You simply select you service, service provider location, and the date - and the system shows you all available time slots.  Once I booked my appointment, I received a text confirmation, as well as an email with instructions on how to prepare for my spray tanning session.  Furthermore, the site provides a ""look book"" in which you can ""pick your Glo"".  Being very fair skinned, I decided to go with a sun kissed Glo, which is a light medium.

Preparing for a spray tan is the key element in getting an even and long-lasting tan.  Exfoliation is essential, and not applying lotion once you step out of the shower is also just as important.

I was greeted by Donna when I walked into the studio.  She asked me some basic questions and gave me simple instructions on the process.  She was very professional and friendly throughout the experience, and I felt very comfortable being sprayed in my birthday suit.  The bronzer was applied evenly, and I felt she really took time and care in the application.

Glo carries a series of three skin care products, as well, including an exfoliator and tinted moisturizer which helps to extend the life of the tan.  For a 20oz. bottle of the tinted moisturizer I paid $15, which is a very reasonable price.  The lotion is quickly absorbed by the skin, and does not leave a residue or film.  It also has a wonderfully tropical scent and does not leave an orange coloration on the skin which most tinted lotions tend to do.

The following morning I showered and gently washed off the spray tan.  I was very impressed with the result:  the tan was the exact shade that I had selected with Donna, it was even, and I looked extremely healthy, refreshed, and sunkissed!",2011-09-02 18:05:53

I understand that sashimi is expensive so it's reserved for dinner AYCE only. So it's fine that they don't offer it. In the downtown area, there are so many sushi places offering lunch specials between $6-9 dollars for non-AYCE options but many of them don't have ""raw fish"". Many lunch specials are just chicken teriyaki or bento boxes with california rolls (which contains no raw fish). I like those too but sometimes I crave for sashimi so lunch AYCE is what I do if I want some raw fish for lunch. 

What made it intolerable were the sushi. HUGE MASSIVE CHUNKS OF RICE with a scrawny piece of fish on top. The fish was so small it just falls right off if you pick it up with chopsticks. As if having a bad rice to fish ratio wasn't bad enough, the mackerel sushi tasted lukewarm. Either they left it out in the open for too long, or the fish was slightly rotten, or did they actually try to defrost it by heating it? I don't know but it tasted nasty. 

The initial order of sushi made me more full than intended thanks to the rice and my personality of insisting not to waste food. So I didn't get to try as much of the other dishes as I'd like. I recall I ordered salmon teriyaki and a few other meat items. Those are not easy to screw up and they tasted infinitely better than the sushi. 

The terrible sushi alone warrants a one star rating. There are so many sushi shops in the GTA and especially the downtown area that I can't overlook such a crippling flaw.",2013-03-25 13:02:23

-We got the waffle fries, 10/10 delicious!
-Brisket: sorta dry and stringy but loved having a side of sauce with it. I couldn't finish my portion with how dry it was
-Pulled pork was very good with awesome color
-Wings were good with sauce but I'd like to try them dry
-Rib tips were SO good
-Slaw is crispy and fresh, but if you like creamy slaw, this won't be for you
-Babe got the philly sammich and it was absolutely delish; he subbed the cheese sauce for shredded cheddar and Asiago

I remember saving up for an opportunity to try this place when I was working part time. Extremely expensive, but definitely worth going. My absolute favorite cut is the New York. When my steak came, I was beyond excited. It was cooked to perfection and rested for just the right amount of time. The moment my knife cut into it, juice filled my plate. One of the best experiences I have had in Montreal. My friend had gotten the filet mignon and she could not stop raving about it.

First impression was a little strange as there is no table service. You are pleasantly greeted by a nice hard working elderly lady who instructs you to order at the window and then take a seat while your food is prepared. Once the food is ready she beckons to you from across the room so that you can come pick up your food in the window. Not sure if this is just a lunch thing and if dinner service has a different system but once I understood how the system worked it was fine. As for the food... We ordered the famed bolognese ragu over linguine, chicken parm., and fettuccine alfredo. My wife had the bolognese and said it was just okay. The pasta overwhelmed the dish with very little bolognese mixed in so it was a little dry and flavorless, somewhat disappointing. The chicken parm. was actually pretty tasty in my opinion and worthy of ordering again. The fettuccine alfredo was not good at all. Very basic pasta with cream. There was no real taste at all and was a total disappointment. Overall I think that this place rides on the coattails of the triple D review from Guy Fieri. I do not understand the long lines and rave reviews to be honest. Oh, one last thing... As previously mentioned we used a Local Dines $15 for $30 worth of food coupon. When I got the bill at the end the nice older lady added up the food, deducted the coupon amount,then proceeded to add 18% gratuity to the bill based on the total amount without even asking. I have no issue with a tip, but presuming 18% when there is no real table service, just a woman beckoning to you from a window, well I thought that a bit much. Yes, she did come out from behind the window and was very nice, but it was not her position to add 18% tip to a four top table. At the end of the day this place is 35 minutes from my home and in no way justifying of the drive and a follow up visit. Sorry Giuseppe's on 28th, I wish I had found a true hole in the wall to call home, but to the contrary was disappointed with your food.",2012-05-03 23:10:31

The space is open and airy, and there are lots of tables and comfy chairs to sit and read or write.  They have free wi-fi (they'll give you the password at the counter), although I don't think there were a ton of outlets for laptop plugs.

I had a coffee and a sticky-sweet blueberry muffin.  There were probably about 8 billion calories in that heavenly muffin, but it was delicious, and I like to think that it gave me enough creative energy to work on my book that it was worth it :)  They do have a menu of *real* food, not just baked goods, so I think I will try some of that the next time I go in.

The only thing I'd say as a heads-up is that they have a few large coolers that are a bit loud, so I would recommend bringing your iPod along.

I enjoy the Mediterranean tuna with capers, calamata olives, and red onion. served on Zoe slaw. I am not a big fan of mayo so this oil based tuna is way better to me. 

Other Yummy choices...
The chicken kabobs ask for well done a little dried but brown and tasty with rice and a salad.

The sound system was so bad that I couldn't understand a word of what they were saying or doing. The band was really loud, especially the drums so it drowned out the singers. 
The lighting was terrible too. A lot of the time there were just a bunch of people running around on a dark stage. Then they would back-light them with a spotlight that shined directly into my eyes. 
I thought I had bought the best seats in the house but it turns out that some of the show is behind the seating so we couldn't see what was happening behind us. If you are going to go, then buy in section 301. Those seats seem to be better. 
The actors reproduce scenes fro 3 tragic love stories weaving between Romeo and Juliet, Moulin Rouge, and The Great Gatsby. I liked all 3 movies so I found some pleasure in the beat of the music although I could not understand the words. Some of the singers had really good voices. Juliet in particular was spectacular. She could win one of the singing shows on TV or have a solo career. I'd go to a show of just her. 

If the production manager and director could get their act together this could be a 4 star or better show. They have the talent in the cast it is just managed poorly.

The more common system where a waitress gets your order like in a regular resto is such a pain compared to this. You have to remember what you want, how much, while looking at the menu and this happens while she stands there writing everything up. No wonder service is never good at these things.

I ordered the french toast with mixed berries. Although the portion was huge, the french toast was so plain, no cinnamon or icing sugar and they used regular white sandwich bread. I only tasted the egg batter, it probably should have been cooked a little longer. The mixed berries were served in a tiny bowl with about 6-8 berries and they were almost frozen.    

I ordered a side of Peameal bacon which was unusually oily. They must have cooked it with the bacon on the grill. I ordered Peameal bacon because I didn't want the oil / fat.   

Unlikely to return in the future.

My first reaction to the menu was holy cow, $27-38 for an entree?! That led us to order off their grazing and out of the box menu. I actually prefer orderly a bunch of smaller dishes so I can sample a variety of things.

Prok Barbacoa - not worth getting. Yes, it was tender and juicy but not flavorable at all. I wish it had more of the stone fruit chamoy toppings or something. The sweet potato/almod patata the pork was sitting on what not memorable either. We didn't really taste anything that made it stand out. Only reason why we even noticed it was because we cut into it while splitting the plate.

Brushetta Duet - I'm glad this dish was only $5. I would've been pretty upset if it was more. Two of the four bruschetta pieces were charred. Why would you even serve it? It doesn't cost that much to replace the pieces... 

Truffled 'Mac n' Cheese' - Winner! This was the only dish we ate that left us both craving for more and even fighting for the last bite. The mac and cheese is topped with broken potato chips and you'll find hidden pancetta pieces. Must try!!!

Berkshire Belly & Waffles - good and different? If you've had roasted pork from the Chinese BBQ stores it tastes very similar. You have to eat the pork and waffles together. The items by themselves didn't work. The dish comes with maple butter but it wasn't needed I don't think.

Staff were welcoming and friendly.  Very quick and attentive to take either your drink or food orders.  Wait times for the food was minimal and acceptable.  Very helpful with any questions we had. 

Food portion sizes were great and more than adequate for even one person.
Food was very tasty, fresh, and had lots of flavorful ingredients. 

I ordered the ginger chicken entree that came with a side of rice (white steamed).  The rice was piping hot and sticky and was a perfect complement to the dish. 
The ginger chicken dish was filled with lots of chicken and fresh vegetables and not too overpowered taste of ginger.

The Artichoke Hearts D'Agnese I really don't have any complaints about. They were pretty solid - not mind blowingly good, but a good dish. 

The salmon came with a side salad and a side of pasta, which I had with Marinara sauce. The salad was decent and the pasta not too bad - the marinara was nothing special and could have been out of a jar. The real let down was the Salmon - really good sauce and side vegetable selection, but a massively overcooked salmon! You actually needed a knife to cut through it... it was the first time I have not finished a piece at a restaurant. 

The chocolate cake was a triple layer cake with chocolate mousse as filling, and unfortunately seemed a wee bit dry. Good flavours though.

I'm willing to give Arrabiata's the benefit of the doubt and chalk the salmon down to a really busy night. I might try this place again, and if I do, will update.

So, living in Phoenix, it is quite difficult for me as cab fare can be quite expensive, and cops are ready to pounce on foolish prey like me. So, last weekend, my best friend and I decided to have a weekend of debauchery and book a room at Hotel Indigo. I've heard my friends raving over it, so I said to myself, ""Why not?"" I'm glad that I decided to. 

From the minute I stepped in, I loved the abstract interior. Hotel Indigo isn't conventional, and I loved that. Another thing that I loved is how inexpensive it is, compared to many other hotels. We were fairly close by to the clubs, and if not, cab fare was inexpensive if we wanted to go to a club that is further down in Old Town. The only gripe I had in my room was the AC seemed to not work that well. However, all in all, I had a great experience. 

The breakfast that I added in to our hotel room deal was marvelous. My friend and I had fun talking to the guys behind the counter, and when my friend inquired about the theme behind Hotel Indigo, he explained that the paintings are all symmetrical, abiding by Da Vinci's reccuring theme in his paintings.

They had quite a crowd for lunch, which was no problem, the dishes were filled as fast as they were depleted. The Chinese dishes were all above par. The salt and pepper shrimp and the salt and pepper squid were my faves. I didn't try the sushi because I was bothered by the fact that it was all covered in plastic wrap, which meant that one would have to touch it to pull it up to get a piece.

Inside this hopping hub inspired by the geniuses of Green is part bakery, part ice cream shop, and part coffe haus....sprinkled with brunch awesomeness in the morning and on weekends. This is my go-to spot for any sweet treat, because as my friends know I do not eat crap. I am now on primarily a low-calorie, low carb, primarily vegan/fish based diet. I watch what I eat and work out regularly.

How does Nami fit in? After a stressful day, instead of grabbing 5 beers and nachos, or a heaping 3 scoop fatty ice cream, I come here. I grab a 100% soy-based ice cream treat called a Tsoynami, which comes with dozens of variations made up by Nami. My personal favorite is The Doughboy, with vanilla soy soft serve and 100% organic chocolate chip cookie dough. Horrible for you? Meh, not great by any means. Better than Coldstone. Actually, you could probably have two Tsoynamis and be still way better off than anything Coldstone, Baskin Robbins, or Dairy Queen has to offer. 

They also have a very high quality coffee bar which provides basic coffee fair, along with a dizzying arrangement of baked goods all vegan friendly. The vegan doughnuts blow my mind. I have yet to dance the doughnut dance at Nami, but I can do an eye test and say ""I approve"".  Overall, I can't give this place enough love. It's super trendy, the food on the weekends (look at their menu) are so to die for gang...its delicious. Green is a business genius for concocting the awesomeness that is Nami.

Now, I'll skip right past the mystery if there was any in the first place; it's an O&B restaurant. Not a bad thing necessarily, not a point in its favor either (I try and avoid chain restaurants sometimes). I find this out before I go and am unabated in wanting to go. I've looked at the menu and it looks good so there's no turning back now.

When I go I was here on a date, and so the main focus was really the date and not the food, but turns out the food maybe should have been the real focus....I'll get to that a bit later :D

So, we are looking over the mains and I suggest sharing the duck poutine pizza. I've noticed that most of my fellow Yelpers are also fans of this dish as it seems to account for about 65% of the pictures from here. It does not disappoint, it's cheesy and delicious and the fries are crisp, the gravy nice and flavorful and the shallots adding that extra zing that you need.

It is at this point I commit my first strategic error, I pay more attention to my date. Now don't get me wrong, 100 out of 100 times I'd suggest doing the same, but alas, this date doesn't pan out, which goes to show you that when choosing between your date and pizza, always choose pizza because unlike your date, pizza always works out!

That is all. Go get the pizza!",2017-12-07 02:55:39

Atmosphere: order at the front, sit down, and they bring your food to our table. It's an upscale fast food setup, like a Zoe's Kitchen or Panera. 

Burgers: I ordered the daily special, which was a burger (I upgraded to the grass fed beef), Mac and cheese and Sriracha dusted honey bacon on a bun. The burger by itself was mouth-watering and the bacon was a great mix of sweet and smokey. The Mac and cheese was a good consistency with hint of relish. I absolutely loved the burger and it was not too filling. My husband got the Seoul burger, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  

Sides: the broccoli and garlic was very good,however I was hoping for more. The only downside to our visit was the French fries, they were a little too greasy for my liking.

This is a very, very small restaurant, that seats only twenty or so patrons.  We arrived early and waited for about forty five minutes or so for our seats in the rear, near the kitchen.  This was actually a good place, since we had no one sitting next to us and all the other seats were on top of each other, elbow to elbow. 

Giuseppe's may seem like a one man show because the owner Rich is woking both ends of the house, but we believe there were three others working in the kitchen.  

We started with Antipasto for $10.95, and then ordered our normal baseline meal of Chicken Breast Parmigiana for $14.95 and the Pasta Bolognese Ragu with a side of Meatballs and Sausage for $16.95, plus the $4.00 up charge.  We also had two soft drinks, which seemed expensive at $3.00 each. 

The food was very good for what they call: ""Phoenix's Favorite Local Italian Kitchen!""  I know they've taken some heat for being on the Food Network and Guy Fieri's show ""Diners, Drive-In and Dives"".  But this is nothing more then a good local Italian place.

I couldn't wait to come back since then and we finally visited again last night. If you aren't familiar, Choolaah is a fast casual restaurant that serves Indian food. It's more Americanized Indian- so don't come here if you are expecting authentic. The spice level here is nothing compared to what you will find at a traditional Indian restaurant. However, this place is still absolutely delicious. 

First and foremost, parking can be a pain in this area, but if you park in the garage directly next to Choolaah, it's free under 45 minutes. Easy peasy. Customer service here was excellent- so friendly and helpful. I ordered the choolah bowl with chicken and tikka marsala, 2 orders of garlic naan, a chicken wrap, an order of samosas, and a ginger mint lemonade. This was plenty of food for 2 people (there was enough leftovers for 1 additional meal) and cost around $26. The food was ready in under 10 minutes, and was packed up perfectly for us as it was to-go. One of my favorite things about Choolaah, is the fact that their sauces are out in the open, and ready for the taking. I'm a huge sauce girl, so I adore this. I love their tamarind apple sauce (a sweet sauce), the mint yogurt, and the spicy mango. Their mild hot sauce is also delicious. I snagged a bunch of sauces and enjoyed each one. As for the food, it's all super tasty. The choolah bowl is huge, and is easily 2 portions of food for me. The samosas are on the small side and an order of them comes with only 3. Although I prefer traditional samosas, these are still tasty. The naan is thin, but very flavorful. The chicken wrap is just the right amount for one person and is super tasty as well. The mint ginger lemonade is probably my favorite lemonade ever- the flavor is just unmatched to anything else I've had.

There are 2 ranges, one in the front that is quite small but there is one in the back they open up when they get busy.  I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to get a range.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I've been there when they were not busy once and I needed a bit of help field stripping my firearm and I was not shown how to do so. Every other range that I've gone to will have staff assist you in taking your gun apart If you need assistance.

My friend went wedding dress shopping today and we decided we were hungry and ready for a bite. Today has proven to me that it is no longer patio season in Phoenix. Boy is it hot outside. They originally wanted to seat us at a table in the sun but we decided to squeeze at a smaller table in the shade. 

The server gets 1 star. It's not like we had a huge group - there were 5 of us. I ordered a mimosa and the others had margaritas and beer. My mimosa didn't show up until the rest of the group was ready for a second round of drinks. I also had to point it out to our server when she finally came around to check on us. 

When I finally got my mimosa, there was a black speck in it and the orange slice that was there for decor had some on it too. Maybe they had something burnt next to the orange slices...? I didn't make a stink about it and drank it but definitely didn't order another one because who knows what else I will find in the next one. And that's if the server doesn't forget I ordered one. 

Food - I would give them 2 and a half stars. I ordered 2 fish tacos and one braised short rib taco. The cook was a little heavy handed with the seasoning for the fish tacos. The short rib taco was just blah but I ate it anyway because I was hungry and it's really only 3 bites since they are small tacos. 

When our food arrived to the table, I asked for some napkins since we didn't have any at our table. The person who dropped off our food never came back with any so I got up and rounded up some silverware and napkins from 2 other tables. 

Usually, I would round up on my rating if I was in between two ratings but because of the service we received, our experience deserves two stars. If you are craving tacos, go elsewhere. They have $20 bottomless mimosas here but you won't get your money's worth unless you plan on spending all day here.",2017-03-20 00:51:22

-Enormous cuts when ordering nigiri...almost double thick of other places
-Unique dishes like ""the shit"" and ""poki nachos""

For me to travel from Summerlin across the strip rather than hit all the ""good"" places in Spring Valley says something. This place is great.

Tip: The extra $5 pricing at dinner time allowing you to order the no rice roll options is WELL WORTH IT over the $20.95 lunch price...I'm sure you could go at lunch and ask to pay $25.95 for dinner menu options, the fish is all right there...

They put out fans by the ITG and DDR machines to help cool off the players and the price of water and snacks in the vending machine is beyond reasonable.

The sad thing is that we ""tried"" to go to Red Lobster first, but were repelled by the large crowd of waiting people.  No, I don't want to stand around like cattle waiting for my pager to buzz so I can be ushered to a cramped seat, fed, branded, and ushered out again stampede style.  The mighty gods of chain restaurants everywhere are wagging their fingers at me right now saying, ""what do you expect lady?""  I know, I know.  

So we went to Olive Garden down the street.  No wait there.  Our waitress was very young, I'll refer to her as ""Sparky"".  My dining companion had a sudden need to try some wine, so he asked Sparky what would pair well with the lasagna.  She didn't come across confident as she pointed to the list of wines on the menu that mister dining companion was holding.  She finally chose one and said that it would go well with the ""meaty"" dish.  I'm not sure what either one of us was expecting because after all this is Olive Garden and we have almost zero knowledge of wines.  So de-classA!!  

After Sparky left our table, dining companion says that he expects the chosen wine to be the suck because Sparky doesn't look like she's even old enough to drink, let alone have knowledge of the fine wines.  But you know, none of this really matters when you consider the fact that compared to her we are old as dirt, and still don't know shit about wine.

I had the eggplant Parmesan with Alfredo sauce.  It usually comes with marinara, but if I'm going to have a heart attack it had better well be because of something I enjoyed eating, not something I felt like I had to eat in the name of my health!  Hell no!  

Dining companion had his red wine something or other, and he was right it sucked.  He described it as tasting like, ""the barrel it came out of"".  

After the main course I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.  I made sure to look in a direction where no one could see my face before I crossed my eyes from sheer delight.  I am a pumpkin lovin' nerd by nature, and this cheesecake was gooood.

So this chain experience wasn't too bad.  The only thing that sucked was no refill on the bread sticks.  If I'm going to go slummin' at the chain restaurants, I expect the constant refills man.  Especially on those items they advertise as ""bottomless"" and/or ""never-ending"".   Finally, Sparky took a long time to bring by the check, and this goes against the code of chain fine dining, wham, bam, thank you mam.  Touche!",2008-09-21 03:27:46

You enter the restaurant and it's like you're transported to Greece. From the cheerfully loud and vibrant Greeks that run the place to the chairs and tables that looks exactly like the ones in the actual Athens, the mood and decor transport you to another world. On top of this, there's the ""experience"" of heading to the back kitchen to see what's available for the day - fun, unique, but above all, makes you feel like you're being welcomed into a Greek home. This place oozes with charm and, dare I say, even a touch of magic. 

And so when the food comes, your expectations are so high. And let me say this first: The food is good. The saganaki was fried well, the octopus had great texture/taste, the moussaka was full and hearty, etc. It's just that I was expecting something more. Or maybe more precisely, something different. For while Athens Restaurant is better than many of the Greek restaurants I've tried in Toronto, it's not a lot better, let alone truly different/outstanding. 

So 3.5 stars is a reflection of my confusion with this charming place/experience that raised my expectations, and the food that was good but not magical.",2017-11-21 19:53:26

Good quality food, every dish is made to order and fresh. A few items are interestingly ""unique"" -- 

Dessert fried sesame ball with a sweet-savory custard filling (vs. the regular black sesame or red bean paste fillings that you get from every other dim sum place). 

The taro cake is steamed not pan fried; it has several layers of texture from the slightly crunchy shredded taro at the top graduating down to almost sticky-rice-cake texture at the bottom. 

The sticky rice roll is a must-try if you like glutinous rice.  White and purple rice seasoned delicately to accentuate it natural sweetness.  The bi-colour rice is held in place by a thin layer of steamed dough, quite pretty.  

Rice rolls with shrimp is a typical dim sum dish, but these shrimps are gigantic. 

Decor is refreshingly ""done up"" without going gaudy. If you've been to other new-ish dim sum places in Markham or Toronto downtown and are getting blinded by mega watts of chandeliers, you'd be safe entering this place without a pair of shades.

To put it simply, Whattaburger's grilled cheese is puny. It's about 1/4 of the height of an In-n-Out grilled cheese, the lettuce and tomato are on the sad wilty side, the bun was cold (if I hadn't been rushed through ordering I could have gotten it toasted apparently), and there was only 1 slice of cheese. Truly a sad little grilled cheese. Whattaburger has a decent green salad and the french fries are delicious. On another (late night) trip here I got the breakfast and liked it a lot more.

At Minder Binder


Minder Binder seems like a really cool place with a good back story.  Then again I'm here to talk about it's current state.  

I came here on a whim with some people.  First thought it looked like some sort of a Spanish mission and was similar to The Mission in Scottsdale; which is not the case.  Ordering food & drinks was a walk-up counter and food served when it got done; odd way to do things in my books for such a place.  I shot for their famous Cheeseburger and ordered me a beer.  Overall, the cheeseburger was pretty basic in presentation.  The burger patty itself had a tad bit of a char crunched, which I definitely appreciated.  The entree came along with your choice of fries from string, yam, and fingerlings.  My friend ordered their cheese pizza; definitely probably my favorite of the night because of it's crust.  Very doughy, warm, and crunchy!  The cheese was oozy, but wasn't too messy.

In end, the place seems very cool and a place to hangout for drinks.  Service was a hit or miss and the food was okay at best. - Enjoy!",2015-04-20 18:12:53

Good wings, a decent heat from the hot sauce and a decent bottle of hot sauce on the table, TY Tabasco is not the only fruit:) 

The appetizers are large, sharing big plate with kid wasn't an issue and realistically your kid needs a big appetite to get through the normal offering.

Entrees are also hearty and probably not the place to attempt their ribs or chicken before any exercise ( plan your dates accordingly ) 

I just can't get a 5 when the  famously advertised chili beer isn't being made , and the blue moon had ran out.  Bar's selling out of beer when there's not a celtic family reunions just shouldn't happen.

It was a nice day outside and while this wasn't our first choice in a restaurant, it did provide the immediate outdoor seating that we were looking for.  I have probably been past Bella Notte hundreds of times while walking through the Strip District.  While I have thought that the pizza and drinks have always looked good, for some reason I have never stopped.  My wife and I arrived at Bella Notte right around 1 o'clock and were immediately seated at the empty outdoor table.  Due to that I didn't really didn't get to see much of the inside.  The outside seating section of the restaurant consisted of a number of tables right along Penn Avenue with room inbetween them and the restaurant for people to walk on the sidewalk.  Since it was a sunny Saturday, this provided ample people watching for the entire time that we were there.

For lunch both my wife and myself got a beer each (reasonably priced too in my opinion) and then we ordered the bbq pizza to split.  The BBQ pizza consisted of bbq sauce instead of the normal pizza sauce and then had chicken and pineapple as toppings.  Since I am normally able to eat a large pizza all by myself I wondered if I was going to leave slightly hungry.  However that fear proved the unfounded as my wife and I ended up leaving and even taking a piece with us because we were so stuffed.  The pizza itself was quite good.  I really enjoyed the BBQ sauce as the pizza sauce since it had a little sweetness to it.  That made it pair quite well with both the chicken and pineapple.  The real star of the pizza though was the cheese.  There was so much of it on the pie that even without the toppings it would have been quite filling and tasty.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Honestly I am not sure why I have never stopped here before but I enjoyed their pizza and thought my wife and I had a nice lunch for a good price.",2016-06-26 17:19:05

FIrst, the food is delicious. The yakatori here is so juicy and flavorful, whatever it is about that charcoal grill they have, it's magic! All the meats are seriously cooked to perfection. Tiny little skewer portions so you can try tons of different meats/flavors! My favorite is the chicken w/ salt and the tsukune pork.

Second, the ambiance. It's a small restaurant that is super clean, with a fresh minimalist Japanese feel. Music doesn't really fit (dance music), but I like dancing ;)

He quotes me a price $50 cheaper then discount and tells me they will be in ""the next day""(his motto).  3 days later i drop my car off and when I pick it up, it has kumho solus KH16's on it. Ya, he decided to put different tires on without my consent.   Never heard of a tire company doing that!  When questioned, Lorenzo tells us that the KL21's are being discontinued.  So he chose the KH16's instead. A CHEAPER TIRE!  That's how he beat discount tires price.

Kultura is a very sophisticated and upscale restaurant that has 3 floors and seats about 200 people according to their website.

The service was great all night and the food didn't take that long to come out. The server was super because he gave us drinks on the house and even took pictures for us. There wasn't much of a selection of food to choose from and it's a bit pricey. A bottle of wine would run you about $50. But what do you expect? Kultura is a fine dining restaurant so it's expected. I ended up getting the pearl barley risotto and shared the chicken samosas with a friend.

I've been to fantastic farmers markets that existed only under covered tables in parking lots, and only during summer months, so having a year round climate controlled venue is a big plus.  

I won't gripe about cosmetics, nor should I.  It's a ""farmers market,"" it is not Sunterra.    

I made my rounds through this market over one weekday lunch hour.  There were lots of crafts, a few produce and meat sections (though some people may be under an illusion as to how ""local"" some of the produce might be), and a number of hot food vendors.    

For my personal use, I found this Market most relevant as a ""food court"" (sorry) of independent vendors.  

It's a place where I can pop in for lunch and grab some Mexican, Ukrainian, Greek, Indian, ""designer"" burgers, etc., and come away with something that far exceeds fast food.

There's a lot of great options for lunches here, and some mighty fine product.

But that in itself is the source of my star deduction:  ""LUNCHES.""  

I'd probably give this place 4 stars otherwise, but the hours just don't cut it for me.  

I work downtown Monday to Friday, like a significant percentage of the population in this city.  Going for lunch to the market isn't realistic.  But pretty much every day, I drive past Kingsland Farmers Marker on the way home.  Many a time, I've wished I could take a quick detour in, and grab something for dinner.  But it's closed.  

The ""late hours"" are 6:00PM Thursday - Friday, and otherwise 5:00.   Even 6:00 is pushing it from downtown, and you know they are just packing up at that point anyhow.

That's what my fortune cookie said during my first meal at Sunshine Moon Peking Pub the other night.  I say ""first meal"" because I  know there will be more... (and hopefully better fortunes than that one too!)

Rich and his team did a great job renovating this restaurant where Bacon used to reside.  It's now got a cool Asian vibe while still casual and welcoming.  Service (from Kelly and James) was friendly and attentive.  

We took their recommendations and ordered the following:

*Veggie Spring Rolls
*Chilled Cucumber Salad
*Soft Noodles (with Chicken and a fried egg)
*Mushroom Purse
*Shrimp in Lobster Sauce

I know... that's a lot of food for two people, right?!

Well, it sure was but we were hungry, and we did pretty well with it.  We polished off the spring rolls, cucumber salad, and mushroom purse and ended up taking home leftovers of the soft noodles and shrimp.  

I really enjoyed the spring rolls and cucumber salad; I probably could've made a meal on those two menu items alone!  I also liked the mushroom purse - it includes all kinds of funky mushrooms prepared in what I think was a paper ""purse"" of some sort.  I tasted ginger with the mushrooms, which is a good thing if you're like me and like ginger!  I love the concept of the soft noodles with a fried egg on top - everything is better with an egg on it!  This dish was lacking a bit of zing, but we added hot chile sauce to it and that did the trick.  The shrimp was tasty but similar to every other ""shrimp in lobster sauce"" dish I've had in the past.

The one thing I'd like to see added to SMPP's menu is eggplant; I'm a huge eggplant fan and order it pretty much where ever I go! Regardless, even without eggplant, I'm really happy to have another Chinese option close to home.  

SMPP is currently open for dinner six days a week (they are closed on Mondays).  They plan on opening for lunch in 2011.

I visited Under the Table Restaurant for dinner and loved the food and experience (Link to review: http://playingchef.com/2014/09/27/3436/)

There was something so special about my dining experience that I immediately made a reservation for a Saturday morning so that my guests and I could try their brunch offerings. I was feeling brave when I contacted Kim (one of the owners) that I felt okay to ask if they could make chicken and waffles for us (chicken & waffles is not on their menu). I am a huge fan of chicken and waffles, but I have had a hard time finding a worthy one in the city (I generally get my fill when I visit NYC as I normally stay in the Harlem area and they know how to make chicken and waffles--though someone from South Carolina once told me that they don't even know what the hell a waffle maker is!) Nevertheless....

We arrived at Under the Table for our 11am reservation and Kim had already sectioned off an area for us. There were 17 of us and we took up 85% of the restaurant (yes, we did have a reservation for this amount of people). The fact that they were willing to accommodate us was amazing. 

I had a moment of panic when I sat down and realized that I did not check-in with the restaurant about whether everything was still a go (i.e., the chicken & waffles). I had been selling this whole, ""you are going to get the best chicken and waffles EVER"" idea to my guests that it suddenly dawned on me... ""shit! What if they forgot about my request? What if they have no chicken? Or fyer? Or oil? Or flour? Or....."" But my fears were quickly abated when Kim told me that they had chicken and waffles for us. Whew!

Honestly, I was only expecting fried chicken on a waffle. Simple fried chicken, on a waffle. Nothing more. But HOLY SHIT! My mind was BLOWN! The chef did not come up with just 1 type of chicken and waffles, or 2, but 3! She wanted us to have OPTIONS! Huh? Unfuckingbelieaveable! When you hear something like this you want to give them a pass. Like, ""as long-as-my chicken-is-not-raw-in-the-middle-I will-love-it-because-you-are-too damn-nice-to-not-love-what-you-made-me"" kinda scenario. But NO! The 3 options were DELICIOUS! ALL 3! Ok, I apologize for the caps, but I feel like I need to make a point here. ALL THREE WERE FANTASTIC! 
The 3 options were (I apologize, but I cannot remember the exact sauces/syrup--there were different sauces/syrups for each one):

1. Fried chicken and waffles with bacon 
2. Fried chicken and waffles with berries
3. Jerk chicken and waffles 

And the waffles? Imagine a waffle and a funnel cake having a baby. Their child is what you got. Oh so good.....

I know some of you are probably thinking that I am just a nice reviewer and would say nice things about any meal I had. HELL NO! I am not easy to impress (read my reviews if you don't believe me). But when I find an establishment worthy of praise, I give it. Under the Table is not only special for the way they try to make every patron feel at home and cared for. But also because their food is delicious, and unpretentious. 

Thank you to the Under the Table team for giving me what I have been looking for; the chicken and waffles of my dreams.

P.S. I have an idea of the name you should give the waffle baby.... ""Itanni's Chicken & Waffles"" ;)

P.S.S. They really named the chicken waffles after me!!! OMG! My name is on the menu! Crazy! :)",2014-11-02 17:23:42

So don't show up at 6pm expecting to have full access to the menu.

They also put very generous amount of goat cheese and walnuts (along with the other toppings)-- this is especially notable because I feel like many restaurants skimp on the more expensive salad ingredients (like nice cheese and nuts)-- but not Dresslers!

They said it takes 3 hours to make the tapioca with black sugar and it's done everyday. I tried going for that right after lunch and it wasn't readily available so I had to choose something else.

The menu is pretty extensive for acai bowls which I am a huge fan of. When I first entered it felt a bit awkward, there was a lot of people in the store and there was no music playing which would greatly impact the atmosphere in a positive way even at a low volume (update: while writing this I had been in restaurant about 15 mins and they started playing some country sounding music, think a more uptempo lounge/spa sound would fit the vibe better.. just an opinion). They offer cold brew coffee and kombucha on tap which I've personally never seen kombucha on tap before and I believe they offer different flavors at different times.

I placed my order to go and very unexpectedly the lady told me it will be 20-30 minutes which sounds quite crazy to me for two acai bowls. I understand they are made fresh on the spot but it's basically 20-30 minutes for a thick bowled smoothie with some toppings on it. They seemed kind of busy so 20 minutes seemed understandable, but 30 sounds crazy. At least I know and you now know for any future trips to vitality bowls. (Update it took exactly 22 minutes) The guy who brought out my order, who seemed like the owner was very nice and thanked me for my patience)

Anyway to the acai bowl itself, I got the tropical bowl.. and it was excellent! The actual blend was nice and thick and not the icey smoothie blend you get from some places. The bowl was not very sweet just kind of naturally sweet so you could tell there was no sugar added. My only negative on the bowl was that there didn't seem to be that much honey I added some at home which made it better. The granola was super fresh and very good. Bananas and strawberry's were perfectly ripe and the coconut shavings added that little extra that elevated the flavor nicely (i wish there was a little bit more coconut shavings. If you dig yourself an acai bowl go check this place out! The only reason for my 4 star rating is because of the long wait.",2017-05-30 06:07:38

Being Asian myself along with having friends and neighbors of many ethnicities has enabled me to taste the flavorful sandwich in many forms. From a tomato sardine nom pang of Cambodia, the lemongrass pork banh mi of Vietnam or the cold cut Laotian khao jee, they're all delicious. What I haven't tried is the mix of East and West which I finally did here with the porchetta banh mi. The porchetta is a large slab of skin on pork belly that's been marinated in herbs and spices, rolled into a log and roasted. Traditionally an Italian dish. The brothers here roast fresh pork belly every day for the Vietnamese sandwich. One bite and I was in love. The pork chunks were moist and full of flavor. The best part? They roast the meat until the skin becomes crackly and crunchy pork rinds and throw in a couple rinds into the sandwich. Each bite was savory from the pork, tangy from the pickled carrots and daikon, crunchy from the pork rinds, spicy from the jalapeños and to top it all off, the fresh cilantro. Flavor heaven! My son ordered the BBQ pork banh mi and I'm pretty sure he swallowed it whole in record time. He said it was the best banh mi he's ever had - that's saying a lot coming from my picky teenager.

The restaurant is really cool looking but I was a little confused by the bar set up.  We sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  I usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor, and about 2 feet from each other.  If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  

Also, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying ""okay, okay, okay.""  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.

I tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  I loved it!

The Eggs Beni with smoked salmon.  It was just okay.  I kept trying to think pf what was missing and I believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  I expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy, this was thin and blah.  

I definitely want to go back and try the dinner, see if maybe I'll have a little better luck.  So kick it up a notch Casbah, you've been around for a while, but I still expect good food!",2011-11-14 02:52:48

After that we started shooting. 

I got couple of bulls eyes. My hands hurt after a while so I would suggest bringing gloves. 
 I would give 5 stars but because of the drawbacks for me is they don't take reservations the same day so it was hard for me to get a group together not knowing if they will have a spot. I called to make a group reservation for 6pm and was told to call back the same day but the person did not tell me they were booked 6pm for that day.

Cheap prices, nice environment, incredibly nice waiter/waitress. A++ knowledge in board games and video games

9$ for a plate of nachos?! AWESOME.
You can bring your own game/consoles/controllers. All you need to do is advise the head waiter when you switch a game in the console because there was theft before and they're iffy about it. Nostalgia run as well. I saw a SNES, a SEGA and a few old arcade booths as well as 2 N64s. They have popular games that you can borrow for absolutely free and they have nice couches too. Moderately priced drinks (16$ a pitcher). Not much selection but for the value, it's quite understandable.

It's now my go-to bar ;). I used to be a hardcore PC gamer and I'm kind of a newbie with consoles and I still love that bar. I believe they also have League of Legends Sundays (shame that I dislike the game).

I confess I was reluctant to share this one. There are only a handful of restaurants, including Gio's, that I hold close to my heart. I want to shield them from being overrun by the uncivilized hordes that populate this city and have no appreciation for quality. But that's not you, is it?


This traditional restaurant is one of the funkiest places to eat. Its decor is bargain chic - a haphazard mess of mismatched chairs and beautiful vintage chandeliers. The interesting and well-published fact is that the building used to be a bank, and Gio kept the vault intact to use as a private dining area.  It's details like these that build character, and we know it's all about the details - in life, in fashion, and in food.


The best part of Gio's is the food. Where do I begin?  It's all so good so I'll just tell you what my last meal was: pan-seared scallops with pork belly and Scotty's meatball to start. My primi was the crespelle and I ended with the involtini. If I could, I would order absolutely everything. The sexy duck and ossobuco are two of my other favourites, as is the asparagus with gorgonzola, but that's because I love cheese - and the funnier the name, the more inclined I am to order it. I'm drooling all over my keyboard...

I'm not sure he's found it yet but this show is very entertaining if you enjoy Broadway musical numbers. Not all the songs would qualify as showstoppers but they are all familiar and the cast is very talented. Coupled with excellent choreography the show flows smoothly towards the big showstopper finish, One from A Chorus Line.

After reading the reviews I expected the show to start late and end early. Actually it started only five minutes late and ran almost and hour and fifteen minutes. My wife and I enjoyed it as did most of the audience based on the standing ovation at the end. It's the second best Broadway musical on The Strip (Jersey Boys is the clear winner) and worth a look even at these prices if you like musical numbers. Remember there is no real storyline or continuity as these are songs from different shows.

After ordering my takeout order via Yelp, I arrived early and was able to small talk with the workers. Island Flavor is a family ran restaurant and is one of its kind! As soon as I walked in, my nose was mesmerized, it's smelt SO delicious - I wanted to lick the walls! The open-style kitchen is brilliant because the smell from everything being cooked immerses the entire restaurant! After 'bout 10 minutes my food was ready. I'm surprised I didn't get a speeding ticket driving home because the smell from my take out bag was driving me nuts- it smelt THAT good, I couldn't wait to get home!

I ordered the mixed plate; my combination included the fruikake chicken and kalbi beef short ribs. I opted to try the fried rice instead of steam rice. After upgrading to the kalbi short ribs (+$3 extra) and the fried rice (+$2 extra), my dinner was totally worth it! Peep my pictures y'all, they don't even do it justice! The chicken had such a nice crunchy texture with a sweet and savory glaze sauce, SO good! The fried rice was bursting with flavor with chunks of pork slices &The Kalbi Beef short ribs, delicious, duh.

The lobby does still have a new paint smell that was off-putting, and that odor did occaisionaly drift into the dining area, but it did not affect my enjoyment. Despite what other reviewers have noted, I found their menu to be pretty expansive, going far beyond the 'typical Mexican restaurant' fare. The one thing I wanted that they didn't have was a Mole sauce, but most places don't so no big. They had a strong selection of liquor and tequilla, and pretty good drink specials. 

I enjoyed my enchiladas del mar, and everybody else liked what they got, too. The tamales entree was a hit. They give you warm chips and salsa that is good but pretty mild. I knocked ours up a bit with the Cholula and Tapatio they put on the tables and was sweating gleefully in no time.

I wanted to try their Margarona, which is a margarita with a corona stuck into it. I know, it sounds gross to mix beer with liquor, but if it is done right, it can be surprisingly delightful.

The servers we waved down didn't know how to take down the orders, and also didn't get some items that we ordered. That's also a con of the pen and paper order

This place has karaoke, but its karaoke is on an extremely tiny TV, so it's not really worth it.  Good Asian-style karaoke can be found at Korea House nearby.

The service here is very good.  They are very attentive, check up on you, and try to be extremely nice to you.  Also, there is a little call button on all of the tables, and if you press the button, they respond immediately (No, seriously, I'm not kidding!  You have to see for yourself!).   

As for the food, it's comparable to most of the other Korean places in town.  The barbeque in its name is sort of a misnomer - this isn't a Korean bbq restaurant in the traditional sense with the big open grill in front of you.  They do have bbq dishes on their menu though.

This review was regarding my experience in the upstairs portion of Poppy Den to which I attended a wedding reception.

The 2 ways to get to the second floor is by taking a boring set of stairs and the other way is the sweet Elevator ride that is decked out with wicked wallpaper of famous woman entertainers and a spin the wheel telephone to call the operator. Big props to whoever design the elevator.

So the layout is great, divided into 3 sections you have the outside seating area with couches and table tops. Great views at night with the neon trees. The second section is the indoor seating area with a small dance floor to get your boogie on. And the third and final section is the bar and lounge areas located near the top of the stairs and elevator.

The food that was served was a few different sliders, assorted tacos and a few other tapas that elude me. Even though I only ate a slider and a couple of tacos I will say they were all very good. My favorite being the seafood indian curry taco!!!

The service and flexibility of the staff was to be commended. Not once did the food quality or drinks being served ever come into question. All party members were all extremely happy with nothing ever being too much. The bartenders were a hoot!!! Very social and a credit the management.

The one thing That prevents me from handing out a 5 stars was the furniture. Yes I understand the vintage look they are going for but to have the lounges and couches propped on bricks was a little scary.

ZskxAOH0ZyiYdz6BE8mKtQ,TqKg5XonFWPAacSLpUNIVQ,xlMgaPOpd_99SFTuOtDH0A,3,2,0,0,"My friend and I ended up at Manitoba after watching a show that featured it as part of MTL à TABLE, Montreal's restaurant week. Walking into the restaurant, which is at the end of street filled with factories (some still functioning, some converted into condos and restaurants), the first thing you notice is how contemporary it looks, especially with its open kitchen. Then you notice that it's not just contemporary, but has a contemporary explorer theme complete with animal pelts draped here and there and logs lining the ceiling. The décor mirrors the food to a tee: hearty staples like pork chop, fried sturgeon, and squash are served with a gourmet twist. 

We barely got reservations on a Tuesday night at 9pm (remember: restaurant week), and were seated at the only free table. The hip-hop music playing when we got there quickly changed to James Brown, though I have to say the hip-hop seemed like a better fit. The lighting was dim and romantic and there were small candles glowing on our table. We got 3 choices for both the appetizer (""Peckish Menu"") and entrée (""Hungry Like the Wolf"") and 2 choices for desert (""Sweet!""). I chose the fried cod collars, the grilled pork chop, and the butternut squash panna cotta. Our waiter was very nice and recommended a bottle of white wine, but when we tasted it, it didn't seem appropriate for such heavy food, so we asked for a red and took the La Chambere D'Edouard. 

Out came my fried cod collars which were reminiscent of standard North American Friday Night Fish Fry fare. It had ample (read: AMPLE) mayonnaise-based sauce spread beneath the very fried, but still tasty, fish. Whatever I envisioned the sturgeon vinaigrette tasting like, it wasn't mayonnaise, and I could have done without it -- and with a lighter breading on the fish. My dining mate's dear heart gravlax was much lighter and tastier. 

Next was the good-sized grilled pork chop, and by good-sized I mean something that, 300 years ago, would have fed a team of explorers and their guides for a week. Covered in black elderberries and on a bed of beans and wild rice, my first thought was ""tough, but delicious."" But then, even with my friend helping me, it required so much sawing and chewing that slowly I began to regret the fact that it was so big. 22 hours later, my body is still yelling at me to become a vegetarian. Moderation makes the heart grow fonder. 

Last was the butternut squash panna cotta, which was served with delicious crouton-like chunks of toffee afloat on its creamy depths.  Though it had some exotic sounding ingredients like seabuckthorn and apple and balsam fir, they didn't stand out to me. The cool panna cotta was quite refreshing after such a heavy meal, though after the pork chop I barely had room for it. The ""northern rock,"" which my friend ordered, looked like a puff pastry served on a bed of moss and, though not mouthwateringly amazing, was good and fit the foraging/traditional Canadian/ explorer theme. 

By the time we were done with our meal, our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us, and I had to try and make eye contact about 12 different times with multiple members of the wait staff to get the check. 

My overall impression of Manitoba? Hearty portions that could easily be shared between 2 people, high-quality ingredients that could stand to be stepped up to reflect the prices, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere. Judging by the young, attractive crowd dining around us (which could be a reflection of restaurant week), Manitoba is going to be a yupster staple in this section of downtown.",2014-11-17 01:26:32

It was kinda dark inside and we got the impression it was more bar than restaurant but we figured we'd at least take a look at the menu. We were right. The menu was more bar food than meals but there were some interesting items that we thought we'd try.

The house specialty is food on skewers so we ordered lamb, pork ribs, beef, chicken wings, and mushrooms on skewers. We also decided to try the Korean Fried Chicken and the Popcorn Pork Ribs. We later added some live oysters that were on special for $1 each.

The Popcorn ribs were lightly dusted and deep fried. Tender and crispy. Nice. Same for the fried chicken. Delicious. All the skewered dishes were nicely grilled and had a natural tasting smokey flavour. I really liked the mushrooms.

Overall, we enjoyed the food and some drinks and we;ll be back, maybe not for dinner, but we'll be back.",2017-03-19 04:03:48
Vd1MQbczWIj2Fj-9vZMLIQ,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg,4,0,0,0,"I have pretty fond memories of Gallo Blanco, a modern Mexican food concept restaurant that adorned the trendy Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix for many years.  It was a fun eclectic take on the usual Mexican fare, but affordable enough to attract a diehard loyal following.  I'd gone there a number of times for dinner and happy hour with groups of all different kinds.  So it was obviously quite a shock to find out the Clarendon effectively gave Gallo Blanco the boot despite the restaurant's runaway success.  Otro Café was basically Gallo Blanco's 2nd location serving many of the same items in a similarly modern restaurant setup over on 7th Street just north of Bethany Home.  Now, Otro is chef Doug Robson's one and only.  I'd actually never ventured here before but my date loves this place.  So a little Tuesday night dinner get together it was.

The one thing my date loves more than anything else about Otro is their guacamole.  I don't remember Gallo Blanco's guacamole being that distinctive, but I will admit Otro's was quite delicious.  I'm not ready to say it was better than Barrio Café's guacamole, but as traditional guacamoles go Otro's can more than hold its own.  I think it's the Cotija cheese that really sets it apart.  

For our main dishes, she went with a pair of Carne Asada tacos while I ventured into the unknown with a Paella Mexicana.  Paellas are more of a Spanish concoction than a Mexican one, but I've had really good paellas at Tapas Papa Frita in Scottsdale as well as a couple of places in Las Vegas so I was curious to see how this one stacked up.  Otro's version includes chicken, pork, chorizo, rice, and a garden of different veggies all mixed in.  It's also served with tortillas on the side if you want to make soft tacos out of it.  The paella came out very hot (scalding hot even), though not too spicy.  The flavor profile was quite impressive though I have to admit this paella was mostly rice and veggies moreso than the meats.  The portion size is more than big enough to feed two and I get that paellas are almost always dominated by the rice, but I guess I would've liked the meat and veggie proportions to be a little more equal.  My date gave me a sample of her Carne Asada taco and it was excellent.  She especially loves dousing her tacos with (what I believe was) the green tomatillo and lime sauce mix that they provide at the table.  You could pretty much put that sauce on anything.  Its that good.

No dessert this time as we were more than satisfied with the food we had.  The place was busy pretty much throughout the dinner hour (despite being a Tuesday in the middle of summer).  Our server was fast and friendly and environment was nice and relaxed.  Based on first impressions I would say Otro doesn't have quite the charm of Gallo Blanco, though the overall setup and menu are fairly similar.  There's no shortage of Mexican food choices (even in CenPho), but Otro has certainly earned its place as a neighborhood joint.  Otro has plenty of unique and unusual dishes to choose from, but I'd recommend sticking with Otro's traditional Mexican fare.  That's what Otro does best.",2015-07-08 15:34:44

We tried a few dishes, here are my comments:

- seaweed salad: the chef recommended seaweed salad was odd. It was a cross between dried seaweed and vermicelli noodle. It was very salty, make sure to have it with another main dish. It does cleanse the palate.
- Yuzu chicken: It's fried chicken, the batter however isn't tempura, it's rice cracker... Nothing special. The chicken was tender inside the crispy outside.
- Beef on hot stone: best dish of the evening. It was beautifully marinated and fresh. And how cool is cooking raw beef on a super hot stone? The sauce was too much. It was really salty. Try it without first.
- Oyster mushroom ramen with original sauce: It was ok. Ramen was nicely done at al-dente but the broth lacked sophistication really. It lacked purity in its flavour. I would have assumed a clear broth but it was murky... Maybe try it with miso next time?

Then cineplex came along with their flashy scene points, free movies bonanza that lures me away! Good job cineplex!!

On to the review!
This is a big theatre, one of the bigger, set up similar to the queensway location.
I was surprised by the small amount of cash lines if you were to buy your tickets at the theatre itself, but there were plenty of kiosks as well, however naturally the first one we went to doesn't work.

The games area is super tiny just to the right of the front doors, which surprised me.

The concessions area is big with lot's of ordering space, and with self serve drink kiosks, but like other posters said, cineplex has the gaul to have a huge sign... No refills! Cheap cineplex.. Tisk tisk

Once you actually go into the theatre area you'll see that it looks EXACTLY the way it did when AMC ran this theatre. Same decor, same velvet cushion seats, same screens (ours had a noticeable tear).

You'd think Cineplex would have gutted this place to make it look like all the other cineplex's around but it's just not the case here.
It honestly looks like cineplex cut and pasted their logos on an already existing theatre. Hey whatever saves money right.... 

Parking is behind the theatre, and quick to walk to.
Personally I probably won't be back, I much prefer the Queensway Cineplex.

My wife and I had lunch and dinner with friends there a number of times. We like its sampler appetizer plate with several kinds of meats, paté, cheeses, olives, and preserves. Although this appetizer plate looks small, it is actually enough for 4 people to share over a drink. For entree, we love its scallops and duck dishes. For dessert, we like its popular bread pudding, which has a pleasing texture and not too sweet. The serving staff is very friendly and attentive. One evening, the restaurant was completely full, but our busy and efficient waiter (Justin) still managed to take good care of our table of 4!

Marche Bacchus is a must visit, at least for lunch on its gorgeous patio deck by the water in a hot Vegas day! Do ask for patio seating when making a reservation. But actually, its small, comfortable dining room is not bad either, the large windows do let you see a bit of the soothing water. My wife and I enjoy taking our out-of-town guests there. They are invariably amazed by the fact that such beautiful water ways exists in the middle of Vegas desert, and the restaurant is located in such a nice residential area by the water!

By the way, the front section of the restaurant is a medium size wine store. You can select a bottle of wine there for your table. Even after the corking fee, the wine is still a pretty good bargain!

- My only disappointment with Marche Bachus is that it does NOT offer Happy Hour! I'd have given it 5-Star, if only it offered happy hours!

Went for dinner on ""date night"" with my wife and was looking for somewhere different.  This location has been here for a while but, for some reason, I've never heard of it.  My criteria when looking for a new restaurant is that it has to have options for my pescaterian wife (no meat, just fish) and certain fish at that.  Checking around on YELP I found Dresslers.
Pulling up the parking situation looked confusing so we Valeted.  The inside decor was classy and modern and they had a nice bar.  I made reservations and it was still a bit early at 6:30 on a Saturday night and there wasn't many people inside, but we were offered outdoor seating.  It was gorgeous last night so we went outside.  That's where all the people were, what an awesome outdoor area!  They had these massive, sun blocking umbrellas which did a nice job of making it comfortable outside.  
Our waiter Clark Kent (really) introduced himself and took us through the menu.  I chose the Spicy Thai Calamari and my wife had the house salad for an appetizer.  The calamari were tender strips of calamari with a nice Thai, tossed in a nice light Thai peanut sauce and drizzled with wasabi sauce.  Perfect is the best way to describe it!  I hate going to a nice restaurant and getting the calamari ""rings"" which seem artificial to me.  These were, again, perfect.  The House salad went over well also.
I ordered a special of blackened grouper over a sweet corn, cream sauce which was again, perfect.  It was blackened lightly and cooked to perfection.  Sometimes when you order grouper you sometimes think you've gotten a different fish.  Also, in Charlotte I sometimes think back to the time McCormick and Schmicks was caught substituting a cheaper fish for something more expensive.  This was the real deal for sure.  The combination of the blackened and sweet corn / sauce combination was something from the heavens.  My wife ordered the ""Just for the Halibut"" and was also impressed.  Nice, flaky fish over a potato cake with a sauce.  Nicely done!
We finished up with a homemade, light Key Lime Pie which was a nice cap for the evening.
All in all, Dresslers will be my new go to spot for a night out whether it's for business or a fun night out with friends.  The menu was diverse enough to offer something for everyone, even my wife who found many options to choose from.  The waitstaff was attentive, informative and enhanced my dining pleasure.

Squash Blossom seemed inviting and the atmosphere was definitely pleasant. There was a wedding party going on outside which was only a negative in that it was a perfect day to enjoy our meal outside. We saw there was a brunch offered (at a very reasonable price of $10/person). We asked if we could check it out before confirming we wanted to get it and they were kind enough to allow us to do a little walk through.

When I saw Bambu had opened up in Vegas, I welcomed it with open arms. I usually get the dessert drinks here. It's in the same plaza as Hot and Juicy so you can walk next door after a meal. I have tried #1, #2, and #6 in Rowland Heights and #2 and #6 here in the Vegas location. 

#1 Bambu Special includes coconut, pandan jelly, logan, and basil seed. With coconut meat and coconut water. I think the drink can best be described as refreshing and more on the lighter side. Includes a long strip of coconut meat which is just awesome for a coconut fan like me. Some may find this a bit bland if you need a sugar fix but I like the flavor when I'm not craving something intense or sweet. 

#2 Combination includes red bean, white beans, mung beans, taro, pandan jelly, pearl, jelly, with coconut milk. Holy moly! This is a lot going on in a cup. This one is my favorite so far but it is a bit intense and on the heavy side with all the beans and taro. And while drinking this thing, you don't know if you should use the spoon or the straw and you end up looking like a drunk confused dork. Oh well, it's still so good. It is quite filling so it might as well be a meal replacement. 

#6 Che trai cay includes lychee, longan, red tapioca, jackfruit, palm seed, pandan jelly, jello, and coconut. This one can get very chewy with all the fruit and jelly. It's not as filling as #2 combination but is not as light as #1 Bambu special. I enjoy the fruit in this dessert drink and picking out the red tapioca and pandan jelly to chew on. 

Service here is a hit or miss. I see different girls at the cashier counter every time I visit. Some are super nice and some are impatient and borderline annoying. One even got my orders wrong and didn't apologize or correct it. My recent visits have been pleasant and the super nice girls are there more often in my recent visits.",2015-05-30 07:46:05

Booked a GO room for a weekend and was very disappointed with the overall experience of the resort. First off, if you have to stay here, book through  Chase Ultimate Rewards - lower rates,  no resort fee ($20 a night savings) and they give you a $9 per person continental breakfast credit for Club Cappuccino. The rate was good, and the location is hard to beat. The GO room product itself is pretty nice - newly renovated, some new tech (motorized blinds, tv in the bathroom, sound system). Our room, however, was pretty worn out - scuffs on furniture, broken furniture pieces, etc. Housekeeping was also inconsistent - our first day, they didn't clean our room, but provided us with the extra toiletries we requested. 

The Flamingo's parking garage is a nightmare - very confusing layout, slow, and trashed elevators. **Tip** The hotel/casino connection is on the 3rd floor. Arrived for check in around 11:30 pm and the line was pretty long... it took us over 40 min just to check in. Wear and tear is evident throughout the hotel. I know the Flamingo is one of the Strip's older hotels, but just b/c something is old, doesn't mean it has to be busted up - broken elevators, dented buttons and furniture, clogged plumbing. The pool area is a redeeming quality - we checked out the GO pool, which is the 21+ pool area - nice chill place.

We had drip coffee on the 1st morning & it was completely drinkable; lattes on the 2nd morning & they were creamy & smooth - just like the Illy lattes I know & love.  Maybe another shot would have made it perfect but this was still 1 decent latte that I'd get again

Service in the restaurant was phenomenal - our waitperson was so incredibly nice & this made the process of waking up so much easier.  Also free papers were provided & we had our choice b/t USA Today, Wall Street Journal or NY Times

We both got omelets - mine w/ mushrooms & brie; BF got tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms & brie

Let me just say that the mushrooms were tender & nicely cut to have a good bite of mushroom in each forkfull.  The brie was a perfect accompaniment - there were huge hunks that must have been added right at the very end b/c it was just a bit melty but still in ""hunk"" form & I can never get brie to do this when I add it to eggs.....it dissolves completely & I can't tell I even added it.....so props to you!

At least at SUBWAY they toast your sub so the cheese and meat gets hot.  I sent it back and it came back luke-warm again.  Manager was a bit tough saying that he doesnt advertise a hot smoked meat sandwitch, and to be fair I didnt ask for it hot.  Ive never encountered anyone thinking they can just cut up some cold meat and put it on a bun and charge 15$ for it.  why not just buy a loaf of bread and buy a pound of meat from them instead?  Kind of ridiculous that they make food there at all, let alone charge you to sit there and eat something that takes no actually 'cooking'..  It should be a clear deli counter with no places to sit , not a restaurant.  

I've been all over the country and in many smoked meat smoked meat shops and never have encountered this kind of atmosphere, the kind where they barley prepare food and expect people to come eat there.  McDonalds prepares food better im sorry to say.  The knish's were barley baked at all, mostly doey and just luke-warm inside.  I feel sick after eating them.

The hours of the place are ridiculous, but I think the same about all morning restaurants.  I have never been to a single deli, not here in calgary from alberta king of subs, to myres, to the one in marda-loop, to swartzes in montrael, where there is a wall between you and the kitchen.  Its always open and always inviting.  The fact that they are hiding the chef's is  allowing sub-par food to come out of the kitchen, and then with the owners reinforcement.  I havnt seen this diners/dives/drive-in's video on grumans, but thats only T.V.  The reality is guy ferrari doesnt get an unknown to come in an order a sandwich and then he eats it on camera talking about how wonderful it is.  He sits in the kitchen watching and making sure everything is great, and when its open and I do that, it is also for me.

I came in with such high expectations after seeing the reviews i was expecting the best smoked meat sandwitch in calgary, to dethrone Alberta King of Subs in my books.  Alas the best hot smoked meat sandwitch (can be done no other way) is with alberta king of subs and their meat from swartz, always steaming, fat rendering nicely, not too dry not too moist.  

If you are in the area, and Alberta King of subs is too far, just buy the meat and microwave it and put it in some bread.  You'll be so much more happier than buying a sandwich made by Grumans.  I dont think I'll ever be back.",2014-10-17 01:51:45

On our way to see a spring training game at Maryvale stadium, we decided to check this place out after reading some reviews and rather than pay $10 bucks for a burger we thought it was a good idea.
The reviews were mostly good and the prices listed online seemed reasonable.
We thought to get burritos. I'd decided before we left the house.

The menu online had prices from $5.75-$6.25. They do not have a working website, so what I found turned out to be dated information.
What it turned out to cost, you might ask..? Two burrito's for $20 bucks. Well, $19 bucks. So that was a bit of a surprise. Parking is tricky and the back lot is in rough shape. But it was packed so that seemed a good sign.

If taking to-go I recommend calling ahead to avoid a wait, which wasn't long however. The place was packed, mostly with families. Another good sign.

The service was prompt and friendly.

My gf had the pierna, and I got the bistec. Large and heavy burrito and goodies that came on the side included shredded lettuce, cucumber, radish, a roasted jalapeno, roasted onion slices, lime wedge and salsa. Good value still but more pricey than I expected so really nothing to complain about.

I didn't try the pierna but my girl enjoyed it. I 'mostly' enjoyed mine except for one MAJOR drawback. Nearly half of the steak in my burrito was grisel, fat and connective tissue....so that was not a gratifying experience. Whomever trimmed the steak did a poor job.

I just cut my own hair usually with a pair of clippers and a mirror. Sometimes, though, there's nothing like paying someone else to trim my 'do for me. 

Sadly, there lacks of an affordable option in my hood. Sure, there's a few of barbers between Bloor and Wellesley, and a few more in the Village but the price points don't match my head's requirements (a number two up the sides and a few scissor slashes on top). You can just forget Yorkville. And I'm not touching House of Lords...I'd sooner hold a 90's style rave just outside to their ridiculous dance music before I'd let them touch my locks.

Welcome Prince Barber - 16 dollars + tip for a trim sounded just right to me. To compare to other places I've been in recent years, Ralph's at Bay and Wellesley, a similar no-frills style cut ran around 25 dollars last time I went. Blood and Bandages is also up to 25. The Men's Salon under the Royal York is 30. Prince Barber's fee was certainly appetizing.

Mohammad jumped up from his chair upon my entrance and sat me down. I described my needs, and he got right to work, and boy howdy he was fast. I might've been in and out in about 10 minutes, and my hair looks great. I told him I cut my own hair, and he took great lengths along the way asking my opinion on length, which was terrific. He straight razor shaved me delicately and accurately.

I felt comfortable in the chair - there was no needless small talk, which I appreciated, and it wasn't awkwardly silent either. I liked that the volume of the news channel on the TV was loud enough for me to hear (FYI the Trews have a new album out, and based on the short clips I heard, it is the lamest thing I've heard in a long time, and I've listened to the entire Nickleback 'Silver Side Up' record...on purpose.) I may be alone in this opinion, but I hate getting a haircut and feeling like I'm supposed to be having a conversation. I usually just want to chill out. Anyway, the atmosphere in there was perfect for me, though you may find differently.

I think there was a promise on the sign outside of a hot towel before and after the cut, which I didn't receive, but otherwise it was a fine cut, I left totally satisfied, and I'll absolutely go back the next time I'm too lazy/don't want to clean up a million tiny hairs in my bathroom. 

Take my rating with a grain of salt - I don't have a complicated haircut, so I can't speak to anyone looking for a complicated fade or taper job. Since it was bell-and-whistle free, I'd say 3 stars is exactly appropriate - I got an A-OK coiffure at a very reasonable price, and I'll probably go back.

Yes there are service interruptions and buses sometimes fail to show up but overall it does a good job of getting you where you need to go.  I work downtown and if I were to drive not only would it be more expensive but it would also be longer because I'd be stuck in traffic.  Instead I hop on the metro and spend my commute reading and listening to music.

The trains and buses are generally clean by transit standards and in more central areas they come frequently especially during rush hour.  Even during non-peak hours the trains come often enough.  Out in the suburbs bus schedules aren't as good but that is understandable.   The STM also operates the 747 bus service out to the airport which is significantly cheaper than taking a cab.

1. The stone bowl mushroom tofu - if you like fried tofu with enoki mushroom and an umami explosion, this is a must have. 
2. Tako Wasabi - bits of octopus with sea kelp and wasabi that you wrap in nori (seaweed)
3. Garlic tuna tataki - quite good but what you would expect
4 karaage - what you would expect 
5. Duck - not on their standard menu
6. Mabo Tofu Spring Rolls - a combination of two flavours I love. It didn't disappoint despite the otherwise weird union

We both ordered the Omakase Sushi Course, which comes with some appetizer dishes, the sushi course, and a dessert. The appetizer dishes felt like a mix of traditional Japanese, sometimes with a more modern topping, so were quite interesting. There was also a light soup.

After that came the sushi course, made right in front of you if you're at the bar. There were 12 pieces of nigiri sushi (including one very delicious seared tuna piece), followed by the BEST Tuna + Green Onion roll I've ever had. The seaweed is so crispy, so they tell you to eat it quick as they hand it to you.

For example, they have these lovely little rolls of heavy gauge plastic to line your trunk or seats with, to prevent soil from getting everywhere. They have these super convenient carts that have a pivoting top shelp, which makes buying tall things really easy.

They have one of the nicest selections of glazed pots around. I'm already finding this to be a little bit of a problem, since I have now decided that I need to change out all of mine because the ones I bought are so darn pretty and colorful.

Parking can be a little iffy, when crowds overflow from the neighboring businesses. I was intrigued at how a nursery could set up a workable space at the end of a strip mall, but they did a nice job.

Unfortunately, if you eat-in you have to deal with their strange ordering system. After waiting to be seated (which on the weekend is a loooong time - it's a popular place), you get given a piece of paper with your table number. You then need to take this piece of paper to the queue (where all take-out orders are placed too), and give your order. After you've gotten your food, and are ready to pay, you have to get back in the queue (behind all the take-out people) to make your payment.

For a burger place I found the menu limiting and uninspired. It's sort of cool that you get a dry erase maker to chart out your eats on their rewritable menu, but that and great service is about all these guys got. And the service is truly great. (More on that in a second.)

Patties are expensive once you start adding ingredients like avocado and mushrooms (not really premiums in my book) and tacking on another 3.50 for grass-fed meat should make for somethin' spectacular, but mine left me wanting more. Nearing 13 bucks for beef these things should come with a side, but they don't and I was thrilled that we split sweet potato chips to start or I would have been starving after. 

A few suggestions that I think would help, and I'm only offering these because I really liked the staff and I would love to see these guys kill it! 

1. Ditch the servers, have people order at a counter using those same menu things and dry erase pens and let food runners flit around dropping burgers here there and everywhere. Water and soft drinks could be self service and a bartender could pop bottles or top off taps. 

2. Clean up the protein options and ditch the lame beef: grassfed beef only, turkey, soy, salmon and chicken. (Yeah, I said salmon burger baby)

3. Expand the menu with 3 categories. Simply - Signature - Say What? Examples: 

Simple
meat/bun

Signature
Mediterranean (meat, feta, olive tapenade, pita)
and so on...

Say What?
The Elvis (meat, peanut butter, bacon, banana spread)
Mac Attack (meat, macaroni and cheese, fried onion strings)

 We went on Friday at 5pm when it opens, so the place was empty. All good though because service was relatively quick. 

They've got a huge variety. For those sashimi fans, they've got salmon, white tuna, surf clam, red snapper, and a couple of other types. The surf clam is pretty good and obviously the salmon is a win. 

Definitely give the chefs recommendation on sushi rolls a try -- matsuda making, shogunate, and black dragon are all pretty good. 

Say yes to the beef skewer...it is so juicy and flavorful, I had to order two plates. Oh and the matsuda golden shrimp is a lightly battered deep fried shrimp with a bit of mayonnaise -- ahhhhmazing. 

Oh and the best part? MANGO YOGURT for dessert. They come in shot glasses so make sure to order a couple at a time. The mango pudding is not bad but it doesn't come with the milk :( I hear the green tea ice cream is good (although I've never tried). 

The place is clean and they've got some nice Japanese tunes to bob to while you wait for your food. Waiters are always quick to take your dirty dishes and fill up on water.

Right off the bat, the greeter might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying ""I Hate My Job, Possibly My Life, Ergo I am a black-hole destroying all signs of positivism"".  I had to open my own door, which isn't a big deal except HE WAS HANGING AGAINST THE OTHER DOOR.  Duuuuude, get out of the way if you're not going to open the door.

The shame of it all is that I entered hungry the restaurant hungry.  So after the door debacle my spider senses are going haywire, further confirmed by being greeted with ""Is It Going To Be Just You Three?""  What?!  Who talks like that?  With a slow gait of a walk and a disconnected facial expression were taken to our table ... oh and it wasn't cleared.  We got an exasperated (oh yay signs of life!) ""hold on just kidding let me clean this"" and after about 5 minutes of him running around looking for a ""rag"" as he asked the wait-staff, we sat in a lysol-like smelling table--heck! at least it was clean.

Now the purpose of this trip was simple.  Get an appetizer, eat only half, then indulge in one of their larger desserts.  Well at this point the whole just being seated experience had thrown me for such a loop that I wasn't hungry.  I got their potato wedges...usually a pretty safe bet...but WRONG.  Apparently loading them with cheese cuts too much into profit margins or something because it was potato plus a table spoon of cheese and a table spoon of bacon bits.  So a tad on the bland mostly potato side of things.

Our waiter/server/dude was more alive than the greeter, score!  But still the entire staff just didn't seem be all OK with being at work, which heck I get it, but in the service industry you suck it up and move on.

I said that I come specifically for this tea because I am particular about my tea and asked for another flavour in Mighty Leaf. Not sure why this wasn't offered to me, since the Tetley wasn't Early Grey anyway, and they had plain black in Mighty Leaf. I also don't think that an organic and generic brand should cost the same. I felt like I received a little bit of attitude from the same woman who served me the first time. I also think small, customary apology should have been issued.

I have been back twice since. Once, for coffee. It was decent. Today, I came for lunch. I got a chicken/avocado/brie sandwich. It was alright.

The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. 

My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.

The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.

If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.",2011-05-01 04:44:57

I had been flying home to Northern California to my stylist whom I had been going to for years and is amazing, but I needed someone local for when I was unable to go home for a weekend. After bouncing around from salon to salon after my first year in Vegas and being frustrated with my hair after every fruitless visit, I found Hannah and she blew my mind.

First of all, the salon is impressive from the moment you walk in. The decor is amazing, relaxing, trendy, and unique. Todd, the owner, purchased all of the decor pieces, many which are antiques and somehow turned a cross-fit studio into a tranquil, gorgeous salon. I was offered a mimosa upon checking in and was immediately greeted by Hannah and her assistant Kat. Todd and Hannah worked in tandem, listening to my wants, concerns, and suggesting the best process for my hair. I wanted to go super blonde and they developed a plan for my hair. Hannah, Kat, and Todd worked as a team to deliver the best end-product I have received since moving to Las Vegas. My cut turned out fantastic and was exactly what I wanted. My color was the perfect shade of blonde that I had requested. 

What I love most about this salon is their attention to detail and their goal of perfection. After being shampooed the first time, Todd and Hannah decided my ends could have been a little lighter and put additional foils in my hair. They do not cut corners her and have integrity in their work! Their honesty and quest for perfection was a breath of fresh air. 

I also loved that they put essential oils in their shampoo station. I requested the lily sent which was very yummy and will be headed to Sprouts to get some for my own shampoo. Also, Hannah offered to style my hair with curls and even taught me how to use the two-inch curler, since I have a smaller wand at home.

I am so happy I found Platinum Entourage. I will be back for back for blow-outs, color treatments, cuts, styles and all of the above. Todd is a genius and Hannah, an artist!",2015-05-05 00:20:42

Chosen for lunch when I delivered a colleague visiting for a conference back to the hotel, a visit to Grand Café at Palace Station served as my second experience at one of Station Casino's 24-hour eateries, and although the pasty case was not quite as well apportioned as that at Red Rock, it was to the same menu of diner eats and American classics that we were treated, the service a bit less attentive than at the Summerlin iteration but the cuisine no less competent or well priced.

Located just inside the Self-Park garage, mere steps away from the gaming floor outside, Grand Café at Palace Station features a rounded central bar set on both sides by tiered dining and opting to be sat opposite several large parties our arrival was greeted with menus and water, the humorous 'My Generation"" placemats cleared from tables as a sizable selection of pastries and entrees were made.

Largely self-selected, my dining partner already sated from a lunch at the conference from which she came, it was with a shared cinnamon roll and banana nut muffin - both rewarmed and piping hot to touch - that the dining began and while the tightly wound roll lightly topped with icing was as good as the sticky bun from previous experience the muffin was unfortunately marred by what can only be assumed as artificial banana extract, the flavor too sweet and far underspiced despite a crumb that was quite moist.

Moving next to 'entrees,' the Log Cabin eschewed for pure maple syrup that has become a staple of my weekend laptop bag, a four-stack of pancakes punctuated with fresh blueberries proved every bit as good as the chocolate chip version enjoyed at Red Rock and again challenging DuPar's for best the best Buttermilk batter in the valley a similar tangy topnote imbued both members of a duo of biscuits, the fluffy rounds just-short of golden but otherwise excellent beneath a topcoat of butter and honey served alongside a selection of jams.

At this point quite full, but still with ten bucks to spend on the hotel's $30 voucher, it was with three cookies and an abysmally dry cupcake that the meal would end, and although the cutesy ""Black and White"" was far less interesting than it would have been had the kitchen actually used cocoa or lemon instead of just sugary vanilla, both the chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies were homey and classic, the lightly crisp rim and soft center dense with flavor yet relatively low in sweetness, the results far better than one would expect from a simple café in a smoky off-strip Casino...or even one along Las Vegas Boulevard charging a dollar or two more.

Generally disinterested in the soups, sandwiches, salads, or entrees offered at places of this ilk, Grand Café once again proves to a good spot for a cheap breakfast for locals and tourists alike.",2015-04-21 04:18:27

Ironically my friends came from there as well. A sign outside would've been nice. Anyway I didn't give them 3 stars because of that. The prices are high and I really didn't notice the increase in quality that much.  Then again I am not Korean. If the meat doesn't have gristle, not brown from age, and tasty then it's considered great Korean BBQ. I've eaten at all the popular Korean BBQs on Spring Mtn. I was surprised when Lee's also bought this place. That firewater makes a ton of cash from getting people drunk apparently. This is one of those places that if you have a Korean friend, you'd want them to come with you so that you will get the best service, kind of deal. Luckily we did and she is one bossy lady too. But I don't think I would come by myself. Is it really worth the trouble to have to, like grovel, to pay more and get less? I was never one of those guys so I only come when I get dragged here. As far as it being superior to others, I really can't tell. Then again, my palate leans toward Average Joe and not ""look at me"" Kimye.

I really don't think the food is worth the premium here, kinda like Mothers down the road. What's the big deal about them too???? I ate there and I didn't see what the fuss was about. Okay, so the decor is nice.... To me, Sura, Honey Pig, Tofu Hut all are good in their own way and I don't feel like I was unfulfilled when I leave those places.

e9GhxiKMdTStXRvGeMpDEQ,59Zmdh7FJ3xTn68D6uc-HQ,kWRyX8FlfPnFYBCPrqPycg,5,6,2,0,"Hart House is arguably the best thing about UofT.  It's the student center but is also available to join if you're an alum, over 60, or a visiting student.  The facility includes places for banquets/events (like the Great Hall), eating and haircutting locales, and a theatre.  But I'm going to review the gym/fitness facilities.

UofT has an athletics center at Harbord/Spadina, but it doesn't seem all that attractive for the following two reasons: (1) it's located far from most of the residence halls - with the exception of Grad House and New College and (2) it's where the varsity athletes practice.  Okay, it's not like UofT has the same caliber athletics program as Texas or Florida State, but hanging around with all those toned-ass people can be rather intimidating.  Still, the distance (especially in brutal Toronto winters) was a pretty huge deterrent from going to the AC.  I'd rather be breathing in the asbestos in the basement of Sid Smith than walk there.  But I'd have to pass Hart House en route between the dungeon of SS and home (Vic), so there were no excuses NOT to go there.  I think the same holds true for people who live at Trin, UC (well, sorta), St. Mike's, and Massey.  The location is just hella convenient.

Anyways, the facilities are pretty nice.  The machines upstairs can get busy at times, but weren't overwhelmingly so.  The pool is really great - never too busy, clean, and a decent temperature.  In addition to having lap swimming, they offer Master Swim classes (for a fee) and Aquafit (free).  Really fun, I might add.  

Hart House also offers free drop-in group fitness classes... I never took part in those but it seemed like many of my floormates did and enjoyed them.  I did enroll in some of the dance classes, which were really reasonably priced (~$60/semester) and a lot of fun.  I HIGHLY recommend Musical Theatre Jazz which is uber-dorky but fun.  They also started offering spinning classes (~$10/class) a couple of years ago, which is great.

The locker room and showers are fine.  They have a mix of stall and open showers available.  You can pay for towel and locker service if you choose.  

Overall, facilities are pretty darn good, the atmosphere is low key and more welcoming than most facilities at UofT, and the location is top-notch.  The only regret I have is not realizing how awesome Hart House was until my second year at UofT.",2009-11-01 22:05:29

I'm an admitted fan of Scottsdale Quarter due to the cool blend of businesses they have. My wife and I occasionally make it a special when our girls are in school and we happen to have to vacation time we need to burn.

The iPic is on the east part of the campus that stretches across N Scottsdale Rd. On the west end is the Westin Kierland. In between are tons of shops, excellent dining, ice cream, common areas with water features, and even music lounges. Heck, for Christmas, there is even a horse and carriage decked out for the holidays like in New York!

You'll enjoy the experience. People even live there as part of the mixed-use, neo-urbanism neighborhood. design. That gives a cool 24-hour vibe.

I went here for a celebratory dinner with a friend on a Wednesday evening. While it was hard to get reservations (the fact that they're closed Monday and Tuesday make it a bit tricky), it was worth going a little earlier than I wanted to enjoy this place. 

I love the ambiance. The wallpaper is so cool, I love the wood ceiling, the mismatched chairs, and even that the servers were dressed casually. I like the whole vibe in general - it was a mixed crowd, mostly ""young professionals"" but also a few older groups - making it noisy and lively even at 6:30 PM. 

I love the cocktails - I really appreciate a good cocktail list and Campagnolo delivers. I tried two of their concoctions, and loved both (but of course I can't remember what they're called now). The prices are a bit high at $9 - $12 a drink, but they are WORTH IT! 

I love the food! I love the sharing plates, which are reasonably priced and delicious - The Buratta was so good (thanks for the tip fellow yelpers) and the others were excellent too! We also tried both of their pasta dishes that evening, the butternut squash agnolotti and a rabbit pasta - the rabbit blew my mind, it was so tender and delicious!  The also have a great selection of desserts, we chose the pastry with poached pairs and shaved parm. YUM!! 

Campagnolo is not the kind of place you go for a cheap meal, or if you want to be reserved in your spending. It is the kind of place that is expensive, yes, but not over-priced - everything you eat was worth the money you spent!

This was our second time visiting this unassuming restaurant that is located on Eastern, a couple of miles north of the 95. The signature dishes are (not surprisingly) called 'los molcajetes', which is not so much a description of the food itself but the name of the vessel used to prepare and serve it, a Mexican mortar. Their use has been traced back to the Aztecs and Mayans who used them for crushing and grinding spices, but they are still common tools employed by Mexican cooks today. They function similarly to a cast iron skillet, becoming more seasoned with each use and imparting the cumulative flavors into the food. They also keep the food bubbling so you can eat at a leisurely pace as you continue to enjoy the food in its optimum state, nice and hot.

This is the only place I've had food prepared in this way, so unfortunately I can't make any comparisons, but I can say that it is very good and certainly worth the trip to a less desirable part of town. We have tried two different options, one with beef and one with chicken. The meat in both is of relatively high quality, but I agree with my brother's preference for the chicken ($12.99). The base of the dish is a flavorful and intensely colored red sauce that is laden with paprika (a little too much, perhaps), and is filled with your choice of meat or seafood as well as various other vegetable garnishes. These garnishes include nopales, or cactus (looks like a tongue coming out on the left hand side of the bowl pictured above), tomato, avocado, radishes, scallions, and a grilled jalapeno (watch out). There is also a wedge of lime, a cheese best described as Mexican feta, and a mini drink umbrella, which adds a whimsical touch. The chicken is roasted to tender perfection (see below), and tastes amazing on a warm flour tortilla. The broth has the right amount of heat, and is full of flavor, but Ian and I both agree that the meal could benefit from a few added elements. I liked the cheese, but it was fairly salty and dense for an already well-seasoned base. I think some crema, or Mexican sour cream, would have been the perfect antidote for the inherent flavors of the dish, and some rice, beans, and/or guacamole could have added to the texture. The meal was unique and tasted great, don't get me wrong, but got a tad boring to eat towards the end and need a little something to push it into the arena of ""oh my god I have to come back and get this tomorrow."" I noticed that you can order the molcajetes fajita style, however, so maybe I will try that next time and see what it comes with. I'll miss the little umbrella, but I've endured much more in the name of food.

Definitely try ""Los Molcajetes"" because it is a unique place in Vegas, the food is really tasty, and the price is right. One dish easily serves two, and with the purchase of 'molcajetes' you also get a free drink. We opted for Modelo Especial, a light Mexican beer that I strongly recommend (pictured below). For both of us the meal was less than $18 with two beers (we had to get an extra, of course), so it certainly fits the bill for the Frugal Foodie blog.

These donuts really are the best in AZ. Always fresh, soft, and really delicious. I did a taste test with my friend and these aren't quite as sugary sweet as Krispy Kreme. Not dripping with glaze. I don't like too sweet though...I can't handle a lot of sweetness...a good donut has a balance. 
Nothing too fancy here--my friend wanted a cookies and cream Oreo fancy kind of donut--well this isn't the place for that.

This is where you get a really good basic donut. Glazed, chocolate, sprinkles, fritter, jelly-filled, long jon. I've never been disappointed.

Staff has always been so pleasant and friendly. Sometimes they've thrown in a couple free donut holes for my kid. So nice.

Inside there's a line where you can place your order.  On my initial visit I ordered the 1/2 chick with Yuca and their cilantro rice. They also suckered me into one of their specialty drinks, the herbal limeade.

On the opposite side of the restaurant, there's a counter for all the sauces - I forget the names of the sauces but all of them are delicious but I think my favorite is the green sauce. I found myself dipping the chicken, the yuca, and smothering the rice in the sauce.

The chicken is flavorful. The meat is tender. The yuca was a nice change from usual fries. The rice on its own was a bit disappointing but mixed with their sauces it was fantastic. The limeade had a nice basil flavor but it was a bit too sweet for me.

There was only a small parking lot for the building unless they had approval to park in the office lot next door and that's what they did. So don't let parking worry you.

I have loved and played hockey for pretty much all of my life and upon moving to Las Vegas and finding out they had a professional hockey team I was ecstatic. I have probably been to around 10 or so Wrangler games and have never been disappointed even though the score may not have gone in their favor. The atmosphere in the smaller intimate arena is always great and contagious even though the seats are typically at about 50% capacity. This goes well with the fact that there is quite a bit of fighting in ECHL games.

The concessions are standard faire and the prices of alcoholic beverages aren't bad when compared to NHL rinks. Parking is a breeze and getting in and out of games is easy.

Well the truth is, I have a duty to my fellow yelpers to keep it real. And the reality is, I kinda stepped away from Home after I noticed my favourite treat's (the epic carrot cake) cake-frosting ratio had decreased (compare my pic vs other yelper pic).  I also noticed that some times the tart sizes drastically vary. Didn't buy em when they were super small.  I always feel bad walking out of a small shop so, often I'd peep in the window like the local weirdos and try to eyeball the cake-frosting ratio from afar.  

Now don't get me wrong, Home has the best treats in the area, and when you get homemade-style foods, they're not gonna be as consistent as a franchise vendor...but, the love...where's the love?? 

I never see Jenny the baker anymore.. she could still be there though, I dunno. I haven't been fortunate enough to get food on days where Jenny's magic baking fingers are present.  The cake was still good but again-- the cake-frosting ratio... :S  Also the small amount of frosting was super duper sweet. 

I DO recommend the quiche, the tarts, the cookies and the cupcakes. They taste GOOD... but sizes will vary...you've been warned.  And don't look at me like I'm all petty for caring about the sizes cuz if you're going to a bakery regularly its not to watch your weight--if you're just stopping by randomly then you will be impressed no matter what..

Nowadays, it felt like an abortion must feel like to a 15 year old. The food was absolutely horrific. Sure, the Stetson Chopped Salad was tremendous as always, but my duck and brie sandwich as well as my girlfriend's papardelle pasta were flavorless messes. 

The service at Cowboy Ciao was the saving grace. I didn't get our servers name, but he was cordial and efficient. I'm going to give it one more shot for lunch, since for years it was my favorite lunch spot in Old Town, and I hate to lose it. It really was just awful though.

We were in the bar area, which is quite small, yet had a pretty cozy feel to it.  Because my friend comes here regularly as with the other patrons, you felt as though you were on Cheers.  Everyone literally knew everyone else's name.  Two ladies who serviced us most of the night weren't even on the clock but I guess since they've been there for so long, they're very loyal and were willing to just help out even if it didn't mean they were getting paid for it.  As badly as I did feel about the two ladies servicing us throughout the night, I was also quite grateful as the actual scheduled waitresses were not very attentive.  

As for the food, I had their wings which were pretty mediocre.  They were a little bit smaller than what I'm used to getting but they were very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Because of the size of the wings, I guess the cost was reasonable.  4/5.

I had a bit of my friend's steak fries which were also alright.  Their gravy, however, did the fries justice.  I wish the gravy was actually warmer than the temperature it was served but it was still very good.  I'd rate their fries 4/5 and their gravy 5/5.

They have a really nice patio area out back which will be great for the summer months.  The people, since they're regulars, were a lot of fun and I think what also made the place even more fun is the fact that they have TouchTunes (look it up).  With this, customers were able to easily create a playlists which made the bar almost like a house party.  But man, I've never listened to so much Beach Boys in my life!

My waitress was Ivana who was a bubbly, fun and polite waitress. She was a nice server to have. I ordered the steak salad and found it good, delicious and not overdressed/drenched. It could use more meat however. The proportion of lettuce to meat was excessive, but over all it is a recommended dish. The lettuce felt fresh, the meat was medium (wish there was more) and the cheese tasted great. They do not have a variety of waters, which is reflected in the menu which is also limited!

In the spirit of fairness, can we get them crazy codpieces like the dude in the Cameo video or something?

Menu: B

Everything is beautifully plated & presented. Lots of care taken to make sure the good is visually appealing. 

Actual Food Taste: C-
I tried 6 of the small plates and they ranged from ""pretty good"" to ""meh"". The best thing was the chicken pot pie bites, followed by the tuna tacos (FYI, basically a Tostito made in to a ""taco shell""). On the lighter side, the asparagus was amazing but the poached egg really didn't add anything. The Brussels sprouts were pretty ""meh"" - undercooked for the most part. 

Service: D+
Our server was nice but things took forever - unacceptable considering they were about 15% full. A glass of wine took 15-20 minutes to reach the table & we weren't checked back on for refills.

Drinks: C
So they have this elaborate cocktail cart where they make you drinks table side (cocktails only). So one of our group ordered one & it was quite a show...droppers if this & that, lots of mixing & shaking. Unfortunately the drink tasted like that violet chewing gum.

Compare with those places in Hong Kong, California, and New York, this is a huge step down. The service is always a weak sector of a Asian restaurant and this is no exception because service people are treated like a slave (low people and their face and attitudes reflects that as well).

The seaweed salad is filled with artificial food color which made me sick to my stomach (the dye spill over the sesame seeds).

Last time we ordered combos, and that seems to have made the difference.  This time, not so hungry after snacking at an earlier function, we decided to go the individual dish route.

The same 13 choices are on the menu.  Except for one lamb, one fish (which I'd be afraid to try here) and a vegetable combo, the rest are beef, beef, and more beef.  The veggie might have been an option, but not after two of them were listed as collard greens and cabbage.  Not exciting at all.  

I wanted a glass of honey wine, which I had tasted a few years earlier at a different Ethiopian restaurant.  It's a strange wine, but I've got strange tastes.  Almost verbatim, the owner repeated the same line as last time, about the wine coming from L.A. and they didn't get the shipment.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But I don't think so.  He didn't suggest anything else, and I didn't ask.  I was already feeling the downer vibe, and stuck with water.

I started to order the dry-sauteed beef, but he said it might be a little dry and chewy, so we switched to two others.  They seemed to be variations of the same dish.  One had some tomatoes added to the jalapeños and onions,  and was in tiny pieces.  The other had longer strips that were way too long to eat comfortably, and also had the jalapeños and onion, but no tomatoes.  Both dishes were poured into a large tray lined with the injera bread, and the tray had a tiny serving of salad - two tablespoons if I'm being generous - for each of us.

The small beef dice had no flavor whatsoever.  The long strips had a little more flavor, though not much.  Both were improved by the vinegar in the injera. But they were both tough as nails.  When the owner came over to ask how things were going, I told him that the beef was tough.  He paused a couple of seconds, said ""Okay,"" and walked away.  The salad didn't taste fresh and had some brown pieces.

The only other customers were a table of four with a baby who didn't stop shrieking the whole time.  But they provided some much-needed entertainment:  the kid sat on the mother's lap and kept yanking at the strings of beads that were the front window curtain.  Each time she pulled, the rod arced downward, and the mom never attempted to stop her.  This being Vegas, I made book with Herb about how long it would take before the whole curtain came crashing down.  Neither of us won, because thankfully they left halfway through our meal.  Then the music was cranked up a little.  I love Arabic music with a beat, 'cause I can belly dance in my seat.  But this stuff was some awful male singer wailing, and it was unbearable.

The only thing good that I can say is that at least it's cheap.  Each of our beef dishes was 9.99.  But since it comes only with the anemic little bit of salad, and the beef obviously wasn't filet mignon, it wasn't worth even that much.  I can't even say ""stick with the chicken,"" because there was none.",2014-06-16 04:14:04

Vegetarians be wary; chicken is listed among the ""vegetarian"" dishes. I wasn't completely worried about this, because my friend Vishnu considers himself a vegetarian, even though he eats fish; chicken and lamb.

i decided to go with the jerk chicken wrap and the butter chicken one (both snack sides). it's so delicious - i have had their vegetarian option before too and it does not disappoint.

when i turned around to order my meal i realized that one of the owners was a precious staff member of mine. she came from behind the counter to greet me. 

i remember when we worked together over 5 years ago how enthusiastic she was about opening her own restaurant and how much passion she had for food, needless to say, they've done an amazing job with the fusion of food, i can't wait until they open again after the holidays! i was even more happy to hear she'll be franchising the place and the next location to open will be at hurontario and dundas!

Firstly, it took our server between 20-30 minutes to address our table and the food took 40 minutes and up to be prepared and brought to our table. It was quite frustrating because my friend and I were extremely hungry. Our server was nice and apologetic but it didn't make up for the bad tasting food and incorrect items we were served. My ""steamed"" broccoli was crunchy and cold while my friends raw broccoli was warm. I received the wrong side dish and both our steaks were overcooked. The steak was lacking in flavor so much that we tried every sauce and it still tasted bland. When it came time to pay the bill, I wanted to speak to the manager because we weren't able to eat our food and certainly were not going to pay for something we couldn't eat. The manager gave us a discount but, did not comp the meal. Most restaurants will comp the customers meal if they couldn't eat the meal due to the taste. I shouldn't have to pay for disgusting food.

There is no parking lot for the restaurant but lots of parking on the sides of the block and right in front of the restaurant. The place is pretty small, but there is a waiting area in the back if you don't want to stand outside. They also offer free coffee for people who are waiting, I guess to help cope with the wait time.

The eggs benedict here is one of the best I have ever had. The english buns are always toasted perfectly and the eggs are poached so well! Although, they never ask you if you want the egg soft, medium or hard - you can always request it though I would think.

I have tried many items on the menu including the cold cucumber soup, mandarin orange sesame salad, the burger (topped with everything - even an egg!), the breakfast poutine and french toast. Everything is always amazing, and I never have a single complaint about the food. The service is also really great, they are very attentive but never up in your face while you try to eat.

The pricing is fair, I think it is basically standard for most brunch places in Calgary with items ranging from $10~15. My bill for two usually ends up being around $30, including tip.

Well Asian Legend has come to my xenophobic rescue with it's polished post modern trappings, ultra hygenic facilities and of course it's excellent Chinese food.

My Asian Legend cherry was popped this summer thanks to my sister's recommendation to dine here for her birthday.  Being the Leonine epicurean she is we ordered nearly EVERYTHING and happily it was all consistently delicious. It was a Chinese feast of Bacchanalian proportions with;

- 3 types of steamed dumplings Pork, Shrimp shu mai and veggie, 
- Deluxe seafood soup
- Moo Shu Chicken with pancakes
- Assorted seafood with tofu
- Peking Duck (Superb!!)with pancakes along with the duckmeat chopped up & sauteed with lettuce to wrap
-Spicy Shredded beef
-Sauteed King Mushroom with Snowpea Shoots
-Sauteed Eggplant with House Sauce 

It was all fantastic, delicious, and neither too salty or greasy.

My sister and her S.O. apparently have hollow legs as they effortlessly ate us all under the table.  Hubby was also very pleased and ravenously devoured his food with fork in one hand and chopsticks in the other.  I just shake my head at him as the old Chinese folks seated nearby look at him like he's a nutty gweilo. For dessert we ordered the smooth rich mango pudding mmmm :)   It was the perfect light yet still decadent way to finish off that epic meal.

The service is the usual Asian stoic, yet shotgun style which I'm used to but the pace can feel very go-go-go! with efficient servers dressed in white button down shirts incidentally with awesome creatively gel spiked hair changing up our hungrily emptied dishes with new hot entrees faster than you can say Dance Dance Revolution.

My one caveat was the uber-lame muzak piping in the background as I swear I must have heard a sterile instrumental version of Crystal Gayle's ""Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue"" about 5 times, had this been 1977 and we'd been at a Ponderosa in Georgia that may have sufficed but I'd sooner listen to Traditional Chinese folk music than to this aural pablum.  

Upon going to use the facilities, I was hesitant to make my way down to the basement bathroom as I'd had some close encounters of the unhygenic kind in some China/Korea town restos and feared the worst.  Well, Asian Legend's WCs are super slick and spotless to boot, housed next to a number of spacious and modern private dining rooms, I saw no gambling, no haggard masseuses,  just private diners having a ball singing a Chinese Karaoke version Single Ladies...oh oh oh....

Just one too many things soured my dining experience today...
...not certain I can go back. 

I walked in (admittedly towards the end of the lunch rush) and was astonished that nearly every table was covered with dirty dishes. Now I've worked in restaurants, I understand when you're hit hard it can be challenging to keep up with tables that need to be bused. I've also eaten in a lot of restaurants, which makes me qualified to say things like tables covered with dirty dishes don't scream ""welcome, sit yourself down, you're in for a treat!"" The waitress gave me a warm welcome, encouraged me to sit anywhere I wanted, but given my choices (a clean table or a dirty one) there were two... two tables in the entire restaurant to choose from. 

Things got worse from there. 

My egg roll was undercooked, cold on the inside and doughy. Why doughy? No clue. But doughy. 

The wontons in the wonton soup were melt in your mouth, and not in a good way. Melt in your mouth because the dumplings were overcooked. No bite. No chew. 

And while their version of Pad Thai was tasty, at 3 stars, which ought to be moderate was so spicy I had to ask for several additional napkins. Waitress must have thought I said several more spices, because she brought two over. Ironic. Unfortunate.

Also unfortunate is the fact that this place is so drastically different than LLXWilly. It's bigger and the hours are better, but neither are enough to make me want to give them another go after today.",2013-06-07 04:56:45

I made the mistake of arriving here at lunch rush, 12 noon. Not only was there a long line of people waiting to order, there was also a big clump of people waiting for their order. Now you may think that the line is finite and eventually you'll order the amount of time spent in the line will be equal to the amount of time spent waiting for food but NO. You're wrong. Because what you can't see is the mobile orders coming in through various apps, and messing up the queue. Although I feel like I shouldn't be complaining because I'm a big advocate for ordering through mobile apps and any chance I get, I'll use Ritual to order because you don't have to wait and you get points and extra perks! This time I didn't but I won't be making that mistake again. 

So anyway we waited and waited and we probably got our food like 20 minutes after we ordered. Major downside: the wait area is right beside where they cook the food so your hair and clothes inevitably end up smelling like smoke. 

I got a pad thai - with veggies. The food itself is consistently good. Spicy, sweet and full of veggies cooked perfectly. The one thing I noticed which kinda bothered me is that they use the same pair of tongs to grab the veggies and the meat when they assemble your dish. For most people this isn't a huge deal but I was kinda grossed out when I noticed that. I know there's always going to be cross-contamination when you choose to eat at a fast food establishment such as this one but I was blissfully ignoring the fact.

As a result it continues to be my favorite ""fancy"" burger place.  I've sampled the Morty's Steakhouse, Elk Gone Wild and created my own creations as well.  I'm never disappointed and appreciate the fact that I know when I go to Burgatory and order a burger cooked medium it will be beautifully delicious.

Also, the fact that it was a non-smoking hotel really saved my entire wardrobe/luggage from smelling like an ashtray and was nice for my throat and voice!

There were a couple of things that were negative; most of all the plumbing.  Our kitchen sink, bathroom sinks, and bathtub were all slow to drain and clogged easily.  The kitchen sink actually started leaking and flooding underneath, and the toilets took two or three flushes just to get the toilet paper to go down.  I also noticed that housekeeping never came in the three days we stayed there.  We didn't put any ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on the doors, so I'm not sure why they didn't come.  As a result, we had to call the lobby multiple times for things like toilet paper, towels, and shampoo.

I was shopping for a gift for my mother and aunt to go along with the items I'd picked up at Payard and Jean-Philippe and as I'd heard good things about Vosges from a friend in NYC I decided to check it out.

Julie, the saleswoman was incredibly helpful in assisting my decision without placing any sales pressure whatsoever.  Considering the prices of the truffles (ranging $2.50-$3.00) I was definitely suprised when the woman offered me a freebie of the Tian Nacu truffle - Mexican Vanilla Bean, Venezuelan 65% dark, and a small piece of gogi berry bar.  Both were fantastic.  I was even more suprised when I asked questions about other options and was given free sample truffles of the Balsamico - 12 year Modena balsamic, 65% Dark, Sicilian Hazelnuts as well as the Rooster - Taleggio cheese, organic walnut, Tahitian Vanilla Bean, 64% Dark Chocolate.  $8 worth of free Chocolate in Vegas?  Nice!  I'd like to think it was my charming personality or stunning good looks, but I'll just assume they do this for everyone.

Regardless, both the cheese and the vinegar truffles were amazing and I additionally had a small taste of the Moe's Bacon Bar before making my purchase.

Had I not just eaten at Payard I'd have likely picked up a cookie, brownie, or hot chocolate as all looked delectable, and I'll definitely be ordering their Red Velvet cake for someone's special event sometime.

Organic does not mean healthy, but like anything else of high quality, Vosges is safe in small doses and absolutely fantastic.  True Innovation is tough to find, but I'd say Vosges does it right and the service was stellar.

Thanks to Yelp, I found Maison Kam Fung a block away, inside a labyrinthine strip-mallish building. 

After stopping to ask for directions and following my helper to the restaurant, I ended up being seated across a large round table from two businessmen, since I was dining alone.

The restaurant was packed, which gave me hope that the food would be excellent. The gai lan was cooked perfectly, and the server kindly cut it into smaller pieces when asked (I hate gnawing on large chunks of Chinese broccoli). And then there was a cart of food I wasn't interested in. And then there was a very, very long wait before the next cart appeared. In fact, the wait was so long that my tablemates complained to the staff. Finally, another cart appeared. This contained one of the best shrimp fun I've ever tasted.

Then, since I was getting tired of waiting for more food, I stopped a waiter and asked for siu mai, shrimp and chive dumplings, and pork spareribs with black bean sauce. The siu mai was delivered promptly, but I was told to wait for the carts for the rest of the food. In the meantime, I tucked into the siu mai, which were very large but not very good. The ratio of pork to shrimp was off, and it tasted like a pork meatball. 

In the end I gave up waiting for anything else and just got some baked bows wrapped up to go. When I left the table to pay the bill, I put a few dollars down for a tip. At the register the host had the temerity to ask if I'd already left a tip as he handed me my change. I guess he was thinking he should just keep it if I'd been so gauche as to not tip.

Needless to say, that left a very bad taste in my mouth. This was the worst dining experience I had in Montreal. I see no reason to ever return.",2009-06-10 03:30:36

This is the first cidery in Charlotte and it already has its own following.  Red Clay is easily accessible from I-77 or South Blvd in an old warehouse on Clanton Rd.  They have a nice patio out front and there's cornhole in the parking lot.

Inside is a mix of seating, pub tables, a couple of long picnic tables, a comfortable seating area in the front and of course the bar in the back.  There's not too much to the decor but there is an apple on the left wall that includes the names of everyone who donated to their kickstarter campaign. Great idea!!!

On my first visit, they only had 3 ciders on tap but on my next visit there were 5 which included a sweet cider, a semi-dry, a cranberry cider, a cherry cider, and a hoppy thyme cider.  I didn't care for the first two but the others were great. I especially enjoyed mixing the cranberry and cherry to create what I call an adult Cran-Cherry.  Sorry Ocean Spray!

In addition to the ciders they also have 3 local beers on tap, a chardonnay and a few non-alcoholic options like kombucha, root beer, and coffee on nitro.

The staff is great here. Everyone was very friendly and gracious to have you supporting them.

A few other items to note:

* They have USB outlets under the bar and around the taproom to charge your phone. Just bring a USB cable for your phone!
* On weekends, they only do flights before 3pm.
* There's an ""Order Here"" sign in the middle of the bar. It's helpful and avoids interruptions between people sitting at the bar.

The atmosphere is great - classy decor with comfortable seating. However, that may be the only remarkable characteristic of this restaurant. 

Firstly, the receptionists were poorly managed. We did not receive our waiting number in a timely fashion. Others who arrived after us were seated before us. The wait was atrocious. We waited for almost 1 hour for lunch. Overall, the service felt chaotic. 

We ordered the special combo with fish and lobster. The combo consist of Hong Kong ""Tornado Refugee Centre"" Style lobster (5 lb), fish two ways (2 lbs) (fish congee with preserved vegetable, and fired fish with sweet soya sauce), pea shoots in broth, fried doughnut, and stir fry rice noodle with long bean and olive leaf.

The flavour of the dishes were great, the temperature of the food on the other hand, were cold when they arrived. For a lunch that costed $138, it is not acceptable. Chinese food tastes extremely heavy after it is cold or even luke warm. The tea is not refilled even after we had made multiple requests. To put insult on injury, we found hair in our dish.

The lemon chicken was just ok.  The sauce was overpoweringly lemony even for someone like me who loves lemon.  The Tom Yum soup was simply awful.  The broth was made up of what tasted like a watered down tomato soup with not enough spices and very few shrimp and scallops.  The calamari in the soup was rubbery.

There are not a lot of great options for Chinese food in this area of the City and I had high hopes that this place since it had been around for a while.

The lamb and gravy were exactly as I hoped and expected--slightly tough, thoroughly cooked lamb with some fat on it and some slightly gelatinous gravy.

I was disappointed in the roast potatoes because they were crispy-crunchy, almost like french fries on the outside, and fluffy inside.  They are supposed to be shiny and brown outside, still firm inside.  The carrots were okay, properly cooked and not overcooked, again a disappointment because I was jonesing for overboiled cabbage or marrow (sort of like zucchini) with lots of salt.  The peas were the bright green frozen things I ordinarily LOVE, but again, I was hoping for olive-drab marrowfat peas better employed as missiles launched at one's classmates from a spoon.  The Yorkshire pudding was American-style, this big puffy round thing resembling a popover, instead of a lovely slice of chewy stodge in a puddle of gravy.  The meal is a bargain at $10.95, and it was better than I'd hoped for.  The portions are extremely generous--one plate is enough for two, really.  I was only disappointed because I'd wanted a trip back to school lunches in the UK in the late 1960's.

The Sticky Toffee pudding is lovely, although again, not quite stodgy enough, and the bottle of Theakston Old Peculier DID evoke memories of a fairly recent visit to Harrogate.

The same meal, minus the show, served in a Tokyo Joe/Samurai Sam bowl would cost 6.95 and be plated far more delicately and with greater attention to flavor.

Food and ambiance aside, the show was spot on.  We had a Mexican teppanyaki chef who really was on his game (So much so, that I awarded Ichi Ban a star!)

Yes, it was much of the same old tired act teppanyaki chefs have been passing along to us for years (twirling spatulas, spinning eggs, onion volcanos, shrimp in the hat) but the passion this guy had for the show was undeniable.

My review will be on the Yin Meditation class on Sunday evenings which I was hesitant to take at first but it has come to be something I treat myself to each week.

Some think of it as a beginner class because it's a bit slower and the room isn't as hot, and it is great for beginners, but as someone who's been practicing yoga for over 10 years I also find it challenging and rewarding.

It's my favourite class by far and embodies a lot of the elements I love about yoga... Stretching, breathing, openness, relaxation, and meditation. And having it in a hot room really increases it's benefits.

You hold positions for long periods of time allowing your body to stretch and to adjust to the sensation of slight discomfort (it should never be painful). It's surprisingly therapeutic to both physically and mentally learn to accept the sensation of discomfort and learn to manage it. 

I always find myself super relaxed after this class which is perfect for a Sunday evening before starting the work week.

Iam Yoga has a lot of great ""fitness"" type classes too which I take during the week but Yin is my favourite by far.",2011-01-13 22:18:31

They claim to be a champagne bar and yet I have not once seen anyone with champagne in hand nor does the decor go hand-in-hand with the classic bubbly theme, nor any modern bubbly one. And Ultra Lounge!? Where? Where is this Lounge area? If they are referring to the tabled off sections or the ill-placed ""lounge"" smack dab in the middle of the dance floor then, I guess that's their idea of a lounge. I hear the word Lounge and I think of the old Pearl that used to be in this area. That was comfy lounge-like. 

If this club was in New Jersey, it would thrive beyond belief. Sorry, but that's not a compliment. The club owner should have consulted another designer before going with this outdated and lackluster looking interior. 

My friends and I have gone here a few times, but those times are always when we have east coast friends in town (see what I mean about NJ?). 

I secured a table here on three separate occasions, obviously not learning from the first mistake. We had to serve ourselves all night. We rarely saw our cocktail waitresses (this occurrence happened each time we had tables). 

For the hype of what they advertise (and Yeesh do they need to tone it down with the gawdy Jersey Shore looking ads... My head hurts every time I see one on Instagram), this club falls way short. With new hip and cool clubs and bars going up around them or ones giving themselves a fresh look (like El Hefe), INT'L needs to do something before they succumb to the same fate as their across the street and no longer in business neighbor Derby (now Bevvy).

In general, place is fun and very crowded. Good for family and kids. Mostly Hispanics are here I'm probably the only Asian there. Mexican music is played everywhere. Very energetic atmosphere.

Haggling is off limit here and I dislike that part. I know stuff and I know the price and some things are just ridiculous. I get it they're making a living and stuff. Some stuff are just really in bad shape idk why they're selling it. There are some antique items here that caught my eyes. They literally sell everything here from bras to shoes to video games all types and some really old stuff. Some guys were selling organic honey also. It's fun to go through all the stands but I recommend go with a person who somewhat fluent in Spanish or else you might feel lost.

They have food stands but mostly finger food, nothing special or fancy. I had a fresh coconut being chopped right in front of me to open for the coconut juice, after we drank all of it and poured into a cup, they broke it in half and scooped the flesh inside. It was really delicious and refreshing I loved it. Many fruit drinks stands around. I had chamango or mangonada. It was delish, $5 for a small but they filled all the way, well garnished with chewy stuff. Then I ordered 4 tacos that took 20 minutes to make and it wasn't even busy. I had this sandwich made with soaked red and soggy bread with inedible fillings. My friends and I later had huge stomachaches and diarrhea. It was terrible and the food gave us food poisoning. I'm pretty sure it was the mango fruit desert thing mangonada or chamango bc only two of us got the diarrhea and we were the only one that ate the mango thing

Each room is meant to be like a different reading/relaxing nook areas. Different feel, different decorations, different furniture, with a different thematic feel to each room. I sat in the silver furniture section-ha. Love the bookshelves with reading material. If you pick the back room I guarantee you will probably forget you are in a restaurant. It even has a TV.  Also, the entire place is covered with art work hanging on the walls for sale, by I assume local artists. They also have some jewelry for sale. BUY LOCAL! GOTTA LOVE IT! This is a totally fun and cute place. Very artistic for my inner creative Drama Queen. The place was also packed. 
   Ok, so now onto the food. I am a chicken salad fanatic so I got the Voodoo Chicken Salad for something totally different and unique. I think I got it because the name was so clever. Cajun Chicken Salad= Voodoo ha, ha, ha! Honestly, I was not really in love with it through no fault of the restaurants. It is just very different. I think I will just stick with my traditional view of white regular chicken salad and my addiction to Casella's Deli-the best!. However, this sandwich was still tasty enough. I would like to go back and try some other Hobnob sandwiches and or salads especially since I hear their Hummus is the best in town. On the way out I got all excited because I spied a Black and White cookie out of NY. I had already ordered a slice of their Coconut Cake which BTW I am eating right now as inspiration while writing this review.

Carmen herself was working busily on the floor, seating customers and creating a positive vibe in the space. 

She made a recommendation on the vino, 6 Sombreros from the Rioja region. Was quite good - not very Rioja-like, but tasty none-the-less. 

We went with tapas rather going the paella route.

I was just passing by this place long back, read ""Best Chicken in Town"" and laughed out thinking how could someone claim that they are the best in the city when there are so many great fried chicken restaurants here. Decided to visit this place to check it out.

After having their food all they claim is nothing but TRUTH!!

Ordered 4 Cheese Mac 'n Cheese, Buttermilk Fried Chicken with their Thai chilli sauce (Yes! you have to order it seperately) and Poutine. For the drinks we ordered Beef Salami Caesar and Orange Creamsicle. Beef Salami Caesar was amazing. Though I don't drink that often but believe me Beef Salami Caesar is one of the best cocktails I've had so far. My husband also enjoyed his drink and said the same about his drink too.

All the dishes were mind blowingly good. Mac n' Cheese was the best I've had so far. It was topped with Ritz Crackers and was served with delicious garlic bread. It had the perfect proportion of the sauce, cheese and crunch. Fried Chicken came with Biscuit. Chicken had the right kind of crunch and was super juicy inside. Cooked to Perfection! Biscuit was as good as it can get, buttery with the right kind of softness it should have from the inside. Poutine was amazing too I think they make their brown sauce in house and that's what made it even more yumm!

It was one of - if not possibly the - worst I've ever had.  They have what they call ""stuffed"" burgers.  Dear Hash House:  A stuffed burger is a hamburger that is - guess what? Stuffed!  This was two pieces of meat smashed so flat beyond recognition that I'm surprised they didn't fall apart when they removed them from the grill.  Not a 'burger' by any stretch of the imagination.  Flat, tasteless pieces of meat.  Perhaps they should actually go places that serve hamburgers; you know, where you can actually taste flavor.  By the time they were done squashing the meat (there's no other way to say it) any semblance of flavor it might have had was gone...kaput.

I also thought I ordered the Swiss cheeseburger, but what might have been cheese at one point was cooked into the ""little holes"" that this thing that passed for burger had (because they, again, smashed it to smithereens).  There were probably three or four mini mushrooms (I think), and could not be considered anything close to what it is labeled.  Plus, the bun that they use is entirely too small - meat stuck out everywhere, making it impossible to pick up without getting greasy meat all over your hands.  Good thing they brought a knife, so I could at least cut this thing up.  I should have been suspicious when our server didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked (you know, rare, medium, etc.  Only fast food places never ask you because they cook them one way - badly).

Here's how you cook a hamburger:  You form the patty, put it on the grill, and turn it ONCE only, without smashing it like you're trying to kill all the flavor.  When it is finished (according to how someone wants it) you remove and place on a bun that fits.  You place the tomato, lettuce, onion and pickles on the side so the customer can stack them in the order they want, not throw them on the bun before you even place the meat on it.

Although this thing was billed as a ""stuffed"" burger, it was nothing more than two pieces of overcooked meat that they had somehow fitted a small piece of cheese and a few mushrooms between and called it stuffed.  It wasn't.

To make it worse, the server told us to order their ""fantastic"" fries - which were nothing more than store bought frozen (or tasted like it) seasoned fries.  

Will I go back?  Probably not, since if they can't make a burger - which is pretty simple fare, then the rest of the food probably isn't that great.  Bigger isn't always better, and just because portions are big doesn't make it good; it just means you're paying more.  (Also, just wondering:  why was there a sprig of rosemary in the bun?  The burger nor the bun was flavored with it, so it seemed odd).",2016-12-24 23:25:06

1.  Ribeye ($51)

3.  Truffle Mac 'N Cheese ($12) - so rich and yummy and I'm sure very bad for you but it's worth the sacrifice

5.  Tiramisu ($12)
6.  Panna Cotta ($12) - this was a surprise, much better than expected
7.  3 Coffees ($5 each)

Total bill was $162 before tax and tip for 3 of us.

The steaks were good.  We asked for medium rare.  Could have been a little more on the rare side but not bad enough that we would send it back.  Joshua, our waiter, was good too although he has helpers that clear and serve.

We all enjoyed the meal and would return.",2011-07-10 09:17:18

He helped put me at ease that I was in the right spot to get my cat the best care. Dr. Similo took the time to explain everything to me and was so caring and nice. My cat gets very anxious at the vet. Dr. Similo even sat on the floor while he went over my cat's lab tests and by the end of consultation, my cat even let Dr. Similo pet her!

They are famous for their falafel which is a great tasty, quick and cheap lunch item. I also get their lentil soup on cold days cause its delicious. They bake all of their pita fresh in-store and have an amazing selection of dips such as hummus, baba ganoush etc. They allow you to sample them before you buy and their service is pretty quick. Their Moroccan cigars are pricey but really crispy and fresh.

You order at the back and they will put the $ amount on the bag, you can then shop around a little more and pay at the front.

The waitstaff were friendly and helpful and I settled on a lamb dish on rice, which was shown on the wall. We appreciated that everyone had a choice of soup to go with the meal, especially the fact that they had several options available.

You can be seated in their soft, cushioned booth which is nicely fabricated and accented with small pillows to lean on after a serious food coma. 

I would suggest the macadamia nut snapper and the coconut prawns. My personal Iff you know me, the macadamia nut snapper because of that light and sweet flavor that comes with a crunch due to the macadamia. The coconut prawns is also because of the sweet crunch of the toasted coconuts, and I lllooovvveee coconut. I would also suggest the ribs as well-tender, juicy, and full of flavor.

Now, this is VERY VERY IMPORTANT. When you go to Tommy's, you must absolutely TRY THE PINA COLADA CAKE. It's one of the best kept secrets. The best way to die and go to heaven via dessert. It is my favorite of all time, and because of the price it's one I rarely induldge in. The Pina Colada cake consists of a soft sponge vanilla cake, with a really light white mousse that is garnished and sprinkled with pinapple and coconut. It is soft, tasteful, elegant, and delicious. It will take your breath away. 

Service? 5 stars. You never have to worry about your drink running empty because as soon as they see you running low on liquids, they are sure to magically fill your glass up when you're not looking.

So as always in the spirit of full disclosure I am slightly biased to Zack  Bruell's restaurants, however, I'm not afraid to criticize if I felt it necessary.  While this is only the second one I've been to, (the other being Parallax) I absolutely love what they do with food.  Chinato (pronounced Key-na-too) is no exception.  Don't expect to find your Americanized italian food here, as you'll be disappointed, if that is what your looking for.  The inspiration for the cuisine is Italian food like they do it in Italy, and to me that is just what Cleveland needs.

So first the decor, its a nice mix of modern and classic with an amazing mural along in the main dining area that stretches the length of the room of what I'd imagine is of some where in Italy.  The seating is intimate much like Parallax and I like that.  I sat in a booth but didn't feel overcrowded by those around me.

Next the appetizers, or Antipasti.  We tried the Salumi Platter and the Beef Tongue with Sweet and Sour Eggplant.  The Salumi platter aka salami was very tasty, although I had wished the server would have told us what the different kinds were or I should have asked.  Either way it was good, didn't blow me away but if you like salami its nice, go for it.  The beef tongue was unique, I hadn't had it before so I really don't know if it was good for beef tongue.  It had a very beefy flavor with an interesting texture.  I'm not a fan of eggplant to begin with those so that threw me off a bit.  I'd try it again though to give myself a better feel for it.  

On to the pasta and entrees.  For the pasta we had the Pappardelle with creamed cauliflower, pecorino and pepperoncini.  This pasta was very nice, it was slightly creamy, but not heavy, and a very nice spicy kick to it.  Gets my approval for sure.  The entrees were Beef Braised in Amarone with creamy polenta, Sea Scallops with pepperoncini, garlic oil and roasted potatoes and Sweetbread Fritto Misto with fried caper berries, carrot and zucchini julienne.  The braised beef was excellent, very flavorful and tender, and the creamy polenta was the perfect compliment with plenty of flavor itself.  Polenta can often be very plain but this certainly was not.  The sea scallops were done perfectly, I find that scallops are often done one of two ways, excellent or very poorly.  These were done perfectly, my only complaint was the potatoes seemed to be a little dry, but wouldn't keep me from ordering the dish again.  The Sweetbread Fritto Misto was a very nice dish.  Its definitely a different twist on sweetbreads than what I've had in the past.  Often sweetbreads are served with some sort of heavier sauce.  These were slightly breaded and I believe sauteed, and it made the dish much lighter with the julienne vegetables.  A nice touch was very thinly sliced lemon pieces that were roasted as well giving a nice lemon flavor and additional crunch to the dish.  The dessert I had was the ricotta cheese cake which was a nice finish to the meal, it was slightly lighter and sweeter than a normal cheesecake, I'd order again.

We tried two bottles of wine, one was a Chianti and the other was a Sangiovese. Both were very good, unfortunately, I'll have to update later with the names when I get back there since they are escaping me at this time.

Overall Chinato is a must try in Cleveland which is sure to become a hot spot.  Check it out and see how Zack is at it again.",2010-01-17 23:00:36

Speaking of mandoo, their mandoo soup had a lot of nonfried mandoo and noodles. Their broth was flavorful and it also had pieces of egg.  The beef and vegetable soup was yummy, but it was majority vegetables. The 3 meats we got was chicken Katsu, meat jun and bulgogi. The plate was huge and the meat was all flavorful.

(yes, he got yelled at for such a poor choice). If you don't like cheese, don't order anything with cheese on it.  Both our dishes had tons of melted cheese piled on, which was awesome.  

Service was just ok. The server never asked how our meal was  after it was brought to the table and since the coffee was bitter i wanted water. Finally had to flag her down halfway through my food to get a glass of water.  I also waited and waited to get a box for my muffin.

I'm amazed at the lack of face time restaurant managers give. I saw a manager once during our 45 minutes to an hour there when a table's order was wrong outside of that, i never saw a manager again. 

I would return again but maybe not on a Sunday morning when they're so busy.  I'll give our server the benefit of the doubt and say that's why the service wasn't stellar.",2012-10-14 16:58:47

My stepson wanted seafood for his birthday, and I think it may be a tradition after this to take him here. 
There are three dining areas, a large dining room, a sushi bar lounge area with a bar yet it is still family appropriate, and a patio with misters. 
The food options include lobster, different styles of crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, and even sushi. Since it is salmon season, they also had a variety of salmon specialties. 
Between the four of us, we had king crab, calamari, crab cakes, spicy seafood chowder, a philly sushi roll, mussels, and shrimp. The only thing I would pass on my next trip would be the chowder. It indeed had a spice, but the broth was a bit greasy. Everything else I would have seconds of in a heartbeat!
Granted, this place isn't the cheapest. (4 people = $200 bill) But I think that is pretty average if you are expecting high quality fish. 
Perfect for a date night, or trying to impress a potential business partner or client. And just as perfect for a family craving seafood. Can't wait to return.",2014-09-15 17:52:29

The exhibits are always well presented. Well thought out, well planned, well labelled and displayed, each exhibit provides an opportunity to learn and appreciate whatever the subject matter may be - from abstract post-expressionism to Picasso, the Modigilani, to David Bowie, to the masterpieces from the Guggenheim's Great Upheaval, these exhibits hold up for multiple viewings. Even though they are frequently busy, the presentations are so good that you can have your own private experience each time. The audio guides are also often very helpful.

The main collection boasts rooms and rooms of Group of Seven paintings, a gallery of miniatures I just love, a collection of model ships in the basement and other regular pieces that are a treat to visit and revisit with friends or on my own. The members lounge is in the lovely old Grange building at the back of the AGO facing the park which is so rich in history I just love being there too. Even if you aren't into art, the building itself is exquisite and having a coffee in the Dundas facing wood and glass atrium is a great view as is the spiral staircase - all designed by Frank Gehry. 

The gift shop is a must-see on any visit. A beautiful jewelry collection of Canadian artists, a kids section, a huge book selection and a number of other kitchen gadgets, houseware and even clothing can be found here. 10% off is offered to members.

I love art museums and see as many as I can when traveling. I can confidently say that the AGO is a world-class art gallery. If you're visiting Toronto or living here, the AGO is an institution worthy of our support.",2014-03-05 18:28:44

TfLBFN-ZflK5SRi1u62NJg,65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw,NIPn7olHs6k3Svxy6DHUQA,4,5,3,4,"We were back in the Bridge for my sister in law's birthday and she had decided to have it at Canyon Creek at Vaughan Mills.  

I've been to Canyon Creek many times but the one near Sherway Gardens, not this particular one ever before.  It was a Wednesday evening so this is the type of place I wouldn't necessarily go to if it wasn't a holiday or weekend but the place was still quite lively, not bopping and busy as to be expected but maybe 40% to half full.

The birthday girl ordered several nachos and spinach dip apps and I had ordered the new Seoul Food chicken app.  The nachos app is great.  The spinach dip may be a bit thicker to be a dip as you'll break your chips trying to dip it, use the spoon to spoon some on your side dish it's easier.  You can dip into the salsa though, that will work.  The dip is creamy and cheesy and good while it's still warm, as cheese goes it will solidify a bit when it cools.  The chips are nice and salty and can even be eaten by themselves.

The Korean chicken app was different and didn't really meet my expectations.  They were cubes of white meat, battered and rolled into some sort of grain mix almost like rice crispies and deep fried.  They were crunchy yes, but without the sauce they were sort of bland.  I've been spoiled by more authentic Korean fried chicken it seems.  This was a twist on a taste but just something a little different but not really special IMO.

My wife is not used to eating heavy in the evenings so she ordered something light, just fish tacos.  To me this is the wrong thing to order in a steak house but it's what she wanted.  I didn't ask her how they were but they looked like fish sticks on tortillas to be honest.  

For me, when in a steak place, get a steak.  That's what I did and I decided to get one of the better cuts, a ribeye.  I had asked for it medium and honestly it was done basically to perfection.  I liked the cut and it is as advertised... marbled.  I took a side of mashed this time instead of what I usually get which is a loaded baked just to change things up a bit.  It was a great meal and Canyon Creek is good at steaks... it's their thing.  

So to summarize, yes to the spinach dip, no to the Korean chicken app, a hella yes to the ribeye steak.

Our server was good and although a bit dim, the ambiance is nice.  We were seated basically in a private area with a long table (under 20) and we had the gratuity automatically added (and HIGHLIGHTED that it was already added at 15%)  on the bills.  The server also said to not add tip since it was already added.  It seems every place doesn't use 18% as the new 15%.

Overall I like Canyon Creek and I pretty much always have.  They are a chain but I don't care, they are good.",2015-09-03 12:35:04

One of the owners came out, explained my options, made his recommendations based on my needs, and provided me with a very good quote. Several hours later, a crew of two gentlemen were at my house installing both units. Instructions were provided, clean up was quick, and the whole process couldn't have been easier. I had a few operational questions, which were promptly answered when I called the phone number provided. A nice change in comparison to those local businesses that pretend you no longer exist once they've made a sale.

I required their services again one year later. I needed to have my soft water filtration system temporarily moved/uninstalled and then reinstalled three days later due to a garage epoxy project I was having done by another company. I called and asked for a quote. The lady said she'd get back to me in a couple of hours, which she actually did. In fact, practically every time I've called them during business hours, someone actually ANSWERS the phone. 

I use them once a year for my RO filter change. I am confident that if I need help with issues down the road that they'll be there to assist.

Given my lifelong loyalty to Marriott I hate to write that BLT just fell short for me. I was really looking forward to a meal at BLT, so much so that my expectations were probably a little too high.

The restaurant setting was comfortable and classy. The grounds to the restaurant and resort were stunning. It was just what you would expect from the A+ Marriott experience.

Now for the food and my disappointment, it started with complimentary pate and popovers that were provided. Pate was ok and the popovers were on point. I will not say anything negative about free. For appetizer, we started with the crab cakes. They lacked any really crab flavor and just missed the mark. We then ordered our entrees which included steak, Mac and cheese, and French fries.  I was excited to see Wagyu steak on the menu and went with the large 12 ounce. Now I know the price at $90+ can be deemed by some high, but the Wagyu I have had in my life have been worth every penny. This one sadly was not. Not at all!!!  Aside from not being cooked to medium rare as I requested, it just was not quality and did not melt in my mouth as Wagyu should. I REALLY question the choice of meat I was given. As for the mac it was very bland and the fries were the only bright spot. They were well seasoned and had a nice dipping sauce. As for sauces, I requested a peppercorn with my steak and it too was very good.  With my overall disappoint in the food, I elected to skip dessert.

The service for the night was good but could not make up for the food. 

The night overall was just disappointing. I really thought it was going to be a ten or in the Yelp world, five stars. To pay over $200 for some good fries and sauces was pretty sad. It just seemed like I paid for a mirage of an awesome meal. My loyalty to Marriott will continue and I even plan on staying at this JW Marriott very soon, but will not be stopping in BLT for anything more than a beverage.",2016-04-02 07:07:37

We sampled a majority of the menu - all of the appetizers and most of the different meats in the entrees. We all agreed that the best appetizer was the fried eggplant mixed with whey (I can't remember the Persian name for it). The yogurt sauces were also delicious and we ended up ordering more to put on our entrees. Entree portions were HUGE and we dramatically over-ordered. If you're not too hungry and order appetizers, two people could split one entree. We ordered more than one entree per person and could not nearly finish. The lamb and chicken were tender and fantastic, but I thought the beef left a little to be desired - it was very tough and chewy. We also ordered the yogurt drink which was much milkier than it normally is at other places, so I didn't like it (I prefer it thicker). But one person in our group loved it. Baklava is their only dessert, which we ordered - not the best I've ever had but quite tasty!

After lunch, we ordered hookahs from their menu of pre-mixed flavors. We tried the berry cooler and the peach cooler. No smoking is allowed inside of the restaurant, so we moved outside to the patio. This is the part of the meal we didn't enjoy. The restaurant is in a strip mall, so the ""hookah lounge"" area is basically in the parking lot right by the street, looking at everything else in the strip mall. It was extremely hot in mid-afternoon and in the sun with no shade to speak of (they really need to install some awnings or umbrellas if they plan to make it a hookah place). Even in the evening when the sun is not a problem, I wouldn't go back for hookah because of the lack of ambiance on the side of the road. However, I would go back for the food!",2013-06-02 22:36:22

I really wanted to try the meatball sub but he told me it was an acquired taste and basically talked me out of it. The bread was perfect and fresh. Nice crisp on the outside and moist on the inside with nicely seasoned bbq pork and cilantro, jalapeno slices, and carrot and daikon pickles. I thought for sure that the 10' sandwich would fulfill my hunger, but when I was finished I was longing for more! lol!

My boyfriend and I went at about 1:45p on a Saturday afternoon and it was only a 10min wait. Not too shabby!

We loved the lemon grilled tuna tacos, original margarita, and queso that we split. The queso almost tasted like a beer cheese, just had a more savory flavor than I'm used to I guess. The margarita was really interesting, you'd get the typical citrus/sour mix flavors at first then it had a really sweet after taste - I'm pretty sure I couldn't drink more than two without getting a massive hangover. And the tacos were out of this world - definitely the star of the show - and there were a handful of other types we want to try in the future that I'm confident are equally as good. 

My only qualms are:
(1) the chips and salsa they serve the table are a unique twist. Instead of making a standard tomato based salsa they serve the tortillas with a corn salsa. This is just a personal preference, but I don't want corn salsa (with close to nothing else but corn in it) with corn chips. Hence the queso move...
(2) our server missed part of our order. Granted it was loud, I mumble, and one order of tacos plus a side plus queso was enough to fill us up. But still, he wrote down the first and third things I ordered. Confused on what happened there in the middle.

If that's what you're looking for David Duncan is the place for you. Ambience is slightly upscale but there were plenty of people not dressed up. Still I wore a jacket (no tie) for dinner and did not look out of place.

I had the chicken Neptune -- a gilled chicken breast with crab meat and some kind of sauce on top. The crab was the real thing (not the fake stuff made out of mystery fish bits) and there was plenty of it. But the chicken was a bit blah. Nothing bad, just nothing exciting. Veggies were excellent (carrot and parsnip), looked like they were broiled and while caramelized on the outside still retained a slight crispiness when bitten, which is the way I like it. Had a bit of my son's rapini which was also very well done.

Garden salad was plain but the Caesar salad looked pretty good. Didn't have dessert but I thought the brewed coffee was good.

Was there for a private party (not really private as we had most but not all of the top floor) and the staff handled the large group well. They also gave us space and time after dinner was over which was nice for mingling and catching up.

Took a sneak peak at the menu, I'd say that the steak/chops prices are not as high as the high-end places in Toronto, maybe $5-$10 cheaper than you'd expect to pay for a similar cut at the Morton's, Harbour Sixty etc. 

Other miscellaneous comments -- easy to get to location and giant parking lot make it very convenient for large group like we had. But top floor was getting very warm by the end of the evening.

Our room was on the 28th floor with a great view to the south of the Bellagio fountains and City Center. I like that there is a refrigerator in the room and motorized curtains that you can control bedside. After the first night, we did not receive service to our room even though when we left, the cart was next door and they were providing service to our neighbors which speaks to the laziness of our housekeeper. The Spa elevators are convenient to the parking deck, pool, and to southern entrances/exits of the casino.

For the drivers, the parking deck is a mess. The later you get there, the less chance you have  of finding a spot. On the weekends, expect the deck and valet to be full if you don't get there early enough. On the upper floors of the parking deck there are some sections marked ""valet""  that guests can park so look for those areas if you're having trouble finding a spot.

The pools are a strong positive for the Flamingo. The GO pools are for the adults and the Beach Club pool is family friendly. Look for the bridge to cross over to the Beach Club pool where you present your key for entrance. Get there early to get your chair and enjoy a dip in the pool or take a ride down the two level slide.

I wouldn't recommend one restaurant in the hotel except Margaritaville to have a drink and people watch. Just put on the walking shoes because your center Strip location can get you to a nice restaurant in 15 minutes.

The poker room in Flamingo has always been one of my favorites. It's a great place to meet people from all over the country to chat and maybe have a shot or two. More importantly, it's a chance to win some easy money off an unsuspecting donkey or an inebriated player that can't see straight let alone make a smart decision.

Even if the food was bad, i would forget all about it just because he is simply the best! 

But...

The food was excellent! Everything that we ordered was executed perfectly! The menu is very small so choices are limited. No problem when it's done right. All main comes with choice of salad or soup, tea or coffee. Appetizers and desserts are ""à la carte"". My hubby and i shared a salmon tartar that was so fresh and delicate! Very good! The table next to us had the escargots. We're going for that next time :) i got the lamb shank. Ohhh! Melts-in-your-mouth-deliciousness! Hubby ordered the  the venison (deer) with red wine reduction and foie gras (en torchon). Cooked medium rare and the portion of foie gras was so, so, so generous! The only thing that he would of liked was for the foie gras to be more tempered and not ""out of the fridge to the plate"" king of thing. He tried to see if they could torch it a bit knowing very well that the foie gras would melt like butter but the waiter (not ours. An older man) ""kindly"" refused. Heck... The food was so good that we let that slip by :/  Both our main had the same sides: gratin dauphinois (superb!), celeriac purée with a piece of prune, baby green beans and summer squash.

The meal summed up to a bit under 120$ taxes and tips included for the both of us. Not bad at all for a byob restaurant and not bad at all for the quality of the food and especially for the service we got from out fabulous waiter!

I was pretty psyched when I heard that RCP was offering a vegan cheez alternative on their pizzas, so I made the voyage to Bougieland with some friends to try it out.  They'll charge you $2 extra for the vegan cheese, but at least they don't skimp! I got a 12"" pizza with bell peppers (ahem, green peppers - don't play me like I might be getting red!) and artichoke hearts.  The crust was good (although I like mine a little more done; it could have had another minute or two in the oven for my taste).  And the leftover pizza was good both cold right out of the fridge and reheated in the microwave.

So, what's the downside? Service is not great.  Ambiance is a little lacking.  There are some nice high tables near the kitchen area, then there's the ""kids area.""  We seemed to be surrounded by tables with children the whole time we were there.... What can you do? It was a busy day.... And there is no restroom.  You have to go outside, down the way, but I guess that's pretty common at Tivoli.  

Beware that most of their bottles of wine are actually half bottles.  We made that mistake and ended up with three people each getting 2/3 glass of wine.  Which was delicious, as it should be for $56/bottle.  Our bad for not reading closely, but I think we all felt it was a little underhanded.... My other complaint is that the (red) wine was freaking COLD.  This is not cold duck! This is a decent red wine....should be no colder than 60 deg.  This was like 40-45.  So, skip the wine, and go for the $1 PBR instead.

We saw inside just long enough to notice that the lights were off and no one was inside, but we hightailed it out of there before the cops showed up.",2012-07-22 17:09:31

On my first visit I sat at the bar with some friends  and was met with a snobbish manager ( I later found out); he knew more than I did about everything and has done more than I have in life.  But this ""manager"" never asked about my food at all,  he just engaged in conversation when not appropriate.  Our bartender was sweet and provided good service and the food was great, although we only had appetizers.  The beer list is extensive and if you can't find a beer you like here, then you're not likely to find it anywhere.  

Last week we were looking for places that were open during the ice storm.  After calling around to a few places in the neighborhood we found Kickstand was OPEN!  We all put on our boots and scarves and walked there.  We were greeted by a very polite lady that told us we could sit anywhere that was comfortable.  (Later to find out this is a manger too, what a difference!)  This is where the review get's good...  You could tell they had shortened their staff because of the weather.  We didn't mind at all (we were staying there a while) what's better is, we didn't notice they were short on staff.  (this is the group of people you'd want all the time working here).  They got busy, but you could never tell, our waiter was attentive, polite and I couldn't have asked for better service.  What a difference a change in day can make for an establishment.  The food was excellent, I ordered a burger with pimento cheese (perfect for a snow day).  We had MANY cold beers, phenomenal (the guy was funny) service, and this time the manager asked how we were and how was our experience.  I highly recommend this place now.  All of the food looked great around our table and we all left full!  I'm glad I waited to review Kickstand.  You have my return business now!",2016-01-28 17:24:53

The blue cheese fondue is surprising and delicious, I loved the BBQ and the ranch is really good too. We also shared the corn dogs and the truffled parmesan fries. We should have asked first because the corn dogs come on a bed of fries and they are really good small bites. I think my least favorite item was the truffled parmesan fries and they were really good too, just a little too much truffle for my taste.

Good: the server greeted us and was seated right away. It's a charming little spot with exposed brick walls and a warm ambiance. We asked for recommendations since it was our first time checking it out, and we ended up going with the battered shrimps tacos. Hands down, the best tacos I've ever had. Filling, well portions and reasonably priced. It reminds me of the food I've had in LA. You know the food is good when it brings back good memories.

Bad: no negative comments. Maybe the hot sauce wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but that's not even significant in comparison to how much I've enjoyed the meal.

It is a very cozy restaurant.  The server was kind enough to bring us to a corner table at the back, so we could quietly enjoy our dinner.  However, I would say that was possibly the darkest corner in the whole restaurant.  Reading my menu was not fun.  It was also too dark to even take a nice picture.

We were the first customers to arrive at around 630ish, and the owner told us to seat ourselves. So we sat at the back, and the owner gave us the menus. I was surprised how little the menu had, I was expecting a bit more. They don't have any yakitori or fried food like karaage so I had a hard time deciding what to get. In the end, we ordered three dishes - okonomiyaki, beef tataki (recommend) and the Japanese style poutine covered in Japanese curry and cheese with one piece of beef. We also drank sake, I forgot which brand but sake is not for me unfortunately. Food took a long time to come, not sure if they had maybe one or two kitchen staff on hand. The food is good but not the best.

Overall, if you like quiet and low-key maybe you'll like this place.

Self, what were you thinking?!

The theater is pretty low-tech, compared to the multiplexes that have become the norm.  You buy your ticket from an actual person, who promptly rips it and gives you the stub.  The concessions stand is less than ten yards away, and the actual theater is just behind that.  You won't find stadium seating or built-in cup holders into the seats.

So what makes the Regent Square Theater so awesome?  The low ticket prices, which are even lower, at $3, if you're a Pitt student.  The concession stand which charges reasonable prices.  I don't think any one item costs $5 or more.  You can add seasonings to your popcorn like Old Bay, Cajun and Ranch, and even have a cup of tea.  There's a generous amount of leg room between the theater seats.  And, yes, of course, the film selection--what plays here isn't at the AMC theaters. 

You can treat yourself to some culture and snacks here for less money than you'd pay catching a mainstream flick at the Waterfront or SouthSide.  There's really no excuse for not coming here.",2010-07-15 21:08:27
Z7YMkY0VNPHxlv7p5wzD5Q,6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,PRz-0bPh1FdszZqt9uq4sQ,1,8,8,5,"Damn...take out that second mortgage before catching a game here.  1 star is even a stretch!  

My buddy was in town (Padre fan) and wanted to watch them play at a different stadium other than their home field on 83rd in Peoria.  I had never been down here to this stadium, so we decided that we would try to catch a game here.  The Padres were playing the Giants at 7pm on Friday night.  I went online to buy tickets, and almost passed out from shock!  Lawn seats were $39.00.  Yes, you heard that right....a LAWN SEAT aka GENERAL ADMISSION was $39.00.  I know we are in Scottsdale, but Jesus Christ!  It's a Spring Training game for crying out loud!  When I saw those prices, there was no way in hell I was going to pay that much to watch a Spring game.  My buddy wound up getting some tickets through a rewards program at work, so technically they didn't cost us anything out of pocket.  He got us some bleacher seats.  Just for shits and giggles, I looked up the prices of bleacher seats.......$70.00!  Once again, are you fucking serious?  $70.00 to sit on a metal bench down the 3rd base line?  I pretty much threw up in my mouth.  Anyways.....enough of that.  With tickets in hand, we headed on down to Scottsdale.  

We found free parking a few blocks down (the only positive thing I can say about this trip) and made our way up to the stadium.  I like the spot its situated in, but once we walked through the gates, I don't have anything else positive to say.  Here are my beefs..........

1.  Bleacher seating-  They are 100 foot long rows of bleachers.  One way in, one way out.  If you are seated on the end, not near the walkway, have fun shuffling past about 40 people to get to your seat.
2.  Standing room only-  They have a huge hill where you can stand in the outfield to try and watch the game.  Its the smallest and worst area I have ever seen for SRO.  Unless you get there way early, find a piece of land to stake your claim near the actual fence, good luck enjoying trying to watch the game from any decent angle.  The other problem circles back to those bleacher seats.  The bleachers are all up and down 1st and 3rd base, so while walking around the stadium, there are NO sight lines.  It's a horrible set up.  
3.  Concessions-  I understand that things are expensive at the stadiums.  I have no problem shelling out a few bucks for certain things.  I saw some of the prices of things, and once again, threw up in my mouth.  A beer was $11.50!  An Its It Ice Cream Sandwich (Greatest thing ever, btw) was $7.50!  Damn, Gina!  Its its are really really good, and they are my favorite ice cream sandwich ever,  but not $7.50 good!
4.  Bathrooms-  I went into 2 different restrooms and each one had only one urinal and 2 stalls.  I know this is an older stadium, but with only 3 pissing receptacles available, lines were incredibly long just to take a leak.
5.  The Giants fans in general.  I have many friends that are Giants fans and none of them are douchebags, so I know that ALL Giants fans aren't complete tools.  Besides the direct people I know though, most Giants fans I have encountered, are dicks.  They just have an aura about them that I don't like.  Very ""smug"".  Its the same thing I have experienced up at ATT.  Beautiful stadium, but you are surrounded by asshats. Thankfully, we found some SD folks to chill with for a few innings and had a good time.  Northern CA folks are just ""different"".  I much prefer the more laid back, chill vibe from Southern CA and get along better with people from Southern CA (LA and SD). 

Well...that is about it.  I don't ever see myself coming back to this stadium.  It's way too expensive, sight lines are the worst I have ever seen at a ballpark, and the general douchebaggery of Giants fans will keep me away.",2016-03-21 05:41:16

Back to the review:  Hong Kong Asian Diner is a little unassuming place serves nice homey Chinese Cuisine. I usually think it's a good sign when I am the only white person in an ""ethnic"" food restaurant...and both times I have eaten here, that's been the case.

They have 2 menus (like a lot of good Chinese spots do) one for traditional eaters...and one for ""Everyone else"".  I asked if I could take a look at both and was questioned ""Ohh, you LIKE Chinese Food?"" Well, yeah! That's why I'm here.

Anyway, the ladies here are super sweet, funny and attentive. Their food is also really lovely.  

I had the Buddha's feast (from the traditional menu) and the Orange Chicken (yup...the everyone else menu) and I loved both! The vegetables were crisp, tasty and weren't overwhelmed by the light sauce...and the Orange Chicken...drooling...sooo good! They slice it into these strips and flash fry it. NO heavy breading, and the sauce was super sticky, sweet, and tangy.

Washed it all down with an effervescent and cheap (nice, right?) Tsing Tao while being chatted up a few times, since I was dining alone.

My mushroom burger was so tasty! Oh but do beware that the mushroom and cheese are piping hot when it's given to you. They do put a sticker on the outside of the burger warning you that it is going to be HOT.

They offer wonderful farm-to-table food and surprisingly fresh in the thick of hot Phoenix weather. Their style is a little hard to grasp at first especially for newcomers to the establishment, though. Read on!

So when you first walk in, you walk into the bar. There's a sign with menus that you're supposed to pick up from. Sort of like Panera, Paradise Bakery, those kinda places where you order first, then sit down? Yeah, this place does that. Except the menus are in a stand that you pick up individually from, it's not on some big board like at those other places. So that's a little unusual. SOMETIMES there's an employee that hands out the menus, but more often than not there isn't. Again, unusual.

OK, whatever, so you order your food at the counter. I get the ""Good night good cause"" burger which is a combination of ""Angus Beef, Tillamook Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Jalapeños, Hickory BBQ, Sassy Sauce"" as described on their website at the time of this review. It's good, and at the time of this review is $8.50 a burger. Sounds pricey right? Their other burgers are even pricier.

What gets weird for me here is that there's a line to tip if you pay with a card, but since you haven't gotten actual service other than having your order taken, how do you know what tip to give? So I just default to 20% as a minimum out of respect. If the server deserves more after, I don't know if I'm supposed to leave a tip at the table or go up to the counter again? 

Anyway, so then you sit down a table of your choosing. Each table has a number, but nowhere on your receipt is a table number listed, so I think the table numbering is more for some internal business process unique to Hopdoddy that doesn't have much value to the customer. Like I said, unusual.

Unusual stuff aside, let's talk about the food!

The food is fucking fantastic. The ""Good night good cause"" burger is a spicy, salty, savory delicious burger that gets pretty damn messy with meat juices real fast. Not surprisingly, every table at Hopdoddy has self-service paper towels for customers, sort of like at BBQ places.

If you haven't figured out already, Hopdoddy somehow integrates different restaurant styles, like the paper towels at a BBQ place, the self service menus of Panera, showing the bar first thing at you when you walk in etc etc. Somehow, that integration clusterfuck of different ideas works here. So truck on, Hopdoddy, you got something good going on, keep at it.

The beer selection is great, but what really makes this place shine on the drinks side is actually their ""soda"" bar, which is a wide variety of homemade root beers, such as orange root beer, blueberry root beer. This isn't some cheap, shitty Coke multi-touchscreen soda machine, it's old school, almost retro-fitted looking machine (look, we're in central Phoenix, if you're not here for hipster food/drink experiences, you're in the wrong city). Anyway, the soda is just as fantastic as the food, it stands out as something you probably have never had before.

All in all, this is probably one of the few places I am going to miss about Phoenix when I move away to Los Angeles. Just wanted to ensure I got this review in before my departure. For central Phoenicians old and new, this place is worth a trip!",2017-07-21 06:51:54

If not for the overwhelming stench of cigarette smoke that literally left me coughing, smelling like an ash tray, and made my eyes burn this would have been a 5 star review. 

Reasons why I love this bar:
#1 Cheap drinks! $3 PBRs and $4 Vodka Crans.
#2 The concert ""stage"" lets fans get up close and personal with the band. 
#3 The bathrooms are hilarious. They're plastered with vulgarities and nonsense, but they were clean at least (Although there weren't any toilet seat covers...).
#4 They play Cannibal Corpse. C'mon, it doesn't get any cooler than that.

FUN FACT: The Dive Bar was on Bar Rescue! Someone please tell me what episode this is on.

The Dive Bar is located right across from UNLV. If I lived on-campus, you bet your ass I'd be there all the time. 

GOOD TO KNOW: There is no security here. It's every man for himself. There were a few fights that almost broke out, but the crowd did a good job at breaking things up. The mosh pit got kind of crazy. A tiny girl got blind-sighted sitting at a table near the back of the bar, was thrown out of her chair, and ended up getting a concussion. Geez.  

Worth a Return Visit?
I wish Dive Bar was closer! It's a bit of a Trek from my usual hang out spots. I'd always be down to see a concert there, though.

We were just on Ossington on our way to Queen street when i glanced over and saw ""Portuguese Bakery"".  I immediately wondered, do u think they sell Custard tarts.  We went in and they not only sell them, they also serve palmiers, meringues, and many other treats.  Most sheshe bakeries now are so expensive but the old school bakeries keep their prices low.  The meringue was hard but had that soft middle that you can only get in a meringue.  The palmier was either brushed with honey or sugar because it was sweet and flaky.  I dont think i can say enough wonderful things about the Custard tarts.  The pastry was thin, but not brittle, it somehow remained flaky, and it was thick enough to contain the luxurious filling.  All of these items together costs just over 5 dollars, versus going to a Macaron shop and ordering 2 and it costs you the same.

Or our taste buds have moved on? Should have listen to the six year old and gone to Taco Bell! When we first got there, I wanted to order breakfast.

The best part of this meal was the soup, it was a little salty but it was very good. It also came with a piece of corn bread. The ribs were very dry, I had to rip them off the bone, and very tough. And a day later, I am still feeling the effect! The vegi's and fries were good. I was able to get a taste of wife's waffle, again i was not that impressed! Very soggy, even before the syrup was poured is was not crispy, to soft, i just didn't like the texture on it. The girls had chicken fingers, and pancakes. Seem they both liked their meals very much.

Nobody however wanted to leave the hotel, so we decided on shall I say THEY decided on ""stripsteak"" at Mandalay Bay.  I tried hard to talk them out of this as I had eaten here about 2 years ago with 8 people and it was absolutely horrible, but they insisted. With that said I am very happy they talked me out of it as this experience was completely different from our previous visit.

1st off ambiance wise you can't beat the place. Very trendy yet elegant. Service staff spot on. Complimentary Appetizer - Trio of Duck Fat Fries
Each meal is preceded by a complimentary order of the trio of duck fat fries.  The trio includes:

1.  Paprika and mustard fries accompanied with a mustard crème dip
2. Truffle fries accompanied with truffle aïoli dip
3. Rosemary and onion fries accompanied with onion ketchup dip
The Truffle fries great and the best of the 3 but nice touch instead of the regular bread & Butter. 

Onward we go. Glasses of wine ordered as nobody wanted the same thing, and a bit pricey per glass but nice selection. 

3 of us tonight so it was 3 Steaks and two sides I'll keep it simple.

A: KC Bone in NY Strip Charred medium. (Cooked to perfection)Tasty, moist, juicy, a 10 on the steak scale.

B: Bone in Rib Eye Charred Medium (See above Perfection)

C.  Slow poached prime rib perhaps the weakest of the 3 but still very good, not as thick as I would have preferred if I was ordering it.

Sides Truffle Mac & Cheese & Bacon Cream Spinach

Spinach ""GREAT"" simply stated

Truffle Mac & Cheese Great except for one thing, no mention of broccoli in this dish yet it had pieces of it and I hate broccoli. Taste was exceptional aside from the unwanted greens.

No Deserts...  A quick meal with excellent service, super food in great ambiance..  Won a few bucks at the dice table afterwards to pay for this thing....",2011-05-04 18:34:00

Palms Place is a separate building from the actual casino area.. so it's quite a bit of a walk.. and it'll seem even longer if you're wastey-faced. 

But the rooms are so worth that walk. 

When I first walked in I ran around the room with my arms out like an airplane and screaming of joy. I'm so mature, I know. This room  is pretty much like a studio apartment. You have full kitchen sink with a stove top next to it and two refrigerators all packed on the side. When you push a table to the side, you'll find your dishwasher. The cabinets are fully stocked with plates and cups of course. The bathroom offers a large jacuzzi to fit two, and a connected shower that offers a handheld shower head, or the 'raining' shower head option. Or if you're just having a sexy party..turn on both! The jacuzzi somewhat protrudes into the room and is bordered by a frosted glass so the ladies (or fellas) can give a little sexy-time show with their silhouette (lol). None of that for me, I just  threw in the shower gel into the jacuzzi, turned the jets on, and had THE BEST bubble bath in my life!!

The decor is very modern and chic and bed is ultra comfy. Two TVs on the same wall and one small one in the bathroom. The room is spacious enough to throw pre or after parties... probably could fit at least 15 people or so.

My family and I live South and usually frequent the Wesley Chapel location. I stumbled across this location while in Pineville getting my jewelry inspected at Jared's. I pulled up my handy dandy Yelp app as I was in a mood for a Black Bean Taco and this place popped up. I had no clue there was a location in Pineville. 
The parking lot is sorta confusing as the lines at the entry don't appear to be for parking so I headed past the Sprint store to park properly in lines spaces. I walked back to the restaurant and upon entry I Loved the large open floor plan. As I smiled and looked around and headed to the register I had several voiced say ""Welcome"" and there were two registers with two friendly faces ready to take my order. I ended up with a Black Bean Authentico and a Grilled Veggie Americana Taco. I was pleased and extremely STUFFED after having those two tacos. 
I think my super FAV part is the sauce bar and my FAV sauce is The Habenaro :-) 

I didn't write my review until after my second visit and this past Tuesday I had a meeting in the area and decided to grab 1 Taco for a snack. However when I walked in it was TACO Tuesday $1 Authentico Tacos = SCORE so I ended up with 3 tacos 1 Black Bean and 2 Grilled Veggie.
What threw me off is the fact that the tacos were way smaller than my first visit (5days prior) I brought that to the attention of one of the guys just as an inquiry. I was totally cool if it was due to it being Taco Tuesday & the fact that the tacos were only $1. The guy ensured me that the tacos are always the same size, fortunately for me I ALWAYS take pictures so I happily pulled up the photo from 5 days prior to show him and he was shocked and said that was a fluke. All in all when he brought out my 2nd order, as I was still hungry after the 3 small $1 tacos that I had to go back to order two more, he informed me that he added more to replicate my prior visit and ask to take pictures of the picture I had to show his manager to ensure they deliver.

Loved my eyebrows right away since I dye my hair black occasionally my eyebrows looked extremely light compared to my hair.  The next day in the morning I looked in the mirror and my eyebrows looked back to it's original bland barely there look :(.   I guess after showering once, the tint didn't stick to my eyebrows or skin after that.   I was so excited I wouldn't have to put any makeup for a few weeks.

The food has always been good but I've never really been inspired to write a review until now.  We were there last night and we ordered the garlic cheese crostini as an appetizer (so good!).  My aunt had a pizza, my uncle had spaghetti and meatballs, and I had my usual - the mushroom asparagus pasta in a garlic cream sauce (add chicken, leave out the sundried tomatoes - yes, I'm a picky eater, get over it).  My aunt has this problem of never being able to finish her food (I did not inherit this in any way) and she was mentioning something about it to my uncle as the waiter, Alex, was bringing our drinks over.  He overheard her talking about not being able to keep leftovers because we were heading to a movie after dinner.  He said he would wrap up her leftovers and keep them in the fridge at the restaurant for her and she could pick them up after the movie.  I was so impressed that he would do that for her that it bumped my 4-star rating to a 5-star rating.  The food has always been consistently good (unless you ask my husband who doesn't like Italian food... I know, I don't know what's wrong with him either) but that level of service finally inspired me to write a review.  Bottom line, you can't go wrong if you choose to eat here.",2012-07-26 22:58:43

To find the restaurant, you need to walk up stairs to the second level of the plaza (there is also an elevator). I've been to Veggie House twice. The first time I didn't like it so much and I ate very little because the flavor of the food was too meat-like (but maybe that's a compliment to the chef for people who like the flavor of meat - he got it right on). The second time I ate there was much better. I went with friends and was able to try a bit of everything because we ordered a bunch of food to share. I recommend the roti, chicken lettuce wraps, kung pao chicken, and their meatballs in that order. I also found a coupon on groupon so I plan to go back and see if there's anything else I might like.

I was told about this place about a year ago from some korean friends and had been a little skeptical due to its location (sole restaurant in the corner of a business park). I had known that this place was a chain restaurant from South Korea so i still wanted to try it. They had finally opened prior to my trip but had not the chance to go try it. 

Definitely a different atmosphere and design from any other korean bbq place in town. Open ""outside"" street-look decor, ""street-side butcher store"", and drop-down exhaust fan/tubes and gas grills with small chunks of wood charcoal for an extra smoky flavor. MMM LOVE REAL CHARCOAL ! too bad no place does it full charcoal like in Korea. Tables in the middle were built on top of metal canisters which gives it a nice feeling and reminds me of Seo-Seo Galbi in Shinchon, Korea but at leas we dont have to stand here. We had always been a fan of al a carte menu's due to the drastic increase in quality of meats used. We had a party of 6 people. One had been to this location previously and suggested to order a large beef combo with a small pork combo. 

-----------

Hobak Beef Combo - $89.99 Large (for 3-4 people) $54.99 (for 2 people) - Includes Angus Brisket, Angus Boneless Short Ribs OR Angus Rib Eye, Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak OR Hobak Aged Short Ribs, Bean Paste Stew, Steamed Egg, Vegetables, Cheddar Cheese, Rice Pop Ice Cream. 

Hobak Pork Combo - $78.99 Large (for 3-4 people) $45.99 (for 2 people) - Includes Premium Pork Belly, Premium Pork Jowl OR Pork Neck, Grilled Spicy Pork Belly, Bean Paste Stew, Steamed Egg, Vegetables, Cheddar Cheese, Rice Pop Ice Cream

-----------

Brisket was pretty normal but a unique aspect of Hobak is it was served with serving sized balls of vinegar'ed rice and wasabi. Interesting aspect. Can't say i particularly like it but i dont hate it, at least?  Boneless Short Ribs was are amazing and tender. Amazing marbling of fat. Marinated skirt steak was surprisingly tasty. Fairly similar to what was experienced in Korea, with the light marinade but their's still seems heavier than what I had on my trip. Still considerably lighter than most places here though. 

Premium pork belly was nice and tender. Probably a little more than meat but still tasty overall. Same for the pork neck. Grilled Spicy pork belly came in a metal bowl which was different. Same as what was said previously about marinade. Flavorful but not overpowering. 

I have always been a fan of the use of bean paste during KBBQ and bean paste stew but theirs is particularly delicious. Not sure if i was hungry or what not. Flavorful without being overly salty. 

The mentioned ""Vegetables"" was like sliced carrots and abalone mushroom. Some orders coming with some. Would probably consider as a side more than an actual dish. 

Steamed egg was tasty but fairly standard as well. 

Cheddar Cheese was something I had experienced in Korea as well. Our experience was with something called ""Chicken Galbi"" cooked on a round cast iron plate with a ring around. Thick shredded mozzarella was distributed around the ring and melted as the cast iron heated up. Quite yummy. Would definitely prefer mozzarella over cheddar cheese though. 

Last but not last, the rice pop ice cream. red bean, vanilla, and green tea flavors to choose from. Sandwiched between two rice crackers. How do you say no to that? And we all love green tea so it was green tea rice pop all around. Lol 

------------------

Overall. Great experience. Waiters/waitresses cook all the food for you. Similar to what you get in Korea. Much appreciated from myself since i usually do all the cooking. High quality stuff. Not over stuffed like you'd normally be with AYCE but satisfied. Definitely one to recommend to others when asked for a good KBBQ without redirecting to SoCal or DJK (another a la carte establishment). Also, one of our friends told us there are disposable toothbrushes with toothpaste and mouthwash in the bathroom with a tip something similar to ""ladies to not like stinky breath"" or something. Lol Not unless they ate this with you ! XD ! 

Tip tho. If on weekend or holidays, come early. Gets pretty busy.",2016-05-09 18:33:57

The airport's PA announcers play the part too.  The one gentleman sounds as if he just hopped off a plane disguised as a head of lettuce from a third world nation.  His English is so bad that you wonder who in their right mind would allow him to pick up the microphone--and he's been here for over a decade.  They have a woman that's simply annoying...""boarding and deeeeeeeeeeppppppppaaaaaaaaaarrrttuureee,"" trust me, you'll know who she is when you hear her.  This is all mixed together with the ""Johnny Von Voice Over,"" recordings they have patting their own backs and slapping their own booties about how great they've made this airport.

This airport manages to take great concepts and ruin them.  The biggest problem is that they're managed by the City of Cleveland, and not an independent group.  So all of the problems of the city are seen at the airport ten-fold.

Their parking garages, the ones connected to the terminal, they lack any kind of RFID tag, EZ-Pass, FastPass or any other automated payment system.  So, I write the airport website.  The assistant manager for parking operations gives the standard form letter reply...""we'll look into it.""  BS, two years later it's business as usual.  There's further layers of bureaucracy when you look at the broken clock on the wall.  The airport's response is that their contractor for the ""airport's time management system,"" would replace it.  No wonder the place is in disrepair.

They've just recently began ripping out the carpet in C terminal, replacing it with terrazzo flooring.  Now this carpet is covering tile that was originally installed a decade ago.  The airport posted signs that this was an improvement demanded by customers and that they're listening.  Yet, a high level airline official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the mold growing as a result of water damage to the carpet was the real reason for the replacement.

Case Western Reserve University started an ambitious project to offer free-WiFi at the airport...but most of the time it never works.  Passengers routinely complain that they can't connect in some of the most common gate areas, frustrating them and making it worse than if they just offered nothing in the first place.


For decades CLE's B terminal had a fantastic observation deck just above what are now the Southwest Airlines gates.   This area offered a wonderful indoor/outdoor observation area of the entire field.  By far it was the best in the nation.  Yet, after 9/11 the airport and security bureaucrats took their mission too far and closed off this airport gem to the public.  Further, airports of similar size continue to operate their observation decks.  MSP for example has a wonderful D terminal deck that's still open to the public.  The sad part is that CLE could easily plexiglass or fence in the outdoor area similar to the Empire State Building or Top of The Rock, in addition to re-opening the indoor observation area.

Perhaps one of the worst aspects of traveling through CLE is the wild variations in temperature throughout the concourses.  They keep it hot all of the time.  In winter it's horrible as passengers are traveling carrying coats and jackets.  In summer it's horrible because the outside temperature keeps the place boiling.  It doesn't help that C terminal has skylights that give a greenhouse atmosphere.

The food offerings at this airport are average at best.  There was one local sandwich and coffee shop that airport management drove away.  Replacing them with nasty chain food.  There's one place in the entire building to get a Coke.  Hudson News used to sell an alternative to Aquafina water at $3 a bottle, but all of their employees would try to downsell you to the $2 bottled water--and now they don't even offer the $3 water spring water anymore...they only sell the bottled tap water.  Petty, I know, but it's one of many things that add up to grade this place with one ""Methinks not,"" star.",2011-07-08 14:30:38

They had my car for 2 hours, and for 6 windows that was awesome. 
The application was flawless. Not a bubble or scratch.

The odd thing is that there's no silverware. The food is served on a bigger-than-the-plate tortilla sort of bread. The object is to tear off pieces and scoop up the food. It's interesting, but again, no more different than eating with chopsticks.

With the Meskerem combo (a meat-oriented plate, but they have a veggie combo too), I had the opportunity to try a few different tastes. All of them were full of spices and vegetables that made for some great textures and flavors. I enjoyed it thoroughly and left stuffed.

They do have a limited (and rather inexpensive) beer selection. The usual domestics and imports available anywhere for $2.50 or $3.00. The water glasses were also kept filled.

The shrimp tempura are coated with panko instead of just batter, so very crispy and crunchy, shrimps were also very big too.

I know people have been raving about the Porchetta ($9.50), but I thought the Smoked Turkey Club ($10) was better. Each sandwich comes with half a pickle, and these babies are done just right with a crisp crunch and a slight dill flavor. I personally believe you should alternate bites of sandwich with bites of pickle mmm. I'd say the sandwiches are about 6-7 inches in length with a decent amount of fillings, but I'd probably recommend rounding out the meal with a side of soup or one of their salads. The Tomato Bisque ($4) with blue cheese croutons was smooth and tasty. The Kale Caesar ($5.50) is simple and satisfying especially if you get it with the buttermilk parmesan dressing. They also sell Graham Pretzel Fudge Bars ($3) if you're craving a dessert. 

There was ample free street parking when I went, and once inside you're greeted by a friendly lady working the counter. Here she'll tell you how they try to get as many ingredients locally as they can, and they make as much as they can in-house. I'm talking the bread, dressings, soups, etc. Always love to hear/see/taste that! 

I'd definitely try this place out again. My only slight issue is that $15 for a sandwich and side seems a little pricey. Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty good meal, but no large portions nor super exceptional ingredients to warrant the price in my opinion. For $10 you can get 3 tacos and a side at Bomba, or a fried chicken dinner at Chow Chow, and for $12 you can get a burger and fries at Jammy Buggars. I think to make Herb n' Twine more of a regular stop than a once in a while treat, they'd need to throw in some meal deal specials or buy one get one half off coupons. (Don't roll your eyes at me, I'm a financial analyst by trade, I can't help it!)

You can take the class either online or in person, but I opted to go in person in case I had any pre-test questions.

It's about a three hour class, and the instructor realizes that it's a long course, so he made sure to pepper the discussion with casual humor, and actually made a lot of the facts and dos/don'ts interesting.  I never realized how much precaution and observation goes into pouring/serving drinks.  It's definitely changed my outlook on the whole bar process.

The test is easy... as long as you pay attention in class.  The instructor makes it pretty clear what you'll need to pay attention to, so as long as you watch the videos, listen, and ask questions, you'll make it through.

Sure, I was a little nervous, but the information is concise, and the instructor was friendly, so at the end of the day, I aced the test, and am now a card carrying TAM member.  

When the time comes that you find a job that you will need these skills, the class is manageable and affordable.  My only real issue is that I'm not the best early riser, and when choosing the first morning class and then being required to study for anything that early....

It's a little farther out than where i live because the other boba place i go to is literally 3 minutes from my house BUT they don't have fried popcorn chicken and close earlier too. This place opens later and has yummy crispy spicy Taiwanese popcorn chicken!! omg! so tasty! It's a 10 minute drive for me but not too far. 

So let's talk about their boba drinks. The bobas are good... their large drinks are huge. I usually get one of their green tea drinks with boba and red beans made 30% sweet. tastes delish! price is decent I supppose. they have a stamp card thing too so be sure to ask for one when you pay. 

The decor is cool I suppose. I definitely think a GUY decorated this place cause there's alot of marvel pictures on the wall along with other stuff. plus they have these Asian toys at the front that looks like guys like. they also have some sort of bitcoin thing or machine at the front too. the only thing girlie they did is recently added character pillows on the sofa. they have plenty of games to play with and I've seen some played it. 

the people that work there are nice and always greet you as you come and go. they are helpful and always make sure your drink is done right or they will fix it for you. 

this place is open late towards the end of the week.

My exchange with Nathalie gave me confidence before even walking through their door for a simple reason that most nail salons get wrong. I requested an appointment time of 6:15 but was advised that they were booked and I could only be seen at 6:45. For every girl out there who's sat around waiting due to over booking / walk ins, you know how rare it is to find a salon who takes the conscious decision to not overbook. 

I was seated within 5 minutes of my appointment time and taken care of shortly after. I liked that the staff had name tags, not only because you could easily remember who your new favorites are, but also so that you can refer to them by name when speaking. On that note, I would like to commend the managers/owners for making the effort of referring to all their clients by name throughout their stay. Even as a newcomer I was greeted using my name, as was done when they passed by during my manicure and asked how it was coming along. Even when paying and leaving I was referred to by name and asked to show my nails. Funny how such a small effort can have such a big impact on your experience.

There were 2 slight imperfections in my french manicure but they were barely visible line issues that I didn't even notice until after I had left and my nails are shorter and often difficult to work with. My technician could have been a little gentler when buffing but again that is a personal comment as it was only a problem due to my terribly torn up cuticles. Overall I was very happy with my nails and the price was right on the money. This will definitely be my go to nail salon moving forward.

Something to keep in mind is that this is a physically smaller location with a large number of seats/stations. Although you are not too cramped this wouldn't be the most serene location if you're looking for a more ""spa"" experience. I do personally get somewhat bothered by technicians who will speak in another language among themselves as I have seen before that it can often be a catty exchange about people they don't think can understand (such as in Michelle's review) however I wish you luck finding anywhere in Montreal where that isn't the case.

We had a reservation and were led through a busy, brightly neon-lighted bar and dancing area, to an empty dining room.  We were told that the kitchen had last-call at 10:45pm and ordered as quickly as we could!

SERVICE:
Our waitress was very understanding and patient with such a large group. I was on a 3-week vegetarian fast and had questions about the oil they use to fry the french fries. When I asked, she answered, ""I think regular olive oil?"" but didn't really bother to check with the kitchen, which I wish she tried harder to accommodate. But other than that, she was pretty polite and quick with service, as well as checking on us throughout our meal.


FOOD:
I requested the waitress to pick a drink that she recommended and she brought me the Green Iguana ($9) which was SO GOOD! It tasted like blue Jello but would be potent as their advertised ""Kahuna-fied"" sized drinks =)
In addition to that, my boyfriend and I ordered:

Big Island Salad ($13), was alright. The dressing was fruity-tangy and the salad had large amounts of strawberries, mandarin oranges coconut, and pineapples. It was supposed to have mozzarella and provolone to balance the flavors. There was not much of either but I love fruit so it was satisfying for me.

Kahuna BBQ Chicken ($10), my boyfriend loved that it had BBQ chicken, ham and cheese inside and I tried his french fries which were really very good and thin and crispy. I could've ate a bowlful of their fries. Really good.

& some other Kahuna-fied purple drink ($25), which was good but not as great as the Green Iguana.

Our bill came out to almost $400, with a $62 gratuity included. Not at all bad for a location on the Strip and with a meal for 14.

People in our party also bought lei's in order to be able to get the BOGO margaritas, beer and coladas.

Atria's is a decent American Restaurant with plenty of space and parking. They're open throughout most of the day so it's convenient whenever you're hungry. Portion sizes are huge and reasonably priced. I got the salmon salad with strawberries with dressing on the side and it was what you'd expect a salmon salad to be.  

I tried the ribs which are definitely not their specialty. I would recommend sticking to more basic options. The nachos appetizer was quite good but also quite bad for arteries.

Food was pretty poor compared to the other Mark McEwan restaurants to which I've been -- Bymark and North 44. I had a strip steak and a starter I can't remember. I do remember the meat was great but the steak had absolutely zero char on it. Not sure how that happens unless they did it sous-vide, but why would you cook a blue steak sous-vide instead of searing it in a pan for 3 minutes? I make better steak at home.

Fries are great, though.

It seems like I got a bit ahead of myself on how good this might actually be. This isn't the super sandwich shop I was hoping for. It's more the Quiznos to Jimmy John's Subway. The comparison between JJ's and Potbelly is accurate as I feel they both want to present themselves as a more gourmet option to the Subway's and Silver Mines of the world, but really a just a new option on about the same level.

I had the italian sandwich here and while the meats are pretty tasty I didn't think there was much on their and it seemed greasy. The greasy feel was compounded by the fact that when I passed on mayo and mustard and opted for oil I got a sub drenched in it. I think with less oil the flavors of the meats would have come out more. I think the size of the sandwich was rather small as it was comparable in length to a Subway 6"" just wider and more bread. I do have to say the bread was quite good.

I am willing to go back and give potbelly a second chance as the price was reasonable enough that it is worth another shot. Maybe something else will be a more favorable sub.",2013-11-24 16:22:04

sg7uasRDm_pCYUCjZF7mbg,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,3,5,6,4,"Great place for a hearty breakfast!  3 1/2 stars...nearly a 4!

This Egg Works is in the middle of blink-at-the-roundabout and you'll miss it part of Summerlin!  It's like a needle in a haystack!  But finding this popular breakfast locale was worth it!

Came here with the fam on a Sunday of all days and even in the upper boonies the place was crowded.  Like super crowded!  But thankfully even though many of us had to wait outside, it didn't take Egg Works more than 15 minutes to seat us.  And we got a lovely table on the outside Richie Rich Summerlin air!  Ahhhhhh....breathe in the wealth!  And the occasional fumes of Ferrari's passing by.

It's easy to see why this Egg Works is so busy.  It's basically the only one in this part of town.  Plus it caters heavily to the breakfast/brunch crowd.  Plus, apparently folks actually like the food!  It's got a lot going for it.

Upon being seated we were promptly helped by the wait staff.  Our order:

ME
-Original Breakfast Burrito ($9.95) - Flour tortilla stuffed with 4 eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers, Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, cheddar & jack cheese.  Waiter also suggested I add avocado in my burrito (a $2.50 upcharge!!).  Comes with a side of more Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes & Habla Diablo salsa.

WIFEY
-Santa Cruz Skillet ($10.99) - bottoms layer of Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, topped with seasoned chicken breast, chorizo, green chilies, onions, and home made Santa Cruz sauce (whatever it really is I don't know).  Topped with a dollop of sour cream, melted cheese & 2 eggs over easy.  Also comes with your choice of toast of banana nut muffin (she chose muffin).

KID
-Waffle Works ($9.80) - waffle served with 2 eggs any style (over easy), with choice of ham, bacon, or sausage.

Plus with check in on Yelp we got a complimentary banana nut muffin to try!

Food was good but it did take a bit of extra time to come out possibly because we were either on the outside patio or because it was just slammed at Egg Works that day.  

My breakfast burrito was definitely hearty, it was huge with the addition of that expensive avocado!  I was only able to eat half, I had to take the other half home for later.  Flavors in the burrito were yummy, fresh scrambled eggs, good quality bacon bits, fresh veggies, spicy potatoes, and more than enough cheese throughout.  Topped with some of their Habla Diablo salsa & house hot sauces this breakfast burrito was pretty top notch!  The side of extra Habla Diablo potatoes are really tasty, seasoned with a nice kick & cooked crunchy on the outside but still fluffy on the inside.  

Wifey liked her Santa Cruz skillet very much.  Chicken was grilled but not dry, chorizo & that Santa Cruz sauce gave the dish some extra flavor and a punch of heat.  All that with egg yolk running down?  Oh yeah, yum city baby!  

Kid thought the Waffle Works plate was OK.  It really wasn't anything special to write home about, pretty par for the course.  The waffle was a bit cold, and tasted like a basic waffle to her.  It was just alright, but they forgot butter!  So her first bite or 2 were dry.  Bacon & eggs weren't anything special, just bacon & eggs.

We were a bit disappointed with our banana nut muffins though.  I thought they would be brought warm to our table but they were cold.  They could have used a pat of butter as well since they were on the dry side.  So the muffin was somewhat forgettable.

One thing that may bother the value-conscious is the prices here at Egg Works.  For breakfast they be on the high side!  To get a decent meal will cost you near $10 per not including any drinks.  And if you upgrade your burrito like I did with avocado, it will set you back over  $12 not including tax!  But keep an eye out on Groupon, they do promotions for this place often.

With the varied menu at the Egg Works we'll probably be back again.  They do Hawaiian type food here too, get a Loco Moco or some SPAM & Portuguese sausage for breakfast!

We'll be back!  If we don't get lost in a roundabout first.",2015-10-28 19:59:58

The butter poached scallops come in a trio and are so rich, buttery, with salty sea goodness.   Be sure to get the clam chowder as well.

As for entrees, I typically go for the bone in filet mignon.  Just be sure to pick up the bone and go K9 on it.....leave your manners at home.  The juices and meat is the best on the bone.

Le menu est truffé de mixtes audacieux d'ingrédients (les fruits ont une prédominance) qui à notre grande surprise, créent des découvertes gustatives aussi délicieuses que farfelues... 

Le choix de sandwich est imposant et vous laissera pantois. La tartinade est l'atout. L'Aurore Boréal, par exemple, est un sandwich dans lequel l'on y retrouve une tartinade de fromage à la crème aux olives épicées, saupoudrée de pacanes rôties, et l'on peut y ajouter du jambon... Tout simplement jouissif. Autre exemple :  la Tomate meurtrière comprend une tartinade de fromage à la crème aux tomates séchées, basilic et ail, garni de tranches de tomates fraîches. Suffisant pour ouvrir l'appétit. Servies par un personnel jovial et à l'aise, les assiettes sont énormes, toujours accompagnées de légumes et fruits frais, et peuvent être combinées à la soupe du jour. Rien de plus réconfortant en hiver... Desserts gourmands, lait fouetté, jus de fruits, légumes, épices...cet endroit veut nous faire plaisir.

Le Santropol a le mérite d'être parmi les premiers commerces à avoir introduit du café bio-équitable sur l'île de Montréal. La torréfaction maison est variée et de qualité. Les caféïnomanes en trouveront pour leur compte; du café sous toutes ses formes. L'on peut même en acheter sur place.

L'espresso est légèrement chocolaté, et dégage une odeur grillée.

Avis aux lecteurs sereins : salle de lecture et somptueux jardin-terrasse, très prisé durant l'été et le début de l'automne.

I never had a cloud cap before. I was hoping the cashier would explain what it was when I said I never had it, instead of saying it's good.. or he could've at least asked if it was my first time here.. or if I needed help selecting a drink..

I use GrubHub frequently while traveling because I am often too lazy to go out. Ordering from Thai Hana is a perfect example of how GrubHub should work.

GrubHub usually takes a while, so I placed an order while shopping at 6:50PM. The promised time for arrival was about 8PM. This was a little longer than I expected, but that's ok - better than nothing. In the comments, I wrote, ""Will not be at hotel until 7:45PM."" 

GrubHub sent updates accordingly - when the order went to the kitchen, an updated time when the driver was supposed to arrive (between 7:50 and 8PM), etc. The driver arrived at my room precisely at 7:56PM. He even called beforehand to ensure I was at the hotel in my room, since he actually read my comment. I was impressed.

I ordered Tom Yum Shrimp soup ($3.95), Crispy Rolls ($4.95), and Pad Thai ($11.95). Add tax ($1.56), a delivery charge ($1.50), and tip ($3.58), and the total was $27.49. That's not bad, considering I'm ordering from a real restaurant!

The soup was ok. It had a lot of lemongrass and could've used more spice. The crispy rolls were good, and so was the Pad Thai. I can't complain about either of the latter two items, which is rare for me. They both had the right taste, and the portion size was appropriate (see picture).

They also didn't over compensate with fried wonton chips and a ton soy sauce in the to-go bag.

We decided to come here on Valentine's Day. Since this was our first time, we didn't know that we had to take another set of elevators from the parking garage up. Luckily we asked someone fairly quickly and we were able to find this place. I was pretty impressed with the decor when we walked in.

I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't know who Thomas Keller was except for the fact that he had a Bouchon in Napa Valley too. We decided to start with Rillettes aux Deux Saumons. Smoked salmon and fresh salmon in a cute lil jar to spread on crunchy bread. This was delicious and a good way to start off our meal. After going back and forth between the special and the trout, I decided to go with the trout (Truite Grenobloise). It normally comes with the head attached, but I requested for the head to not be there. I wasn't a big fan of the toasted brioche, but overall the fish was tender, moist and just a tad bit too buttery for my liking. The fiancé ordered the Gigot d'Agneau (lamb with lamb tongue). His lamb was a overcooked, which made it a lil tougher to eat. The tongue you couldn't even tell it was in the sauce, but it comes with beans and we are both not a huge fan of beans. For a side dish, we ordered the Mac and Cheese which was nothing special.

Overall, I thought our bill was fairly reasonable, less than 150 bucks for 2 drinks, an appetizer, two entrees and a side dish, but I wish the food was better. Maybe we will come some other time and try other dishes....",2011-02-23 17:11:06

I've previously eaten here and found the deli to be exactly as described; a deli.  Now, this would be fine if it were located in an older, more run-down resort, however, this is the M.  I expected a little more the first time I ate and the same after this past experience.  

Basically, my major reservations about the Vig are:

1. No waiters - From an employment standpoint I feel this to be a way to tighten up the cost of labor.  If you want a counter order deli, put in a Capriottis.

2. There is no comparison between the Vig & Carnegie in Mirage.  The food, service, and portions are all justified in the price.  This brings on #3

3.  For the price, the M resort can do so much better; and does.  Almost every restaurant in the M, including the The Red Cafe is a better overall choice IMHO.  

Finally, I would like to summarize my review by saying that although, the Vig is a small blemish to the M resort on most key points.  The food is flavorful and quick.  If your at the sports book or playing around the resort and need a quick bite, you can do worse in the city.",2010-03-30 01:29:40

And, since we were only a group of 4, we had to wait about 10 minutes until another party of 3 was seated with us. Next time, I will be sure to bring 8 so we can all sit with people we know.

The waitress was very attentive, getting our drinks and re-fills quickly. We were served a soup and salad before the chef came over to prepare our dinner entrees. In my opinion, I wasn't a fan of either the soup or salad. The soup flavor was bland to me and the salad dressing was sour tasting. The chef came over, introduced himself and began cooking our food. He was pretty quiet, which surprised me because I thought the chefs were supposed to put on more of a show. Oh well, he was nice enough.

For such an expensive restaurant, you would think the bathrooms would be really nice and attended for...I literally walked in and two of the three stalls were backed up. And, on top of that, there was a mushroom floating in one of the toilets! EWW! If I didn't have to go so bad, I would have held it. Not okay!

When I returned to my seat, the chef cooked our meals and a few ""appetizers"" including hibachi shrimp and cooked veggies of mushrooms, zucchini and onions. We also ordered chicken fried rice, which was to die for! I really enjoyed watching the chef prepare everything...in my opinion the real reason to go here. For our entree, we ordered filet and scallops. We asked for the filet to be cooked medium rare and it was way overcooked! I would say more well done if anything. I also found that the meat was really under seasoned...but they do provide a couple sauces to go with the meals. They do give a lot of food to you....and after dinner, we got green tea and ice cream. I'm glad I shared everything because it really was a lot of food! 

All in all, this place was fun. There were a lot of birthdays going on and this would be a place I would return to have a celebration or just a fun night out with a lot of people. But, I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be. Plus, the price is steep so not somewhere I can go often. So, I would return but it's not going on my top 10 favorite restaurants list.",2013-03-03 18:39:17

The online appointment process is ridiculous and not even possible if you have dial-up. In the wintertime you need to make an appointment a couple of weeks before your blood draw if you want a morning appointment. There is no way to call in for an appointment.

The friends enjoyed their Tikka Masala - spiced well and had some heat to it! The grilled cheese & bisque was also very good! The bisque was very heavy, so even though the dish didn't look huge, I was pretty stuffed!

For dessert, the two friends got the cheesecake and bread pudding. Cheesecake came wrapped in a puff pastry thing (we nicknamed it ""The Cheesecake Poof"") and a side of fruit puree. The cheesecake was super soft and delicious and went really well with the puff pasty! The bread pudding was very dense and well spiced! The garnishes of cranberries, raisins, and dates were also a nice touch. 

Experience was very good overall! Service was relatively quick and very friendly. The food didn't blow me away but was definitely enjoyable, and I'd be interested in visiting again to try more dishes.

Surroundings. Definitely this place has not been updated whatsoever. Chairs are ripping and cut into my thighs. So uncomfortable.  I tried looking for any other chair that was not ripped and there were none. Horrible. The place was like a giant food court/cafeteria. Sitting right next to strangers is not my idea of romance. Luckily I made a reservation and we got a table by the window away from the masses. *one star off 5*

Service. Beyond horrible. The dozy waitress did ABSOLUTELY nothing for us. We cleaned off our own table TWICE and TWICE moved dirty plates to the next without ONCE her noticing and clearing it. She refilled our water once never to return. *another star off 5*

Food. Got seated and went to get the salads etc then came back and waited around 15 minutes when our food was cold to even get the meat man by!! I had to get up and threaten to leave and THEN the HOSTESS who seated us got the ball rolling. We got no cornbread at our table. From reading previous reviews, we were supposed to have cornbread. Ok now, so the meat was tasty. Well not the parmesan chicken, that was horrific. We only got offered about 7 of the supposed 16 meats. All of that filet mignon wrapped with bacon was nowhere to be found, nor shrimps, nor sausage or any of the rest of the good stuff. Instead they kept coming around with the EXACT SAME STUFF. Why are you charging full price for half the offerings?? Nonetheless my husband stuffed himself and I was full and that makes me happy. *3rd star off 5*

I left a $4 tip and that was only because I gave $100 bill and a $5. Total was 101. If it would have been 100 I would have left 100. The person who actually deserved a tip was Carlos the meat guy. He was fantastic. Thanks Carlos.

Going through the mall is no big deal except for the constant haranguing from the vendors with the carts in the mall.  That I find exhausting and apparently, it's a problem as there is a stern warning about soliciting as you enter the hotel.

Check in was nice and Deborah from Michigan was a great help.  Told us the ins and outs of a few things and how to sign into the free wi-fi.

Then the elevators to the rooms.  This is a nice feature.  They have a 24/7 attendant that makes sure you belong in the elevators before allowing you to enter them.  Keeps the security and other hijinks to a minimum.

The room was beautiful.  We selected the studio room.  It was just right.  Kitchenette with toaster, microwave, fridge, and dishwasher.  Ice machines on every third floor (there wasn't an exact science to that but we finally found one).

A small desk, a couch, table, flat screen and bed.  Very comfy bed but with one detractor.  They have a built in headboard assembly very nice but it doesn't allow access to the outlets near the bed.  Not a huge deal to me or most, however, the YS has a C Pap machine and no way to plug it in.  After much looking around we found a plug in that he could reach by putting the machine on the floor and stretching the cord across the walkway (can you say trip hazard).  Anyway, we made it through (I tripped twice in the night).  They would have had a five star if not for that.

Their pool was open 8a to 6p.  It didn't get a ton of use because we were there in mid December and while sometimes it's warm there it wasn't on this trip.  The hot tub was nice and we checked that out.  They do have a lifeguard on duty as well as someone to check your room card and hand out towels as you enter.  They check your bag too, for glass, etc.

We walked down to the guest computer room and laundry on the 2nd Floor nice.  We were going to go do a load of laundry but didn't have enough wash to warrant it.  Most of the one and two bedrooms have their own laundry but this is nice if you have the studio and wanted to do wash.

They have a computer or two for your use just off of the laundry room.  Makes it handy if you need to check in on the aircraft or look at email.  

The exercise room was a thing of beauty.  It has treadmills, ellipticals, weights, bikes, and mats for floor work.  Very good size and things are in working order.  I would recommend.  It's 24 / 7 so anytime is a good time to work out.

Loved the kitchenette in the room.  We went to the grocery and bought a blender and supplies so I made smoothies every day.  (There is a Jamba Juice in the mall if you want too).  Great way to stay on track while you are out of town.

This location is super busy but the line moves fast. You walk up to the cashier, place your order, pay, and then are called up by order number in a little while. They ask what toppings you want on your meal item. All of the toppings are laid out nicely in front of you and you can see what is going on your food. Everything looked/tasted super fresh.

Nice to see they have a few veggie options. I opted for a veggie burrito the last time I was there and really enjoyed it. Note, those who aren't big eaters, I would for sure recommend getting the small size of whatever you order unless you want leftovers - their portions are huge!

You can always get one of their standards blends (I recommend the Santa Fe if you like spicy, tex-mex salads). 

The only reason I rate Chopt 4 Stars is that I do feel like it can be pricey. I love avocado, which is an extra $2! The Santa Fe, sans fried onions + avocado, runs around $11. The nice thing is that it does last about 1.5-2 meals!

We got the pork and beef combo small combo which came with bulgogi, pork cheek, belly, and short rib.  We came for lunch so had no problem getting a seat.  The banchan during the meal came with the typical offerings, and also included either soybean, spicy tofu, or kimchi soup.  We also got a complimentary refill on a few banchan which is nice.  And not to mention a large shaved ice for dessert.  The menu includes many meat combos all priced around the $60-90 range depending on party size.  But in my opinion, the small can serve 3 comfortably.  They also have soju for $12.75 (a little steep in my opinion), but necessary for all Korean BBQ meals.  In summary, the short rib was fantastic and a must get at 8 oz.  The portions were good and the banchan offered a few nice additions like bean sprouts and kimchi cake that you might not typically see at other BBQ joints.  Downside was the sauces weren't very spicy and the other meats were tasty but nothing crazy.  If I came back, I think I might just order the prime cuts and eat from there, because that short rib was seriously fantastic.",2017-10-05 22:40:30

With that being said, the waffles are absolutely delicious.  I had a naked one, which obviously has nothing on it, and it was so very tasty.  I also tried the cinnamon roll waffle which was way too good.  To me, the waffles seem more like a dessert than breakfast though.

The cookies did have a bunch of stuff jammed in there including caramel, pretzels, chocolate and nuts too I think. The second cookie still tasted fresh the second day and even melted well after 12 seconds in the microwave. Cookies only $1.85 each, so a good deal for a good treat.

As for the food, we got the 5-course tasting menu with the chestnut dumpling-truffle add on. I really wanted to try the white truffle risotto but it was just too pricey at $80 each person and I think at least 2 people at the table had to order it. Each course was tiny but tasted light and delicate. The portion sizes left me craving for more... We got scallops, mackerel(?), squid and a lobster/chicken dish. The chestnut dumplings with truffles were really nothing special and I don't recommend getting them. We also ordered 2 cheeses before dessert: a camembert and gouda and both were delicious. The desserts were probably the strongest-tasting part of the meal... we got a tangy citrus buffalo milk froyo (?) and a slice of rum cake to share that was realllyy heavy on the rum flavour.

So, when she found Island Malaysian Cuisine in Las Vegas, it was on our Must Eat List. We found this restaurant in Chinatown, Las Vegas. it was cool because this ""Strip"" had a long row of Chinese style architecture. We noticed that there were a lot of foot massage places and made note of it for our next trip to Las Vegas.

The restaurant was dark and had an island theme. We were greeted and given our menus. We were offered the pictorial menu as well which was super helpful. I like looking at my food. I thought the initiative my server showed was great.

My daughter was craving char kway teow or stir fried thick rice noodles. We also ordered the Nasi Lemak as well. The Nasi Lemak came first. We found that the rice was not strongly flavored with coconut milk. The chicken curry had an nice kwah or sauce which we enjoyed. The chicken was a little overcooked. The sambal ikan bilis or chili fish was not crunchy but chewy. It had a nice flavor, but the texture was off. We enjoyed the hard boiled egg and cucumber that went with it. It was okay (3/5) 

The char kway teow or fried noodles were excellent. Nice wok hei caramelization! The flavors screamed home to us! We ate every bite. The fried egg inside was lovely. The chicken was tasty. They also give a generous amount of bean sprouts which we adored (5/5).

Its not huge. Its well but not over flowingly stocked. They use mostly own brand (Say 80% own, 20% other brands.) There are some things i have not seen in other stores. 

Lemme elaborate a bit. This is really a niche store. It will not please people who love to go to supermarket and brow isles and pick up useless junk. This store is small. Imagine maybe three 7/11 stores together and you will get its size. They have most of the thing normal person would need, but probably do not have odd stuff large supermarkets have. Like, they would have 5-6 kinds of their own pasta sauce, 2 kinds of other brands and 2 kinds other brand. That is it. There would be no 32 varieties by 12 different brands. 

Because they mainly sell their own brand its possible to find some unusual items. I picked up a jar of Cuban Bean Dip. Never seen it before and have no idea what it would be, but what the hell!!! They also had some Equadorian beer i have not come across before. Not their own brand but cool.

Cool thing i liked - No Member card nor sale (At the moment anyhow). Price you see is price you get, no gimmicks, no games.

It was really crazy there today as its 1st day. But i suppose crowds will die down and it will be pretty pleasant place to shop once you learn their inventory.

It's a small store with very limited seating, so many people had to do takeout or eat awkwardly. I liked the decor though and it had a modern industrial fee to it. 

We luckily snagged a table and we got ourselves a chocolate whiskey which was part of the flavor of the month menu. I LOVED it. You could really taste the whiskey and everything and I'm not a huge ice cream person, but this ice cream made me crave it and ask my SO to go again another time. The texture is different and tasty. 

My only negatives about the experience was the wait time, which was like 20 minutes (and it wasn't packed) and the service was to be desired. It was two Chinese dudes that didn't give a f, but they were working really hard to push out orders. When they called your ice cream out, he wouldn't wait for the ""aha"" moment when he put the nitrogen in, which hurts the experience of the customer because in the moment its kind of rude, and they also weren't able to film it and put it on social media, which is literally free publicity. Those are my only issues.

While I was there I figured I would pick up my foundation at Sephora as well. They were out so I moseyed on over to the Smashbox counter at Nordstrom... they were out, too. Then come to find out apparently Smashbox got new colors so they aren't even making mine anymore?? Just my luck. SO the girl that is helping me proceeds to tell me that I should just go with 2.25 instead of 2.3 because it's so close I won't even be able to tell. I was hesitant, but I'm no makeup guru so I trusted her judgement, thinking it will just be a little bit lighter of a shade. Wrong! As soon as I opened the box later that day I could tell that the undertones were pink, which is horrible for my yellow undertone. I decided to give it a try since I was completely out of mine, and alas I ended up looking like an oompa loompa the whole next day. FUN! If you go online to look at the color swatches of the two next to each other you can CLEARLY see the difference so I have NO idea why she would have recommended that shade to me over the 2.2.

The interior is quite dark, cramped and feels a bit seedy. I guess lack of interior updates is how they keep their prices down.

Mine didn't show up, so I asked after it when my friends were mostly done their food. There was a blank look on the waitress's face, so I was pretty sure she didn't put my order in. She said she'd go check on it. She came back to tell me they were making it. I asked her if they just started. She said yes. I told her to cancel my order. She gave me a dirty look. Why would I want to wait for my food if my friends are done eating and they're the ones that messed up? When she brought the bill over for my friends, she finally apologized. Not cool at all.

That being said, my two visits after that one were alright. The desserts look like the pictures. Very much so. They're also not expensive. The durian is fresh. The ginger boiled milk has a strong ginger smell. The matcha mein mein is not super strong on the matcha, but it's alright, and it's not too sweet. The pomelo with mango sweet soup and coconut noodles is interesting. It's not the best mango pomelo sweet soup I've had, but it's pretty good. The portions are also quite good for price.

The arena itself is OK.  I had seats in the second section from the stage in the 5th row off the stage.  They were good seats.  I've also been here when I was at the turn in the horseshoe of seating and the seats were painful to get in and out of.  In addition, I needed the Hubble Telescope to see the performers.

The ushers were helpful, Metro was accommodating with approving my camera (the screener at the metal detectors thought it needed special attention).  One complaint, if TM and AXS are going to encourage electronic tickets on smartphones, have more than one line where your entry can be scanned.  It's absurd to move all of us who are not wasting paper to go to one line to get in.  Even the Las Vegas Academy High School can scan smartphone and paper. 

The arena is always clean--well to start the evening.  Getting out is now a lot easier after the near stampede following one of the large prize fights.  Walk up to the plaza level, go through one of the doors that says exit to stairwell, and down the steps and outside and you're close to the garage.

It was my first time at the show - something that I have always wanted to go, but could never bring myself to not only buy admission tickets but on top of that, buy sample tickets for another $20. I got this treat, via a friend for free admission, so didn't have any qualms about it. 

As you walk in, you get a nice looking wine glass for all your sampling. You can purchase a minimum of $20 of sampling tickets (each $1) for your samples of wine, beer and food. There were some free things, but most cost about 1-3 tickets. Having $20 was enough for my husband and I. 

About 70% of the show are wine vendors, some from wineries which was nice to talk to them about the wine, and what makes it special. Some just seems to be sponsored by LCBO ""Wines from Around the World"". If you love wine, or want to learn more, try different wnes at one sitting - this is the place to be. There were also some some guided wine tastings for 5 tickets per person. There were also 2 Sake stations, and would be cool to have a guided tasting of sake.

I was also very interested in learning more about cheese, but there was only a handful of vendors. This year, you can also participate in a guided cheese tasting (free) but get there on time to get your spot. 

Highly encouraged to sit in on some of the food instruction shows. Learnt a lot about cooking lobster from Matt Pettit (Rock Lobster fame) and got some free beer and lobster rolls at the same time. I wish there were more of these shows. 

As I mentioned before, I felt the Expo was more about the alcohol. The food vendors consisted of local toronto restaurants which I think most foodies in TO would have been to (like Guu, Rock Lobster, Brassaii etc). There were also some other smaller local places. I wish there were more food vendors of products, like jams, honey etc Simliar to what I see at the One of Kind Show. 

The other very cool thing was the Buick Tasting table at the back of the show.  A long communal table with never ending Guacamole + Pomegrante dip, and Double Smoked Oysters with Lemon and Chives came out for a taste (of unexpected flavours).

 Summerlin Residents Can Come Here For ALL Of Your Wisdom Teeth & Extraction Needs! :)

Office manager Ana reassured me how great Dr. Martin was which helped ease my mind of any concerns I had based on Yelp reviews being not so favorable in addition to deviating away from our normal doctor. After all ,this is my family and their health and well being is my chief concern. Ana was so wonderful and advised me that she would help us with anything that we may need along the way.  Joseph P. was right, the poor reviews were NOT about the surgery itself. 

Estella booked my husband for the first available appointment (Aug.5,2016) after he experienced horrible pain from a cracked molar down to the gum!! We decided to also have his other 2 wisdom teeth extracted as well. She was very friendly and nice throughout the whole ordeal. Her understanding and compassion must be recognized because it was so greatly appreciated on our end. 

Dr. Martin has a very mellow disposition which can help  with calming nervous patients and family members. He greeted us with a warm smile, then explained his overall plan. After watching a short film clip, which is very smart might I add,( it answers most question that could arise) my husband was put to sleep and Dr. Martin removed the cracked molar and his 2 remaining wisdom teeth (one being impacted). It gets a little more risky and tricky as one gets older because it can grow deeper into the bone. I'm quite pleased to say it all went very well.

 Dr. Martin did an AWESOME job!! He also called later in the day to check on my husband as well and to make sure he was comfortable without pain or nausea. How wonderful is that? This is a GREAT doctor.  :) :) :) 5 STAR SERVICE!!

Special thanks for outstanding service to Ana, Estella,Tasha, Desirey, and Andrea!

You can load up your salad or pizza with every single topping, and no one bats an eyes. They offer ""pre selection"" menu options, or you can customize. They also have limited bottled beer, and Bellinis.

The staff is friendly, and remembers me, and makes recommendations to ""spice up"" my usual, and they are always right. 

They are VERY busy during the lunch time, which is great for them, but apparently I've told too many people about my secret lunch spot.

MStt4Azl4lL-j7boTT-CBA,Hd5h-uSjhGzSmH2GwFybXA,p6vkPirVzPRYQE9VZGEAIg,2,6,1,1,"First off: I hate car buying.  Carmax was alright, but I hate buying a car.  You do your homework on how much KBB and Edmunds say your trade in is worth, you look at all the sites, check Truecar to make sure you know the price, you think you're savvy, and you're still at the dealer's mercy.

Case in point: I went through USAA's car buying service.  I found the car I wanted and could afford, and looked up my trade in online.  I traded in a motorcycle, which all appraisal sites said was worth $14K trade.  Newport called the local motorcycle dealer, and the dealer said they'd only buy it from them for $10K, which was exactly what I had left on the loan. Egyptian Rat Screw #1.

Egyptian Rat Screw #2: I had a pre-approved check from USAA for the car.  The dealer still made me do a credit application just in case the check bounced.  This, of course, caused a hard credit inquiry on my credit score, lowering it another few points.

All in all, it took three and a half hours to drive away with the car.  The salesman didn't even offer me a test drive.  Most dealers take the car off the line and detail it while you're waiting for the financing, but they waited until I had signed the contract.  By that time, the service department was closed, so I had to come back to get the car detailed.  Oh, and the car was on empty.  It has a 16 gallon gas tank and it took 15.5 gallons to fill up.

When I picked up the green slip a week and a half later (even though the information is transmitted electronically now in Nevada, and the dealership doesn't have to physically take the paperwork to the DMV and this dealership is directly across from the E. Sahara Ave DMV) it comes up that the car's smog is out of date and it has to be smogged before I can get the plates.  I thought a car had to have a valid smog to take it off the lot.  I guess I was wrong.  Good thing they own a smog station on premises and didn't charge me for it.

Those are the negatives.  Here are the positives: I called the night before and asked for the car to be placed on hold.  Francisco did that for me.  When I arrived, the car was actually in the showroom with a sold sign on it.  I came back the next Saturday and the did a great detail job on it.  When I picked up the green slip, they smogged the car for free.  All cars come with a two month, 2000 mile power train warranty.

I love my car, high miles and all.  I took it to Friendly Ford to get a new key cut (there was only one, and a new key cost $350.00) and the service writer said the car looked clean and in good shape, despite the high mileage.  The car's price was within range according to KBB.com.  I am hopeful that I never have to buy another car again, and I'm kind of iffy about going back to these guys.  It will depend on whether or not I can find the car I want at another dealer.",2015-04-21 02:02:42

After I found out they serve imported Japanese A5 Wagyu, I had to try it!

I called to check the price the night before.. $185 for a 6oz Ribeye.  Pricey! It was the most expensive steak I've ever had.  Although I prefer Filet, if it's really A5, it should be just as tender as a Filet.   I think the Wagyu at CUT at the Palazzo is A3, but don't hold me to that. 

I decided to risk it, and I arrived on a Tuesday Eve around 6pm w/o reservations.  I was seated on arrival.  The booth was very comfortable with fluffy pillows.   

Instead of bread, they served a complimentary trio of Duck Fat fries.  They each had different seasonings, and dipping sauces.  

I liked the garlic sauce the best, it was very thin, and rich and I knew I was racking up the calories when I was eating it.   It was one of the best dipping sauces I've ever had. The fries themselves were maybe 3.5-4 star, not the best I've had, but better than average.  I usually don't use dipping sauces on my fries, but the garic dip was excellent.   

The fries were better than Wolfgang's CUT steakhouse french fry side dish. 

I ordered the A5 Japanese Ribeye Wagyu ($185) along with Foie Gras as a side ($19)

It came pretty fast.  The restaurant itself wasn't very busy.  I dropped by the night before around 830-9, and it looked alot busier.   The bar was packed, though.

The steak was good. It was very tender, as I expected.  Very buttery, and rich.  The seasoning was outstanding.  The steak came pre sliced in thin slices, about 8-10 pieces.  I suppose they can make sure it is cooked correctly throughout.   Mine came out medium rare, as requested.  
Compared to the wagyu filet I tried at CUT in Beverly Hills, I have to say this comes very close to being the best steak I've ever had.  It was on Par, for sure... 

The foie gras was maybe the best I've ever had! It was more tender than the steak, like butter, served hot, and was very rich.  It was well worth the $19.   

I had no room for dessert, and nothing looked too appetizing to me. 
Overall, a very outstanding meal for a very expensive price.   Bring your wallet, the total with tax and tip was nearly $270.  That is for just 1 person. The soda is $4 a pop w/ no freebie refills.",2009-04-01 02:48:09

Service is very friendly, but definitely lacking. Had to call the waitresses over for every little thing and ask for water twice before finally getting it.

I waited with my friend for the other pair that was joining us, and ordered the brussels sprouts and okra. I understand that they're $1.90 and it's a really low number. But there were only three brussels sprouts halves on a single skewer and three little chunks of okra. Really, it's a brussels sprout and a half on a stick with some sauce, and I don't understand why you'd consider that an order of anything. 

When our party arrived, I ordered the Kitsune Udon for $7. It's comprised of three fried tofu dumpling-type pouches filled with udon, which are perfect. They sit in a decent but tiny amount of broth. I would actually call this a fair price, but there's still just something lacking. My friends ordered some skewers, spending around $15-20 each, and were disappointed with the portions. The quality seemed fair, except for the chicken wing, which I was told was ""gross"". One would need to spend a lot of money in order to be full. 

The bill came with four little teensy semi-frozen grapes. We popped over to Tacos Al Asador for a taco-treat afterwards.

I ordered the ""plate"" with gyro meat, cuke tomato salad, red cabbage, lettuce, tabouleh, and hummus. I was naughty and also accepted the pita...

So very rare these days. The restaurant was busy and they were keeping it tidy. Another plus.
The gyro meat was very tender and cooked properly but was WAY under seasoned. Very blah. This surprised me because I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor in all the rest. I'm picky about tsatziki and I thought this one was excellent. Could taste dill, garlic and lemon. Both of the other sauces were equally well spiced and very tasty with the THREE meals this one plate served me. Tabouleh always disappoints me in restaurants because it never has any flavor. This one did! I could taste spices and parsley and probably a lot of salt. It was proper. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will get it in a salad next time. The cucumber tomato salad was good too. Very fresh and crisp. Did not try seasonal veggies, falafel, or babaganoush this time. May not ever. I really loved the choices I made with the exception of the gyro meat. If there is lamb in there, it is a wee tiny lamb who tastes just like beef.

What I don't understand is the sauce. The grilled cheese is flavorful enough and they have an extra bowl of bbq sauce for it. The salad is seasoned but they put a range sauce at a side. Also, they threw extra range sauce on top of pickled cabbage that's already good by itself.

I figured it had been about 6 months and I really do enjoy taking her. She loves it. I should have re-read my past review about telling myself I'd NEVER go back in the evenings. And here's why...

To be honest, I wasn't expecting anything bad to happen. My dog was having her usual fun time but within 5 minutes of entering, a small dog got attacked by a larger dog and all you could hear was crazy amounts of yelping and whining like the dog was being eaten. It was a horrible sound. The owner of the small dog started crying hysterically, running towards the dog, arms outstretched screaming like a banchee. Now, of course it's not her fault her dog is being attacked but she definitely was escalating the situation by acting this way. Don't any of these people watch The Dog Whisperer? Geez. :P Energy people. CALM, ASSERTIVE energy. Fuck, it's not hard.

So this fight between the two dogs is still going on. About 15 seconds into it, it turned into an all out brawl with 6 other dogs going ape-shit on this little dog and then each other. IAnd THEN, as if things couldn't get any worse...every dog in the park started running over to the scuffle. First thing I thought was, ""It's time to get the FUCK OUTTA HERE!"" 

The group of dog owners converged in the entry way to the park, apparently to talk out the situation, while hysterical lady kept crying. Some words were exchanged between owners & I decided it was time to excuse myself. Mind you, I had my dog leashed at this point. She was healing & completely under my voice command. I made her sit and stay at the gate, in front of all these people and their dogs. I went first and she followed, all on my voice commands. 

It made me feel like I accomplished something to have my dog under my control while there was complete chaos ensuing around me. 

If you can't even get control over your 10 lb. dog in most circumstances, please for the love of god, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK. And if you don't have control of your 70 lb. dog, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK.",2009-10-28 04:17:30

In the heart of Scottsdale is this oasis with the staff that Kimpton is renowned for and a property that is a joy to walk around and view. I felt as if we were in a beach resort on Hawaii. Beautiful OPEN lobby with so much to look at. An actual beach (with sand people) pool area. They even have pails, shovels and such for the kids to play with the sand. There is a deeper pool area for those of us who are not traveling with kids to play in.

The room we were in was a King with a view of the pool. The rooms are generous in size and as always Kimpton's eye for details like closet doors that open all the way so they are not blocking your movement were present. We had our own private patio area to relax in as well. Ours had foilage surrounding it and was very private but I did see others that did not have that privacy. Extra points that they are VERY pet friendly and will go out of their way to make your pets stay a happy one.

The negatives for us were that under all that beauty was an old resort and as such things did not work well. The air conditioning was LOUD and our toilet would take multiple flushes to make even a little paper disappear.

I would definitely recommend this resort to friends and family and we will be coming to for a longer stay next time. LOVE LOVE LOVE the staff

The food is good - a step up from most Mexican restaurants. The menu is also different with some upscale options. There are 3 things that I don't understand though:
1. Why they don't give out free chips. Come on it's a Mexican restaurant. Also, if you want more chips after you've paid for your little bag, it's an extra $1.
2. Taco Tuesdays - $5 off tacos is awesome EXCEPT  you can't get shrimp or grouper. Those are regular price plus $2. Why?
3. Rice - it seems to always be undercooked",2015-09-14 23:18:56

I love banh mi - from the refrigerated ones at T&T to overpriced Banh Mi Boys and was pretty excited to try it out.  They have both banh mi's and a bao taco - great for when I'm hungry or just want a smaller meal.  

For $4-6 you can get a small bao (taco shaped) though it will not fill anyone up and comes with nothing else.  The bao itself is loaded with meat and carrots but is a bit overpriced for what it is.  The banh mi costs a bit more but is obviously much bigger.  I'm happy with the flavours and the meat, but it does leave me wanting more since it doesn't come with any fries/taro chips/etc.

I did end up getting taro chips on the side and must say they're quite tasty.

Sure enough, the bar, my chair are sticky. Disgusting. The stainless steel coolers, sinks, counter tops should be shiny & clean. You can see sitting at the bar, the grime on them! 
Bartender is very nice & friendly! I ordered lobster pizza and lobster bisque. The pizza is ok, but the lobster bisque is awful. Bland, tasteless, no texture (so I'm not sure if there is even pieces of lobster in it?). I even grabbed Saltine crackers to put in it, but guess what? Crackers are stale? Newks ( a sandwich chain) has incredible lobster bisque and they are a deli! Great taste, texture, pieces of lobster in it, yet this is a seafood restaurant serving this microwaved canned tasting bisque? 
Corporate has to do something about this Red Lobster! It's in a heavy traffic location , but is a very very poor restaurant! I never understand why any restaurant GM is ok with a dirty bar area, with a nasty smell? Must be he/she just doesn't care? And if anyone from corporate stepped in here and is ok with this condition, then shame on you! It has to be about more than profits & the bottom line!

I was immediately pleased to know that they offer daily tours of their facilities including their boarding area.  

Upon entering the boarding area I was quite surprised to see how many small, medium, large dogs were boarding which already was a great sign. 

I found the facility to be clean and much to my liking. Also as part of their  boarding services they offer food at no extra charge should you not wish to bring your own, and they also provide bedding and a complimentary bath after a 5 night stay.  Another wonderful touch is the classical music they play for them at night.   So feeling good about this place we elected to arrange for their boarding services.

Upon my return I found him happy and well taken care of.  He was a little smelly and dirty but I assumed it was from the 4-6 times they get taken out to their dog run. No issues here so that's what really matters. 

Staff is great and helpful and I also appreciate their long hours of operation as this conveniently facilitates pickup and drop of times for me. Also this facility is staffed 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

The restaurant is a pretty good size so I've never had issues just dropping in and getting a seat right away during normal dinner time hours (weekdays and weekends) with 3-4 people each time. 

Now onto the food! I got the nori fries both times. The first time they were just normal fries with a sweet sauce and shredded nori on top (not that great) but the second time - wow, they were so good. I'm glad they changed up the recipe and made it so that the nori is mixed in with the fries so you get a taste of seaweed in every bite. Needless to say they went very quickly when they arrived the table. We then got the smoked salmon appetizer on top of some garlic toast. This was very delicious as well as it had large fish eggs on top. I like how they just pop in your mouth! 

For the entrées we got the smoked salmon with vodka sauce pasta and the okonomiyaki pasta to share. We were a bit disappointed that the okonomiyaki was not an actual pancake but was just a pasta version. It was a hit with my friends although I personally thought it was a bit dry. The grilled shrimp on top was cooked to perfection though! On the other hand, my friends didn't really enjoy the smoked salmon pasta but I loved it, as someone who enjoys a creamy pasta from time to time. 

For dessert we all shared a black sesame crème brulee. The crème brulee tasted more like a mousse to me, it was very light and a bit airy. The black sesame taste was definitely there and not too heavy. 

They have a daily menu as well that changes up if you want something different than their standard menu. They had some really good options such as a seafood stew, a Japanese style poutine that I was eying and steak frites all for a pretty reasonable price. I will be back for sure!

* I can't explain the clean woodsy aroma, maybe the bar/building materials.

The location is just on the outskirts of downtown in a slightly seedier area, but that's ok.  Probably why it wasn't super crowded and how they manage to keep the JJ GCMS on draft so long.

My wife and I arrived at this quaint and airy venue as the lunch hour was winding down, choosing to eat indoors because the wind was kicking up a little bit but it it wasn't for that, the patio dinning area looking very welcoming.  There were about 8 tables occupied when we were seated but by the time we were finish with lunch, we were almost alone except for only a couple of other tables and one of those tables was just a guy reading a book.

I'll not mince words and just sum my dinning experience by asking myself the same question I always ask myself when checking out a new place (new to me).  ""WOULD IT BE WORTH COMING BACK AGAIN""?  

In a word... NO.

I had just a simple hamburger with fries with a side salad and water.  The wife had a turkey burger with a side of macaroni salad and a glass of tea.  Honestly, the best way to describe the burger is to say that it was completely void of any taste what so ever.  Have you ever had a burger that started off as a flash frozen patty and then thrown directly on a grill so that it's thawed and cooked at the same time?  YUCK!  Now take that tasteless piece of cow meat and put it on a pretzel bread bun (a terrible idea by the way - why pretzel bread)?   I can say that the fries were darn good though so I'm glad that I got those so I can say that there was at least a sliver of sunshine to this otherwise dreary meal. 

This place is also part bistro and part book store and part coffee shop.

Beneath the foot traffic of the many nearby restaurants on Professor Avenue, some of the most inspiring and locally unique food is being prepared underground in a windowless cave. 

Dante has outdone himself with the creation of Ginko; a Toyko inspired sushi bar created in the basement of Restaurant Dante. After descending down the steps and through an unmarked door, you are instantly transported into another world. I've never been to Tokyo, but I can imagine this is what it would feel like. Two Japanese born chefs who greet you as you walk in. The ambiance consists of glass mosaic tiled walls, modern accents, a glass bar top with a calming stream of running water underneath. On one end of the bar is an unobtrusive flat screen that was displaying a vintage cartoon version of Speed Racer and Transformers. The background music, subliminal Japanese hymns. The majority of this smallish restaurant is bar seating for roughly 30, with two high-tops capable of sitting 2 each and two booths with room for a party of 6 each.

Sitting at the bar is an all-encompassing event. The chefs speak to you, you get to admire their superior knife skills as well as browse the ultra fresh seafood and veg. Throughout my time here, I was simply in awe of the experience and ambiance that was created here.  

As far as sushi goes, it doesn't get any better than this. Cleveland has long been lacking in the raw fish department. Mostly because of the lack of knowledgeable talent and a nearby ocean. Dante Boccuzzi has changed that with the creation of Ginko. I've been told the fish served here is caught in Hawaii, Japan, Sicily and New York and flown in on some instances, that day! 

If you like fresh seafood in it's most raw form and can appreciate the great technique and artful preparations that go into this type of cuisine, trust your instincts and desires and get to Ginko! 

*My only gripe: They take reservations for bar seating. I've never seen or heard of reserving a bar seat before. Perhaps this will change in the future, but I just don't get it. This isn't a place to linger for hours. You'd think they'd be able to turn more seats by not allowing reservations at the bar. I mean, isn't that the option of having bar seating in the first place? A quicker, more readily option than waiting for a traditional table? Get rid of the bar reservations and we're cool. Besides that, absolutely no complaints.",2011-10-06 13:34:18

Bao - good, missing something to stand out and knock you off your seat, but good

Bone marrow soup - good. Wife thought it was too salty, I thought it was right. Like the fatty tendon and meat you can pick off. Fun and different.

Cost wise it was fair. Chicken wings were a bit expensive for what you got, fried rice was well worth the 8 bucks and the soup and bao were fair.

More than anything this place can clean your standard Asain food palette with something different. Will come back and order the fried rice and soup.",2016-01-21 07:17:49

I've visited this restaurant twice in the last few weeks sitting at the far right side of the bar each time so I could interact with the chefs and watch them create the dishes I enjoyed while growing up in Louisiana. Like in most Louisiana kitchens you won't find any recipe cards, measuring cups or jarred sauces here, it's a pinch of this and a bit of that with each layer seasoned to taste during the entire cooking process. It was obvious from the first taste that these guys have learned their craft from the owner whom I'm told spent more than a decade cooking along side some of New Orleans' finest chefs. Not only are the dishes spectacular examples of authentic Louisiana cuisine with the complex textures and flavors, the presentations also reflect a high level of pride and professionalism, nothing is merely thrown together, there's an art to this style of cooking and you'll experience all of that here at Russo's.

The service at the bar is exceptional, I can't speak of the table service I've yet to experience it but I can appreciate the other reviews that are somewhat critical and I'm sure this isn't anything close to acceptable by the owner. If the food experience is great I sometimes can tolerate a certain level of poor service not that I agree with it but it's not a deal breaker for me and I usually show my level of satisfaction with the tip and a note on the credit card receipt.

Everything I've tried here has been very good - the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo with its rich dark roux is so addicting - the Shrimp Étouffée with a few extra dashes of hot sauce was very memorable and ranks very high on my list of favorites here - the Grill Smoked Pork Loin with red beans and rice, collards and hushpuppies was absolutely perfect and if you're into big portions good luck finishing this one.

Their chicken is freshly cooked, which explains why it's so hot when you first get it. I love that about them, because no one would want food that has been sitting under a heat lamp like other fast food restaurants right?!

As everyone has mentioned before, their fries are the crinkled kind that you can buy at any grocery store. But that doesn't bother me, so...

I'm not a big fan of coleslaw to begin with, so their coleslaw was pretty good here. Nothing i would rave about. I also think they would do great without the coleslaw and switch it for some other type of side food, like mash potatoes & gravy :]

Their toast...omg their toast man! I fell in love with it the first time i tried it. It's this thick cut slice, toasty on the outside so that it has that nice crunch to it, but soft in the inside. I always order extra toast when I go here.

Their sauce is one of a kind. Hard to describe, but it taste tangy to me. I like it alot, however i feel like too much of it on my chicken or fries would make me shiver ....yes shiver :P

- Staff is nice and friendly and patient (as it took me a while to choose what I want)

- Everything blended well together. They do supply wasabi/soy sauce, but since I was eating on the go and didn't use it - it was a little dry
- Service wise was quick as well, so it's perfect for busy people

That being said if you know where to look you can find a good restaurant or café.  I had heard loads of good things about Olive and Gourmando for a long time but since I rarely find myself in Old Montreal for lunch I only made it there for the first time recently.  So is it really as good as everyone says?  Yes indeed!

It is a café but you are seated by a host and served by a waiter.  The place is packed at lunch so either get there early or try and go after the lunch rush has died down.  If you are one or two people consider eating at the counter.  They have typical café food which is why it is best as a lunch place.  You can expect a variety of sandwiches, salads, soups and so on.  They do have wine and beer if you so desire but I skipped that since it was lunch and I was on my way to a meeting.

I kept it simple and got a latte and grilled cheese.  The latte was as good as any coffee shops here in Montreal and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The star though was the grilled cheese which was made with goat cheese, raclette and caramelized onions.  It was wildly delicious and there was so much cheese that it was oozing at the sides and that is a good thing in my opinion!  Now I like ketchup with my grilled cheese but for a sandwich of this calibre Heinz just won't cut it.  Of course they know that only the finest condiments are acceptable for their food so they serve up the grilled cheese with a homemade spicy ketchup.  While it wasn't very spicy it certainly put Heinz to shame.

Now you can't come here and not get a goodie.  When you're ready for dessert head over to the display of pastries.  This will probably be the hardest part of your whole experience because here you will be faced with the arduous task of narrowing your choices down to just one.  Ultimately I settled for a banana-chocolate brioche which was so fresh and loaded with chocolate and big chunks of banana.  The pastry was very flaky and as a whole the experience was divine!

The service was another highlight.  My waiter was very friendly and despite the fact that the café was completely packed I got everything I ordered in a reasonable time frame.  As soon as I was seated they gave me a glass and my own pitcher of water.  I was really thirsty when I arrived here so I really appreciated this.

It is expensive and for me that was a downside.  The latte, grilled cheese and brioche came to $23 and of course because it was a sit down place I also had to tip the waiter so in all I paid about $26.  While I don't mind treating myself once in a while I wouldn't routinely pay that for lunch.  That being said I would put Olive and Gourmando on my list of places to check out when I'm in the area because it is too good to pass up.",2016-02-15 14:25:37

We ordered some poolside drinks and food and enjoyed ourselves immensely!

After a power nap and shower (great water pressure in our room by the way), we took the complimentary shuttle over to AZ 88 for some drinks and dinner.   From there, we went to Rusty Spur and then called for the shuttle to pick us back up... it worked perfectly and no drinking and driving was key!

In speaking with Cheryl, the Assistant GM of the property, we learned that they will be doing another renovation later this month.  We previewed one of the new rooms, and were wowed - they are going to be pretty sick, not to mention eco-friendly too!

One benefit of being off the strip and without a casino - there is a much shorter taxi line!  And it's about the same distance to other casinos and hotels as from the main Planet Hollywood building - pretty much the middle of the strip.

Overall the service was satisfactory, though the concierge was bad.  They don't have enough concierges so I always had to leave a message and wait for them to call me back.  That was annoying.  They also didn't call me back when I needed to cancel a reservation...oopsy.  Also, Planet Hollywood doesn't have very good food options inside.  The closest thing to fast food is Sbarro, which has hiked-up prices.  And everything else was overpriced and/or poor quality.

The rooms are all suites.  We stayed in a studio suite, which is basically like a normal-sized hotel room with a king-sized bed, pull-out couch, and kitchenette.  The rooms are also pretty new, so it's very clean and doesn't feel used.

They do lunch specials until 3pm for $6.50 and they are nicely sized. I was thinking it'll be a smaller portion for lunch, but seems like the same for dinner. 

We shared: 

Crispy Spicy Eggplant - This was yummy and the definite standout. I can eat a whole plate. The batter was light and crisp and the sauce on it was perfect sweet and spicy.

Hot Spicy Szechuan Tofu (aka Mapo Tofu) - this was pretty decent, it was not spicy though so don't let that scare you off from ordering. I was hoping for some greens to go with it since other Chinese restaurants do that, but still good. 

Veggie fish w/ tamarind curry sauce- Originally we ordered fish in hot black bean sauce but ended up getting this so I think our order was heard wrong. We ate it anyway. The sauce was good, I like the tang the tamarind brings and like there was a variety of vegetable in it. The ""fish"" was interesting. It looked like fish with skin on which seemed like it was made of seaweed and gave a oceany taste to emulate fish flavor and the texture of the fish broke into meaty strands....I think it's a acquired taste. 

I'm admittedly a ""naturalist"" in that stuff that's manipulated/processed isn't my thing and kinda freaks me out. I may be a (light) meat eater, but I eat ""clean"" and prefer that. It fed my curiosity though, new experience and all....I'm always up to try something out of the norm for me! It seems the chef knows how to prepare these in a way to showcase it right so if meat substitutes are your thing, this place is sure to excite with the massive variety of ""meats"". It could be a restaurant vegans can bring carnivores to as some dishes probably would be hard pressed to tell it's not real. 

I appreciated they have a brown or white rice option. We also were given soup which was just a veggie broth, and seemed to be lacking something. 

The service here is friendly, checked on us, kept our drinks filled. Even though I'm Asian, I still feel bad saying good service is out of the norm for Chinese restaurants. 

Overall, this is a welcomed addition to Spring Mtn. It's nice to have other options to dine with some of my veggie friends and it seems like the food here is made with care. I'll be back to try more things, I'm sure!",2012-09-20 08:33:36

The sales people constantly follow me from case to case whenever we look. I give this store a bit more credit than the downtown summerlin location though. At least they didn't give me hassle with returns here like that one did. My main concern here is with the quality of the product. Have bought a few pricey items here that I then take to an independent jeweler that my fiancé has known for years that is always honest even if it's not the answer we want. The two things I bought from this location that I have brought to them to be inspected and appraised I was shocked to learn how low the quality of the diamonds were and even had small chips/damage. Luckily I could return them right away. Now this could be a problem with other stores as well but I've run into it twice with this one specifically. Not fun to find out something you spent a few grand on or even more is worth less than $150 and is poor quality.,2017-01-19 04:41:20

My Fiancee made Summerlicious reservations for this popular place.

The place is too cool there are no address posted or restaurant sign. The sign in front is just black. lol 

We were seated near the middle of second level of this three level restauarant. It was kind of loud where we were initially seated and asked to move. Our server then seated us at a nice table by the far end in the skylit room also on the second level. Ah what a releif I don't need to scream into my fiancee ear plus I can see my food thanks to the skylight. :)

For Summerlicious there's a set menu:

For me I ordered the app Sushi Pizza, main Sea Bass, and  dessert Doughnuts
She had the app Samosas, main Steak, and dessert Flourless Chocolate Cake

Each item was introduced by the server, they described it's preparation and ingredients used. The presentation was great! Most importantly the dishes tastes were distinct and flavourful.

I enjoyed what we had, we shared. In the future will definately have this place in mind when visiting the St. Lawrence area.

Ordered the Paul Rubens (pastrami, coleslaw, cheese) on the dutch crunch roll (or whatever it was called).  Added a side of fried zucchini.

Will start with the bad.  The zucchini was bleh (that's below meh).  The ranch that came with it was beyond cheap.  If you go to a grocery store and look in the salad dressing aisle half of what you'll see is ranch dressing.  So how this place could end up with an awful ranch dressing is beyond me.

With the above being said I didn't let the zucchini color my view of the place other than I'd never order it again.

As for the sandwich it was surprisingly good.  I added lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onion and banana peppers so the sandwich was really stacked.  The bread (dutch crunch) was really good...perhaps the best at any sandwich place I've been to in quite a while.  Overall I'd order the sandwich again.

My only concern with the place is that the variety of sandwiches they serve is so large at some point I would be afraid they would lose quality. I'll have to order a few other things before I can make that call.",2015-10-29 02:13:02

I've been to Phoenix Children's Hospital just a few times over the years... Once was just for a tour when I was involved with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation years ago.  I was super impressed with what I learned and saw during that visit and I became a fan back then even before I had children of my own.

The next two visits were more recent emergency visits with my son... One for Croup and the other for a night terror (of course I didn't know either diagnosis until after the fact).  Both times the lines to get in to see a doctor were rather long.  However, once we did get in, we were very happy with the level of service provided.  Courteous staff and attentive doctors and nurses.  We found them all to be patient as well, which is tough when you know they are constantly dealing with sick or injured children.

PCH has a reputation for being the best in Arizona for a reason... the name speaks for itself.
From the colorful curtains in each room to the movies playing on TVs throughout the lobbies and individual rooms, toys for children to play with as they wait to be seen, etc... They even offered my son stickers as we were leaving.  I am a fan of this place and I like knowing that it's nearby.  That being said, I hope that I won't have to visit PCH again ever.

They have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree. 

There was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food.

The Oxtail (15.00), served with rice and peas and salad, was a very generous serving. It was fall-off-the-bone tender and rich with flavour. Very good. I would order this again.

-Look for Weslodge. 
-Now look to the left of Weslodge, you'll see a lane-way with a red parking P above it. 
-Go down the lane-way, Patria will be on your left.

Now that you can actually find the place, let me tell you about the experience itself. Nice modern decor with great service. Not only did the food seem authentic but the staff all seemed to have legit Spanish accents.

We were there for a group bday dinner and the serving sizes of the tapas worked out very well. Lots of options, and I'd say the dishes ranged from good to very good.

2 Stand-outs:
1. The paella. Make sure you order this well in advance as it takes quite a while to make. I ate paella everyday while I was on vacation in Barcelona. This was the first paella outside of Spain that has come close to capturing that flavour experience. Great for groups and I'd highly recommend it.

2. Churros Con Dulce De Leche. If you love churros, I'd recommend this as well. Despite our waiter being unsure if their churros would best those from La Gabardine, they total did. The crown of best churros in town now rests with Patria.

- Runner-up: Another excellent dessert was the chocolate pudding w/ olive oil and sea salt. For those that think it sounds a bit weird, don't worry, it works and is delicious!

The final bill was totally reasonable for the level of service and quality of food we received. Great for a nice dinner date or celebratory dinner.",2014-05-31 15:08:55

""I'm sorry we couldn't give your food expectation at Istanbul sofra. With all the respect you never dine in with us. Because we don't serve just falafel and yogurt sauce or just rice . Your past reviews you never had mediterrean or Turkish cuisine before . I understand didn't fit in your taste .

We serve more than falafel sauce An it's Tabouli. start to appreciate some of the small restuarants. They all not 1 or 1 .Regards ""

Original Review:

The atmosphere is lovely and the location is great. Everything good ends there.

I got the falafel platter and tabbouleh with a side of the yogurt sauce. 

Where to start... So, the falafel itself had absolutely no flavor and was super hard until you got a fork through it and it fell apart. Very odd. When I say no flavor, I mean ""nothing"". I didn't know this was even possible. 

So, I went to layer on the tahini sauce, only to discover that it was too runny and also had no real flavor. It was like juice more than sauce. 

So, I tried the yogurt sauce. I'm halfway convinced that they used a very diluted ranch dressing - you know, the kind you get in a place that's trying to cut costs. At least it had some sort of tangy runny flavor, but still very disappointing. 

The rice was overcooked and hard and the tabbouleh was just as bland as the rest. The tomatoes had no flavor (come on, it's summer!) and there was no lemony tang or, really, anything. It was just kind of there. 

Even the pickled vegetables that were on the side was tasteless.

I actually started to think that maybe something was wrong with my tastebuds since it all just tasted like cardboard to me. But, my dining partner had the same experience. 

The service was okay, but not great. I really hope they get their act together. It's a great spot and I'd like to have something enjoyable there,.",2014-07-18 19:58:34

Further exacerbating my itch, a woman we met at a Clutch concert earlier in the year told us she worked there, urging us come to come over for a spot of food. Last Sunday evening, a beleaguered Kay begged me to order pizza. Remembering the woman and the coupon and realizing I had yet to eat at Carbonara's, we placed a takeout order, whisking through Dormont, Mount Lebanon,  and back to Beechview. 

The ticket was good for a free white pizza with the purchase of two large pies, toppings and other extras notwithstanding. 

I caught sight of the fellow Clutch fan as we awaited our food, but she was busy with patrons at the bar and was likely too buzzed the night of the aforementioned show to remember us, I imagine. So we let her be.

The dining room was bustling with middle-aged and elderly customers as expected. Booth seats resembled leather couches, and overall, the decor looked somewhat unfinished. Teen and twentysomething servers skipped about, trying hard to stay on top of demand and seemingly succeeding. Welcome to Shoppin' Center Suburbia on a South Hills Sunday evening. 

Each pizza, from the small white, to the two colossal regulars were centered around a crust that felt like a cracker on the outside and sourdough bread on the inside. Other analogies that come to mind are flatbreads and pita. The sauce was miniscule, stingy even, but the lardy, party-hearty provolone (not mozzarella) was in abundance, forming strands with each pull from the teeth. The toppings for each were all fantastic. Be it bacon, olives, mushrooms, pepperoni, or tomato, none of them were swept up in the mix. The mushrooms were fresh, the bacon seemed cooked to order, and the tomato slices were straight from a backyard garden. The white pizza, however, with its garlic, olive oil, and grated Romano, stood out from its other behemothic brothers with its confident flavor profile. Had the sauce been more plentiful, these dough saucers would have soared to a 5 with no turbulence encountered. 

Dessert for me was a breezy, angelic, coffee-soaked primer on Tiramisu. Espresso-dusted, the cube of mascarpone was elegantly mousse-like, burying the pappy ladyfingers beneath in off-white luxury with hints of liquor subverting inhibitions slightly. It was fit for the opera.

I found the decor to be interesting, which is important to me, as I like having things that catch my eye. That strange Disney-looking pile of TV screens hanging over the bar certainly was interesting, though I can't say its my type of decor, and it clashed with the reddish/orange theme of the space. (I have to add, aren't there more colors than red/orange for new restaurants? I'm starting to get tired of this color palette!) 

Anyway, the interior was pleasant. I sat on the bench-style seating along the casino and it was sufficiently comfortable. I don't do tall bar-chairs, and they had those, too.  The place was not full at all, and our geeky waiter, who was a bit forgetful, was quite pleasant.  We tried every single happy hour appetizer offered (embarrassing) but that night was drown-my-sorrows night, so I deserved them.

The cheese dip was good. I LOVE cheese. I must have been a mouse in my previous life. This was real cheese, not that Velveeta-smooth stuff other restaurants sell as food. The guacamole was good but we had to add salt to bring out the flavor. The chips were heat-lamp warm rather than freshly-made warm, but no complaints- they did their job and tasted fine. I liked the chicken wings- crisp and moist and tasty! 

I enjoyed the chicken mini-tacos and liked them even better with the accompanying pico de gallo. The quesadillas were boring- I'll skip those next time.  The chimi taquitos were all right- fried rolled flour tortillas stuffed with some kind of meat. I think I was full by the time I got to them or I'd probably be a little more enthusiastic. Or not. They were just all right. 

I prefer ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine, but I will settle for tasty chain-restaurant-level Mexican when I need a fun fix.   I may not be raving over the food and the service could have been a little more attentive, but it is what it is. No major complaints to keep me from coming back.

I first passed this local on Saturday, hoping to get a breakfast burrito.  Seeing boarded up windows I assumed they were now closed.  As I found out on Sunday, I had mistaken the boarded windows for the wrong business.  Ramiro Mexican Restaurant is definitely not closed.  This is good news for me as I love Mexican food and I love it even more when it is only 400 meters from my home.

I dropped in on Sunday and had a classic Mexican breakfast Burrito (eggs, potatoes, chorizo and cheese).  it was very good, hot, fresh and was served by a very friendly cashier.  it was so big, I would consider asking them to cut back on the potatoes next time.  

A big plus for me was that there was a salsa bar.  It had two red sauces, a green chile sauce, limes, cucumbers and pickled carrots, garlic, onions and jalapenos.  This was a nice touch to spice up the burrito.  The green Chile salsa was good, the smoky red one (chipotle?) was so so.  The pickled veggies were very good.

The site is clean with plenty of parking and a drive through. I will be back to see if they are more than a one hit wonder.

Update 4/20 - had a wonderful green Chile carnitas burrito - fantastic, earning an upgraded review. Also, much better horchata than my first visit. I am a very happy neighbor!!!",2013-04-17 19:12:24

Tatuado is a crazy fun spot to do it all.  We came here for a birthday dinner but stayed for the show.  The menu is great - all sort of options to choose from - appetizers all the way through to dessert.  
We started with nacho appetizers and they didn't disappoint.  A huge portion with all the toppings and the meat/chili sauce on it was insane good. For dinner I went with the Hombre Burger - a chorizo/beef mixture with guacamole, cheese and these weird little chip strips that gave it a nice crunch.  But the bun.  Oh that bun!

He was funny, engaging and even on a Sunday night didn't have to beg people to participate.  
The restaurant is full of rock and roll memorabilia with tons of photo ops.  My particular favorite was the outfit displays and in particular, the one with the photo of 2 adult entertainers and the words ""I love single moms"" emblazoned across it.  Well, this is Motley Crue, guys!  
I'm hoping this place does well.

The restaurant is a bit of dive in a neighborhood that lacks charm. This doesn't turn me off, as some of the best ethnic restaurants I've been to everywhere in the country fit that description, although I'd be happy to see the sad carpeting go. It's been noted by other Yelpers that this is a mom and pop operation...I reiterate it here to make a point, which is that there is one person waiting on people (mom) and one person cooking (pop). This can make for some long waits for your food, even if you call ahead, as I did. To be fair, I was quoted a half hour between my call and pick up, and that's about what it was. However, there was only one table occupied when I arrived, and they had one to go order ahead of mine, so when it's busy...? The woman who waited on me was very nice, although we went back and forth a bit as to what I ordered, partly because of the language issue and partly because  #81 on the menu is listed as pork meatballs, when I had ordered pork on the stick. They got it right, but it was confusing for me. 

I skipped the pho, as I like to eat that while dining in, and had the bun, aka rice vermicelli noodles, which I ordered with pork on a stick (lovely description...kabob style) and the spring rolls. The pork was nicely marinated and flavorful, although the crowding on the wooden stick had created pieces that seemed not fully cooked. Plus, it was just not enough meat. The spring rolls were tasty, the noodles were done perfectly, with no clumping, and the veggies that traditionally accompany this dish were present and fresh. Again, a decent offering but not the best I've had. I will update this review after trying their pho.",2015-03-23 13:53:40

Just like last last time my husband really enjoyed the pulled pork he said it was very good.

I thought the pickles and corn muffin were really tasty. (didn't need the hot bbq sauce but it was also very tasty)

The coleslaw was very improved. It was fresh tasting, a little sweet and pretty drip free.

I was so hungry after spending 3.5 hours volunteering at the aid station for the Viva Bike Vegas 2012 ride that I could have eaten a take out menu and thought it was good.

This was my first time here and I had researched Yelp reviews and their online menu.  I ordered from the take out window one order of chicken lettuce wraps and a large hot and sour soup.  The lettuce wraps were very good.  I am a salt lover, but the sauce made the wraps salty even for me.  But, I still enjoyed them.

The hot and sour soup had a rich taste but I'm not used to having ground meat in hot and sour soup.  It's generally small slices of pork.  The texture was a bit of a turn off and I didn't think the soup was that spicy.

My biggest issue was service.  I realize I was a walk in at 4:30 on a Saturday evening.  There were four people in the restaurant at the time.  There were some take out orders to be made but there was never less than three cooks working behind the counter and before I got my meal, there were 5 total.  I probably waited 15 minutes.  I saw the one cook pick up and handful of rice sticks and toss it into the take out box--no gloves, no tongs--just bare hands.  Also, the soup was ladled into the take out container and just left on the metal shelf for 10 minutes while the other things were being prepared.

When the counter critter brought my bag, she apologized for the long wait.  I watched this place as it was being built and never stopped.  That's been about 10 years.  I guess I can wait again before I return.  The lettuce wraps saved the rating from being 2 stars.",2012-09-23 18:36:34

i'm a huge fan of sweet potato fries and this place tends to overcook them. they often come half burnt which takes away from the creamy sweet flavor. the wraps aren't bad but once more, they come lukewarm so if you are looking for something hot, opt for the burger or a noodle bowl. my favorite dish consists of their yummy springrolls. they are fairly large and can be eaten as a main course. 

this place isn't bad but it's not great, just like what the stars describe, it's A-OK. the food is generally flavorless unless you ask for specific ingredients (in which you pay extra) but the juices and smoothies are great though pricy. my favorite is their beet juice. sometimes i buy the large bottle version of it when i want to splurge because it's overpriced for what it is. however, it's light and a great breakfast drink.",2011-08-03 22:47:37

The interior design of this restaurant is more modern compared to other Chinese cuisines. 

We arrived around 10:45am and was told it would be around a 15 minute wait but we waited around half an hour for a table. 

The washrooms are upstairs and each washroom is it's own separate stall with sink. 

The dim sum prices are comparable to other high end cuisines, like Casa Imperial or Casa Victoria. The dim sum is around average, but the presentation is more elegant. 

Anything with bamboo charcoal is very instagrammable, but I found the texture very grainy. The bamboo charcoal and egg yolk bun is a lava bun, which not many dim sum places offer. The durian filling in the bamboo charcoal tart was very creamy and filled with durian.

We asked for chili oil THREE times for the cashew nut, chicken and vegetable dumplings, but we never got it. All other dim sum places usually serve this dumpling with the chili oil, but not here. Also, I find that peanuts would be better than cashews as they have a more nutty taste.

The place is usually busy during the dinner time so a lineup at the entrance is not uncommon. It's totally worth it to drop by for lunch as they have lunch combos and daily lunch specials. Price is worth for what you'll be getting so expect to spend about $10-15 per person.",2017-06-23 00:31:13

This is the reaction I always get when I list the public library system as one of my top three favorite things about Las Vegas. (The other two are the Neon Museum and the weather and the food... I know that is more than two. I just love so much about this darned town!)

Seriously, though, I love the public library in Las Vegas. I have a serious library addiction. At any given time I have at least 10 non-fiction books checked out, 20 on-hold, and some choice DVDs waiting to be viewed. 

The book selection is quite extensive, easily 3 times the selection of my previous Atlanta library system, and if they do not have it, my experience has been they are very responsive to suggestions. I sent an email suggesting a Buddhist text, and BAM! The next month it was in the catalog. They also have all of the latest DVDs. You will have to wait a while to get the most popular titles, but patience is a virtue, friends. Just today, I have to return ANVIL. Yes, the library had it!

The online services are quality as well. Searching and reserving is easy, and their online periodical searches are wonderful. I have been doing some research for a paper on Lady Gaga, and I was all prepared to go to the library, sit on a computer looking for periodicals and then slog my way through microfiche and stacks of magazines. Not necessary: there are literally millions of periodicals available to search online from the comfort of your home with full text available.

My local branch happens to be swank. Sahara West is a beautiful library, and I have always found the staff helpful. I rarely need the staff as the system is very user-friendly. They recently installed the latest check out technology, so all you have to do is pile your books on a desk, swipe your card, and the computer senses all of the items, and checks them out to you. I never expected to be wowed by technology at the library, but I was.

In addition to all of this, the library system hosts numerous events: art exhibits, movie viewings, author visits. For example, Thursday night at 6pm you can go watch The Hangover at the Rainbow branch. 

If you do not have your library card, you are missing out.",2010-01-19 21:48:35

Menu items: Tortilla de Patatas, Halibut with Chimichurri, Beef Cheek Fideos & Churros

This fairly new Toronto King-west restaurant has knocked my socks off. Hidden under a new residential building in an alley-way, Patria, the new collaboration by the same owners of sister restaurant Weslodge, brings a little bit of Barcelona to our palates.

With an eclectic decor, comfy chairs and an open-kitchen concept, the tapas-inspired restaurant delivers a modern take on traditional Spanish food with ingredients directly imported from the mother-land and flavours that explode in one's mouth.

I visited Patria for lunch to take advantage of the lower-priced tapas option. The restaurant is not cheap by any means, but their lunch menu delivers some of the most delicious tapas I've had the pleasure of tasting in this city. Starting with my favourite and one that makes me salivate just thinking about it, the Beef Cheek Fideos. A tremendous explosion of sweet and savory flavours that marry well on a plate of noodles, soaked in a tomato broth, topped with pieces of juicy beef cheek and cilantro. The noodles are soft and mushy, and rightly so, as Spanish ""fideos"" usually are. They are thin, short, with the right moisture balance.

Patria's take on the famous tapa - Tortilla de Patatas is one to admire.This potato, cheese and egg concoction has texture like no other. Layers of ""un-mushy"" potatoes are wrapped in an omelette-like egg and cheese mix. The tortilla comes served with a small pouring of a tomato compote that gives the dish that extra punch of flavour.

On the fish front, Patria opens up one's imagination to the possibility of using chimichurri on fish, with their take on a halibut covered in the precious traditional Argentinian sauce. The fish, cooked with a nice flaky centre and lightly fried skin, comes smothered in the parsley, garlic, oregano, red wine vinegar and olive oil sauce. The chimichurri is so fresh and tasty, you almost want to order bread to dip in the sauce and wipe the plate clean.

On the dessert front, Patria delivers just as well. The popular dessert, Churros, has crowds craving for more. The popularity of this dessert stems from the fact this Spanish-staple is made on the premises. Their churro-making machine sits at the front of the kitchen, outputting hundreds of the doughy treats that are served on a bed of thick and sweet dulce de leche.

With this kind of food, Patria, also known in English as Homeland, hits the spot when in search of a little of Barcelona in the city.

Buen Provecho,

Every single bottle was passed through a machine for security purposes. One agent told me it would take too long to do it now and that I would have to wait. I refused to miss my next flight.

First as we were trying to get to the place we almost missed it because it's not in an actual fast food place but inside of a liquor store.  The left side is where you get the food and the other side is the liquor store.  Perfect idea to me cause we ended up picking up a bottle of wine to go with our meal.  The place looks pretty clean although it's not in the best neighborhood but usually these kinds of place have the best food.  There isn't much seating about 2 or 3 tables and there is no privacy from the customers entering the liquor store.  If there was more privacy we may have eaten our food there. Service was ok considering the lady that took our order didn't speak much english but enough to understand our order.  Then there was the lady that we paid for out food and she was really friendly and helpful.  Service alone will bring me back to a business.

We got our fries and we had to wait a bit because they made them to order and they weren't sitting out waiting to get sauce added to them.  I'm a French fry connoisseur so they weren't as good as I would like them too and they weren't crispy but they were made fresh.  My boyfriend to the mild wings and I got the hot wings.  The wings are HUGE and not the skimpy ones like Wing Stop and I mean HUGE and meaty.  Since I like spicy food my wings weren't too spicy to me but they were pretty good.  I tried my boyfriend's mild wings and they were pretty good too.  

I looked at the Mexican food they had there and it didn't look so great because it looked like it had been sitting all day and had that film around it.

Particularly for those west of the 404 along Highway 7 who don't want to trek out east to First Markham Place's food court, this place can't be beat.  It's located at Valleymede & Highway 7, in the McDonald's plaza.

The decor is extremely sparse - basically a small table and counter for sit-down clientelle, but most are just takeout.  Menu is simple and I'd say at least 80% of the people go for the standard $5.50 combo of rice + 2 meats, which also comes with some sauce and a small spoon of that addictive salty green onion ginger salad.  Nasty stuff the first time you try it but believe me it grows on you.  If you do choose to eat in they also provide free tea, and recently even added a microwave for your meals - I guess if you're coming in with others that have food from other establishments?  Or you want your food extra hot perhaps?

Come before noon or closer to 1pm otherwise you'll have a bit of a line to stand in.  The meat is hung behind a glass display case (typical of most BBQ places) and you choose what you want and the girl will expertly chop it in front of you and lay it on the rice.  A few times I catch her looking away while she cleaver the meat and I think it's a wonder she hasn't lost a finger before, but she knows what she's doing.  

Favourite meats - bbq pork and roasted pork (with the crispy skin - so bad, but sooo good).  Chicken and duck also available, and some sausage.  You can also buy just the meat by the pound to take home - all a good deal.  I could probably eat this stuff every day - and nice to have it local.

Pros:
Lots to choose from in AYCE menu
Pretty good prices

Cons:
Portion sizes vary differently per order

I never get reviews for AYCE restaurants that compare them to their non AYCE brethren.  You can't compare the 2 honestly.  If you come to Sano Sushi with realistic expectations, you will be just fine.

Sano is your typical AYCE sushi joint.  This place is much bigger than it seems from the outside.  There are many tables inside that can seat large parties if needed.  Dinner Friday to Sunday costs $24.95.  That's already a pretty good price compared to other places.  If you pay in cash you 10% as well!  Yay!!

Sano offers a lot on their AYCE menu. There are many categories to choose from.  It seems like pop is also included on the menu which is a rarity but something nice. This place is run by Chinese people so there are come Chinese type dishes on the menu as well.  The sushi is what you would expect from an AYCE joint. It's decent but nothing special, which is right where it should be.  If you expect the highest quality here you're out of your mind.   

The portion sizes here are all over the place.  One order the sashimi is one size, the next it's twice the size.  Sometimes they don't even follow the the number of pieces they have listed on their menu per order.  More food is usually not a bad thing but when they charge you for unfinished portions it can throw you off.  

All in all, Sano is a pretty decent AYCE sushi joint.  It does it's job at a very good price.  If you want omakase type sushi, you will need look elsewhere.  Come in with the expectations of an AYCE joint, and you'll be fine.",2017-10-04 13:12:45

We were able to find a spot to sit at easily. We had several interactions with different employees and they were all super nice. Our food came out quickly and we dove in. I poured hot sauce and honey on my biscuit (it's the best way to eat chicken, in my opinion). It was tasty, crispy and warm. My husband really enjoyed his biscuit, as well. We ran into some friends who ended up sitting next to us and offering tastes of their beignets, which were good. 

The negative to me was the size of the chicken on my biscuit, which ended up being similar to a chicken tender. It made the chicken to biscuit ratio off and many of the bites I took were just biscuit because of how small the chicken was.

""People like braised stuff these days, right?""
""Yeah.""

""And balsamic vinegar is, like, all the rage, is it not?""
""Indeed it is.""

""If a dish 'needs a little something,' it is more often than not salt, correct?""
""Yes, good sir, salt is the magic missing ingredient every time!""

""Would you say, then, that if we put an ounce of salt into each dish, it is unlikely that our customers would feel that the dish was lacking salt?""
""Indeed.""

""OK, so let's braise some meat, stuff it into noodles, develop a sauce that has balsamic vinegar as its primary ingredient, and add as much salt as we can.  Be sure to add the salt when the sauce is near boiling so as to create a supersaturated solution.""
""Brilliant!""

""Can you think of anything else?""
""Yes... texture is all the rage these days.  Perhaps we could disrupt this dish with some completely misplaced and undercooked root vegetables!  What could be finer than intermingling some crisp fresh carrots with the melt-in-your-mouth beef?""
""Not a damned thing - let it be done!""

The funny thing is that there is actually an article out on The Google about how they make this very dish.  I may have been slightly off in a couple of my details...

One of the cute things they do is the dessert, which is essentially a scoop of ice cream in a waffle cup kind of thing, but the plate is decorated with mango sauce and whatnot, and pictures are drawn (ig moment there).

The sushis are not the best, and appears have gone down in quality over the years (Sagano has been around for a while), but their sashimi is still okay, and service is still excellent. This restaurant is probably better for a quiet meet up/drink nowadays.

The patio overlooks all that is Vegas and Summerlin: a fake lake with McMansions on the opposite shore. Nevertheless, most of us enjoy being close to bodies of water (however man-made), and I am no exception. The multilevel patio was constructed with care and dollars, and it makes for a great dining environment. We started our meal off with a cheese plate that offered five cheeses that covered a nice spectrum of fromage. From there, we went straight to the entrees. I had the roasted chicken.

I also tasted both of my friends' dishes (steak frites and halibut), both of which were the cat's pajamas as well. The only dig I could offer is that the staff was not entirely personable. The host acted like it was a bit of a chore to seat us, and our server half-assed it. However, the manager did make his rounds and checked on us, which I always appreciate.",2013-06-27 22:34:11

I despise shopping for jeans. I have probably entered one of the local Levi's outlet locations at least 10 times in the past 4 months and left frustrated and ready to wear dresses (and those shorts) for the rest of my life. The outlet stores are unorganized and staffed by some unhelpful youngsters who ask if you need help, but then become inoperable when you let them know what you're actually looking for. 

But, I love Levi's. It is one of my all time favorite, iconic brands. Levi's are sexy and tough and to me, everything a jean should be.

The other day I woke up determined to get some new jeans, but despite my gusto, a visit to the Premium Outlet location left me downtrodden and defeated. My husband convinced me to give the Fashion Show location a shot. 5-stars to my husband for leading me to Anastasia, the most helpful jean assistant ever created. If you hate buying jeans, you want to go see her immediately. 

First, Levi's has a new sizing system (Curve ID) that works beautifully. It takes into account your hip size, so there are different cuts for each size suited for both the super straight and super curvy. Genius! I walked in, Anastasia measured me, and the first pair she handed me fit perfectly. However, we ended up spying the deal of the century sales racks in the back of the store and couldn't resist. These were the old size system, but Anastasia was tireless in her efforts to find the right size, right cut and right wash. She even had insights into what styles she thought would look best on me, and she would get really excited when a pair fit me and make cute outfit suggestions, like, ""OH, you totally need to get some red pumps to wear with those!"" Best of all, she was genuine, and the results last! I wore a pair last night, and I felt like a million bucks. 

I just had to write this review for all you ladies who hate buying jeans. I promise that if you go here and ask for Anastasia, you will fall in love with jeans all over again. I would hire her for my personal shopper if I could.",2010-08-29 02:15:18

I dont normally review places on the strip, or in Vegas casinos, since I live here. I usually leave those places up to the tourists. Although since my opinion of this restaurant differs from most of the other reviews here, I figured I'd share.
I had the Rare ahi appetizer, which was good, and probably the best part of the meal in my opinion, and then the dry aged porterhouse steak as my entree. The steak, unfortunately, was nothing to write home about. And for $51 I expected a pretty good steak. I was prepared well, but didnt seem to have any flavor to it. The dry aged steaks at Capitol grille, are SO much more flavorful. I also had the grilled foie gras with the steak, and it wasnt too bad. I guess for a steak house in Mandalay bay, I expected it to be alot better. 
The Service was very good, and the restaurant itself was very nice. I have eaten at every other restaurant in Mandalay Bay, and they have all been great, but I think Stripsteak fell a little short.",2007-08-23 19:42:16

It purports to be a 'Supergrill', strong claim, and there is some good food to be had.  On Blue Jays game days, they have a baseball special which is a steak supper and a beer for $20.  They've got one of the tastier calzones that you'll have outside of Little Italy, and their ribs are surprisingly good.  Not an expectation for a pub of this nature.

I would suggest that you avoid brunches unless you like scrambled eggs only.  It appears they use ready-made whipped eggs or similar product, so a sunny-side up option (my brunch go-to) will not be found here.",2008-09-09 23:01:56

What has happened to you?  I was your number one fan.  I've had over 50 meals with you and filled up eight all-you-can-eat-cards with 10 stamps each.  

Lately, you've slipped. I've definitely noticed the last four or five times I've visited you.  I'm not sure if it's the economy so you're not selling the fish fast enough or sacrificing some quality to save money?  

But that wouldn't explain why you would try to serve me nigiri on plain white rice last time I was there.  Did you run out of vinegar to make the sushi rice?

I haven't seen my favorite of your sushi chef's JR in a long while.  Maybe my timing is off.  But it also seems the old angry sushi chef is angrier and slower than ever.  Must he put up his hand to shush me if I try to ask him for more than one order at a time?  I wouldn't have to place simultaneous orders if he didn't take 8 minutes to prepare each item I request - on a slow night.

Thanks for the memories, Sushi Mon.  We definitely shared some good times.  I'll always remember your ikura and Ah-Chi-Chi rolls.

Sincerly,
Richie H.",2009-03-28 00:09:19

One feature that's quintessential about the Range Rover is its the oversized windows and the Evoque's sleek style falls short on window size.  Passenger rear windows are very small and leave little passengers with no view. Sadly based on CR ratings on these tiny windows, I'll have to pass on this model.

We had the Smoked chicken + black  bean quesadilla, shrimp tamales, Swordfish, and cornmeal crusted chile relleno. 
I thought the smoked chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty. I think they grilled/fried the skin so it be crispy when you eat it and obviously goes well w/ avocado. I love the Garlic Creme Fraiche. 
Shrimp tamales: I liked it more the first time I had it but it was still really tasty. I thought it was a bit oversalted this time around but the shrimp was very good. I love the corns that are in it. 
Cornmeal crusted chile rellano- eh. Maybe it would be better w/ some kind of meat but it was a bit lackluster for me. Could use some more spice as well. It was pretty cool to see a whole pepper covered in cornmeal but it was very dry due to it as well. Barely got any eggplant in there as well. 
Swordfish: I thought this was absolutely delicious. The swordfish was cooked in perfection and had a GREAT sauce to go along w/ it. I love the cream green chile rice. It was kinda like risotto but less mushy. It was just an overall very tasty and seasoned dish.

Classic Pedi  $25
Aromatherapy  Pedi  $35
Hot Stone Pedi $45
And a deluxe one I don't remember  for  $55.

I went with the $45 Hot Stone Pedi. It took them an hour,  just to do the scrubbing and massaging- then on to color! I brought my husband with me, he had the same pedicure,  and loved it! We got to soak for 20 minutes,  then got scrubbed with orange slices and exfoliating stuff. Then,  a paraffin  dip! It was really lovely!  Literally the best pedi ever.  I didn't even have to ask the nice lady to remove my ingrown toe nails,  and she did a great job cleaning up my neglected  feet. A gentleman did my husband's feet,  and he walked out feeling relaxed and pampered.

I had a gel manicure  ($35) and she matched the color to my toes perfectly!

After almost a year of going to a salon in the southwest, which is way too far away from where I live I decided to hunt out a new salon. This also came after the nail artist I saw at the previously mentioned salon started really trying to push me into doing higher-priced treatments. Typically I have a schedule: gel mani one visit, then a gel mani and pedicure with regular polish on the next visit. I dislike being upsold when I am trying to get something done as well, especially if it is done by the nail artist during my treatments. 

A co-worker of mine recommended The Nail Room, which is also far from where I live, but not as far as the south west. I definitely enjoyed their 20% off discount for first time customers.

PROS: This place is CUTE and the owners (a wife and husband) are very nice and cordial. The whole staff seems happy, and while I was there the salon was quite busy. 

My gel application was done VERY well, by Jenni (the owner). She took her time and really made me feel like she wanted to get my gel application done perfectly. She definitely succeeded. It is one of the best gel applications I have ever had. The pedicure was also great, and Jenni took her time - nothing felt rushed.

If you are there when they are doing one of their ""cupcake"" pedicures the whole place smells like a bakery! 

CONS: The selection of polish is smaller than my last salon, but not so small you can't find something you like.

The seats do not offer and massage options and the employees have to wheel a bucket to you to actually do your pedicure - so there are not jetting tubs for your feet here.

Overall I would recommend The Nail Room, especially if you live in Henderson. I am still debating if I will return, because it is so far away from me. I may need to try another couple salons closer to where I live and make my decision from there.",2014-10-01 23:27:23

Why not five?  Because I expect nothing less than perfection from Chef Dante. But next to Pacific East, this is my go-to place for sushi, and now that I live less than 3 blocks away, I really don't know what will keep me from the extraordinary Happy Hour and beyond, every day.  Even guilt-inducing thoughts of dwindling fish populations barely registers on my normally moral conscience, when it comes to uni atop a cooked scallop.  Just ask Chef Taishi about uni (sea urchin) and his face will beam with delight, and he will chirp happily about how Japanese mothers feed it to babies. If you've never had sea urchin, imagine truffled butter with a hint of sea breeze slowly disintegrating on your tongue.  Yeah, Japanese babies obviously have excellent taste.  This, and the red snapper, are your best bets here, but sit in front of Chef Taishi and ask his opinion.  He'll offer you the freshest and choicest cuts.  

P.S. If you're a lucky girl and have $200 to spend on a meal or have a wonderful man who understands the worth of a $200 meal, try the chef's tasting menu.  If you do, throw in an extra $50 and get one of every martini (especially the Shiso Martini), and cram yourself into a table by the semi-arched, red-tiled walls.

I enjoyed it last time but I remember it being pretty expensive so I've been visiting cheaper sushi places in the interim. KoFusion today left me pretty disappointed. First of all, our waitress gave a really strong impatient vibe. I got the impression that she was staying late or covering for someone else because there were additional customers she wasn't expecting late in the day. She was pretty slow with refilling my water and was trying to take our menus away right as we ordered a roll of sushi for an appetizer. It was like she was trying to discourage us from ordering more. At the time, my mom knew what she wanted but I wasn't ready yet so, I decided to wait until later. When she came back to check, I asked about the sushi bowl. I've never heard of a sushi bowl before and wanted to make sure I wasn't ordering anything I wouldn't like so I asked the waitress to describe it. Seems like a simple request right? Her response was ""the description in the menu is pretty obvious"". Come on, don't you think I read the description first? Even if I hadn't, isn't it her job to talk about the dishes in the menu from her perspective in more detail than what's on the menu? I was very disappointed with her response. After continuing to talk about what sushi bowls could be from what I read, she did reaffirm my assumptions but it would have been nice to have gotten there without the sarcasm. Also, she completely forgot to take my mom's order. If my mom didn't shout what she wanted as our waitress walked away, we would have had to wait until she returned again later. In the end, the food was delicious. I love the sweet and spicy sauce that the sushi bowl came with and if you like raw fish but want something a little different than regular sushi or when others aren't into sushi and you want something for yourself, I would definitely recommend it. For almost $20, I was a little disappointed to see imitation crab but overall it was a good balance of savory, tart, sweet, and spicy.

With so many other cheaper and friendlier sushi options, I can't imagine that KoFusion will be lasting much longer when these kinds of experiences are what they're offering. Also, I'm pretty sure we walked in right as dollar sushi was starting which I didn't remember until we were on our way out. Why didn't anyone mention the deal?

I believe they started construction way before a certain ""Eat Mo Chiken""  place up the street and they just barely opened a week or two ago. Anyway, I finally came by tonight to get my yummy fries fix. 

Hmm... I didn't really remember the fries being like this? Maybe I'm getting it confused with another place but I thought they were regular thick cut fries with seasoning salt? Well, instead it was something similar to jack in the box curly fries, only thicker, not curly and better seasoned. It wasn't what I remembered but it was still very good. Dangerous! In fact, the burger I had also reminded me a lot of JITB. I had some sort of a bacon cheeseburger on sourdough. It was like a cross between a sourdough jack and a Carl's Jr western burger (because of the onion rings and bbq sauce). Pretty tasty.

My peers gave rave reviews, so promptly myself and another who missed out on the event did a followup here.

Situated inside a mini Hispanic indoor mall, you had your choice to also purchase a pinata, vitamins or random swap meet type clothing.  But we stayed true to course and went direct for tortas along w/ locals slowly filling up the seating area.  Between the Cubana torta and the Guadalajara (pork in bread roll doused in spicy sauce), I'd go w/ the dry tortas as the latter was a bit of a soggy mess.  For the latter, the pork was very tender but obviously was cooked separate from the sauce (which is evident if you order it w/ the non spicy red sauce w/ the spicy given to you on the side).  The tortas are generous, wrapped in paper and already sliced into two portions!  Next time I'd order one of the soups and a torta for sharing.  Eyeballing the locals, honestly they were ordering a variety of other items outside of the speciality.

The cashier lady was very friendly and made a point to stop by and check on us gringos.  A+ service, and they take credit cards.  BTW, around 11:40am, a ton of high school kids start rolling in... so eat before then!",2010-12-06 20:42:54

There are quite a few 'marquee' pizza places in the valley...some that come to mind would be Pizzeria Bianco, Cibo, The Parlor, Pomo, and Patsy Grimaldis. Ask a random person on Yelp what their favorite pizza place is, and chances are you're gonna hear one of those names mentioned. (This includes us by the way). 

I've never heard anyone say that Humble Pie is their favorite or even in their top three. I wonder why? I could be crazy...but if I was to take a Humble Pie pizza and put it in a taste test with the aforementioned places...I don't think the majority of people would notice a big difference in the level of 'goodness'. Each place has unique flavors, but they're all really damn tasty. Unless you're familiar which how each pie tastes from experience, I think you'd be stumped to identify which came from where. What I'm trying to say is Humble Pie can hang with the big boys. 

So...I'm sitting here wondering now...why don't more people rave about this place...why don't I myself rave about this place?! Could it be something so simple as atmosphere? Humble Pie's interior is very...should I say...humble. There's nothing snazzy or memorable about this place, other than the actual food which is quite good. Cibo is in a quaint old house, Pizzeria Bianco is overflowing with prestige and this aura of greatness from all the national attention...Humble Pie is basically just a storefront with an interior that could have very well been put together by someone who just read 'Interior Design for Dummies'...it doesn't take much chances, and it shows. 

So...what does that leave us with here? 

A pizza place with awesome food, but not much else. I definitely recommend it, but I expect it to continue to hover right below the other more well known places for the foreseeable future.

Within an hour the plumber called from a job he was finishing up in Henderson.  He was going to set me up for Monday but once I explained what was going on and that I could not turn the water back on until the valve was replaced he came out to my house immediately. At first it looked like a quick job as he was able to break the corrosion and muscle the old valve off the compression ring and put the new one on in about 10 minutes.  But it turned out the old ring was leaking and it then turned into an hour to try to get it off.  Finally he did it and got the new ring, valve, and fill line on without any leaks.  All that was $85 (I had all the parts already) and I really wished I had cash on hand because I would have totally tipped him.  

As much as I would like to name my fantastic plumber I did not get a receipt when he left.  Not blaming him though, since he was pretty tired from doing his best to get this fixed.",2016-10-17 01:43:36

Having been here a few more times since first reviewing it 2 1/2 years ago, I find that things are just not that good. With the exception of customer service, who was helpful and friendly, it's a bloated, sugary nightmare of meh. 

FOOD. So lackluster, I didn't even take pictures. I ordered the Waffles/Works, which is one large waffle, a couple eggs and a meat. The waffle wasn't very hot, and tasted more like an old flavorless pastry. Even with maple syrup for a couple extra bucks, it still didn't taste like much. The scrambled eggs arrived cool, dry and overcooked. I swapped that out for fresh eggs (poached), which were cooked to order, medium. The bacon was ok, not great. Definitely past the medium ordered at, but at least, edible. 

Tried a buckwheat pancake from another in our party's stack. The top of the pancake literally came off, which gives an idea of how dry this was. I know it's buckwheat, but still, I was hopeful for a little sign of life here. 

The kids ordered French Toast, and a Denver omelet. The French Toast got a thumbs up, the omelet was considered fine. The homemade potatoes looked extra paprika-y, and were left largely uneaten. They also had the banana muffin, which they liked as much as they always have.

As we walked up to DTF there was a chalkboard sign outfront saying that they were not Opus. I hadn't even realized they were residing here and fondly remembered my sister's visit to Opus when a shooting took place and she was out front till 4 am giving a witness statement.

I am glad you now live here DTF.

It was a Thursday, it was dead, I had made a reso. Our server was friendly, funny and she kept the bread coming. We decided to go for the tasting menu, and I advised our server of our allergies, scallops, oysters and mussels. She came back to check if lobster was ok, and it was, but despite this the second course was still scallops.
That is why I have to give DTF four instead of 5, if our allergy had been more serious, where we couldn't have picked the scallops out, we would have had a ruined meal.

But the food, it is so good. I can barely remember everything that we had, but the duck ham & cheese really stood out. The lobster cream broth was so good, even though my counterpart could not indulge the scallop portion.

I also really have to respect all the locally sourced food, they are also part of the Vancouver Ocean Alliance, so no net caught fish. 

It really topped off the meal with the dessert course where they had written ""Happy Anniversary"" on the plate, and then we were given mini raspberry macaroons afterward. SO CUTE.

Do be warned, the food is pretty rich, especially if you do 7 courses like we did. Prepare your stomach and try to get over the restaurant name when telling someone who doesn't know what you are talking about.",2013-03-06 02:12:39

We showed up around 7pm on a Friday night, and our first clue should have been that the restaurant was almost empty.  However, we were hungry, so we threw caution to the wind, grabbed two bowls of peanuts, and were shown a table.  After deciding not to throw our shells on the floor, we perused the menu.  As a place that quickly establishes itself as a BBQ joint, the menu seems disjointed; oysters on the half shell and peel & eat shrimp co-mingle with sliders on the appetizer menu, and shrimp & oyster po-boys are listed above the omnivores' pork, chicken, and brisket sandwich options.  But the true blasphemy surfaced once the meal arrived.  

Y'all, the mac & cheese was NOT GOOD.  Grainy, tasteless, and altogether sub-par macaroni and cheese is unacceptable in a BBQ restaurant.  And the fried okra was overly salty without packing much flavor.  At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how great the meat is at a BBQ joint (and keep in mind, City Smoke's meat is nothing to write home about); if your sides aren't stellar, you might as well shut down shop.  Between the four of us, we ordered the brisket, rotisserie chicken, and pulled pork, but no one was overly complimentary of the meatsplosion on the table.  We had three sauce options: one was vineagar based, and the other two tomato-based ones tasted almost exactly the same.

Our service was okay, but I think that's mostly attributed to the fact that our server only had one or two other tables to attend to.  Maybe City Smoke burned brightly at one point, but the flame has died.",2012-10-22 17:31:52

We went on a Thursday night and were kind of surprised when we were told there would be a 10 minute wait. I guess it's still somewhat new, so people are eager to try it out. 

I ordered an Italian soda and a minute later a different waitress stopped by and asked what flavor I wanted. I responded I didn't know they come in different flavors. She said, oh yes, there are 10 different flavors that are listed on the menu. I handed her the menu, and she flustered because well, the flavors aren't listed. She struggled to name three and I settle don butterscotch.

We ordered the chicken and waffles and chicken pot pie. The chicken and waffles was awesome, but I didn't dig the pot pie so much. I didn't like that the crust was separate from the filling, and it was made from dry tasting crackers instead of a buttery dough. If you're not a fan of leftovers, I recommend sharing an entree otherwise you're likely to end up with leftovers. 

A few minutes after the entrees were delivered, the waitress brought us our check. What????? Even though she was all smiles and told us not to hurry, it still bothered me. Unsurprisingly, she never stopped by our table to check on us again until we were ready to pay.",2015-04-04 21:58:38

Tavern Grille earns its three stars by a solid performance everywhere but the food.  It is an inviting venue, the service is fine, the menu is extensive for a sports bar, the portions are large and the prices are quite reasonable (particularly the daily specials).

Even the food has a lot going for it.  Most of it appears fresh and of good quality.  The blame falls squarely on the preparation.  Let's start with the chili - I don't mean you.  You should definitely not start with the chili.  It is overly acidic, short on beef, and believe it or not, it needed salt.  I have never had to season chili before.  Amazing.

I ordered my burger medium well, and it came out so far past well done that the burnt crust was actually hard to cut.  It was also bland, unimaginatively dressed and poorly bunned.  At least the bread didn't get soggy -- how could it, there was no moisture at all in the meat. Time constraints prevented me from sending it back.  On the way out, my wife mentioned that the burger was badly overdone and the hostess laughed and said we have to order it medium rare or rare.  If they know about this, why haven't they fixed it.  Wake up, manager.

The Philly steak seemed to have good ingredients on it, and was the best choice, but the salt shaker got a lot of work on this one too.  The steak fries were ok once you salted them.

Oddly, I might go back.  Everything else about Tavern Grille is so good I might risk a repeat fiasco hoping that the cook who worked on our food this time was having an off day ... probably not.",2015-06-11 14:31:07

Hands down best croissants in the city! And this from someone who bakes her own croissants regularly. If they were a little closer I don't know if I would need to bother. 

They were flakey but not so flakey that they just crumble at the touch like some croissants. They had the perfect doughy interior with a great fermented flavour. Something that is lacking in many store bought croissants. And my guess is they use organic flour because I often can taste the bleach and a funny after taste in non-organic flour. 

So why 4 stars?

I also had a grilled cheese that wasn't bad but wasn't 5 stars...

I thought it'd be a good way to try their bread without getting a whole loaf and they sliced a fresh loaf but the bread had the wrong texture for grilled cheese and the cheese wasn't that great either. It had a taste that I equate with the taste of the rind from Brie. 

So I'd say go for the croissants!! And feel free to pick up one for me. :)

First off, it was a SUPER busy night and they only have one server. I felt really bad for the waitress but she was on a rush since it was just her. Didn't really had time to order. 

Second, the food was ok. We order 2 pad thai, 1 thai soup with pork, pad see ew, and green curry with rice. The waitress ask us how spicy would we want the soup to be and we said mild, it was nothing near mild. One pad thai came with peanuts and the other didn't, ask for lemons and we never got it. Also, the pad thai was so sweet. I know pad thai is supposed to be like that but it was too sweet for this one. Pad see ew was very salty.

This review will focus on brunch, as the dinner happened a long time ago, so my memories are a bit fuzzy and I don't remember specifics.

I actually didn't realize Aft even had breakfast options until, in an effort to feed my increasingly hangry husband, I turned to Yelp for nearby brunch options.  We have a couple old faithfuls in the Queen/Broadview neighbourhood, but we wanted something new.  Aft to the rescue.

For a small restaurant, Aft has a healthy brunch menu, consisting mostly of savoury meat-based dishes with an obligatory sugary option for those of us who are relentlessly tormented by their sweet tooth.  But really, what do you expect for a place that specializes in smoked meats and other barbecue flavours?  Vegans, turn away; there is nothing here for you.

As I said, my sweet tooth always prevails, so I ordered the french toast.  My husband stuck to the Broadview Breakfast, which consists of your standard breakfast fare - eggs, meat (your choice of sausage, bacon, or Canadian bacon), toast, home fries, and baked beans.

The portions are really hearty.  Despite looking a bit underwhelming, my french toast was too much to finish.  Battered in corn flakes and fried, I really enjoyed the crunchy texture alongside the doughy challah, and the light dusting of cinnamon sugar was subtle without being imposing.  As a surprise, it came topped with two slices of double-smoked bacon, which was more than enough to balance out the sweetness.

After tax and tip, I think we spent about $45 for our meal, which is pretty standard for two meals (no alcohol) in the area.  The only reason this isn't 5-stars?  My receipt pointed out that I paid paying $5 for ""Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice.""  I didn't realize that pouring directly from a bottle of Tropicana (I watched this happen) was considered ""freshly squeezed.""  I mean, I ordered the juice, I have no problems paying for it, but just don't tell me I've paid for something far superior to what I got.  The menu didn't really list any juices or coffees, so I just ordered what I saw other patrons drinking.  Honestly, I think my disappointment could have been avoided if I had just spent a few more bucks and getting something liquor based.  My husband spent $5.50 on coffee, but at least he got a whole Bodum worth.

Long story short - great food, limited coffee/juice options, avoid the orange juice, try a cocktail instead for a few bucks more (it is primarily a bar after all).",2016-10-03 21:43:53

Although they don't have a huge selection of flavors, they do have some unique flavors.  I sampled the kettlecorn and had a cup of the dark chocolate and the maple and pancake ice creams.  The portion size is large, which justifies the cost of a double.  The ice cream has a wonderfully balanced base, smooth and creamy with a good mouth feel.  The kettlecorn was a nice representation of a flavor that should be hard to make into an ice cream.  The maple was very flavorful with nice chunks of pancake.  The dark chocolate was very rich, not as loaded with cocoa as some I have had, but very smooth and satisfying.

There is a huge difference between tacos (or any dish really) you eat while drunk and those eaten while sober. The magic that makes a 2:30am meal taste amazing is mysteriously absent when you return with your wits about you. Herein lies the difference with Fuzzy's. I will not go into incredible detail but suffice to say that they have cured several of my usual taco pet peeves. The first thing they have done right is to put the grated cheese on the bottom so that it can melt into the meat and not just fall off. Many of the menu choices can also be had with feta cheese on top. Secondly they have gone away from the trap of ""super spicy for no reason"". Trust me that is a good sign. Ask the Creoles and they will tell you the relationship between camouflaging spicy and terrible tasting ingredients to make something edible. Instead they have chosen to used a garlic sauce that brings out the flavor of the meat rather than masking it. The final thing is that the shop owners have kept the prices very reasonable.

The Good

I was able to make a reservation for 12 people easily - though we were the only guests in the restaurant for 90% of our meal
The prices are very reasonable - most dishes under $10 - 6 of us shared about 6 dishes, three desserts and two drinks and the total was about $15 per person with tax and tip
Service was efficient
Food was tasty, if not a little on the salty side with all the soy sauce used
Conveniently located - streetcar stop right in front of the restaurant
Menu available online
Green tea was free and regularly refilled
Most drinks are $1 (pop, milk and juice)

The Not So Good

The three sauces provided were cocktail sauce, and two variations of a garlic Hennessey mignonette, one slightly pinkish and the other more on the yellow side. 

The ""yellow"" mignonette was very sweet, so I felt that you lost the sense of the garlic and onions. The ""pink"" one was more balanced and quite pleasant.

A complaint I often hear about Ethiopian is that it all tastes the same - whether that's actually true (I don't think so) or it's a result of our western minds being so used to each separate dish having, well, it's own, separate dish, that when it's all piled onto a delicious piece of Injera, the way we experience flavor shifts is a mystery to me. At Red Sea, there is no mistaking Wat for Alicha - the flavors in each dish (even just stewed lentils) are distinct. Some things are sweet - others salty. And there's none of this ""spice level"" stuff - you get the full range, when ordering a combo (at 10.99, veggie combo is a steal).

Dings - nuked Sambusas. Service was both good (presence, smiles) and cranky (unhappiness about splitting a bill 3 ways, each portion on a card). Warm, as in tired A/C. But really good, thoughtfully prepared food. Lovely.",2010-07-16 13:15:50

We greeted warmly. The young lady came over right away. She was lovely. She is Mrs. Q. She took our drink orders and explained a little bit to us. 
The server came over to take our orders. We had to try to the fried pickles. They were fantastic. The sauce also very good. Mrs. Q also brought us the comeback sauce which was awesome. 
We were disappointed though that they no longer serve Fried Chicken. That is why we went. It was on the menu on the website. I did ask why it was no longer served and the server explained they are a scratch restaurant and that the Fried Chicken takes about 25 minutes to prepare. 
Honestly is that not what Southern food and Hospitality is about?? Enjoying good food and conversation. We would have waited. To us good food is worth the wait. And seriously why is everyone always in a hurry? And Vegas is in need of good Fried Chicken. In my opinion it was a mistake to take it off the menu. JMO. 
We had a burger and wings. Were they good, yes. Were they the best we have had honestly no.

There was hardly anyone in the line for a Friday afternoon and they told me there would be a wait for my food.  I could've gotten into the line and had my food quicker.  I asked them to just cancel my order and give me my money back.  They obliged and that was that.  Very weird situation.  The parking situation here is awful.  Their parking lot has less than 10 spots and there are people constantly circling around the lot trying to find a spot.

He liked both and we agree that while the flights were good, we prefer the blends. 

The one drawback we noted was the lack of games and music. However, we thought maybe they were trying to create an atmosphere where people talk and have conversations. It was kind of small and I could see how if it were super busy, it may be hard to find a seat. We didn't have a problem though.

Food-1
Strikeouts-2/3

Strike-out #1. Let me start off my saying that we had to wait at least 30 minutes before a hostess finally came to ask us for how many people to be seated. She took the number of seats of the table for a table of 6 and told us ""15 minutes"". Little did we know that ""15 minutes"" turned into just under 45 minutes. We were not impressed. 

Strike-out #2. They added 15% tip on top of the bill before asking. Tipping the waiter was confusing.They also have the option to ask for more tip with the card machine, when using a credit card or debit to pay. There was not a, 'no tip' option, so I was forced enter $0 or 0% for tip, otherwise I could have accidentally paid tip twice. I hate it when restaurants don't tell the guest that the tip is already added onto the bill. It tricks people to overtip and the service was abysmal. 

The decor was mediocre at best since it was newly renovated, but really tipped the score on this was the massive drum in the front. It's nice, but when one little kid starts going bongo crazy on it, you would want to rip your ears off.


The food and sushi rolls and sushi was mediocre. The best thing on the lunch menu was the teriyaki chicken which I kind find of ironic for an all you can eat lunch SUSHI buffet. You definitely do not get what you order in terms of quantity or quality. Usually when you order any of the big rolls, like a green dragon roll you expect something grand. This definitely doesn't make that cut. Not only was it small and tiny, but also only four pieces. Opposed to the typically 8. Some places serve 6, but this was just unacceptable. When I order 15 pieces of sushi, I expect 15. We get 8 pieces instead for 6 people. We went in the afternoon around 3:30pm, so there was not much of a crowd to serve, so I don't get the lack of accuracy is. I had to order my order twice. I hate it when all you can eat restaurants do this to save money. It makes hungry people like myself angry and write negative reviews just because they wanted to save a few dollars. 

The person taking our order made up for the one star this restaurant barely deserves since she was battling a war with serving the entire restaurant where everyone else ignored our table or forgot anything we told them if they bothered to stop. I would rather spend money to eat pho 3 times than come back.",2015-10-27 03:58:31

It was a Saturday night and although the place was busy, there was no wait time to be seated (party of 2). Loads of tvs and decent music selection for dinner. We were attending and event at the Opera House and wanted to find a decent place to eat. Loaded up Yelp and Prohibition was the closest to parking with 4/5 average ratings. I would say the mark is true to experience.

Food Quality & Price: Husband had the philly cheese steak sandwich and LOVED it. They placed a Gator sauce on the table to compliment the meal. All condiments are sold at Prohibition too. So my husband picked up a bottle to go ($12). I ordered the halibut taco which was okay (3/5), next time I'll probably get a side order of mac & cheese instead. Each dish ranges from $10 - $30 (with entrees on the latter side of that scale). But sides seem pretty hefty in size. We both really enjoyed the DF (duck fat) fries and Sweet Potato fries. We made it at the end of Hooch hour and got some beers for $5 each. The cider was delicious!

Service: Was friendly and attentive. Exactly what you'd expect but nothing above and beyond.  

Overall: We were really glad we picked Prohibition Gastropub for dinner. I would return if I'm in the area. There were a few annoying flies in the joint during dinner, but that's probably because the doors were left open. If you're headed to an event at the Opera House, Prohibition is a 2 minute walk from there and a safe choice to pick from.

Food served on a molcajete, a grinding tool made from volcanic rock, the same kind the Mayans and Aztecs used for thousands of years back can only prove the authenticity of the cookware and of the scheme.

I love the falafel pita and tabouli. The tea was good for just a hot tea as well. Maybe it's the atmosphere that makes it all so good? Or maybe it's that they do what they know and do it well? For me, this is a staple in the valley for middle eastern cuisine. It warms my heart that after all of these years they're still there and seem to do well. 

The tahini is perfect, the falafel is perfect I love the halva. 

They have a market area with many items that I'm familiar with growing up in Toronto and I've been surprised what I've seen there although admittedly, I believe the only thing I've ever purchased are the seamen snaps.

Anyhow, I imagine Haji-Baba will always be a favorite of mine even though the staff behind the counter aren't always the most chipper I've encountered, it's just that good.",2018-04-19 04:57:05

My sense of this place is they know that they have a great product, and that they do, so they let the service suffer. The mistake they have made is they may not be aware that they are in Las Vegas, not California. I was asked by the server if I knew what I wanted, before she had given me a menu. I saw a server complain that a customer was upset because they had tp wait over 45 minuses for their food. OK now that the unpleasantness is out of the way. The corned beef hash was fantastic. So if you don't care about being treated like a valued customer then by all means stop in. If not; there are plenty other diners in the sea.

The menu is huge, so it was hard for me decide what to get. I ordered South Of The Border while my friend had french toast with scrambled eggs and bacon. The black tea and lemon he had was good, though it was probably because I never had tried them together before. His toast was good, but he wasn't so happy with the food overall.  Not because they're bad, but you expect getting better food than what you can cook at home. I was happy with my omelette and their home fries. The chorizo really spiced it up. I don't like the salsa or ketchup on it though.

The food is always excellent here, and the menu has a wide variety of selections.  We have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered.   To the contrary,  we have been pleased with everything we have ordered. 

We especially like their hamburgers.  They are quite big,  and they grind their hamburgers in house.  No more  frozen hamburgers from a box!  Also,  they know how to do hamburgers well done and have them come out juicy.   This must be hard to do, as sometimes when I order a well done hamburger, it comes out like shoe leather!  Not at Tavern Grille.

They are listed as a bar.  Guess they sell a lot of alcohol,  of which I haven't had any since 1967.  (The little I recall, however,  It was a great party!)  But I digress. 

Incidentally,  while their profit margins surely must be better with alcohol,  they never hustle you for anything. 
This place doesn't smell like most bars and the restrooms are always clean,  which usually is not the case with a bar.

In short,  this a great place to take anyone; including the family.    Probably not fine dining, but it definitely is fun dining!!",2015-04-05 01:07:51

I arrived at about 3pm and I was lucky to have the opportunity to speak to the owner Raffi about my first-timer selections since it was not busy at this time. Based on my cravings, my wife's allergies to tahini and Raffi's careful suggestions, I left with 4 Mamajouns, 1 Goat Cheese Pizza with Sun Dried Tomatoes and Mint and 3 Lentil Balls. Since I was bringing my order home across the city, I had two Mamajouns heated so I could enjoy them on the way and Raffi kindly instructed me how to prepare the others at home (he also provided me a separate bag with the condiments to keep them cool until I go there).

Everything was as delicious as I expected and each item was thoroughly enjoyed by myself, wife and kid.

I was happy to have experienced some authentic Armenian flavours in the Mamajouns and Lentil Balls and also familiar flavours in the pizza (although the mint really added a wonderful, unique touch to it). I'd like to suggest to those that might be apprehensive about Armenian pizza having too many exotic flavours, that if you stick with the ""Pizza"" menu here, you'll only get really, really good Italian-tasting pizza with quality ingredients.

The establishment itself is very clean and inviting with nice decor. You can see into the kitchen through a glass partition which was nice. 

I look forward to returning to Mamajoun and trying several other items from the menu (although I'd order the same things again in a heartbeat).

""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" Five stars.",2016-01-20 18:02:04

They have a mixture of flavouring and dairy and they just use liquid nitrogen to freeze it all into a delicious ice cream for you. They also offer the cheetos snack frozen in the liquid nitrogen which makes you puff smoke like a dragon. It's a really interesting feeling and definitely a lot of fun to do with your friends.

The ice cream itself tasted great, but nothing special. It's the novelty of the place that brings you in. I think though, they should be a bit more careful with the liquid nitrogen as they don't appear to handle it with much safety precautions in mind. Giving kids/teens a cup full of liquid nitrogen with the cheetos in it doesn't seem like it would end well if you have a group of particularly ""not so smart"" people. It looks like bubbly water to them. 

I do appreciate how friendly the staff are. They seem to really have fun with their work and are happy to help you take really cool foggy pictures. It's something fun to visit with friends, but I think I'll stick to other dessert joints for the food and taste aspect.",2016-10-31 16:21:22

The design and decor of the place are awesome.  We sat there and gazed off at the high ceiling and the intricate detail on the walls, as well cool old fishing photos they have on the old beach wood covered walls.  The fire in the middle of the dining area and the fish tank walls give it a Florida like, tropical fishing cabin/beach hut vibe if you will.  We also were able to get lost in the menu, which is large and contains some great seafood fare as well as the traditional burgers, sandwiches and salads.  There is everything from buffalo burgers to crawfish bites, to alligator tail.  Very cool menu and everything looks good.

Well, they were smart to make the place a tourist attraction in itself because the service ranked right above whale crap in my opinion.  When we walked in there were two decent sized groups (around 6-8 in each party) and two other couples in the whole place.  There were three waitresses working the dining room area.  We got to the restaurant at 5:55pm, sat down and waited until 6:05 to get our drink orders placed.  Another 10 minutes went by and finally came the two waters, milk and watered down lemonade we got for the kids.  We ordered food (2 burgers, 1 order of mac and cheese for the kids to split) and waited.  We waited some more, got lost in the decor and aura of the place, waited some more, gazed around, waited some more.  Finally the waitress came up and asked us if we wanted more bread, when a half a loaf was still left on the table.  I looked down, looked back up, and politely declined.  Well, 5 minutes later we got another loaf of bread, 30 minutes after we ordered dinner.  I grabbed my belongings and told the wife we were leaving ( We had to get in line for Santa).  The kids were wrangled up and we walked to the front to pay for the drinks.  I waited for a manager, while the waitress (not very motivated by any means) asked me if we wanted it ""to go"".  I laughed and said I would just stop by and see if it was ready at lunch the next day.  She told me to ""hang on"" while she found a manager.  When he came over he told me it was ""almost ready"".  I reminded him that it was 30 minutes from the time we ordered, and the order was two burgers and a bowl of mac and cheese which should have been out in 7 minutes max,  He implied there were large orders ahead of me but comped me the drinks.

Thanks, Johnny Morris, I owe you a glass of milk.  

Moral of the story, the staff is less than competent, to say the least.  The food looks great but I could not tell you if it's actually real or just something they dangle in front of you to let you admire the ambiance of their fishing hut. I wish I could trust this place enough to give it another go, but I don't have hours to burn waiting on food.  Maybe someday.  

The reason it got two stars and not zero is the place is really cool and has an awesome looking bar.  The menu looks fantastic, but again I'm not sure if what they offer ever actually comes out.",2014-12-05 05:20:02

Jun's is a small establishment and on a Friday night it's hopping.  As luck would have it we were able to score a table.

The drive thru lane was looonnngggg.....even the walk up window looked crowded, tho to my surpirse, I didn't have to wait more then 5 minutes to actually order AND receive my drink! All this AND the guy at the window  (who was quite friendly, btw) told me that today they had a 21 personnel meeting at that location and they were also right in the middle of changing shifts. Bad timing for a coffee rush, but very well handled!!

On a side note, I've never had any problems with the drinks or food at this location. If anything, one time they gave us one too many oatmeals, which we were not charged for and got to keep. I will take that kind of mistake anytime! (even if I have no idea what to do with an extra oatmeal.....)

This cafe is located in a plaza with a number of businesses, such as a convenience store, South St. Burger, and Swiss Chalet.

The last time I was here was a good year ago. It was winter, and I walked without taking my hat and one of my mitts off.

A barista from my usual Starbucks was working here. She recognized me in all my bundled winter gear. We chatted. She was temporarily helping out at this Starbucks location. 

I ordered my usual iced green tea. My order was corrected and tasted great, as she I was a regular customer at her regular cafe. 

This cafe is roomy. I didn't stay to sit down and take things in at a slower pace. When I was there, there were a couple of customers. It felt like a good place to just think and relax.

I should come back here again and see whether things have changed.

The bagels were good and fairly priced. I guess I was expecting that there would be a place to sit down and there wasn't. From what I could see they did not even sell coffee there so we opted for coffee across the street. We ordered two bagels. One plain and another salt bagel. I was surprised that the salt bagel was actually a pretzel. I wasn't looking for a pretzel but obviously this was due to my not being able to read French or navigate the menu. They provide small no drill butters and Philadelphia cream cheese upon request. There are benches outside but the ambiance was somewhat lacking with a down and out homeless person looking for handouts. Despite this we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the ""bagels"" had hoped they would have. Even served warm but maybe that was something that we had to specify.",2017-08-11 15:13:39

I really wanted to be all over this place.  With a name like ""Thor"", how could you not?  I just always feel a bit underwhelmed whenever I leave.  

Their menu is a bit confusing and requires explanations from the staff.  For example a ""Hit and Run"" is a shot of espresso while you wait and an americano to go.  A ""Mjolnir"" is 4 (or was it 2?) shots of espresso with condensed milk (a play on a Vietnamese favourite).  You can only get those 2 items if you have a few minutes to spare as those are ""drink in"" items only.  Would be greatly helpful if this was indicated on their menu board somewhere.  I also feel like pricing is a big higher than at your average independent shop.

I'll still pop in now and then, especially to FINALLY try the Mjolnir.",2014-01-21 16:26:35

I was very hungry, so I wanted to make sure I got something with some substance. I chose the special of the day (forgive me, I forget the name of it), but it was a sandwich stuffed with ahi tuna, pickled carrots and radishes, cucumber, jalepeños, cilantro, and some kind of sauce.

WHY: I have a strong gut feeling that this may be the best Cane's location out of the Las Vegas chain! Haha.

WHAT:  I have previously written a review about one of the other Cane's locations, but this is my absolute favorite location! The reasons behind my judgement is that the customer service is the best, the food is the best, and it stays 100 percent consistent!

The handful of times I have come here, I have never been let down.  There are times when the fries are either too salty, too soggy, or too crispy. Or times when the chicken fingers just don't taste how they should be tasting. But! Never has any of these incidents happened to me here!! I just may be their number one fan and proud!

The manager was an absolute sweetheart! I had forgotten my Caniac Club card, and he made it easy to accommodate me! There was one time I had forgotten my card at one of the other locations, and I couldn't redeem my box combo there! They had told me to email and or contact Cane's Corporate!! & sure did!

- Along Spadina Ave (Chinatown), right beside the Matcha bubble tea
- Parking available on the street or nearby GreenP near Kesington Market
- Restaurant size is normal and can accommodate groups, better to reserve in advance if possible
- Decor is modern and simple, I like their strong and sturdy utensils 
- Staff are nice, provide recommendations, always on their feet to refill water or make sure the food plate doesn't overcook

Food
- Shared a few items for 4 people

SIGNATURE FRIED CORN SQUID (~$9)
- Kinda like calamari (battered squid) that's topped with sweet corn and chili mayo sauce
- Good portion and ratio of squid/fried batter and not oily at all
- The mayo sauce and sweet corn complimented well as a balance

TAKORAISU (~$9)
- good fusion mix of steamed rice covered with seasoned ground
beef, cheddar cheese, and sour cream
- Reminds me a little bit of a Mexican taco feeling to it
- Good portion to share and ground beef was not dry

JAMES CHEESE BACK RIBS (~$37)
- one order is suggested to be enough for around 2 people, so we added another half order (~$18)
- signature dish that also comes with egg, corn, sausage, sweet potato and regular potato sides
- ribs are marinated in Korean-sauce (spicy level can be adjusted) in advanced
- staff comes over and wraps the mozzarella cheese on each of the ribs; really like the combo that gives a bit of sweet and spicy feeling to it
- portion wise was enough; especially adding it with the sides

Overall, I would say it lives up to the hype you often see. The ribs are great to taste (just a little pricey - but everything has inflated now). Recommend coming in as a group to share a few dishes - they also have daily specials on drinks.",2018-03-19 16:57:40

We ordered one round of drinks of which 3 of the 4 of were beers.  They were not at all cold.  We drank them, reluctantly, and paid the bill to get out of there as quickly as possible.  I cannot tolerate anything but ice cold beer at a sports bar, and that shouldn't even be a special or abnormal request.  What should have been a bunch of appetizers, four meals and several rounds of drinks to celebrate a partnership on a potential transaction turned into a disspointing, single round of warm beer.  We were ready to spend a good amount of money, and they didn't act like they wanted it.  So, we took our business elsehwere, which was a very pleasant and refreshing experience by a nearby competitor, who acted like they cared.

In summary, the place is a huge dissapointment. The setup is weird; you walk in and immediately are faced with a wall, as they split the front into two levels to jam in more people.  The actual bar is completely separate from the two tierd dining area.  It's not even easy to see where the bar is from the front.  The wait staff is horrid; They should really check their attitudes.  Finally, the beer is not even cold!!!

With 2 more notable options within a 3 mile radius, I cannot see myself ever spending another dime here.  And as a business owner and frequent sports bar patron, I cannot recommend this place and am absolutley shocked at the customer service this place employs.  This place cannot last long with the current staff in place.  I won't recommend it, and I can't see anyone else doing so either.  I really wanted this place to be good, but I cannot tell you how dissapointed I am.  I felt like it was a reflection on me since I recommended the place to my clients.

Sorry Cogburn's, you failed.",2017-03-07 02:48:33

Freezone is located in the heart of Koreatown, just a hop, skip and a jump away from Christie subway station. While it is not as high-end and up to date as let's say Bar+ (near Yonge and Wellesley), you are still going to have a decent enough time. The venue is on the lower floor, so you'll be walking to a basement level, but the entrance is lit up by glowing neon lights. 

Each room varies in size, but each time I have gone with a group of ten or more. The couches and tables look like something you'd find on Craiglist, but don't worry - they are clean. Honestly, it's set up like you're having a karaoke session your living room and it's kind of awesome. And let's be honest: you're here for the music. The song selections are a bit dates, but you're going to find all the classics (Wannabe by the Spice Girls: check. Semi Charmed Life by Semi-Sonic, check.)

Drinks are cheap. You can bring in your own snacks, so stop at the T&T Market ahead of time or order a pizza. Either way, you're in for a fun night. And honestly, just have fun.",2018-05-01 12:35:53

For a year now, every time I go for lunch in downtown, I end up at Harumi Sushi next door.  Noticed this was a ""signature"" Thai basil, so I wanted to try it one day.  I expected it to be better than the normal Thai Basil locations which are usually pretty good.

Walked in, sat down, put an order in for Pad See Ew with beef to go. Was excited and couldn't wait to dig in when I got back to the office.

First impression, the food looked, inadequate.  Didn't see enough noodles.  Took a bite, and the beef was very chewy, and the flavors were sub par - heavy on the sweet side which I did not expect.  Was starving so ate the little portion and finished with a disappointed and unfulfilled feeling and a bad after taste.

It's the worst experience I've had recently.  I have to assume that every Thai Basil is run completely independently.  This location ruins the brand.  Will go to the other locations but never back to this one.",2017-10-06 03:01:43

They were formerly orphans who were experimented on by an evil mad scientist. After burning him and his lab down, these mutants escaped into the woods.

There are a variety of ways to get many dishes.

The Szechuan wantons were the best I've had in town.  Spicy but in depth flavor and not too spicy.  In general on everything the spice level was just right.

Get anything they make dry chili style. It is spicy and salty but not too much and all in a good way.

Scallion pancake wasn't my favorite and they need to give you some sauce or soy for it.  Still very good and not too greasy, just in comparison to the other stuff it lacks.

Thus, sprouts Chipotle, a relatively healthy option for eating; granted, you choose your ingredients wisely.

Since this particular location is located right by UNLV, lines can get pretty long during lunch hours. They seem to handle themselves pretty well when the lunch rush comes. For Summer time, it's not too bad. During regular semester periods, lunch lines can go out the door.

Food is what you'd expect - Familiar, safe, flavors that are almost carbon copies of the thousands of other Chipotle locations out there. The only problem that I occasionally encounter is the rice, which can be a little dry at times. But hey, I'm not really eating here to impress my palette tenfold. It's simple good food that gets the job done. 

Sure, I feel like a total sheep-brain by drudging through the long lines, reciting my order by memory (chicken bowl to-go, with black beans, pico de gallo, corn salsa, a sprinkle of cheese, and lettuce). I've been here so many times, I could order this stuff with my eyes closed.

I noticed on the website that it said for parties larger than 8, there will be 18% gratuity charge added to your bill,  so when I got my bill I didn't even noticed that the 18% wasn't added , instead I looked at the total and added 5% more to it because service was great and they were good with us about the adding tables & chairs to our growing party.

  When you first walk in  there is a bar in the middle of the restaurant. A hostess greets you & invites you to order at the counter on the side. After ordering then you walk to an assigned table. When ordering our items sometimes the servers were disorganized despite being friendly. 

A manager helped us decide what burgers to get. I ordered the Good Cause burger that donates a $1 to a non-profit. All the burgers are organic, hormone free can you say hipster? There is a vegan option on the menu that my friend enjoyed with a multi-grain bun and avocado. 
Overall, I enjoyed my burger you are paying for quality  here. But the major standout was the parmesan fries a MUST order here. Next time, i will order their shakes they look like retro american shakes.

In Vegas, it's really hard to find a decent Pho place (District One Oxtail Pho is probably my favorite but it's hard to justify $14 a bowl for more than a special occasion).  

You're not really coming here for the ambiance, or service.  You're coming here for a pho fix.  It's definitely not the best I've ever had, but for the proximity to my place, the price, and the quantity, it's hard to find better.

Then, the Diamond lounge sucked. 11.11.16 was better than before, but it is never consistent, which I separately reviewed, but it is part of the hotel & casino.  I also waited to post some of my review in hopes that the Flamingo Hotel & Casino would redeem themself cause I'd like to take advantage of my free room offer.  No thanks.

The pool is ok, nothing special w/ super old plastic lounge chairs.  Horrible smoke ventilation & the bar carry's no nice wine or champagne.  Not one single bar.  The showroom has no cocktail waitresses & the bar is in the far right hidden from everyone.  I've seen three shows there.

I would say four except that the show we were scheduled for was cancelled.  The Flamingo Box Office is absolutely the worst also.  It all depends on who you get, however that too should be consistent.

As I mentioned on 10.13.16, Flamingo couldn't even call us or email that Jeff Civillio Comedy show cancelled for the rest of the year.  They email me over free rooms etc to mainly get my play, but as a courtesy they should email that the show has been cancelled. I moved my schedule around & planned on meeting friends in the Linq as mom & dad were going to attend the show. 

As I waited for the Flamingo box office manager, Sherice, the Jeff Civillio performance behind Jerrin the Diamond/7Star rep, was being advertised. Also I informed them that the cancelles show brochures were still on display.  Jerrin was kind, but the manager Sherice was of no help at all.  Paul another manager finally informed us that TR would help us better. 

Sherice never informed us of any of this until I asked her for higher management cause I'd never had such unnecessarily, rude & bad service.

Finally, I speak to a real person who should teach Sherice some customer service skills, Antoinette in TR. Now, she is the only person I will speak to at Flamingo. Five stars or 'seven stars' for her. She has what it takes to keep a client. She turned the whole situation around for us. 

Overall, I give the Flamingo one star cause there is only one of her & that is sad. I had the worst service until I met her & have given them a chance to fix it until posting this such as my Diamond lounge check ins.  They also need a remodel.

The best part of this place so far, is the bird exhibit & access to the strip & Linq.  They also have a dog park & a beautiful Makau who speaks as you enter from the valet.  Valet is also wonderful.",2016-12-08 00:11:36

  The store could use their employees more efficiently.  Albertsons is doing themselves zero favors by keeping one register manned by a human being open. If I am paying exorbitant prices, I do not want to be directed to a self checkout lane. And most of all I would appreciate it if the CSM watching the self check outs would acknowledge me. Maybe let me know that she did an override for my beer when she was doing work with a portable device. Or maybe thank me for shopping there. And maybe instead of a couple of employees talking to her, maybe they could of been working at another register.

  This Albertsons could use a remodel. Eastern Avenue at Warm Springs Road isn't Gangland Central. It is unwelcoming to walk into a store through a rotating gate structure. Its amazing how an upbeat supermarket puts me in a state of mind where I don't mind spending more. The Summerlin and College Road Albertsons are examples.

  I have little love for this Albertson's at the exact time I have love for convenience. In my situation it is in the center of a one stop errand hot spot.

My husband and I are a single car family so I often rely on this cab company to get me where I need to go. There are often times when I have no problem calling and getting a cab when I need one. However, there have been a few times where they neither show up or call to say they are not showing up. 

Like today for example. I call and they say no problem they have one in the area they would be there right away. After waiting for twenty minutes in the cold my goosebumps persuade me to wait in the vestibule for another ten minutes. I finally call back to say just forget it and the dispatcher yells at me that I wasn't there. I know where I was, I know where I told them I was and I know how long I waited, so unlike me I yell back. Hindsight that probably wasn't the nicest thing for me to do, but I was upset. 

I guess they aren't too bad if you find one of these at a cab stand, Most of the cars I have been in are old and poorly taken care of, but they do take cards.

I was worried at first as I walked by a few hipsters out front, and was pleasantly surprised that the feel was not at all pretentious hipster - but laid back hipster!  

A wide range of craft beers from all over the world are on tap, and as we discovered - there are a few Seaboard beers that have been in production since the beginning of the year.  I opted for a flight of all Seaboard beers, and decided to get some pizza from the Exchange Pizza Depot to find they would bring it inside to us at Seaboard (SWEET!!!).

The beer was good - one of the newer IPA was actually really good, and I always enjoy trying new beer and wasn't disappointed with anything.

It's been quite a while since I've been here... Waaaay back when Olivier(Baguette Cafe) was still the manager here. 2005 B.Y.(Before Yelp) to be exact. A bunch of us came out to celebrate Terri R.'s birthday, and what a great time it was!

I've only dined here for lunch and dinner, so I was excited to dine here for Sunday Brunch because breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal time. What I like about brunch is that you have both sweet and savory options available and the menu selections here did not disappoint! We started with a pastry assortment of a Blueberry Streusel Muffin, Apple Danish, Almond Croissant, and Pecan Sticky Bun. Each one had its own distinct flavor and was very good.

I must add that our waiter Homero was a SUPERSTAR from beginning to end! The service provided by him and his team of runners and busers added to our stellar dining experience. Everyone's entrees looked delicious, and I went for the Corned Beef Hash which came with two eggs and brioche toast. Wifey got the popular Croque Madame which has been on the menu since day one(I helped open the flagship location in Yountville) the taste was the same, but I think the brioche slices have gotten thinner.
My Corned Beef hash was delicious and a very generous portion too. A very good choice if you choose to dine here for brunch.

 Towards the end of our meal, we were also surprised to see that checks were split(we had a party of 15) and no auto-gratuity wasn't on the bill which is totally unheard of these days, especially on the strip, I just hate auto-grat period, and we've all dealt the calculating BS when a restaurant doesn't honor split checks when it should be part of their job...no headaches on this day, and it was done with no problem. Thanks again Terri for organizing this fun and memorable day!  ALOHA!!!

A couple of Sundays ago, the family was downtown for the weekend so it was the perfect opportunity to head down to old Montreal for a nice family meal. For the occasion, we decided to try out Le Cartet, a place that I had heard many good things about but hadn't had the chance to try yet. 

This restaurant and boutique offers breakfast and lunch as well as a takeout menu for the many workers in the area during weekdays . On the weekend, the focus switches to brunch. We arrived for the beginning of the brunch service and were able to grab one of the last tables in the back so thankfully we didn't wait long. Given the lineup that was present on our exit an hour later, we made the right call to arrive early. The space is a perfect morning spot - tons of natural lighting, plain white walls and high ceilings. It's a tight fit with everyone cramming in for brunch but still comfortable. 

The brunch menu at Le Cartet is a combination of classic brunch dishes with some extra twists. The first dish that we ordered was their Coupe Santé - Fresh fruit salad, greek yogourt, blueberries, ginger-honey organic granola and cashew nuts. Wherever they get their greek yogourt, my family would love to know because it was some of the best we've ever had. I love blueberries so that's the perfect option to pair with the yogurt and the granola was wonderful as well - a nice subtle hint of both honey and ginger. Mix everything together and you get a very nice yogurt parfait. The lightest option we tried and a hit for all of us.

The second dish we got was the Brunch Cartet - Scrambled eggs with mesclun salad, ham croissant, goat cheese and a sweet potato salmon cake. This was the most unconventional plate we ordered. I could take or leave the salad - it was good but rather unremarkable. The scrambled eggs were very done as one would hope from a breakfast/brunch place. The croissant was fresh and flaky, the ham was solid and the goat cheese was a nice creamy rich touch to a otherwise light plate. The real star in the end however was the salmon cake - nice crunch on the outside while keeping a flaky context inside. I would have loved that element to be more plentiful compared to the rest but a solid dish nevertheless.

The final dish was le Brunch des Cantons - Scrambled eggs with country ham, sausage, bacon, baked beans, toast and roasted herb potatoes cooked in duck fat. This dish was completely in my wheelhouse which makes the fact that I didn't order it all the more shocking! Great items here - all the meats were delicious and I am always a sucker with anything cooked in duck fat.

Each of these dishes came with an amuse-gueule to enjoy before the meal however we didn't get them during our meal! Our waiter, realizing his mistake, gave us a mini-bag of them on our exit - sucre a la creme. Deliciously rich and sweet - this ended up being a nice way to end the meal rather than start it.

Le Cartet was a solid brunch experience - all the dishes were well executed and the service was quick and to the point. Its location makes me a perfect starting point for a nice afternoon in Old Montreal. Whether or not I would stand in line to eat there however is a different question all together. In the end, I would easily recommend you give them a shot -  however arrive early otherwise your day in the old port will become a quick afternoon stroll.

So happy to say there is finally a great Chinese restaurant near Charlotte! It is located right near Carowinds (same exit). 

Menu has a good variety of different Chinese foods- esp. different styles. Portion size is decent, but the best part is that the food came so fast even when it was fairly busy! 

Random tidbits:
1. I love twice cooked pork but this one was more fatty than usual. If that's what you like, then go for it! 
2. Please try the drunken chicken, it was so tender and delicious! 
3. It seems like it can get busy fast due to limited seating, so it would be safe to make a reservation. 
4. Servers seem to really care about the needs of the customers, even if it's like getting me a water in a timely manner.

The Gourmet Burger was a nice, simple burger with really yummy meat. I loved my sandwich particularly. It was served with a side of pesto mayonnaise that was absolutely delicious, and the chicken and mozzarella were so yummy.

The bread pudding was good - different than many places. It was dense, and I felt it could have used a little more flavor or more variety - it was a little hard to eat after awhile.

Although alot of the reviewers say portions are small, I ordered the quinoa salad and I thought it was a huge portion for just $5. I was fairly stuffed after finishing it but I assume this may be one of the few menu items that are well worth it. Because of how cheap the menu food items are, drinks are expensive. I don't mind paying $7 for a drink if food is going to be cheap, theres gotta be a trade-off right? I got the pink lemonade which I highly recommend!

Ribeye was totally different - chef removes outer fat rim and you are left with what looks like a filet Mignon but once you cut into steak you quickly realize it is not a filet.  Not sure if it was just this piece or this is normal (again have never seen a trimmed ribeye like this) but it was not as tender as a normal cut ribeye.  Flavor was good - blackening spices not over done.  Onion soup is heavenly but you can easily remove the first layer of skin on the roof of your mouth if not careful.  Wines by glass were a very nice selection - still can not fathom why reds are served at ""room temperature""  which is close to 70 or 72 - they should be cooler.

First things first - it's a bit hard to find due to it being in the Palomar hotel. Just go to the Lobby of the Palomar (which isn't at street level FYI) and turn right. Voila. You are there. 

This was the first time I have been here for dinner, the other was for lunch. So I waited for my friend at the bar. So, for it being a pretty small bar - and I was sitting at it - it took a long time for a bar tender to come and ask what I wanted. In fact, it wasn't until my friend got there that they even asked. I would rate the bar service not so great. Another instance of trying to do side work, and not paying attention to who is at the bar. And, then we ordered two simple drinks - a glass of chardonnay and a tanqueray rocks, and that even took some serious time to get.

For starters - I would definitely recommend them. Deviled eggs are awesome, although fundamentally a little odd to get at a restaurant and not a backyard bbq. Fried green tomatoes are delish and definitely try the short rib sliders. My only issue with the short rib sliders is I am not such a fan of the sweet rolls, but the meat is awesome.

For dinner, I think I am a little hung up here. I can't say I loved the stuffed chicken. (Does not appear to be on the menu anymore.) Turned out a bit dry for me. But the accompaniments were great - cauliflower, veggies, etc. 

Overall, it's a neat place. I like the setting, I am just not sure of the food. Appears to be a southern twist - so I am thrown off by the trout, shrimp, etc., as they just aren't my thing. But I think it's a good place to go for a drink and some apps.",2016-06-16 21:28:40

It had been a surprisingly cold spring day with hail and light snow after a short Carolina winter. I decided to try Bogs since it has been on my list of Highly Rated by Yelpsters.

The man at the counter was polite and efficient. I happily carried home my turkey sandwich with the au jus on the side. Eating it took me back decades to when the entire family went to the corner bar to cash paychecks, play the bowling game, watch television, and eat wet sandwiches. Bogs' sandwich was dressed a bit more but similar in taste not in price.

Unlike others I did not find the sandwich to be of huge proportions. The price is the same as an entire dinner at many mom and pop eateries. It was a good sandwich but not as great as all of Ohio City seems to think. I suspect I will try another sandwich before the next time it hails.",2012-04-12 13:03:35

We were here for a party with 12-14 people. Everyone arrived at 8:30, with the birthday boy coming in at 9.

Only drinks were offered until he had arrived and said all his hellos (which took time.) It would have been a great opportunity for them to up-sell some apps while we were waiting, but no one offered (or was available) to take a food order until nearly 9:30 PM. Everyone noticed this.

Drinks are very expensive - cocktails especially.

I paid nearly $20 for my jambalya which was quite tasty - I like a lot of spice - and the sausage and meats were cooked really nicely. It was piping hot (I always notice this.) But to be fair - this is essentially a casserole dish - and $20 felt pretty steep. The portions were massive and most people at our long table didn't come close to finishing their food. Reduce the price, reduce the portion, reduce the pure waste. Half my bowl was empty - and I am a GOOD eater.

There was a man playing an out-of-tune upright piano and playing covers. He was working hard to be accommodating (asking people what they'd like to hear before he started playing) but he was too loud, and to be frank, not very good - so we were all yelling at each other across the table.

We had to leave slightly earlier than others, and so asked the server to split out our two entrees and four drinks. This took 10-15 minutes and she was clearly upset about being asked to do this. Both my partner and I have been servers in fine dining restaurants. This. Is. Not. Hard. Or time consuming. I have absolutely no patience for servers who act like the sky is falling every time you ask them to split a cheque. Especially when all the meals have been auto-grat'd 20%!!

This reaction in combination with the lacklustre service to that point was sort of the last straw and we likely won't return - and keep going to Southern Accent instead. Most of the people we were with were not impressed by the service.

I understand it can be challenging to wait on large parties, but an experienced staff will recognize this ahead of time when the reservation is made, and have sufficient support in place.",2011-08-31 14:01:14

After an early morning appointment, I became quite hungry and decided to stop by the nearest breakfast place I could find. Eggspectation was right in front of my face. Having been to other locations of the same restaurant, never would I have assumed to have such a terrible experience, and meal. 

Upon walking into the restaurant at 9:30am on a Monday morning, I was quite surprised to see that it was quite busy. Even more surprised after we left. I'll explain more as to why.
Our hostess had little to no manners, poor enthusiasm and bad attitude. I understand it's early in the morning and you may not want to be there, but it's your job! 
Upon directing us to our table(Table for two) the kitchen staff kept staring in a very ignorant way. Yes, I'm abnormally short in height, that gives you no reason to stare! Again, poor manners. 

Once we sat down right across from the kitchen, our waiter approached us. No hello, no good morning, no smile. Just the simple question of ""What would you like to eat?"" So, we politely answered with our order. By now, we wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. The only thing that kept us there was hunger. 

While waiting for our meal(20+mins for two dishes!) Scramble eggs with cheese and waffles with fruit. Which included ""real"" maple syrup.  We noticed the manager raising his voice and showing a great level of anger towards his kitchen staff. Very unprofessional to do such thing in front of your customers! 
At the same time, the same manager had to remind his staff which included our waiter to ask if we wanted toast? If we wanted coffee? Who doesn't want toast with their scramble eggs?!  Anywho.. Our meal finally arrived and it was lukewarm.. I was no longer in the mood to complain. I simply ate it with a smile. The fruit was unripened, taste it like a raw starchy potato. The waffles were warm and crispy, sadly it included a strong aftertaste of artificial vanilla flavour.  As for the maple syrup... It was NOT real. Real maple syrup does not taste light corn syrup with the thickness of corn syrup. Do not fool me by saying it's real and do not charge me $15.00 for a dish that is not worth more than $6.00. 
Eggspectations, please do your research on what REAL maple syrup is! If you cannot afford to serve it to your clients, do not promote it. As a foodie, I can surely taste the difference. Nice try in fooling me!
When it came time to pay, the debit/credit card machine gave you two choices for tip. 20% or 25% along with the choice of a dollar amount if you wished to do that. I cannot stand when others decide for me how much I should tip. 
 A tip is a reward for the having done a good job. I felt the job was poorly executed and deserved 10% out of kindness of mine, along with me never returning to this location again. 
I strongly suggest you to find any other place that will be far better than Eggspectation. Especially after paying $45 for two people.",2017-03-30 00:05:47

I also noticed it had pretty much none of the teriyaki sauce on it, in my opinion that's what makes that sandwich.  It was also pretty cold, it's not necessarily meant to be a ""hot"" sandwich but the vegan chicken was not even warm let alone hot which made it seem undercooked and chewy so it was all I could taste, it ended up making me lose my appetite half way through and I ended up throwing away the other half because my stomach felt upset.

OPTIONS AND EQUIPMENT: There were lots of options for items to paint, such as vases, plates, jewellery containers, mugs, ornaments, pot spoon holders etc. They had lots of different paint colours to choose from and all different sizes of brushes.

Available for use is also stamps, sponges, stencils of letters, shapes etc. There was also glass fusing available. 
 

AMBIENCE/SETTING: They had a good music station playing, to listen to while you're having good conversation or quietly concentrating on your fine painting details.


STAFF: The staff was really friendly in explaining how everything worked, then they left us to do our own thing and enjoy ourselves, but they were always available to answer questions.


PREP AND CLEAN UP: We didn't have to do any prep or clean up and there was no ""studio fee"" like other businesses. If you get any paint on your hands, it washes off really super easy. No hand scrubbing required.  


BTW: They also have a party room. Oh! And there is no sign above the store; its just on the windows. It's beside ""Scholars"" near the McDonalds.


CONs: The only thing about this shop is that unfortunately they don't take reservations.

In the house, there's a gift shop packed with trinkets and tchotchkes of all kinds, and then of course there's the tea house. There are seatings (indoors and outdoors) at 11:30am and 1:30pm, Wednesday through Saturday (March through October), and bookings are recommended but not essential. We sat outside on the patio overlooking the wetlands and enjoyed the most leisurely lunch in the cool breeze under the shade of the trees. The waitresses could not have been friendlier, service was attentive, and the food -- all of it organic with plenty of vegan options -- was delicious. Our soups (the cauliflower, and the gazpacho) were fantastic and so were our mains (the sausage with sauerkraut, and the macrobiotic plate packed with salads and fruits). But it was the dessert that really blew us away -- best flaky apple strudel and real hand-ground chocolate mousse I've ever had. The bill for 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 2 desserts, and 1 iced Assam tea came to $65, so it wasn't a cheap lunch, but it was totally worth it for the quality of food, service, and most of all the experience that you get.

I asked for medium spice and that made the dish more interesting.  I loved the presentation because it comes in this dome like fried egg, that's stuffed with the pad Thai, and when you dive into it with your fork and spoon, that's right a spoon, no knife, you get this delicious aroma of thai spices and heat.

Cliff Notes: a racist chef that cooks extremely bland food. 

To start the chef told us he's 21 and just applied for the job and somehow got it after a few years in other restaurants kitchens with no actual culinary experience. The chef was a complete racist, he then slanted the eyes on smiley face and said ""hey look its a Chinese face now"" (this is supposed to be a nice meal, not a clan meeting Walt Kowalski).  Following that, all of the seafood was completely over cooked and he didn't put butter or seasoning on the chicken and steaks (which he wouldn't let go of the fact of us eating rare steak saying it was gross and he can't do that).  The egg tricks got raw egg all over my shirt and ended up with shells in the eggs.   Awful dining experience and will never return again, Sapporo has now earned my business.

ML Tavern is affiliated with Hyde Park. I initially had worries about the steak as Hyde Park in Beachwood had been off with getting the temp right on their steaks recently. The steak here however, did not disappoint and had everything one could want in a steak -- a well charred, caramelized outer shell and a juicy, tasty, marbly interior. They had served it hot with the ""doneness"" right on the money that night. There are different sauces to choose from, and this one was served oscar style, topped with bernaise, asparagus and crab meat. Trout Almondine was well-executed with the skin very crispy on the outside, yet retaining the sweet, flaky texture of the fish.

The place was well appointed and made to look like an English Pub with the wood paneling and all. There is outdoor seating, and free valet service which I felt was pointless other than maybe to give it a high-end feel. Our server was attentive and friendly.

The brunch menu was kind of limited  (http://www.mesagrill.com/lasvegas/pdf/mesalvbrunch.01.08.10.pdf).  We decided on the following:

1)  TIGER SHRIMP TAMALE with CREAMED CORN (not on the above menu) - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=bZdGAk4KyioloJNNm9GiIA) This was quite good.  I'm not a fan of tamale but I enjoyed the creamed corn and the shrimps (total of 4!).

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=ZzxIYMiVP3O1osnjdF4Hfg) I ordered it well done.  The salmon was very tender with good flavor.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=QQ6QbO2CmSWDD7l9OwudAw) This was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  My fiance gave it 1 star.  Enough said.  

Service was spotty.  At first it was really good, but then it just went down hill.  Like I said earlier, our food must have sat on the kitchen counter for awhile b/c my salmon was barely lukewarm and my fiance's sandwich (the pork tenderloin) was cold and hard!

But the original section is cute with the brick walls and laid back decor.  It's a casual place to chill with friends.

I wish I could give different ratings for the different meals, because I think it's a 5/5 for lunches, and 3/5 for dinners. Is the quality that much less at dinner, you ask? No, not substantially different, but the value is not as great at lunch.  

Lunch offers everything from BBQ chicken sandwich to the delicious cajun spiced Adam Bomb burger to chile glazed salmon (my hub's fave) to good salads (I add med rare salmon on my salad) to their daily specials. The Daily Specials are around $10-12 and include a large main entree with sides and a strawberry lemonade and are a big meal for not a lot of $. Their homemade kettle chips are amazing!!  Their desserts are also awesome. Coca cola cake, mile high PB pie, fruit cobblers and their really good cookies if they have them. Get the cherry white chocolate chip one if they have it. Yum! Definitely a great, popular spot for lunch with fresh alternatives. 

Dinner, however, is pretty much the same food as lunch, avec shrimp and grits, pork tenderloin and other specials. I just haven't been blown away at dinner.  But the cost is $16-$26  per plate, so I have to really be craving something to pay that. I'd like to see the average dinner price be just under $20 so be a range of $13-21 and I'd go more often.  

Service is always extremely friendly unlike its neighbor who shall remain nameless. I believe they are serving Saturday brunch but not Sunday, which is when I want it. They also cater, which is handy. I'd skip the hummus though.",2010-12-01 14:55:50

I should have said something but I did not. The other person I was with had the same thing and his was fine. Desert : devils food cake - probably the best part of the meal along with my tea. Again, it could have been better without the dried fruit which made is oddly sweet. So, all in all I am going to say it was 'ok' and I probably will give them another chance. Another thing that was quite odd, we asked for a normal menu and they basically did not have one. I mean if you are doing restaurant week and want people to come back? Have a menu for people to see?

Unfortunately, Thailicious was only Thaiokayish for me today. First, walking into the restaurant, the setting seemed very wrong to me, A table right by the front door and the front desk set back from it, so everyone entering is literally passing right next to your table, never mind passing it, they wait right next to you to be seated. Okay, perhaps trivial. Tables are set so close to one another you cant have a private conversion with your date. We were brought water right away, good start, orders taken promptly thereafter. Wife ordered Pad Thai with tofu, I ordered eggplant with chicken. But I also ordered the crispy spinach appetizer. So my wife's plate shows up around 10 minutes later and she is waiting for mine before she starts. I encourage her to enjoy it while its still hot, she noticed it didn't come with crushed peanuts as its suppose to. Another 5 minutes pass by before she could ask for them. My meal finally arrives. So for flavor of food I'll give it 4 stars but service is low 3. So now we have our meals and half way through them, my appetizer shows up. Personally, I should have said take it back.

I've already been a handful of times and while I admit, it's on the pricey side, I'll pay more for organic, local, healthy cuisine any day.  Be warned, however: the parking lot can get crowded during lunch, but it's worth it to park farther away or be patient and wait for a spot... 

Once you step inside Flower Child, you'll find friendly service and tons of menu options for both adults and kids.  (I still want to take my kids in to see if they like the kiddie options, but I've seen others enjoying).  

It's a fast casual concept, so order at the counter and find your table and your food will be brought to you.  That is, of course, after a pit-stop to fill your drink cup with your choice of three different teas and / or three different lemonades.  I suggest mixing and making your own unique version of an Arnold Palmer.  Free refills included!

The Asian Avocado Salad with Chicken or Salmon is my latest go-to order for lunch, but I don't think you can go wrong here... just order whatever sounds good and know you'll be nourishing your body with healthy ingredients.  You've gotta feel good about that!

As an afterthought worth sharing, I did order the Raw Local Veggie appetizer a couple of times in the hopes that it would compare to True Food Kitchen's Crudite appetizer, but sadly, it does not.  The Tzatziki at Flower Child is not good at all.  I'd suggest serving with the black olive tapenade like TFK and/or getting the TFK tzatziki recipe instead.

Lastly, if you're looking to bring food in for your family, friends, or a small gathering, Flower Child does offer a ""Family Dinner"" option that seems reasonable.  I look forward to checking that out sometime soon.

What I had in mind, try out their awesome steak and their fried chicken... however, it turns out they are only served on weekdays. Ratzzz.

So we got the bbq platter for 2 with ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  We got the coleslaw and beans as a side.  So the highlights... I guess I'll have to say brisket and beans.  The briskets were done well, but I still like Barque's probably best.  The ribs as stated here aren't fall off the bone which we have all been spoiled with.  It's tough when you're accustom to fall off the bone to eat dry ribs.  I felt the flavour wasn't there and could have been smoked for longer.  The pulled pork was also a little drier than we have expected.  The good thing is that their sauces are pretty good, so feel free to go nuts.  The coleslaw was average but the beans, they were good.  

The servers were attentive and friendly.  The vibe in the place is your neighborhood come as you are type of feeling, which we both liked.  However, before finalizing my thoughts on this place, i will be back to try their steak and fried chicken.  For smoked foods, I wasn't super impressed... but as stated here by many Yelpers, their steak is danggg good and that's what I wanna eat.  I'll be back and when I'm back, STEAK ME!!!",2013-07-23 15:26:35

Who doesn't love Korean BBQ? plus All you can eat? I am there. I checked out Korean Grill House on a Saturday night but thankfully made a reservation at 8:15 so we got to avoid the long lineup.

We decided to go with All You Can Eat Regular for $14.95 which includes Pork, Beef, Chicken, Beef Ribs, Ox Tongue, Ox Liver, Salmon, Squid and Fish Fillet.

I saw that many people were having drinks, but I decided to just get sprite. Just the thought of the extra heat on my face (asian flush) from the alcohol PLUS the grill, would be too much for me. Note that all fountain drinks are free refill.

They first gave us rice, soup and all types of meat plus the side dishes when we decided to order All You Can Eat. Sidedishes are tofu, potatoes, kimchi, beansprout and pickled radish. They were all pretty decent for a All You Can Eat restaurant. After the first round, they gave us a chart sheet to fill out to order more.

* Watered down sweet soy sauce to dip the meat in
* Beef is surpringsly tender and overall well seasoned
* Pork is average but the sauce was a little too sweet
* Chicken takes awhile to cook and it just tasted like teriyaki chicken
* I was surprised to see beef tongue on the menu. 
* They are thinly sliced and marinated in sauce. 
* The tongue doesn't take very long to cook and it was quite delicious

I enjoyed the short ribs the most. The marinade was little too strong (sweet & salty) and some of the meat pieces were very fatty but it was pretty good with rice Rice was much needed since all of the meat are marinated and the flavors are really strong.

Service is pretty decent, you just need to wave them down cause they won't ask you if you need anything first. I would say that the only thing that was bugging me is that the meat was taking FOREVER to cook. Also, remember that you can ask them to change the grill for you if it gets too messy and turns black. Plus remember to make reso when you visit this restaurant, I left around 9:30'ish and there was still a long lineup outside.

Summary: Korean BBQ can get quite pricey if you go to Korean restaurants and eat till you are full. If you aren't too picky about the quality of meat and a little bit of MSG, Korean Grill House isn't that bad once in awhile. For $14.95 it will def fill you up. Just remember that you will end up walking out like you swallowed BBQ meat.",2012-01-10 01:17:30

We started off with drinks including Bloody Mary's which were well-made and spicy. Next were the appetizers. We  ordered zucchini fritters, hummus, and 18 oysters. The zucchini fritters were light, airy and not oily. The hummus was good although it's hard to really mess up hummus. The oysters were very fresh, and interesting in that they were very small. The oysters cost $2.45 each.

For the main meal, I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich on an onion roll. It had a wonderful coleslaw type of dressing and was joyful to eat. Others in our party ordered jambalaya, steak, chicken stroganoff, and fish and chips. We all tried each other's food and seem to agree that everything was excellent.  

Although we were stuffed, we ordered the  chocolate peanut butter dessert. It was nothing like I have ever seen. It's consistency was almost like a thick soup. Extremely decadent, it really hit the spot. Definitely more than enough to share with two or three people.

This place was the ONLY place in the valley that could meet my stringent 4-point criteria for fajita perfection.

1) Tortillas must be freshly made in house and of the thick and chewy variety.  CHECK!  As much as I love me a paper thin authentic tortilla to sop up posole or machaca, when it comes to fajitas, I need what I have now learned are sometimes dubbed Texas tortillas that are pillowy, warm and slightly chewy.  Fajitas makes them with skill.  Love.

2) The chicken or steak should be grilled, preferably over mesquite.  CHECK!  Charred goodness awaits you, and those guys behind the grill are masters of their craft.

3) Steak should be able to be ordered medium rare or rare.  CHECK!  Although you can't specify the temperature of the meat, if you order the Cadillac Fajitas made of beef tenderloin, they come out blissfully mooing in the center.  Heaven.

4) Vegetables should be limited to peppers and onions.  No broccoli, mushrooms, squash, whatever, unless you are ordering vegetarian fajitas.  CHECK!  Ok, I know this is nitpicky, but I don't want my meat, pepper and onion experience to be sullied with broccoli.

Additionally, if you like shrimp, ORDER THE SHRIMP FAJITAS.  I don't know what they marinate them in or how they cook them, but those babies are like crack.  Pure, unadulterated crack.  Other bonuses - the portions are huge without sacrificing quality, making the whole experience a killer value.  You literally get a raft of guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and cheese to top your fajitas, making a half pound portion plenty to share.  Or don't share and take home the leftovers.  Chips and salsa are yummy, taking up far too much fajita space in your stomach before you eat, the yellow rice is fluffy and delicious, and though the beans are forgettable, the margarita is potent enough to keep you happy regardless.

We found this place in a moment of frustration at the fact that we couldn't locate the perfect fajitas in the Valley.  So what do we do?  We Yelp ""best fajitas in phoenix"" and get (duh!) a restaurant called Fajitas.  If it were a snake, it would've bit us.  We still make the trip to Glendale just to feast at this place and swear to play a round of putt-putt at Castles and Coasters afterwards to walk off the excessive fullness.

Last night (Sunday, 5:30pm): Painfully long service even though the place was 1/3 full. Beers and margaritas took 15 min to come out from time ordered. Inattentive service by our befuddled waiter, who seemed like he might have had a few joints prior to work. Food (tacos and salad) took 25+ min to arrive from time ordered. As a table we all felt abandoned. 

We had invited another couple to join us last night and had been talking up Otro for weeks one of our delicious favorites. The food was fine but frankly maybe a few notches below our many prior visits. 

Bottom line: something seems to be ""off"" at Otro. Someone's not paying attention to the operation. This wasn't just a bad night. We never saw a manager *ever* (at past Otro visits last year, we always had an enthusiastic manager come over to say hello and check on things). 

Some people might give Otro the benefit of the doubt - maybe they were just having a rough night. But my guess is that there are big management issues that are spinning at this once great spot.

I liked this layout because all the cold items were on the periphery of the store unlike the location at Crocker Park where I think people end up ganging up on each other between the produce, dairy, meat, prepared foods, etc.  

This place was CRAZY BUSY at 3:30pm on a Friday afternoon....very reminiscent of my Chicago Trader Joe's days.  Honestly, I was a little uncomfortable with the amount of people in this tiny store.  Also reminiscent of the Chicago TJ's were the kids pushing little people carts & the parent's completely unaware of where the kid was in the isle or who they were blocking.

Aside from all that, I found ""mostly"" what I needed and what I didn't find a typically perky TJ's employee told me with a nice smile.  I think the wine section here seems better than the Crocker Park locale too.

-prices are similar to JetBlue and Delta
-sometimes awesome full sized headphones are provided.

When you first get there, you think that this isn't going to be good due to the surrounding businesses and the small lobby area but you will be surprised.  From the lobby, we get walked into the back room where they have several areas curtained off for your privacy.  Although you can hear other people getting worked on, it wasn't hard for us to get into a ""zen"" mode.

I guess we got the couples deal cause my wife and I were placed in the same area.  It contained 2 beds that are lower than normal with a bucket placed at the foot.  We soak our feet in the bucket while we wait for the technicians.  

When they get there, I am totally surprised that they ask for me to take my shirt and jewelry off.  I learn later on that my wife did not have to take any clothes off so it might just be the men.  A blanket is placed over my body and she begins the foot massage.  Of course, it feels like heaven and I begin to fade away.  After what seems to be an hour, she ask me to move up on the bed so my legs no longer hang off.  She then proceeds to give me a full body massage for what seems to be another hour.  In reality it wasn't an hour but it felt so awesome, it felt like it.  Now, I don't know if it was part of the deal to get the body massage and my wife didn't know either.

The menu changes almost daily (this is the epitome of farm to table - they base their menu around what they can get from the market THAT DAY).  I don't know if they do the whole sustainable organic thing, but you can be sure they got the local part down.  I had the shrimp bisque, which was quite tasty.  But the best part by far was the duck breast.  I really enjoyed that!  And a couple of amuses thrown in... quite nice.  Dessert was good too, but not as good as the main.

It's BYOB, so be prepared.  Also, if you want to make a reservation, they really make you jump through hoops - you can't just leave a mesg, and have them call you back to confirm - they make YOU call back after receiving THEIR mesg to confirm.

I let the owner know that I expected them to cover the cost to have Apple repair the hard drive and felt most comfortable with our conversations being documented so all communication must happen via email, and was refused.

We took advantage of the ""after 9"" menu, where you get an appetizer, a main and a coffee/tea for $25. The selection is obviously limited and sides aren't included. The filet mignon is $10 extra and each side is $5 extra.

At Moishes, they serve you a complimentary bread basket with butter, pickles and coleslaw. YUM - I love their pickles and coleslaw. I enjoyed the salmon tartare appetizer though it's a little on the bland side. I got their filet mignon butterflied, which was well cooked but not the best filet mignon I've had. 

Their special chicken is really good - the seasoning is delicious. The peppercorn gravy that comes with the steak frites/monte carlo is divine. The monte carlo potato itself is a must-try but very heavy so maybe share it with others. I would avoid the fries, average when compared to the whole meal.

We got some decaf coffee to finish off the meal and my brother got a delicious piece of chocolate cake for his b-day. The waiter was a little sarcastic but we didn't mind it; the service was ok. And btw this is a very loud restaurant.

We ended up paying $240 for 6 people without drinks. Everyone enjoyed their meal and found the food delicious! Would probably go back for another occasion to enjoy the ""after 9"" special.

Azure is considered a ""party"" pool, but you also have to understand that this is a super mellow version of a vegas pool party.  It's perfect if you just wanna relax in the sun and have some drinks after a hard night in vegas.  Of course, you'll still be crazy drinking here, but the crowd doesn't go buck wild.  So if your sole reason for coming here includes dancing up on drunk women in the pool, you're better off going to Rehab/TaoBeach/Encore/WetRepublic.  In terms of capacity, we went on a Saturday and it seemed like all the cabanas were filled, as well as most of the daybeds/loungers...but it was far from being packed.

Our party of 10 guys ended up here, which wasn't such a bad deal at $1000 minimum, considering we DID have 10 guys and 0 girls (bachelor party).  $1000 wasn't too hard to spend because we ate lunch here as well.  

The final tally includes the 20% sales tax + gratuity.  Just keep that in mind so you don't expect some odd number to be charged onto your credit card.

Anyways, know what to expect at Azure and you'll have a pretty grand time as the service was excellent, wolfgang puck menu satisfied our hunger, music was poppin', and the booze was flowing.  

Quick tips: 
Minimum $1000 for a cabana with 10 guys, which has 4 pool loungers and seating inside the cabana.  10 heads is the perfect amount of people, anymore and there'd be no place to sit.  We had a good location next to the main pool.  
24 beers = $180
Punch bowl Mojito = $200 , Can fill about 30 cups (more watered down at the end because of the melting ice)...but make sure you ask for a ladle. Probably the best deal here in terms of booze.

I've been here twice, about 3 years apart.  The first time was with a friend after we got impatient waiting for the more rowdy of our group to make it to dinner.  We each had an entree, and I honestly can't remember what it was.  Not because I was under any sort of influence, it was simply forgettable food.  I'm pretty sure I only drank water, and still paid about $12.  I was unimpressed, but grateful there was somewhere easy to grab some food.

My second experience was better.  At 2am, after a night of clubbing, few things feel better than a big bowl of pho.  BF and I split a basic order of the miracle soup and some spring rolls.  Both were very good and hit the spot.  I'm not saying it's as good as some local asian restaurants, but it did the trick.  

I could swear it was the same waitress both times.  She said barely a word, stopped by only as often as she needed to, and left us to eat in peace.

We are inside and the staff we super friendly, attentive, and fast. The food came out fresh and hot and it was my first time ordering the lemonade and it was so tasty and refreshing.

Let me start off by saying I am a loyal Raising Canes fan. I literally eat this during every lunch break since I've discovered it (I am not from LV and never heard of Raising Canes)

If I were to rate the food it would be 5/5 no doubt, this is my favorite fast food joint.

However, when visiting this East Flamingo location I was very disappointed and left upset by the rude ""customer service"" I had in the drive thru. I always go to the one near my workplace on St Rose and they treat their guest excellently. Well during my drive thru visit the lady helping us out had us repeat our order several times and then when we corrected her she would say ""that's what I said"" when she didn't... When we asked to substitute something she said ""no you can't do it"" in a snarky tone.. might I add that I've done it before at the other location. Then at the window she just came across as snobby and not wanting to assist us.

I wasn't wild about the mole sauce, to be honest, but the ranchero and the verde worth definitely delish. I scooped up the sauce with the rice that accompanied the dish, and ended the feast pretty satisfied. 

If I were to go back, I'd take a long look at the specials, or perhaps some of the more esoteric, uncommon menu items. I saw the soup come to the table, and that looked pretty great. And even though it's a Mexican restaurant, the best looking dish we saw was a steak. Looks like they do a 10oz steak with a Mexican twist (peppers, served with tortillas) and that could make for a change of pace.

The space was super cool. Remarkably casual, even though it's very well appointed and the servers were on top of things. We had a large group, and there's plenty of space, especially with that patio now open.

It was just what I needed after a long day of travel. Enough swanky that I feel like the trip was worth it, but comfortable enough (with comfort-esque Mexican food) that I could still relax. The strip mall looking location belies the comfort and class inside, that's for sure.",2017-01-31 06:57:02

If you like sandwiches, the cuban sandwich is very rich and tasty.  I also recommend the Grilled bbq spare ribs.  Decadent.  Chicken Tortilla soup is also very tasty

If you are looking to lose or maintain weight, they have a pretty decent salad selection.  Ahi tuna with Kale and mushrooms is pretty solid.  So is the grilled chicken salad.

carrot cupcake
vanilla cake
banana donut

...one of these things is not like the other...

Just kidding. Those are the four items I tried at Nami. Overall I was impressed and went home happy. The treats were moist and delightful to eat while chatting with company. I will be back for sure. 

- carrot cupcake is a definite winner with it's slivers of carrots
- banana donut takes second because of the real banana goodness it gave off and ! it was topped with nuts !
- peanut cookie was okay, but PEANUT flavor wasn't coming through as strong as I like
- vanilla slice takes last place because even though it was decorated with icing and a small snicker doodle, there was no texture to the cake layers

The ratio of main ingredients in Nami's recipes was perfect so whoever does the baking has something good going on. Many vegan pastries I've tasted give off a distinctive after-taste of poor quality oils. Thankfully, I didn't taste that in Nami's goods. 

On a side note, though, seriously - the icing is ridiculous. Too sweet and way too much!

It's a bit tricky finding the place from the road. Just know you have to find a building with a blue roof and drive all the way inside the parking lot because BATL is at the very end. Upon entering the establishment 10 minutes early, we were greeted and asked to sign a couple waivers. You then walk to the throwing area. Turns out my group was the only group throwing that afternoon so I had no reason to be anxious. We were introduced to our instructor/supervisor Carly, who provided each of us with two throwing practice lessons/sessions. One thing I want to note is that if you are a beginner, it is good to follow what the instructors say at first, but if what they say isn't working for you, request to learn how to practice differently (i.e. ask to practice throwing with one hand). The way the instructor throws won't work for everyone, I've noticed. After the two practice rounds, my group started an internal tournament. There are 3 throwing sessions. Each throwing session you are BATLing your opponent 1-on-1 to see who gets the higher amount of points. You get 10 throws per throwing session. I lost all of mine, but still had a lot of fun! In the end, out of the 4 people who had the highest amount of points, only 1 of them was throwing it the way that Carly taught us all to throw. The winner of our tournament was someone who never axe-threw before and won by throwing the axe with one hand! I had a blast and when it came to payments, I asked for my $100 to pay for myself ($42.86+tax) and to be reduced for the other 9 throwers so that they each had a small fee taken off their final payment.

We ordered our drinks, waited awhile and then after sitting around for 10 minutes after that just looking around and rubbernecking for our servers-they finally took our order. The food came out at different times so one person would get a hot entree dish 10 minutes before another person would get their sushi, then three minutes later another person would get their sushi and so on.

 I ordered two rolls and as said before, it was mediocre. The salmon and tuna tasted rubbery and just not as fresh as I've had before at Pisces or even other sushi establishments in Charlotte.

My wife and I purchased a car from pinnacle nissan, the car is great.  I haggled for 6 hours and I know the deal we received was very good.  The problem is the people that work there.  There was a small item that needed fixed, the gm at the time told me he scheduled an appointment in service.  When I called to confirm there was no appointment made and the gm had been fired.  Our sales guy also left. Pinnacle nissan would not honor his promise to fix a small dent in the door.  The gentleman who wrote our paperwork was completely clueless. He kept trying to add hidden coverages on the call.  I finally had to tell him that we were going to walk from the deal.  The funniest part was he didn't know how to take the 3k in coverage off my invoice! His justification was that over the life of the loan it wasn't that much money.

It was as if my coffee house dreams had come true. 

Their menu consists of craft brews, a few cocktails and wines, coffee of all types, and lunch items. It was very inexpensive compared to most coffee houses that I frequent. The sandwiches looked light but satisfying, although I did not get to try one.

I didn't have a specific taste for anything on this night, but my guy really wanted chicken and dumplings and had heard good things about them here. We started with an order of zucchini cakes and he had the roasted red pepper tomato soup. I had one of the cakes and must say it was one instance where I didn't mind that I was eating zucchini.  I didn't try the soup, but he cleaned the bowl, so it must've been good! For dinner I ended up with a chopped salad as I didn't want anything as heavy as stew or dumplings. It was yummmmy! The champagne vinaigrette was so bright, it was literally like sunshine in my mouth; loved it!  It was a great portion and I finished all my veggies... Mom would be so proud.  =)

Service could not have been better. Our service team was attentive but not annoying. Everything was timed perfectly, dishes cleared properly, etc. 

I started with the black and blue martini. Gin and blue cheese stuffed olives with a sprig of rosemary. It was good but the rosemary was overpowering. Gin is so aromatic already, I felt like it was ruined with the rosemary. I quickly pulled it out and enjoyed the rest. 

They bring out a complimentary bread basket. Pretty basic with two types of bread and regular butter. Nothing special. 

For my appetizers I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. They were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. I also had a wedge salad. It was good but pretty standard as far as wedge salads go. I have had better. 

The steak that I ordered was great. New York strip medium rare. It was done perfectly and had great flavor. You can choose peppercorn or some type of glaze on your steak. I chose peppercorn but should have ordered it plain. They bring out three kinds of sauces with the steaks, so it's probably better to try the steak plain and add sauce on your own. It didn't disappoint though. 

For sides I had baby brussels sprouts with pear and bacon (a special that night) and also had potatoes gratin. Delicious!! 

Dessert was a very slight let down. I had the pumpkin creme brûlée. It was more like pumkinless creme brûlée but still good as far as a creme brûlée goes. 

They have nice restrooms within the restaurant. Anyone familiar with Las Vegas restaurants knows that having restrooms within the restaurant itself is a treat. They also provide Molton Brown soap and lotion. Nice touch!

rsPiYMqfshrrU8qPQBp19g,ITa3vh5ERI90G_WP4SmGUQ,NFm869_w6cvVaWaNpAzjeA,5,9,8,5,"So I got drunk one night in Charlotte and made some new friends.* Whenever there was a lull in our magniloquent discourse on the finer points of the economy, microbiology and NASCAR, I'd ask them where I might find the best meal in Charlotte. There was a lot of hemming and hawing from most people, but about 40% of them instantly pointed me toward Soul.

That kind of percentage can't be ignored, so when I was able to drag myself out of bed the next morning, I headed over for brunch. 

I must admit that Soul and I got off on the wrong foot because they refused to serve me liquor before noon. However, once our server was able to gasp out (past my hands wrapped around his windpipe) that it was North Carolina's ridiculous law rather than their personal decision, we moved past it. And everything from that moment on was perfect, because everything included their shrimp and grits. 

Our lovely waiter Marlon sold me on the dish, and it truly was architecturally interesting as he described. Instead of a bowl of shrimp and grits (as I'm used to), it was more like fried grit cubes with the shrimp and sauce poured over. And it was beautiful, rich, salty amazingness. The only downside was that I wanted more. (Her french toast panini was nothing to sneeze at either, but I'm a savor-tooth tiger to the core.)

I'm sure it would've been a better brunch with a bloody mary, but this was a meal I'll eat every time I'm in Charlotte, and you probably should too.

On previous times I've been here the experience has been more than sub-par... but today I couldn't figure out what to eat so I landed here.  Figured there's a banner outside that said under new management so I'd give 'em yet another try.
    On first glance the joint looks glammed up a bit more than on previous trips here.  You know a lil extra decor here, a lil decor there... I end up making my way to an available table, got my drink order in then made my way to the buffet line.  At that exact point I realize my mistake of giving this place another shot.
    I opted for the broccoli beef, bbq pork, general Tsao chicken and some vegetable fried rice.  All except the rice looked fairly unpleasing (like they been left in the tray too long and yet those were their best options).  Got back to my table and dug into the pork and found it was so overdone, it was dry and hard.  The beef was so rubbery, the broccoli way overcooked and dark.  And the rice although good looking was so hard and undercooked that I almost broke teeth and lost a few fillings.  Left that after a few bites, then noticed I'd get some shrimp they had just taken out and figured I'd take advantage of something fresh.  Fresh it was and salty as heck too, making me sip my Pepsi away in two gulps to counter the Salton Sea I had just ingested.
    In all this not a good place to eat.  I've been here 3 times.  As the old saying goes, ""3 strikes and you're out.""  Yes it's under new management, but it must be the same crummy cooks and perhaps the same motto applies to this management of leaving old food in the tray and making it look so unappetizing that they don't care.  They must be rich to not care to make a quality product, scratch that, decent product.

j1yHSfzl0q4QAveTeCeueQ,u0JoB0Vm1ZhwF8nysxPnfg,FFGoEGNDGdYc9ZHqfkcB3Q,3,8,5,4,"It breaks my heart to do this because at the rate I patronize this place you'd think I'd be upping the stars... and I WOULD if they would just fix a couple of things. Instead, I find myself very frustrated and I must remove a star from my review. 

Two reasons: 

Here's the crux of my beef: I like the peanut butter flavor. They offer chocolate peanut butter every Monday but I don't want CHOCOLATE peanut butter. Mind you, they have chocolate frosty every day AND, this past Monday, they had sugar-free chocolate in the SAME MACHINE as chocolate peanut butter (AND chocolate frosty was still an option in another machine!). 

I haven't seen the plain peanut butter in quite a while, and I know I'm not the only person who's been asking for it. (It's especially good with any of the berry flavors - like a PB&J!) The fact that they load up the machine weekly with a flavor that customers could ""mix"" themselves and deny the rest of our requests for the straight up peanut butter makes absolutely NO sense to me. 

So, fine: it's your yogurt shop. You pick the flavors. At least let me know if it's worth the drive. I'm willing to tell you exactly what will make it worth it for me: knowing there's at least one flavor I want. (And, it doesn't even always have to be peanut butter!) 

I have asked and suggested (and have overheard others doing the same) that the day's flavors be posted on a website, facebook or twitter. The response was that it was not practical because they couldn't be updating all day long and they didn't want a customer to be mad if they came for a particular flavor that was posted but had run out. I don't agree (Ahem, it's the digital age, people! You're not sending the Pony Express out with an update.), but I can understand the concern. 

Instead, I was encouraged to provide my cell phone number to be associated with a particular flavor and I would be sent a text message the next time that flavor was available. I don't know the mechanics of blasting a text but it seems that would be a lot more time consuming (or at least equally) than updating a fan page on facebook or posting a tweet. 

Also, by the way, once they've texted me, my number would be crossed off the sheet and I'd need to ""re-request"" to be notified. Talk about inefficient! 

Yogurtology has great flavors available to them. The bar and shop are clean. They could totally be five stars. I want to be able to give them five stars but I can't. In fact, as a regular customer, I'm so disappointed I can't even stand by my ""yay! I'm a fan."" Right now, in my book, they're ""A-OK."" If I'm going to go for frozen yogurt, this is where I'd go. And, I'd pray I'd be delighted to find a flavor I love in one of the machines... but, I wouldn't know until I got there. 

Change that, and I'll restore the star...",2010-09-02 00:15:37

Biscuits and butter and jam: Biscuits are the best way to start a meal. The biscuits here are plump, and served warm with rosemary butter and jam. I could have just stopped here and I would have been perfectly satisfied. These things are out of this world good. BUT it's not a real meal unless you're uncomfortably stuffed AmIRight? 

The Birmingham: Made with Vodka, Asian pear, rosemary-clove syrup, and lemon sour. Such an interesting drink (the good kind of interesting). Tart and refreshing. 

Mac & Cheese: So decadent with smoked gouda as the star. I could run away with this dish. I could live off of this dish. I could raise my children with this dish. It's that amazing. 

Jalapeño hush puppies: I've never met a hush puppy I didn't like, but these were particularly good. I was hoping for a little more spice from the jalapeño, though. 

Chicken and waffles: Rosemary herbed waffles, where have you been all of my life?! Wow! Such a great compliment to the perfectly crispy, juicy, tender, buttermilked, battered, and boneless chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this meal.

Each tin can had a speaker inside of it and you could hear conversations being played. So unique!

The parking here is very challenging, as the Mexican War Streets area of the North Side can be tight. There is a small lot, but usually we find street parking or take a bus to visit. Definitely check this place out if you have not yet!",2018-02-14 20:00:27

There was only one other table occupied and a couple at the bar, yet our server was slow and forgot to bring out several items. Our sushi, something that relies on great presentation, was served on chipped white china. We're talking huge chips here. I can't believe they didn't throw the pieces out.

The food was all pretty bad. I got the egg nigiri, and it was the worst I've ever had. How do you screw up what is essentially an omelette on rice? My husband liked his pink lady roll (not on happy hour), but the 4 other rolls and nigiri he downed only out of ravenous hunger.

The prices are slightly higher than some of its competitors but the quantity and good flavor surely makes up for that.

There are quite a few options of fresh ahi tuna poke here.  I ordered 1/2 a pound of Hawaiian style poke.  The cuts of tuna they used were very large and quite fresh.  It was marinated in a soy and chili flake sauce with some minced onions thrown in the mix.  Pretty good option for poke in my area.

The mixed plate we ordered was fairly good as well.  Furikake chicken was spot on, kind of like crispy orange chicken but with more flavor from the furikake seasoning.  The kalbi short ribs ($1.00 more) were good and came as 2 huge pieces of meat.   There's quite a bit of fat on edges which I did not eat and one of our meats came out a little more red on the inside than my wife likes to eat.  Luckily, I have no problem with that.

I've glanced over some of the breakfast options and saw the Portuguese sausage and eggs at over $8.    That's $3 more than I'm used to for a standard breakfast option.  I decided to get a side of the Portuguese sausage but they were considerably smaller and not as good as my go to spot for Portuguese sausage (Aloha Kitchen next to UNLV for those wondering-amazing).

For the closest location with good poke and friendly service, I'll definitely keep Island Flavor in mind.  Truly a good mixed plate with plenty of left overs for a second meal.",2015-10-28 23:18:50

Nonetheless -- since my original reviews, I've ordered from JVG (as I like to abbreviate them) four or five times.

We got a philly cheesesteak sandwich, the chicken ranch fries, fried mushrooms, and a 2L of diet coke.  It was more than enough to feed the two of us with some leftovers to spare.  

We've only ever done delivery, largely because it's consistent and delicious.  My husband feels like he has a ""relationship"" with the driver at this point, which is a sign of a good local business.

BB's lunch menu is just a little less costly than SM's. Both places do all you can eat. 

I believe dinner was $26 for AYCE. I calculate that I can eat roughly $52 worth of ala carte, so AYCE is most definitely the way to go ... for myself. 

Bf and I (aka the Power Eaters) began with three orders each of the hamachi (yellowtail) and sake (salmon) and two of the hirame (halibut) with shiso (Japanese mint). The nigiri were all smaller than I'm used to. But this was totally a good thing because taste great, less filling! The hamachi and sake were both tasty, but lacked body; a little bit too much give in the texture of the fish. The same goes for the hirame. Although for the hirame, that wasn't a bad thing. I'm used to getting really stringy hirame. For the record, I'm not well versed in hirame and don't know the mark of good quality for hirame. I just know what I like. 

Normally, I would say smaller portions is the devil, but for AYCE, the opposite is true. Smaller portions are less filling, thus more variety is possible. Brian's Beach is good for this reason. You can order half rolls of most anything, save the soft shell crab rolls. 

Phase II, the gaijin rolls. We got Sam's Volcano, Almost Fire, and Kimmy rolls. All good. We also tried the baked green mussels. One order is five pieces. That shit should be illegal. 

Phase III, we also ordered the white tuna, which I thought was amazing, but bf thought it was just decent; ikura (salmon roe) with quail egg; saba (mackerel); 

They have Sapporo and Asahi, sake, and a few wines on hand. 

The place is small, prolly just big enough to accommodate 20 heads. 

The service was great and our sushi chef was very available. 

I ordered the Homemade Tofu Cheesecake, but it ""wasn't hard yet"" (It ain't easy), so I defaulted to green tea ice cream. 

I'd say I've found my southside sushi mistress. 

I think fresh fish in Las Vegas can be such an inconsistent thing that to fairly review a sushi joint (just in the realm of QUALITY OF FISH), you need to go back a few times. So I'll be back. A few times. 

Next time I'll ask for toro (fatty tuna, the bacon of sushi).

So, I forcibly grabbed up the kiddies (those over 21) in the family, and drug them off for an evening out. This place is basically an open space, painted black, with a bar in the middle and a few seats and a long pleather banquette (held together with duct tape) along one wall. There is a very unadorned stage, a motley crew of employees and an equally interesting mélange of characters serving as the clientele. I was worried that as a sort of soccer grandma, I would stick out like a sore thumb. No worries. Everyone fits in here. 

The drinks were incredibly strong - had to have a little tomato juice added to my Bloody Mary, and the band was great but the music was horrifically loud. Once I stuffed cotton in my ears, I felt better, and noticed that most of the musicians had done the same thing, so I recommend bringing along a set of foam earplugs just in case. They clearly shot the entire decorating budget on amplifiers. Had a blast (pun intended), and would return, but probably just to see the band I liked. It is what it is.

Yeah that's right, I eat breakfast at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. First off, the fact that Farmer Boys serves breakfast throughout the day is a plus. I sleep in on the weekends so I can never make the breakfast cut off at 10AM. I stepped up to the register after awkwardly staring at the menu for 2 minutes and ordered a french toast combo for $6.69. My husband also opted for breakfast and ordered a sausage burrito ($6.49). Total after tax and a drink came to to $16 and some change. 

We were handed a number and sat at a booth that was wet after being wiped down. I screamed in excitement when I seen that the condiments on the table included a bottle of Tapatio hot sauce. This distraction made me forget about the wet table. About 10 minutes later, our food arrived.

French Toast Combo: The french toast was served with a gallop of butter on top and 2 packets of warmed maple syrup on the side. It was comparable to other diner quality french toast but far better than any fast food version. The eggs were cooked just right and were REAL scrambled eggs, not that weird fake patty thing. I handed the two strips of bacon over to my husband who declared they were made ""just how he liked them"". I might add that my breakfast was served on a real plate with actual (not plastic) utensils.  

Sausage Breakfast Burrito: Big enough to leave you feeling stuffed and apparently tasted great. It comes with eggs, hash browns, sausage, and salsa. The Mr. stated he would forgo the salsa the next time around. Both dishes were garnished with a cute little orange slice.  

Another reason why I'm hopped up on Farmer Boys is that they offer a veggie burger, which I'll definitely try the next time around. I was really surprised at the quality of the food. I was expecting more McDonald's-esque food, but it was anything but.",2014-10-20 19:19:11

We got 2 pizzas. I had fresh mozzarella, pineapple, mushroom and pepperoni on mine. My man had shredded mozzarella and jack cheese, sausage, onion, jalapeno. We both had the spicy diavola sauce. It was full of flavor and delicious!

Let me tell you if you like ""mild"" spicy the diavola sauce isn't for you because it is HOT! 

It was $23.57 for both pizzas and 2 sodas. You get free refills and they have lids and straws if you want to take your soda to go.

We got a ""belly card"" that we can swipe each time for rewards. 

They have ""Thirsty Thursdays"" where on Thursday you can get any beer buy one get one FREE!

We decided to come in to see what the hype was about. Immediately, our waiter asked if we have been to Korean barbecue before. We said ""Yes."" He immediately said, ""Well, this one is the best in town!"" We did not appreciate his cockiness or arrogance. And, it turned out to be not that great after all.

We got the family combo. We chose the brisket, short ribs & the ribeye. Most of the side dishes had too much sugar or they were too spicy. There were five little balls of rice. We would have appreciated a big bowl of rice. As far as the meat, I think we would've liked cooking it ourselves. It really seemed very rushed, the whole experience was rushed. The waiter was running back-and-forth. Plus, we both agreed that the meat could've used a lot more flavor. It wasn't seasoned at all. There was some salt on the table, but it was in a little tiny bowl. And, we kept on putting either too little or too much. They should keep salt in a normal salt shaker or the kind that you have to twist around in circles. At least very little will come out at a time.

Finally, what seemed to be a very rushed dinner. We got dessert. We got to pick which flavor of ice cream, that was nice. And, it turned out that the dessert was very delicious. It was a puffy rice cake with ice cream inside. That might've been the best part of our dining experience at this establishment. I would not recommend it.",2017-01-09 03:35:16

But maybe not, as this place could just as well be as old. On top of that they live up to their namesake of 'cream' as they're clearly using quality dairy here.

The value is more than fair, as you can still get a small for around $2 - and it's still a good size. They also make their own genuine fried funnel cakes and even their own waffle cones. The taste of a real, soft, fresh waffle cone is miles ahead of packaged ones. About the only critique I have is that there's only one size of waffle cone (large), so I get more than I want or need.

Still, having quality dairy soft-serve, in a real waffle cone, then dipped in chocolate and coated in peanuts for $4 is something I can easily live with. My wife feels their butterscotch milkshake is one of the best she's had. You're not going to get that taste with cheap, skimmed ice-milk.

Not sure if I wanted Mexican or sushi, so I decided to give this place a try. I have never had Mexican sushi before, so wasn't quite sure what to expect. I ordered a very large order: a pierna torta ($6 and change) a shredded beef tostada ($3) and a Kissi roll ($9) I was asked if it was for there or go to. When I said here he warned me that it was a lot of food. That was really nice of him, since most places would be like ""score... ordered lots of food and ain't gonna eat half of it' It shows they care about the customer. I did still continue that order. Came out to $20 even after tax (before tip) I then proceeded to the salsa bar to get some pico de gallo, and three different types of salsa to have with their chips. The pico was amazing, and the green and red were both very flavorful. The brown was flavorful too, just a bit spicy. The chips were delicous.... crunchy but still soft.... i do believe they are homemade. My tostada arrived first, fully loaded with goodness. It was huge! Just after the tostada I was starting to fill up fast. My torta arrived before I was able to finish the tostada and came with some fries. I ate about half of it and knew that I was in danger of not having any room to try the sushi. The torta was good, but I probably wouldn't get it again simply because I think the tostada was better. My sushi arrived and I was only able to eat 3 bites of it before I was full. Those three bites were amazing tho! I highly recommend this place.... Even though the rolls are $9, it is technically 2 rolls.... it is 12 pieces. Very large pieces. And it also comes with some crab salad on the side and a bottle of spicy mayo and a sort of teriyaki sauce for you to put on top and customize. This place is all about giving you custom food and at a fairly decent price. They are very kind and even tho the place looks a bit run down from the outside, is nice.

I'd have given it a fourth star, but the service was a little spotty. Maybe it was an off-night, who knows, who cares? 

Woo-Che is a nice spot for AYCE Korean BBQ. My bff was in town with her boyfriend, so a friend and I all met up here for dinner one night before hitting the strip. I suggested AYCE Korean BBQ, so we hopped on my fancy Yelp app and saw a Yelp Deal. Sold.

Fair warning: bring both, a change of clothes and a bottle of febreze for later. You will smell like Seoul.

Anyway, you walk in, and there are plenty of tables. You pick one, the server asks you what you want to drink (I suggest Hite), then they turn on your grill at the table.

All the meat is buffet style, so there are rows of all kinds of great uncooked meats. Shortrib, pork belly, seafood, chicken, top round, bottom round, etc. Grab it, throw it on your grill, and enjoy!

The Banchan selection is quite good too. I can say that I've had a much better experience at Tofu Hut, because I didn't have to worry about picking from a buffet. It's easier for me to go off  a menu. But that's just me. You may feel otherwise.

The ventilation system here is pretty good too, but like I said, make sure you bring a change of clothes, and/or febreze.

Anywhere with a bunch of local brews on tap can't be bad in my book, but what's more, our waitress impressed the socks off of me with her knowledge of the beer menu. She had clearly tried all of the beers they had listed and was able to describe them and make recommendations based on what we said we liked. What's more, she was just...pleasant. Nice. A great waitress. Really seemed to like her job. Hats off to Kickstand for the training of your wait staff! It really did positively contribute to my experience.

On to the burgers! I recently went to Block & Grinder over on Providence and had their burger, so it's hard for me to not compare them. B&G's burger is clearly a statement, with the branded bun and the premium condiments, and I can definitely appreciate that - it was a great burger. But Kickstand's burgers are good in their own right, and what they might lack in quality (no, they don't have a Gruyere cheese option, sorry), they more than make up for in breadth. 

I went with the build your own burger, and wasn't disappointed - it was a quality specimen. And I love that they serve their burgers with tots! It's so...Napolean-Dynamite-give-me-some-of-your-tots.

My friends from work have been telling me about this place for some time now (since they do it regularly) and so on this very evening, we were invited to watch their Sat 8pm performance.  We showed up and it was pretty darn packed.. lots of turnout.. lots of people coming to watch their family and friends perform - I thought that was neat.  Plus, they had the cotton-candy machine running (I think $3 ea) and popcorn, so it really helped set the atmopshere.  

We sat on bleachers and were entertained for a good hour and a half by the FOF (1st year, I think) and by the advanced students.  I was impressed with their work (hell, you won't find me trapezing in this life time!) and most impressed with the 'catchers' and how fit and punctual they have to be to do their job.  The two owners, as I understand it, were doing the 'catching', so obviously they are highly experienced to do the job.

Good time, entertaining evening.. and after the show, they had $10 fly-bys for anyone which I guess means you go up the stairs, get harnessed, and get to fly on the bar/swing and then flip and drop on to the trampoline/net they have below... they had a lot of people doing this after the show.

It was a nice environment and the hostess gave us a booth that was away from everyone else. All of us were excited to eat here as it was close to us since we came from Reminderville, Ohio. After ordering some simple drinks we looked over the menu. The menu was vast with several options.  We were impressed just from the variety and possibilities which made this place look even more promising.  Well, we ordered our food.  No one ordered the same thing so it was something different for everyone.  We then began discussing personal plans and before we even started to make plans our food was done.  ALL of our food was done in less than 5 minutes!  We were not the only customers there at the time so it was a big surprise that our food arrived so quickly.  All of us commented, ""Wow, that was really fast.""  We soon found out why.  It was somewhere between warming tray and microwave quality. How could this food be made so quickly when I ordered a quesadilla and taco combo?  One of my friends had ordered a dish with several ingredients to make his own taco/burrito and the refried beans portion was extra salty and had a burnt taste to it and kind of crunchy.  The beans were so salty it was appetite ruining.  I just tried one bite of the beans and it ruined my taste buds for my food.  When the waiter returned, we just told him to take our plates but our friend told him that his dish was ""bad and ruined his appetite"". My friend was able to get a refund for his meal but since we finished or mostly finished our meals we paid for ours.  Overall, I have to score this place low because the food was not what we expected.  I feel bad about our experience and earlier reviews like from Eric O. make me believe this was NOT the same place that night.  I want to give El Chile Bravo a second chance because it was in a GREAT area and had a wonderful environment for me to enjoy.

There was a looong piece of hair in my boyfriend's soup and as I look into the kitchen.. nobody there was wearing any sort of protection against falling hair.

The pho here is average but not fantastic and the rice (chicken, pork chop, and egg) my boyfriend ordered was decent but his rice was sogging into congee.

The waitresses are all about efficiency and it comes off as a bad attitude.
I'm trying to pack up my pho (to go) she's reaching OVER me and knocking into my hand as I'm trying to pour the soup into the container.  Nope. There was nobody at the door and more than half the tables were empty - you can wait until I'm done pouring.

s7NAIzdM2OQmdNK4JiuCLg,loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,nY0WI0qGvkmMzTuNHMbCtw,3,7,3,2,"My 150th review!

And I wouldn't have chosen anything else other than my alma matter! Why the 3 star review you might ask? Although I have pride in UNLV, I am well aware of there being better options else where. And no I am not referring to the school up north, but rather out of state universities.

I can start by saying my college experience was rather enjoyable. When you grow up in Vegas, going to UNLV isn't exactly the most exciting thing considering it's the only major university in town and the acceptance rate isn't exactly competitive. Although my first semester I was pleasantly surprised. I can honestly say it felt like a ""real"" university. UNLV is comparable to the state university system in California. The major plus is that it is a university with division I ncaa sports including football. I respect the university and state because most schools costs almost twice the tuition here and compete in division II sports. I can see why the graduation rate is a bit lower, the Las Vegas job market doesn't exactly favor those individuals with a degree. Unlike other major cities where an education is a must to be competitive in the job market. The result of it is the city not susceptible to an education, which is also a result for low endowment. I do highly applaud the Fertita and Harrah's family for their generous donations. The UNLV Rec Center, Lied Library, student union, and CSUN events all added to the college feel adding to the efforts of an ""student centered"" campus. Definitely couldn't miss major events like UNLV premier and UNLV UNR Fremont Cannon game. I think a major downer for me was I felt like I didn't get the most out of my education and I have my program to blame for that and not the university. Another gripe I have is I wish the buildings were more in uniform like other universities with a beautiful campus. 

All in all, in you're trying to save money by staying in state, UNLV isn't a bad option especially if you're a millennium scholar. Racking up thousands of dollars in debt isn't exactly ideal, especially when your degree isn't gonna get you a job paying 50k a year right out of college. Go Rebels!",2014-01-21 02:21:41

Unfortunately, for some reason today their sushi bar was not in service.  As such, I mildly panicked about not having prepared to look for other gluten free items.  However, when asked the waiter immediately had answers for me and didn't miss a beat.  He indicated that the curries and the pad thai were gluten free.  Cue epic battle of wills trying to decide between the Mango Curry and the Chicken Pad Thai.  This time, the Pad Thai won out and to be honest I was pretty happy with the results.  The food came out heinously fast and the portion size was enormous ( defs took 3/4 of it home).  If you like spicy food, like I do, you might want to over call your spice level.  I ordered a ""5"" hoping to get like an after taste of spice/ a tingle and the result was maybe an increase in flavor but no real spice.  Maybe I'll try a 7 next time, and there will be a next time.  Anyway the Pad Thai had a grilled taste to it like it was made in a well loved wok and the chicken was moist.  Most importantly though, no contamination issues.

They have a great catering deal that includes a full tray of their Italian Salad (including 2 bottles of their housemade dressing and sliced pepperoni), 40 pieces of fried chicken, a full sheet pizza (which came in two half sheets, which was perfect!), and a full tray of rigatoni for $135.

We came here for breakfast around 10am. I didn't expect the place to be so crowded, but I guess it makes sense...it's literally down the hall for some hotel guests. The first thing I noticed was that everything had a very european attitude...including the service. It was a few minutes before anybody came by to get our drink order, nevermind food. Could've been a one-time thing though, who knows. The waiter brought us butter & jam despite the fact that we ordered no bread, or anything else appropriate for it. Staring at it & all the pastry passing by caused us to order a croissant for desert, so maybe that's how they get'cha?

Food:
Quiche of the day: Tomato confit & carmelized onions. My friend said it was probably the best quiche she's ever had. Came with salad on the side...very small portions of each, IMO.
Croquette Madams - I had this, and it was definitely delicious. The entree it self was ""european sized"", but as you can see from pictures above, the side of fries is huge. Both were delicous. 

Espresso:
I guess it's a weird thing to devote so many words to, but at least it's something that's not in the other 400 reviews..
I ordered an espresso before the meal. It came, in the right cup, and was perfectly acceptable for a cup of Illy on the strip, even if it was light on the crema. I finished it quickly, and asked for another, this time a double. The food came before my next espresso, and when it arrived, it was in a cup more suitable for an americano. I know it happens sometimes when you want a double, no big deal, but the espresso wasn't right. It might have just been that it wasn't hot, but it was off enough that I sent it back and asked for another. I even offered to take a single if the barista wasn't confident in pulling a double. After a slightly shorter, but still long wait, my new cup arrived. Same size cup, this time holding what looks to be a single shot. The waiter explained that he made it himself, but he'd be happy to take it back again if it wasn't right. It did taste better than the prior one, and although it still wasn't very hot, I kept it. I don't have it in me to be that guy that sends back 2 espressos. 

The bill was about 50USD, and overall, we were happy with the meal. The food was delicious, and the service could've been better, but it wasn't that bad. Maybe we were easy to overlook it because we were in a good mood, or maybe we were critical because we had other things we wanted to do afterwards. But like I said, in the end, I am eager to go back and try some more stuff. And really, where else you gonna go in town for a really good breakfast?",2009-03-23 22:51:25

**Falafels were great too, and dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves)... I do not know how to describe the difference, but I think the dolmeh was the best I have ever had. It was tasty, and it could be it had more olive oil, the texture was different and it was yummy.
**I keep coming back to edit this review : ) They also had a cilantro sauce, along with tzatziki (lots of dill in the tzatziki), a mediterranean sauce with a ranch base (I believe), a tahini sauce and some other hot sauce I think.
**For vegetarian option for the plates they have portobella mushrooms, (beside falafel, and dolmeh I guess) I tasted them as well and they were great.

Little did I know, the large was $8.50 and probably the size of a medium at other ice cream places. If you get the vegan base it's $1 extra so I was already at $9.50. The idea is so great, but I might have had a poorly made ice cream since the matcha powder was not mixed in completely with my base. I also could not get any toppings seeing as the toppings cost $1 each.

Drinks comes in 0%, 30%, 50% and 100% sugar, as with ice. My go-to drink is Milk Tea with 0% sugar and no ice.

On Friday, there was a five minute wait at 7pm for one of about twenty-five tables (guesstimate only). 

Friday meant seafood specials and panko breaded eggplant.  Nice sized menu with  some interesting choices.  I went for Lasagna. It was really well made with lots of ricotta mixed with seasoning, some meat mixed in and a really nice meat sauce.  The cheese bordered on dry, but extra sauce made up for it!  Portion was nice size, goldilocks would say just right.  Rather than insalata, err salad, the wedding soup was really very good. Plenty of pasta, lightly salted, four mini meatballs, little carrot and celery. Even the italian bread seemed very fresh.

The rigatoni and meatballs was also very good.  The meatballs were large and moist.  The sauce was a little sweet and mild.  Portion was a little bigger than lasagna.  Salad was your average salad and the house italian was sweet, with a slight bite.

The service was excellent.  From the hostess to bussers everyone was very friendly and either greeted or thanked you.  Our waiter Justin was first class!  If your near I77 and Rte 18 stop by. Total tab for both meals, 2 beers and a coffee - $36",2013-03-23 03:38:04

These cupcakes are amazing! Here is the general review: 

1. I had a vanilla with chocolate frosting - it was ok - I would give this cupcake three stars.  The vanilla cake needed more flavor to it. 

2. The triple chocolate - BF says it was very good and very chocolate. 

3. Pink Cadillac - sooooo good - Serious five star cupcake! 

4. The Baked Apple: So delicious and genius - apple struesel on the bottom!!

It. was. fantastic. The spread was like a better version of the buffalo chicken dip I've had at so many holiday parties. The bread was light and fresh with a crispy exterior. I am not usually a fan of soft spreads in sandwiches but I found the spread-to-bread ratio to be perfect. 

Sandwiches come with the side option of corn and black bean salsa or Mediterranean pasta salad. I opted for the salsa, which was a hearty mix of black beans, corn and poblano peppers. It was very reminiscent of my long-gone favorite side at Einstein Bagels.

Aside from sandwiches, the restaurant offers breakfast, smoothies, salads, burgers and desserts along with an assortment of teas, chips, bars and the like.

The cook, I'm assuming, came out and checked to see how we liked everything and we thought that was very nice. Going above and beyond. He even engaged in small talk and gave us two desserts on the house.

Do not have the chicken dumpling dish, it's terrible. The salmon and sea bass are just ok, have had better. The pork chile stew is quite decent and flavorful. For desert our strategy was to have a safe bet ( death by chocolate) and be adventurous ( bacon dipped in chocolate smores) . Both were quite decent. The latter is interesting and basically helped me check off under ' new experience of the day'. Given the small menu, it my no be a repeat kind of place but do try the experience once.",2012-02-08 06:22:50

I should qualify my opinion a bit -- I love Asian food, and my son loves steamed pork buns.  Well, this place hit the spot.  The dim sum selections were hot and tasted freshly prepared.  In fact, everything we sampled tasted freshly prepared.  I usually pass on buffet sushi, but the tuna nigiri and salmon nigiri were melt-in-your-mouth luscious.  My husband sampled the Indian food and pronounced it tasty.

Everything was beautifully presented and the staff working behind the counter were constantly freshening up the buffet.  I felt a bit like a bull in a china shop when I came slopping through, but someone always wiped up after me.

Eclairs were served warm, like someone just made them.  What a treat!  I slipped a cookie in my purse for later.

No one seems to know about this place yet.  Friday night around 7pm and the place seemed only a quarter full.  Hmm.

By the way, we got two free buffets for signing up for a slot card and putting 500 points on it.  Six-year-old got in half price.

I echo another reviewer's comments in saying that service was excellent, from the cashiers, the buffet cooks and servers, the waiters, and the bussers.

This is my new favorite buffet in Las Vegas, my other favorites being Wynn and Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan).",2014-09-13 04:57:21

However, throughout the wait, the servers were all super nice and attentive in assuring we would get seated as soon as possible. We ordered the Cheese ribs (mild) and then a kimchi fried rice. On Fridays, you also get free fries with the ribs and option for $5 beers. Honestly, the free fries really wow-ed me. They were fried to a perfect crisp, slightly seasoned (not sure what it was tbh) and the cut was like McD fries. The ribs came with corn, sweet potato mash, egg, regular mash potatoes and  a veggie medley. I liked the idea of the ribs wrapped around cheese but for me, I would opt for spicy ribs next time as the mild was a bit sweet for my liking. On the other hand, the kimchi fried rice was alright, the spam in it was good but I don't think the rice came out too hot.

There's something up in the kitchen that I can't quite explain, because on the night's when they are at their busiest is when I have gotten some great meals.  On the slower nights I've visited the food was subpar.

The Bangers and Mash has been the only consistant meal on their menu that I've had.  I've been let down countless times by their sheppherd's pie - oily, gritty, and lifeless.  They have some curries on the menu, and I know that in the UK curry dishes are all the rage, but it just doesn't seem right.  The rest of the menu is a tweaked or modified variation of other traditional pub fare.  As far as dessert goes I've never been able to make it past the Jamaican Cheesecake.  Thumbs up!

While the menu and atmosphere are a bit gimmicky (guys wearing kilts) - especially after repeated visits - the selection of bourbon and scotch is nothing short of impressive.  The bar itself is a bit unconfortable as retail space is a precious commodity.  It seems like every 6' there is a huge black pillar that does nothing but take away  from the bars surface area, and creats an unneeded congestion.  They have ample seating on the patio, and an area inside with large wingback chairs to enjoy a pint like blue blooded royalty.

I will say this though.  The ONLY REASON that they are getting 3 stars from me is because of their bloody mary's.  For the love of all that is holy they have some incredible mix that can be bought by the bottle to take home with you.  The real key to what they're doing is adding a quick splash of Guiness into the bloody mary's.  For me it works, and works really well.",2011-03-28 20:34:17

This buffet is off of Sahara not real close to the strip.  

This place is kinda in the middle of the road to me.
I have been to way better places and also have had worse.

We have been here a few times in the past as well that as before Yelp :)

We have found that the earlier you go in for dinner or lunch the better it is as with any buffet same with this one for them for bringing out hot fresh food.

The night we went in it was pretty busy and the food was being replaced pretty fast.
My husband really likes the crab legs. They are not big but they are ok to satisfy your craving!
The Sushi is not at all like going to a Sushi place but it is passable. They do put out a few different kinds of rolls.. Like I said it is ok nothing that satisfies my cravings for Sushi but I did have a few pieces and they were just ok.

The price for lunch and dinner is not too bad. Nothing like the strip buffet prices.

Over all the food is just ok, it is usually hot and the items that I did try were not too bad. I am not too crazy about Chinese food at a buffet. I would much rather have it made fresh for me. 

The staff keeps the plates cleaned up real good and drinks filled pretty fast even when busy.

As others have mentioned, need a high clearance 4WD or AWD (I did it via AWD with no issue). And as Ashley B mentioned, the normally listed route in is a slow, bumpy slog, with the quicker/easier way in/out via access south of the Executive Airport (where the airport road, Inspirada, turns into Bicentennial). These routes can be easily spotted on Google Maps, especially on satellite view.

Even though an easy, short, flat-ish hike in, bring plenty of water since this is desert hiking: I went through almost 40oz of water in relatively cool, but sunny, weather.

Trail 100 is the fast route to the site (~2.2mi round-trip), trail 200, longer, more elevation, but has the advantage of avoiding the ""Indiana Jones and the Lost Ark sized rock"" blocking the trail (as a hiker I passed referred it as), scramble over, which might be a bit of scare to some.

I was met by a young lady who had an upbeat, bubbly vibe. She was very professional & made sure I had everything I needed throughout my time there. I sat at the sushi bar and had nice conversation with one of the chefs, who is opening his own Akahana in Belmont soon. The thinly sliced fish in the prep station looked fresh and was very colorful. I had the Raging Demon roll & the special Stupid Cupid roll. Both had eel, which I favor and were tasty & thankfully, solidly packed so it didn't fall apart (pet peeve of mine when it comes to sushi). However, I always enjoy alittle fresh, chilled ginger to finish my meal but their's was tainted beige and browning on some edges. Now here's my primary complaint: the odor in there is nasty; That dirty floor, wipe-counters-with-the-same-rag-over & over again- kind of smell. Now, I know I'm somewhat OCD clean & germ conscientious & I challenge myself to tone that down.  So I dug deep & stayed and ate but I prayed I wouldn't get sick all the way home!

3.5 out of 5 because the rolls were good and the staff was excellent. They just need to hire a new cleaning company to use some vinegar/bleach & steam that place from top to bottom. Or refinish and update the interior  :- /",2018-02-16 06:17:33

Met a friend here last night and decided to grab a drink at the bar before sitting down. The bartender was a tall bald guy (cant remember his name) but he was so awesome! he made me a ginger mojito but used vodka instead of rum, it was delish!
We sat in the gorgeous intimate dinning room. With the high ceilings and kitchen behind a glass wall it was a very enjoyable setting. 
Our waiter (Arty i believe his name was) was amazing. very informative and accommodating with my peanut allergy request. He suggested I start off with a Lychee Lemon Drop. this was mixology at its finest. Sweet but refreshing and with rock candy sugar i cant wait to try to replicate it.
We started off with the lobster pancakes as an appetizer. More of a crepe then a traditional pancake filled with plumb lobster meat, mushrooms, red chili, scallions and dressed a lobster and coconut milk sauce they were melt in your mouth goodness.
Moving on to the main course. We decided to split two entrees. 
Grilled Garlic Shrimp- Huge prawns over a bed of black fettuccine in a red coconut curry sauce they were mouth watering delish. The sauce truly made the dish. With the spice of the curry and a sweetness from the coconut milk it was the perfect combination.
Our waiter then suggested the Short Ribs- totally melt in your mouth meat accompanied with goat cheese mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of Wasabi mashed potatoes... which i ate the entire portion. don't judge me.
I also had the Strawberry Burst cocktail. Made with cachaca (a Brazilian rum) it was packed full of strawberry flavor in every drink. 
We finished our meal with a bottle of pinot gregio. 

This was an amazing experience and i highly recommend it to everyone.",2012-09-14 22:27:11

If you have been to Tucson, for example. a very comparable restaurant is Hub. Similar atmospheres and rich, hearty, flavorful foods. But that place is in crappy Tucson so, pretty much having some edison bulbs down there scores you a 5 star review on the 'hip vibe' alone. But Arrogant Butcher is in downtown Phoenix and has nearly 300 reviews around 4 stars. One should EXPECT more than the typical Fox template. 

The decor and service is excellent as expected.  However, the letdown came when, after enjoying the hummus plate and pretzel fondue, the angus cheeseburger came to the table. Good but so far below expectations. With all the other great items on the menu, they should have just axed the forgettable burger plate (or improve it to Zinburger status).

The hostesses were very nice about it but could not yield to our disappointment no matter how sad and pathetic a face I was wearing.  She gave us a card wtih their phone number and a sugggestion to call in the morning for a reservation.  We didn't because we weren't sure we'd be available.  Several days later we stopped in for lunch and were prompltly seated in what we thought was a ""good"" table.  YAY!

The waiter was tall, good-looking, impeccably professional, and friendly.  I've heard some people express concern about bringing kids to MESA... and we brought two of them.  He really knew how to take care of us and how to effectively take care of our kids.  (I think he mentioned having 6 of his own, incluing a couple the same ages as ours.)

Lunch was fantastic and commensurate with the price.  We had a Bobby Flay Burger, Ancho-crusted scallop salad, Cornmeal crusted chile relleno, and the youngest child had the Crimini mushroom quesedilla.  As an appetizer we shared a Goat cheese queso fundido.  All was great and well within the palate of even our 8 year old.

All of our plates were picked up by the bus boy empty... practically licked clean.

Having never had Flay food before, I had a ntoion of what it might be like only from watching Chef Flay on the innumberable TV shows he is on.  His food lived up to that expectation:  fresh, high-quality, punchy flavors, cooked perfectly, and plating that was both clean and pretty.  Like most tourists we photographed our food... no matter how goofy that may have looked.

One of the best parts of the experience was the way we were allowed to enjoy the experience without a hint of either slowness or rushing.  If we needed anything there was someone immediately available to help.  When we were eating and talking, we were left alone to have our privacy.

Wow, thoroughly enjoyed that game against Buffalo...but I digress.

Westgate is mostly dining establishments, definitely not going to keep you busy with shopping, but the energy on game day makes it a fun place to visit.  My teenage daughter really liked the feel of the place and wants to visit with her cousins.  We may try to have lunch and go to a movie at Westgate before heading over to downtown for the opening of Glendale Glitters.

I'm not sure what percentage of development is done for Westgate, there is a lot of vacant land still so I anticipate that in time there will be more, but for a place to kill some time before an event at Jobing or UPIG I enjoyed the Westgate.

One major ding, and possibly at the request of the restaurants:  after the Cards 1st playoff win, we decided to hang around afer the game.  No Colts vs. Bolts on the huge screen outside?  Just adds for Westgate??  What the heck?

We ordered the Mac n' Cheese, a spaghetti, poutine and alcoholic beverages. I gotta say, for 5 bucks the portion it came in was decent. However, the taste not so much. It tasted like microwave dinner food... perhaps, we didn't order the ""right"" items on the menu? Other than that, as many yelpers have noted, service is quite slow. It took awhile for our server to come take our order and for our food to hit the table. On top of that, our food did not come hot. It was just warm.

Staff changes (kitchen and service) have waivered what I thought was an undying love for this place. I've been disappointed 3 times in a row by the quality of the food and the staff so I think this review is fair. In fact, the food and service is so consistently good when one of the owners, Paulino, is there that maybe I find out when his shift is and go back when he's working (like in totally normal, legit way; not a weird, stalker way). When the cat's away the mice will play, I guess. I'm not sure if it's just growing pains or what but it seems the newer staffers are inexperienced and really don't give a damn. My last experience at La Capital, I wanted a cocktail (something with tequila in it) but the waiter said I could have a shot of tequila and a beer - I asked for a Margarita (thinking that surely they could make a drink with lime and tequila) but the waiter said they didn't have the ingredients and offered me a grapefruit Jarritos and a tequila (maybe that's a thing? Grapefruit soda and tequila? but, NO THANKS). When I questioned not having tequila and lime in a Mexican restaurant the waiter asked me what the recipe was and that he'd make me one - yeah, A for effort there buddy but if you don't know the ingredients for a Margarita I don't want you making me one (for $10 no less). There were 3 of us dining - we had the intention of sharing the tacos but the food came out and we had no sharing plates. I requested hot sauce and the waiter pointed at the two bottles of salsa on the table (that is not what I had in mind but I let it go). My tacos had hair it in - I sent it back. HAIR. ACK! The waiter apologized and said they'd make me a new one BUT THEY LITERALLY REMOVED THE HAIR AND SENT ME BACK THE SAME PLATE... Unacceptable! Keep your hair out of my food, is that too much to ask?! Since we couldn't order cocktails we stuck to water - which was a mistake because our glasses were empty the entire time. The waiter never came back to ask us if we needed anything and we couldn't seem to flag anyone down. I also want to mention that we went at 1:30pm after the lunch rush so there is no good excuse for having trouble flagging down our waiter. Aside from our table there was a couple - that's it. It wasn't busy. We ended up eating off of the same taco plates by eating a taco and passing the plate with the remaining tacos along, which is really awkward when you are dining with co-workers. These aren't like close buddies - I think I accidentally ate something that fell out of my coworkers mouth. GROSS. I'm afraid the love affair is over. I'll probably go through a phase of eating a lot of tacos at meaningless taco joints until I find the right one and then a new love will blossom.

The attempts were made a couple weeks in advance and while there were times available, they always seemed to be after 9 pm. As a matter of a fact I found the whole calling this place for reservations to be silly as the person on the other end always seemed to be next to a DJ booth.  So while I was in a perfectly quiet environment I was forced to scream to be heard.  Why can't they just use some sort of online system?

So while I walked through the whole restaurant I don't know that I saw as much as I should have.  On your way in you can see the kitchen and there are actually a couple of seats outside the restaurant on the sidewalk that act as a ""chefs table"".  They also have some crazy colored bathrooms which I didn't use and then each table seemed to have an odd religious candle on it.

For dinner my wife and I decided to split the poke for our appetizer which was big eye tuna, seaweed and rice crackers that came with what I thought was a lime crema. I can't say that it was really what I expected as it felt like a play on ceviche.  The tuna was raw but I really enjoyed it whenever I dipped it into the slightly tart lime sauce.  Then for our dinners I went with the duck confit tacos while my wife went with the Täko tacos. My tacos came with the duck, cucumber, scallions, pickled peppers, hoisin, cilantro and mint while my wife's consisted of grilled octopus, Harissa aioli, lemons and pickled red onion.  She enjoyed hers immensely and told me that she could eat a whole plate of the grilled octopus that was inside.  My tacos were also pretty good and I loved all the accompaniments to them but I have definitely had better duck confit before.

The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  I look forward to trying more of their delicious tacos and hopefully the next time I am able to procure a reservation.",2015-08-22 19:38:50

We had a craving for pizza after staying up all night to watch the Royal Wedding (Yelp is not a place for judgement!) and then sleeping all day. 

We were going to get Mamma's but every time we order from them, it arrives cold and needs to be heated up. This is probably something to do with how the deliveries are made (we always wait 1+ hour for our food, so we assume it spends at least a little time with the delivery guy while he makes other rounds), and we usually overlook it because the pizza tastes great after 10 minutes in the oven. Still, we wanted pizza *now* so we decided to try Papa Ceo's. 

Long story short, it was awesome. The kind of NYC grease but with a thin crunchy base and a puffy crust. My only problem was that they were a little skimpy on the sauce. I like my pizza saucy!

When asked to describe Handybook, I say it's like Uber for all of your home service needs. Cleaning professionals and handy people to do odd jobs around the house are a click away. It's an easy to use app, and I'm really impressed by it. This is the first time I've had a cleaning lady as an adult, and it certainly won't be the last time. I was instantly hooked. 

I was moving and I needed someone to do a once over before I gave the keys back to the landlord. Nothing like moving all of your furniture to remind you how disgusting you are and force you into a minor existential crisis: Where did all that grime come from? Have I ever swept under there? How am I alive? Will I be a fit mother? Maybe I should just have pets? Ew, imagine how dirty my apartment would have been with pets, etc.

A few classmates and I have what we call ""Flask Fridays"" which really translates into a visit to a pub on Fridays after class. We've visited bars on the east end, downtown, in the west end, you name it, we've got 8 more weeks to go and hopefully just as many bars.

To start with, we weren't aiming to go to Prohibition, we were looking to hit the Avro or The Comrade but the former wasn't open yet (5pm on a Friday, open yer doors!) and the latter was closed ALL JANUARY, so off to Prohibition we went, and it was the best decision on the block.

They have happy hour pricings, pint specials, drink specials and some insanely delicious beers on tap (Innis & Gunn, Flying Monkeys, Beaus, etc) not to mention some of the best gastro-pubby snack food this side of the Don Valley. 

We came in early, 5pm and didn't leave til 10, we had the macaroni and cheese, the duck fat tater tots (which have ruined regular tator tors for me forever), a few pints each and we spanned TWO different shifts of servers. The mac and cheese was huge and split between two people and the tater tots was definitely a sharing dish. While we didn't order the sheet nachos, the table beside us did and it was also gigantic and perfect for sharing.

In terms of pricing, a person can nom and leave under $30 but if you really want to try a variety of the foods and beers you'll spend more.

But my favourite part of Prohibition was the service. They were quick, friendly, attentive and FUN. When my first beer turned out to be flat, they were on it like a bonnet, sniffing it, pouring a bit from the tap and tasting what they pulled. No muss, no questions, they apologized profusely and came back with a second beer of my choice. CLASSY. The service only continued to be great from there on.

Granted, there is a ""half portion"" option for most food items, but it's only $2/$3 cheaper...my rationale was might as well get the full portion. Best bang for your buck.

Sushi- better than Getgo but dont expect UMI, Penn Avenue, or Chaya quality, but hey its all you can eat, so ill take it.  

Appetizers-  The cheese and clam wasnt successful nor was the stuffed crab.   The salad was fresh and crispy but not a lot of variety to put on the salad.   The wonton section was fun with items such as cheese wonton, pork buns, and a variety of dumplings.  All of these were good plus there is plenty of dipping sauces which I always run out of at other chinese establishments.   I did not try the quesadillas, meat pockets, pizza or Soup.  There were 6 different types of soup ranging from wonton to Clam Chowder???

Main dish-  They had many traditional chinese items but, i particularly liked the bbq chicken.  I also went for the Mongolian BBQ.   This was cool and really was worth the price of admission.   I loaded up on the shrimp and steak which at any japanese steak house would be about $25.   The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the steak was done to my liking as well.  Again, all you can eat!  

Side dishes-  Big fan of the singapore noodles

desserts: fresh fruit like kiwi and oranges, cheesecake, tapioca pudding, rice pudding and ice cream.

The place always seems crowded and for a buffet thats what i like to see because  that means high turnover of food!

I have not tried the dinner selection but am looking forward to giving that a shot once my stomach recoils back to its natural state.

For $9 its tough to beat, but would love to see some Thai food put on the buffet somewhere, just some simple curries would be sweet!",2011-02-22 00:17:36

Actually, it was worse than that. The food made me feel queasy for hours. Here's a few service particulars: Waiter did not ask if we wanted water. Waiter was so busy when he brought out the calamari appetizer he put down two plates in front of my dinner guest instead of giving us each one. Their marinara sauce was overpowered by cayenne pepper, so everything they make is ""fra diavalo"" whether you like it that spicy or not. What's funny is the numerous waiters and waitresses they have running around...like a 1:1 ratio with customers but it doesn't help because none of them know what they're doing! Someone should tell the kindly grandmotherly woman running this place that she needs to hire real management to get this joke under control. Kind of sad, actually.",2017-04-10 06:12:19

Despite the dive-y appearance, I have to say there is nothing about Big Jim's that I did not love.  

We were promptly greeted by a server, sat in the bar area (where less minors seem to dine so that makes it more enjoyable for adults without children), and were greeted with waters and asked if we had any questions.  So far so good.  On the menu for us tonight was Provolone sticks, wedding soup, Chicken Parm dinner, and Chicken Parm hoagie.  Holy cow was it a ton of food!!!!  The wedding soup was good (no noodles though), the italian dressing on the house salad that came with the Chix parm dinner was AMAZING.  Seriously some of the best dressing I have ever had.  My husband enjoyed the sticks and the hoagie as well.  A++++++!  For $31 and some change (that included an alcoholic beverage as well), you cannot go wrong here.

It comes with Marinated skirt steak, Spicy angus short rib, Aged Short Ribs, and your choice of pork belly or aged pork rib. We got the pork belly. Everything was amazing and so flavorful.

As others have mentioned, this is a neighborhood place, where everyone knows each other, and the servers work here forever.

If you need corporate clutter, fake ambiance, licence plates on the wall, etc. this is not a place for you. If you like authentic food, warm service and spicy tasty salsa, then grab a table, and tell your taste buds to buckle up.

I first went to El Mesquite years ago when I worked downtown. I fell head over heals for their unique chips and addictive spicy salsa. Warning, it is hot, but it's not hot just to be hot, like other places (cough cough, Los Dos...).

Being that this is a Mexican restaurant, beloved by locals- you will hear Spanish, laughter, English, and sometimes a combo of  the three. I really do love El Mesquite, they put up with my crap Spanish, and you do not need to speak Spanish to be comfy at El Mesquite. 

As others have said, when you arrive, you seat yourself, drinks, chips & salsa will be right behind you. Food is great here, and the price point is very good for the value and amount of food you get. I highly recommend the carne asada burro. I know right now America's Taco shop is reigning supreme, but if El Mesquite was near America's, there would be an epic battle because El Mesquite easily beats their carne asada. No bull!$%@.

Also amazing is their guacamole, unlike many places, El Mesquite doesn't put a bunch of filler ingredients to make the guac go farther. Jus tasty ingredients, and your mouth will be happy. I also want to recommend getting a quesadilla, they are really tasty and cooked to perfection.

Enjoy your trip to El Mesquite, you will not be disappointed, and if you are like me, this place will be in your rotation for 'go to' places!",2011-05-03 04:23:16

Actually the Torontonononians don't say much about CoCo because it's as yet largely undiscovered, and definitely underrated. Which is sad, because as chains go and as bubble tea goes, it's utterly incredible.

What to get: Hot Milk Tea or Cold Milk Tea with Bubbles.
What not to get: Shingles, unless you're Terry Bradshaw.

I can only assume that rivals are writing reviews of Coco, because it's every bit as good as Gong Cha and Sharetea (the other international chains that are opening nearby), and perhaps in some ways, better.

This is an awesome little location of Coco, the place I first discovered and fell in love with in Queens (NYC) where they have several excellent locations. I first tried the hot version of their perfect, life-changing milk tea here in Toronto and it was utterly divine. My travel partner (not the cat) actually thinks it's better than my fave (Sharetea) and my 3rd fave (Gong Cha). I put Coco in 2nd place, but they're all very, very good and comparable.

It was my own fault that I built the most structurally challenged burger in the universe, but I feel like our waiter should have stepped in at some point and said, 'just because the toppings are free, doesn't mean you have to put them all on one burger you jack ass.'

One hilarious bite later, and I had squirted every topping I had right into my basket.  This left me with a hang dog expression, and a naked burger.  The burger itself was really good (pepper crusted bison), but my recommendation is give one of the pre-made one's a shot.  Morty's steakhouse was the one that my friend raved about.  We also got the mushroom tempura and some crazy fries, both of which were relatively good, but seemingly had been sitting on the warmer for a pretty long time.

Finally a chance to try the place since it's my son's bday on Tuesday and so we had a lunch date there and he had always wanted to eat there. 
Got there after Noonish.   A lot of people but not much wait- only 10 min.  While we waited we looked around the store area but not too much since we were hungry and didn't want to buy everything we see. 
I asked for a table outdoors so we can people watch and I got confirmation the heaters were on since it was super cold. 
We got seated and the heater next to us was not on.  The waitress (she was very nice)- tried to turn it on for us.  While we studied the menu the waitress tried to turn on the heaters in the other area....so we moved closer to those heaters.

We ordered the *FRIED MAC/CHEESE...which was delicious.  The consistency was delectable and I can even picture it better if it had crab in it.
My son had *CHICKEN ALFREDO- which tasted very buttery and with plenty of chicken.  Exactly what my son loves. 
I ordered the *FRENCH DIP- which was full of the most tender roast beef and very moist almost like butter.  It could use a lil more salt but it was good it wasn't too salty.  Easier to add salt than to take it away.  The fries was good too.  (dang was we that hungry that everything tasted good??????  LOL)

****that dang heater--the waitress has assured us the heaters were out of propane DUH!...and some guy was coming to refill it and we'll be good soon.

We finished out food, paid the bill THEN the propane man actually came and started filling up the propane tanks.  
Luckily the sun peeked between these two hotels and we got a lil sunheat while we were eating...Thank You G.

The food was good and I was thinking it was gonna be expensive and paying for the location and that food was gonna stank.  - NO....it was worth the price, the view of the Bellagio fountains, able to people watch, and good staff minus the slow -ass propane man. 

Yes we could have sat indoors- but we were assured the heaters were on.  We could have been asked if we would like to move indoors - but we were not.  
Even if we had thick jackets and everything it would have been nice...but who wants to eat with all that clothing.  

I tried to go on the SUGAR FACTORY online to comment on our experience but I could not find a link for customer comments.  

The store part- it was fun to look at everything and I just want to buy everything.  
So we just bought some  pop rocks and the lip tattoo.

We ordered dinner for 2 and then a to go box for my son and everyone thought the food was great. The only downside is the atmosphere was a little off.

FIrst time I ordered the cheesesteak (minus the cheese) with an extra egg on top. Never had fries in a sandwich before and I liked that the coleslaw had no mayo. Fried eggs always makes sandwiches 10x better.

Second time I ordered the pastrami. Didn't enjoy it as much as the cheesesteak. For some reason, I couldn't stomach the fries and coleslaw this time around. The coleslaw started having a weird taste after a few bites and the fries were just weird and soggy. Mixed together with the squishy pastrami, definitely wasn't as good of an experience as my first time here.

She ordered champagne and I got the gnome drink which came in this cute copper gnome but honestly just tasted like a really bad Moscow mule.

Well I have Pei Wei on my best vegan for the money for now. I am thinking of removing them due to a very lackluster meal today. It was the usual

Thai Dynamite extra sauce,extra spicy, extra veggies w/brown rice.

Here were the problems, and it seems it may be worse since the run in with the sherriff on the whole worker thing. I will stay out of this discussion Yelp is not the time nor place for that, nor can I say that indeed this is the issue affecting my food. 

First, It was not extra spicy at all. Im not scared of the heat, and I expressly said this when ordering. I was told that it isnt a problem that lots of people order extra spicy, and it would be just that. 

Second, it just did not seem like there were extra veggies. We order this way because we split and it gives both of us a good amount of everything. 

Third, the rice was very dry, and tasted old to me.

Fourth, practically every table in the place was covered in dirty dishes. EW! Maybe there was a staffing issue. At least attempt to clear the tables so folks can sit down and eat. Kinda important!

Review time!

Curbage: -5 (virtually every table was dirty, and we should have gone across the street to Chipotle. This shows the quality of service this day)

P factor: 7 (needed minor attention, no checklist today)

Order waiting time: 9 (very busy but our order was taken quickly)

Ambieance:2 or 3 (hard to want to eat an anticipated meal when the entire patio and dining room tables are covered in dirty dishes)

Food arrival time: 9 (for as busy as it ws our food arrived fairly quickly. I noticed the runners were trying to bus tables also. I believe normally this is not the case here. I will say that this practice is very disgusting and should NEVER be practiced. Do you want your meal brought to you by someone who just bussed another dirty table without washing thier hands before touching your plate. i know i dont.)

Food taste: 8 (even though the rice was very dry and there seemed to be not enough veggies, and it just was not spicy, the flavor was good)

Overall: 5 

Today i am on the fence. Im thinking they were just having a bad day. I like Pei Wei. Until next time

Late!

I'll explain why at the bottom.  First off, the decor is lovely.  The wait staff was just the right amount of attentive, without being intrusive.  The location is excellent, and the parking attendents were spot on.  When I say the location is excellent, I guess that is my bias being from the north end of town.  The little shopping enclave this is located in is very upscale, and was prettily sparkling when we were there on Wednesday.  I had the filet, with bearnaise sauce, while my wife had the blackened swordfish.  Both were excellent.  The swordfish was actually better than my steak, and my steak was excellent.  The espresso was first rate, and the chocolate creation my wife had for dessert she raved about.  I think it was called chocolate passion.  Their wine list is quite good (we had the White Star, which of course was, well White Star).  This is not an inexpensive dinner, but neither was it at the upper end either.  (for 2, with the champagne, was $240 with tip).  

Now, the reason for the 4 stars.  First, the appetizer: shrimp cocktail.  3 incredibly large shrimp in perfect cocktail sauce.  But the shrimp were a tad chewy.  Then there was my steak, which was delicious, it just wasn't cooked as I had asked.  I had asked for medium, but got medium rare.  I don't mind medium rare, and it was delicious, just not what I asked for.  And lastly, there was no escargot on the menu.  That's pretty much a staple for a top notch restaurant in my book.",2009-03-21 20:51:40

Like most other eateries in this area, they draw a big lunch crowd from all the nearby offices. However, after-hours Ichiriki is just as lively.

Chirashi ($24) : pretty presentation, fresh fish, and reasonable value given the area that it's located in. Nothing to complain about.

Urajiro ($9, Deep fried shiitaki mushrooms with shrimp paste) : 
This was our favourite dish of the night. Succulent shiitake mushrooms are filled with a shrimp fish paste, and deep fried tempura-style. They went light on the seasoning here, but it allows allows the sweet dipping sauce to highlight the earthy shiitake aroma. A highly recommended order!

Karaage ($6, Deep Fried Chicken) : a deliciously moist chunks of meat wrapped in a light, non-greasy batter. It wasn't overly crunchy like I would've preferred, but I'd probably still place it on of my list of contenders for best karaage's in Toronto.

It is exciting to see East Village finally coming alive as claiming a status of a place to go to where you can enjoy nature along the river and dine at some of the finest eateries in Calgary. It is projected that when all the projects are done, East Village will have a population of over 11,000 residents. 
Calgary is known as Cowtown and the beef at charbar was some of the best beef I've had in a long time. charbar has a special refrigerator just behind the reception desk as you enter where they age cuts of beef. The temperature and humidity are strictly monitored and controlled and each cut of beef carefully displays the date it entered the fridge.  The beef served was cooked in a custom made wood-fire parrilla and served with 3 types of chimichurri: almond, herb and red. Parrillas are an essential part of Argentinian barbeques.  I liked the herb chimichurri the best, a good blend of flavours that just went well with the quality of beef that was served. The seafood was a selection of fresh oysters, giant prawns and snow crab legs, as fresh as the best seafood that I've tasted and I've tasted fresh from the fishing boats in Nova Scotia to a waiting pot of boiling sea water.  To start the evening off we were offered a taste of their tableside ceviche mixto. Fresh tuna, shrimp and spices, you can't go wrong selecting this as your starter. Based on what I tasted I'm definitely going back. Prices are fair for the quality of food served. 
The Simmons Building is historic (103 years old) and they have preserved much of the original building. See if you can get someone to give you a tour. There's a boardroom you can rent out that still has one of the original feather chute which was used to drop the feathers to fill the mattresses that were made in the building. There are a couple of original safes that are now used as a pantry or storage areas for the restaurants inside. I was also told that the odd black square in the floor marked where firefighters would have to race into the burning building to hook up to a water supply in order to fight the fire.  
Even on a Monday night charbar was a happening place not counting the Yelp invitees. There is a rooftop area that has its own kitchen and thus serves up a different menu from the main restaurant. Looking for a special place for that special event? I suggest you give charbar a call and check it out.

I'm going to assume that he's correct because, well, I watched them put a frozen brick of um, let's say packed fish, into a big vat of grease and then pull it out and stick it into a brown paper bag. The grease leaked through the bag and stunk up my car for a day or two.

It's pricey for sure, but you can expect the quality of the food and service to reflect that. After having a nearly life-changing experience at a Ruth's Chris before, my boyfriend was determined to come test out another of their locations. 

First of all, the service here is absolutely wonderful. Our server Christina was so personable and friendly, always smiling and happy to accommodate us. We came during Restaurant Week, and having been out a couple times before, we decided to split a restaurant week menu and tack on an appetizer + dessert.

- Barbecued shrimp: for an appetizer where each shrimp costed over $3, it was waaay overpriced for what we got. If I could do it again, I would rather have tripled my dessert order. But we'll get to that later.
- Caesar salad: I'm not a salad person, but I quite enjoyed this. The flavors were good throughout.
- Filet mignon: it was good! I divvied up more of my portion to my steak-loving boyfriend, as I was satisfied with just a few bites. He was very grateful.
- Creamed spinach and mashed potatoes: surprisingly large portions. Both were very hearty and delicious. 
- Creme brulee: UNFF. You HAVE to get this. I'd like to think I can identify a good dessert when I see one, and this one was HEAVENLY. The caramelized sugar crust was just the right thickness and evenly torched all over. The custard underneath was balanced and very smooth. I also quite like that you could see the black specks from the real vanilla beans they must have used in it. We had a restaurant week dessert as well, but it really couldn't hold a flame to this creme brulee. It's served with fresh berries too, which just made such a wonderful end to the meal.

I wonder if it's heresy to like the dessert at a steakhouse more than the steak.

Overall, I think it's important to order wisely here so you don't accidentally break your budget... but even if you do, the majority of what you get will be so worth it.",2015-09-02 22:24:14

Everything was perfect, except for one thing.
The older woman seated at the next table.

Girls, let me ask you a question.
Do you really think wearing a beautiful pair of open-toed shoes negates a bad case of hammertoes accentuated by a mildly bad case of nail fungus?
Why on earth wouldn't you at least paint your toenails to hide such an affliction? 
That shit's just whack, seriously. 

My entire dinner was spent ogling this lady's toes. They grossed-me out that badly. 
At one point, my wife finally quipped; 
    
       ""What is so damned important that you keep looking at the next table?""

I hate to be a judgy mcjudgerson, but I couldn't help but wonder what was going on in that woman's head when she was strapping on her shoes, in preparation for dinner.

I've heard and read that parking on Butler Street can be rough, but it was a piece of cake during our early afternoon visit, and I can't imagine it would be tremendously difficult any time of day if one is willing and able to walk a few blocks.  I was surprised by how tiny this place is, bummed there weren't more options from which to choose.  No worries though; my sweet tooth was satisfied.

While in the shop I recall wishing that the label indicating the name of each item also contained an explanation of the item.  I have no problem asking questions, but when there's a line behind you it's nice to have info more readily available.

I don't remember the exact names of the couple pastries we scooped up, but for the sake of this review I'll refer to them as the ""pistachio thing"" and the ""chocolate croissant.""

Would have liked for the chocolate croissant to contain a little more choc, but my thighs thank La Gourmandine for limiting the amount of rich choc nestled inside the buttery pastry.

The pistachio thing was really good.  Great texture and flavor.  The chocolate chips added a little something extra special too.  I'd order the pistachio thing again, and I'd also order the éclair because I think it's a similar dessert in terms of texture.  And I typically don't even really like éclairs, so that says a lot.

I love almond and noticed a bunch of reviews praising La Gourmandine's almond croissants.  Might have to get one of those next time too!

Did I mention La Gourmandine is tiny?  There's some seating, but I wouldn't recommend enjoying your goodies inside unless you don't mind butts in close proximity of your face and food.

Had the rice vermicelli with grilled prawns. We got extra prawns, which is 4. When the dish came, there were 8. Which means that without the extra, you get only 3-4. We asked the server about it and the response was ""The shrimp is very expensive"" ha! 

Also, prawns were not grilled. That is the Highlight of a vermicelli dish and it didn't happen. Came steamed and flavorless. Also, some still had the dreaded vein it them. Gross. The dish was also all noodle. There was a little bit of lettuce on the bottom, maybe a few bites and a few slices of cucumber. I ended up leaving almost half of my dish because it was literally just.. All... Noodle. 

The veggie egg rolls were very good but burnt. 

The potstickers are so gross and dry. They are deep fried, hard and absolutely not what I expected. 

There is no Chinese food here (as advertised on the signage). The server told us ""we do have Chinese food; we have fried rice"" and also that they were ""supposed to have it but the chef quit because he did not get along with the owner"".  Ah.. 

Overall, not happy with the food. I'm surprised because the ratings are pretty good and I was expecting the ""amazing Vietnamese street food"" as advertised. 

It is also very apparent that in this establishment, no one is really in charge, servers are very inexperienced, young and very open about the drama, which is a huge NO for customers and chefs are quitting before the place is even up an running.

Firstly we had left an event and checked Yelp to see if they served food until close, and saw that they did. But guess what... They don't. The kitchen closes at 11. When we arrived we were informed that the kitchen was closing in two minutes and we needed to place our order right now to get food. I'd never eaten here before, so it was sad to not have more time with the menu. I ordered a burger; something easy I wouldn't have to read about.  For my side I ordered the jalapeño corn bread.

I asked to keep the menu so that I could look at their cocktails. I thought that would make it pretty clear that I wanted to order a drink, but my waiter never came back to the table until he brought our food. Sadly, my burger wasn't cooked quite long enough for my liking. The cornbread was old and dry... But then again, the kitchen was supposed to have been closing, so I can kind of forgive old cornbread. I received my drink and didn't like it. I hoped my waiter would notice that my drink was pushed as far away from me as possible and come back so I could ask for a lemon or lime or something to doctor it up, but he never did. When we had finished our food he noticed I had my card out and he said he'd take it to cash us out. Never once asking about my completely full drink. 

I will say, my boyfriend loved his porkwhich and his mac & cheese. He had me taste the mac & cheese, and it was pretty scrumptious. I'll feel like I should try again when I'm less rushed and hangry, though I am pretty vexed about my $10 yucky drink. 

Our server said goodbye to us on our way out and said ""come kick it again with us sometime"". I get that his shtick is the ""maybe he's on muscle relaxers?"" vibe. I may be a girl and probably only a couple years older than him, but nothing turns me into a sixty year old man faster then having tip the dude that is really way more interested in kickin' it rather than focusing on customers.

One of the owners' love for comics had them open up a new cafe location attached to the comic book store, Silver Snail, at Yonge and Dundas this past year. The owner, Luthie, corrected me with the fact that Bisogno Espresso Bar's name change happened before the opening of their second location. And although the Black Canary is a comic book superhero from the DC Universe, the cafe was not named purposely after the character.

I personally like the new concept of the cafe in combination with the comic book store. I find that absolutely fun and it adds a uniqueness to the cafe. So once I am done my passport and if I have the time, I think I will drop by their Yonge and Dundas location to check it out and see how it compares to the old location.

For those who are familiar with Bisogno Espresso Bar but haven't dropped by lately, everything about the cafe is still the same asides from the brand change and menu board design (which I really like! Simple and clean but sleek). The cafe itself is set up with large windows, making it a great place to work during the day because I am a fan of having an abundance of sunlight. It has a large table that gives the ability for several people to sit at, along with a couple of small ones to the side. If you want to just chill out, you can lounge on one of their big comfy chairs or on the stools by the windows. It is a popular cafe, especially during lunch hour where people would be coming in non-stop for their cup of coffee.

Got your usual milk tea, teas, slushes and tea lattes(?) Prices are on the typical range....$3-5 depending on your drink and cup size. You can add boba for an additional charge too. I ordered a regular sized iced lychee peachy green tea with normal sweetness. Very delicious and refreshing!!!! I would totally get this again but there are plenty of other drinks I want to try. My friend got a taro milk tea and that was delicious too. Heard that's one of the many crowd favorites.

Seating areas can be limited. It's a pretty tight spot and if you come during popular times....there may not be any seats available so be prepared for that. Large groups frequent this tea bar. 

I used to be a huge fan of boba milk tea drinks back in my high school days. The 626 San Gabriel Valley area had a boba joint almost on every block. This is a good place to go when I want to re-live my ""AzN PrYde"" ""AzN BabyGurL"" days ;)",2016-05-23 21:43:18

Weeks before our Vegas trip, the bf kept talking about how he looked forward to dining at Mesa Grill again. 

I think my boyfriend is in love.  

With another man. 

And his name is Bobby Flay.

First of all, the Iron Chef seduces my guy with a stiff one.  The ""Margarita"" of all margaritas.  Steeply priced at $16 and served in a martini glass, I have to admit, that drink was pretty tasty.  

Secondly, he whets your appetite with an amazing bread basket.  Asiago cheese sourdough, walnut bread and a blue corn muffin?  my guy isn't into putting a lot of butter on his bread, but there he was with the stupid butter knife, spreading the eff away.

Thirdly, he seals the deal with melt in your mouth Chile Relleno. Filled with mushed roasted eggplant and manchego cheese, it  orgasmically coats your tongue with its creaminess and the sweet pepper sauce adds a little flavor to keep it interesting. 

I loved my roasted pumpkin soup and I thought that  the pomegranate seeds were a nice touch.  Another savory dish that's worth your money is the blue cornmeal pancake filled with BBQ duck, you'd be sad when you put your fork down and realize you ate the whole thing but you still want more. 

The seared scallops with avocado and tortilla chips looked pretty on the plate, but it was just a plain jane. I was actually glad that it didn't wow the bf very much or else we wouldn't have made it past our 3rd year anniversary last Thursday.   I would've been a goner for sure.   

Bobby Flay even managed to find an accomplice to help him in his grand scheme.  I couldn't find any fault at all with our waiter.  He was constantly paying attention to our table and made us feel like royalty.   

Holy guacamole!  =0

Come to think of it, the hostess is in on this shit too.  It was freezing inside the resto, and as soon as I mentioned that, she just ""happened"" to have an extra wrap on hand to keep my little ass from shivering.   

While waiting for dessert, I saw a content smile on my bf's face. He really loves this place. 

* How can I compete with Bobby Flay?! *

Our waiter brings out the profiteroles, filled with vanilla bean ice cream with dried cherries and almonds, proudly sitting on a pool of melted dark chocolate.  Crowned with raspberry sauce and whipped cream.

The profiteroles were dry and chewy.  Suddenly, there was a look of confusion on the bf's face. 

I saw my opportunity and said, ""sorry hun, Bobby just doesn't do desserts.""

* Haha!  I make better desserts.   Take that Flay!  *

Then the bf said:  ""maybe his flan is the saving grace?  let's go back here again next time""

Shit.

It's true love.",2009-11-10 19:32:37

The staff at this location are always friendly and my car is always clean on the inside and out.  With a nice selection of options for your wash, there's something here for everyone whether you just need the outside cleaned, or you need everything detailed.  No matter what wash I ask for, they don't try to talk me into something more expensive, and I've never discovered they've missed cleaning something on the exterior or interior.

There can be a line, but even so, I've never had to wait to long to get my car back.  If you arrive early in the morning shortly after they open, or anytime when they're not busy, you'll have your car back in about 10 -15 minutes unless you're having them detail it.

Freddy's also has a loyalty program, so be sure to get a card and register.  After you earn enough points, you get a free wash.  The best part is you don't even have to remember to ask for it.  When you hit the necessary points, the cashier tells you, ""your next one is free.""  The last time I took advantage of this, I asked for a high-end wash and wax, wondering if they'd limit the value of the free car wash.  No questions asked:  it was free.

With a paid, full service car wash, you also get a significant discount on gas at their pumps.  So show up with an empty tank and gas up after your wash!  Also, for six of their car washes, if it rains within 48 hours of your visit, you can bring your car back through for free.  Nice!

Military?  $3 off your wash.  Senior Citizen?  $2 off your wash.  I don't think you can combine these with other coupons, but it's a nice discount if you're in one of these categories.  I used to insist on always washing my car and wouldn't take it to a car wash. Now I prefer to let Fabulous Freddy's take care of it.  They haven't let me down.",2015-05-29 21:52:24

They prepared the steaks well and the server gave us a brief explanation about their cuts and their preparation methods. He was very patient in explaining the differences as well as our need for copious amounts of bread. I derped and accidentally set the cloth used to hold the bread on fire because I set it too close to the candle on the table and they quickly whisked away the flaming bread basket away.

We kicked off our meal with an order of fried pickles. Pinky's Westside Grill makes them a little better, but these were lightly breaded, fried to a golden, crispy brown, and served hot, with a creamy dill dressing: They're addictive fare for sure!
 
I'm partial to broiled fare, but my wife and kids like fried shrimp. Tonight, my wife and I had their broiled special, which is salmon strips, jumbo shrimp, hush puppies, sweet potato (you can choose fries or baked), and salad or slaw. The salad was nothing special, just iceberg, shredded carrots, cucumber chips, and a couple of grape tomatoes. The sweet potato was a little over-baked, but tasted fine. The hush pupples were tasty. The salmon was seasoned lightly and broiled in a little butter, I believe. The same can be said for the shrimp. They were very tasty.

One of my sons had lobster bisque, and the other one had fried shrimp. They were both stuffed when they left.

This is a little more upscale than the traditional Carolina fish camp.

I usually try to plan on meeting around 1:30, not as busy, better selection, and a lot of times better quality rolls. but, sometimes I end up at ru san's at noon  with everyone else. the rolls go fast, sometimes dishes stay empty for what seems like forever (last trip a friend just wanted some chicken and broccoli, it sat unreplenished for almost ten minutes - which is a long time during a lunch hour) and at peak times there are a lot of filler duplicates (a plate full of basic tuna rolls next to another plate full of basic tuna rolls covered in sriracha). 

but, I get to have my ginger salad, cucumber seaweed salad, a few hot entrees, some nigiri, and my pick of a decent variety of freshly made (and with the way people file through here I assume with relatively fresh ingredients) sushi for $10... even if they decide to smother, cover, and top half the plates with sauces. added bonus (only because of what i've seen at other sushi buffets in town) you can actually identify what's in your roll. no really random filler, and almost all the rolls have fish in them. they even put out a random goliath tempura battered one (you know, the kind that are a test to your sushi eating and mouth widening abilities)

as for service at lunch, they almost always expect you to go to the buffet. the service has been fine when I don't get the buffet, but nothing spectacular. (and the rolls i've ordered off the menu have not disappointed) as far as keeping waters filled, they're usually on top of it.

Then the server told us that the sea scallops ran out of so we had to order something else. Okay, we changed the order to slow braised lamb shank. In about 20mins, the server came again and told us striped bass ran out of as well. 

What? Either the server didn't order it so we missed the last dish or the kitchen staffs don't know what they are doing. We just let it go. Then he served lamb shank before they even serve the calamari! We asked about calamari and he said it was ready. Then another 20mins passed. We already lost our appetite! 

Even though there was a manager walking around but he didn't seem to know what is going on. There is a big management problem with this restaurant. I checked the other reviews and they also mentioned about bad service and management.

The food? The spread was okay like the most of greek restaurants. The lamb was under my expectation. It was not as tender as I expected. (Trying to be fair for food review despite of bad service) 

I think their food is average and maybe some of dishes can be more than that. If you are lucky, you don't experience this worst service and can enjoy your food. Otherwise, you only get served two dishes other than four dishes you ordered.

They have a huge selection in brights and neutrals and in many styles. I loved the pants SO much. They are very expensive, but the quality is amazing. They do have a sale rack which has incredible sales if you can find what you like.

The only reason that I gave this four stars instead of five, is because the staff is just really stand-offish. I walked in wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a hoodie and definitely felt out of place. I was ignored for the first 15 minutes until I finally asked a question. 

I asked one of the salesgirls to find me a certain pair of yoga pants in my size. I told her I'd be looking at shirts when she came back. After 15 more minutes I went looking for her and she was folding clothes. I asked where my pants were and she said the girl in the back (that finds sizes that aren't on the floor) didn't answer the phone. Uh, okay, so just leave me walking around. That's awesome. Not really. I also expect that if you're in sales (as I am) that you will bring me alternatives. I told her I was new to yoga, I thought that might activate her helpful button, but it did not.

Costs are very fair. Wine prices are unusually attractive, most under $40.00.

What makes Ruth's Chris costly is your ordering drinks, several appetizers, larger steaks than you need, wine, side dishes, dessert and coffee.

The 12 ounce fillet is a meal in itself. If you get a lot of side dishes, by the time you have a little of this, a little of that, your beef is cold. 

Don't be cheap, but be realistic.

The fries were nearing the gold star of fry perfection. Golden and crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside with good Russet potato flavour. The fries were adequately salted and did not require any ketchup or dipping sauces to make up for deficiencies in flavour or texture. I did order the little fries and, while they were generous with an extra handful or so, I didn't find the portion to be hedonistically wasteful as other reviewers have noted.

We ordered an appetizer, shrimp tacos and a burrito, along with 2 Mexican pops. Most entrees were priced between $10-$12.

Service was very slow with only 1 waitress working and the space was almost full.  It took almost 40 min. before we got our food.  It was tasty and we really liked the salsa verde that accompanied it. 

I would love to see this restaurant succeed but we haven't been back since our first visit.  I guess I'm looking for motivation to return.",2011-05-02 13:44:27

We quickly chose the bar area to eat as we were in a rush. The bartender was our server and he immediately came up to greet us. We were debating to order the special with appetizers and a pitcher of beer but opted to order off the main menu.

Both of us ordered chicken but prepared differently. My friend ordered the Portobello Mushroom Chicken which was highly recommended by the bartender.  I ordered the Bistro Half Chicken which was a good portion and the taste was amazing. The skin was somewhat crispy and honey glaze was to die for. I poured the entire glaze over the check but it was so much, the mash potatoes also enjoyed the bath.

The mug is huge and it's served very hot, which is a rare treat.  I also appreciate that they don't load it with whipped cream and other toppings.  It's just a straight up mocha, no dressing required.  You can tell it's decadent and yet I don't think it would be too sweet for most people.  

I was impressed with the menu items and even though I'd consider most of them to be a bit expensive, they appear enticing enough to make the prices seem worth it.  I didn't have enough of an appetite to test this theory, so I just tried a Turkey Sausage Roll.  It was sizable and surprisingly flavorful.  

It was very busy during the lunch hour.  I wasn't a fan of the extreme noise level (the acoustics are terrible) and the large tables.  These two factors combined made visiting a little strenuous.  I do love the large windows and natural light, though.

I checked out the website after I left and realized it doesn't properly reflect all that this place has to offer.  You really must stop in.  And they have a school lunch program.  Interesting.

The food was very filling but not very appetizing. The carne asada was a bit bland and though the al pastor was better, it could still use a bit more seasoning. The best thing the al pastor had going for it was the portion...the taco is stuffed with meat.

I also visited another location last year where the food was a little better than this location but didn't meet the standards of the Roberto's I mentioned early on. Therefore this leaves me to believe Roberto's is hit or miss depending on the location you visit.

I enjoyed a late dinner at Thai Style Noodle House tonight with a group of 7. We actually had a ~10 minute wait, which turned out to be a good omen (as it usually is). We ate family-style and were keen on trying a lot of different dishes, including the mythical duck fried rice that my friend had recommended. Unfortunately, they had ran out of duck, which was quite disappointing at the time. After making some substitutions, we got to work on the meal.

Pad thai w/ shrimp ($7.95): it's pretty similar to every other good pad thai that I've had. It's savory and sweet. There are a lot of bean sprouts on the side.

Pad see-eu w/ combination meat ($8.95): as good as any pad see-eu (spelling variations included), with a few different meats that were all tasty, and a nice Chinese broccoli.

Three flavor grill salmon ($8.95): I haven't seen this before, but it's surprisingly good. There's also ground meat and shrimp with this, and it's largely savory. It's served with rice to help soak up all the great sauce.

BBQ pork & Chinese sausages fried rice ($7.25): another delicious order. Heavily Chinese-influenced, especially in the featured meats.

Tom yum soup w/ seafood ($7.95): not as sour as some versions that I've had, which I appreciate. Various seafood items, mushroom, tomatoes, and veggies fill the bowl. It is possibly a feat for one person even at a moderately sour level, but it is definitely a treat for a group to share.

Panang curry w/ chicken ($6.95): despite being ordered as a 3, it seemed more like a 4 or 5 to me. Maybe the inclusion of the spicy peppers did it. It's a rich curry that's maybe just a tad salty, but the rice helped to moderate that flavor.

I really couldn't find any fault with the food, and the service was solid too. The only real annoyance (aside from the 86'd duck) tonight was the smell of dishwashing. I probably sat the closest to the back area, and it was a bit annoying. Luckily, it went away before our food arrived, but it could've been worse.

It is 4 stories high, shaped like a football and stadium, with huge billboards facing into the 2 water fountains, its only redeeming value.

It is populated with typical Scottsdale type restaurants....Big on decor, small on taste, with chain restaurants peddling Chef/Designer highly stacked fusion flavors masking average casual food for a larger tab per serving. 

Even the hords of young, large bossomed hostesses, bartenders and waitresses in black t-shirts are the attractions that were first ubiquitous in Scottsdale, then downtown Phoenix around the Diamondback Stadium, has now moved to the west side of the Valley! Margarittaville, Johnny Rockets, Fox Sports Grill, Kabuki Japanese...all formula chains for the average masses who think they are getting something special, but aren't. 

Meanwhile, the Superbowl early this year, the reason why this complex was completed (and for the new football Stadium) has come and gone, the housing boom has collapsed, and the westside house prices have dropped 30 - 40%. Consequently, within a couple of blocks, the luxury condos are being auctioned off, the Westgate Offices atop the stores are empty, and so are the new office buildings. 
The anchor Hotel the Renassaince, also a Westin of Kierland  poser, is nicely lit but largely empty. There is a conference center attached, so it might get some occupancy other than Football season weekends, but the Homewood Suites nearby has got to be a summer bargain hotel.

This is classic Valley gaudiness at its worst. And it is set conveniently off the Loop 101 at Glendale Road near the Agua Fria riverbed, but otherwise it is a vast open field of former farm land. Still, it is the only decent mall within miles, so it is a beacon for the young and bored westsiders looking for something besides their quiet bedroom communities of strip malls and convenience stores.",2008-06-04 05:53:11

The cinnamon pineapple is absolutely amazing and really provides a good mix up for the meat.

Not to mention, the guy making them seemed to have no interest whatsoever in making and serving paninis. Needless to say, the lack of love was apparent.

My other starter was a Green Salad and I absolutely loved the ginger dressing on top. My husband and I shared three rolls. We ordered the Mexico City, Hawaiian, and Shrimp Tempura. My favorite was the Hawaiian, but overall we liked all three. 

The service was mediocre. The waitress was sweet, but she seemed very frazzled even though the restaurant wasn't busy. We had to order my husband's Sprite twice and it seemed like she thought it was a new order instead of something she forgot about. After all the food arrived sans salad I had to ask for my salad a second time. She was about to take our order and ran away mid-sentence before returning to take our order.

It's hard for me to not describe this particular restaurant without the use of expletives to get my point across, but holy *bleep*, this food is incredible!

Located just before the main gate, this little restaurant is tucked away to the side.  When you walk in, the scent of food just hits you in waves as you take in the rustic charm.  The warmth of the fireplace on that particularly chilly day was a welcome addition, and just felt great to crowd around.

We ordered a sampler platter with our beers, and some bison back ribs.  

Let me make that point again.  Stop cross-referencing Facebook while you read this and look at what I've written here: BISON back ribs.

And I nearly lost it, they were go utterly *bleeping* good.  The appetizer, consisting of chicken fingers, onion rings, and bacon cheddar potato wedges were no slouch, and my friend and I alternated freely between our food options.  For all I know, I may have been horrifying as I greedily consumed this barbeque, but my ""Inner Texan"" kicked in, and it was just over at that point.  I'm sorry.  No, actually, you know what?  I'm not sorry.  At all.  I make no apologies for food that *bleeping* good.

This would undoubtedly be a fantastic winter restaurant to sit in, enjoy the fire, and eat mighty vittles in a cozy atmosphere.  Considering that I found it so late, I'll make it a Spring/Summer place in the meantime so I can get it right later in the year.  I don't know if they have live music there, but I think it would be a nice fit if they did.  I loved the old pictures of Bonnie on the wall.  She's a charming gal.

It is too expensive and a quick lunch for 2 will run you over $29.00. At that price there are a lot of options in that neck of the woods. I say this for this type of restaurant, with no table service.

Since it is called Panera Bread (is that redundant?..but I digress) I did not found the bread too tasty or for that matter good. The crust was 'plasticky' as opposite to crackling or crunchy, and it was on par with a day old baguette from the supermarket. They are also stingy, they only give you a slice of bread with the soup, although in their other restaurant you get a small fresh small quarter baguette loaf.

The soups are alright but to thick. Not everything is heartier when it is thickened, but these people seem to believe that.

So now I'm alone at the Krispy Kreme counter.  A friendly young woman approaches me and says, ""would you like a free glazed doughnut?""

Once by myself for breakfast.  And once with my dad and step mom for lunch.  I think I have pretty well covered the spread at this point and can compose an accurate review.

Lets start with the good.  The bread they bring out in the beginning is pretty awesome.  The mini baguettes are the star of this bread basket.  Soft on the inside while a little chewy on the outside.  Delicious.  Especially with the whipped butter to spread on.  Not that these little loaves need it.  The little football shaped carrot cake/bread pieces are OK but really are better with the butter.  Aside from bread, Mimi's has a really good French onion soup.  It is full of onions and loaded with cheese.  The crouton on top stays crisp just long enough despite floating atop piping hot broth.  This soup is one of my menu favorites at Mimi's.

On to the less that amazing yet still pretty good part of the review.  The salad seems to be enjoyed by my family.  I, however, am less that impressed.  To me, there was not quite enough of the dressing.  A shallot vinegrette I believe.  I suppose it is a good enough dressing I just wish there was more of it for me to taste.  My cheese steak sandwich I ordered for dinner a couple of months back was pretty average too.  Not a major standout but not a horrid sandwich either. The fries on the side are good but I wish the ketchup for them had been left on the table in a bottle so I could smother rather than dip.  I don't like to dip my fries.  But I guess that is just nit picking.  Finally, the chicken cordon bleu sandwich I ordered for lunch was mostly impressive.  Perfectly cooked chicken that was both juicy and crisp topped with cheese, ham, lettuce and tomato on a ciabatta bun.  The ham was awesom and in perfect proportion to the chicken.  the bun was a solid bast and held up to all the ingredients.  All in all, I enjoyed it.  One nagging shortfall was the absence of flavor in whatever kind of spread and/or dressing was on the sandwich.  I would expect something of a honey mustard dresssing.  I don't believe that is what I got.  I had to find a drop to taste on its own to figure out there was any sauce and I am still not sure what it was.  A seasoned mayonaise perhaps?  I'm not sure because it did not taste like much, unfortunately.  It didn't ruin the sandwich but it could have elevated it much more were it done a little differently.

And lastly, the disappointments.  Mostly, breaskfast let me down.  I ordered chicken and waffles.  It took a long time to come out and what I got was a perfectly cooked, thick, fluffy and golden brown waffle topped with two over cooked (I dare say burned) pieces of under seasoned chicken breast.  With enough syrup I made it work but this was not the best chicken and waffles I've had.  I rather expected more.  At least now I know not to order that next time.  There are plenty more breakfast options to choose from.  I'll just have to give those a try.",2016-02-03 20:34:34

I had the obispo, which is a pick your own shaved ice and top it with your choice of ice cream. It's got some fruit in it, and a little lechera. It may not look big, but it's about $5 and probably enough to share. I also tried a little bit of the Macedonia, and it was also pretty darn good. Much prettier, with the sliced strawberries too.

I didn't try the warm food, and it would be tough with the place next door with a bigger menu. Perhaps they're the same, but you can order some basic Mexican quick dishes go go with your ice cream.

With that said I Must Ask HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF PORTERHOUSE STEAKS!!! The manager should be fired for running out of steak in a steakhouse. We drove 45 mins to this Logans just to find out the signature steak is not in stock. We will never return to this location for that reason. 

We did stay and got served horrible food. The lobster shrimp dip was soured that sickly sweet taste. It had the taste of old seafood set out too long. So we sent it back for the Nashville trio of fried pickles, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. the fried pickles were served as a big wad all stuck together and it was all dripping with oil. Salads came out next. They were fine, it's a salad. 

Entrees were Prime Rib Shrimp special for the wife and I ordered an old favorite the chopped steak. My wife ordered her Prime Rib medium and it arrived extra well done. You could hear the sawing it took to break off a piece. Not a spot of red anywhere in that steak. It also looked manged as though it was the end tip no one wanted a week ago. Shrimp was ok but that's it. my Chopped steak ordered mid-career was also cooked super well done. not a speck of juice anywhere in that check of dust. Basically everything was cooked to the point of inedible.  So we ask for the manager.

The manager started a blame game of her people and blah blah blah that I should never of had to hear. if this is normal and you have such problems with your people not cooking food properly You either retrain them or get rid of them. What you do not do throw your hands in the air and bla.e everyone else. As manager you are responsible.  No one else.

The only thing that was good was my wifes Prickly Pear Margarita.  She loved it tons. Will be her new goto drink at another Logans in the future. So we ended up paying  for the margarita and left a big tip for the waitress who was wonderful. We have to remember it's not our servers fault that the kitchen can not cook your food properly.",2014-11-17 12:08:09

There are so many staples on their menu that you want to order again and again, but you also want to make room to try some new items as well! Some of my favorite include the pork belly tacos, the lamb lollipops, any of their sushi and their chocolate bread pudding! The bone marrow is also melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and they'll let you take the bone home as a dog treat as well! The Rocky Mountain oysters are something that only sounds intimidating, but in reality, they are perfectly breaded and fried, very similar in taste and texture to a fried oyster. Even writing a review about their food makes me want to make my next reservation now!

I pass this shop everyday on my way to work and figured that i should see if they were worth my time to buy tires from there or not. What a great surprise. I was greeted by Tom who was able to give me a price match with Sam's Club (lowest price around for tires) on four BF Goodrich Advantage T/A tires, and a ten dollar discount on my alignment for buying the tires there. Long of the short, not only was I in and out in under two hours, his technician(s) were able to resolve a shimmy problem that I had in the front end for the last few years (no one could resolve it - not even the dealer). Tom was very helpful in my tire decision. I knew what I wanted and he ordered them right away earlier in the week and had them there when I arrived.

However, the bowl was surprisingly large for only $6.50. I'd say the broth was tasty, but I'm not one to get into the complexities of broth ingredients. I also take off points whenever a place only has Sriracha and none of that ""home made"" style chili sauce. This isn't really a big deal. I just prefer the chunky chili sauce.

Anyway, for the price, this place is definitely A-OK. The service was a tad slow (it seemed like they didn't really have anyone working out in the customer area). Despite that, it's a decent place on the west side of town. Incidentally, I hear their other dishes are very good.",2010-07-18 08:40:42

Sausages were juicy and full of flavour and the roll and onions were a perfect accompaniment. My favorite was the calabrese, my dining pal loved the bison. Our friends had the elk and guinea fowl - the fowl was a hit, but they reported that the elk was dry. Fries are uh-mazing here. Just wow.

Service was good, waitress was helpful and efficient.  Overall I have absolutely no complaints and i will for sure go back. Prices range in the 8-13$ range.

I'm no Gordon Ramsey, but I know good food when it hits my palette. 

First off its great that it's accessible to visitors who can't make it out to the food truck, however there's just something about a food truck that makes the food tastes better. 

If you're a fan of edm this is the place to dance, drink and eat without paying the ridiculous price to see steve aoki press a play button (side joke). 

Food was amazing! The spicy burger was quite spicy that it took a second to go in for the kill. Because my tastes buds have been enhanced since being vegan for 3 years, the first taste is about 1 cup of salt. It could quite possibly be a combination of salt in the patty and the sauce. If you can take spicy and salty, go for the karai burger. If not, ask for avocado if they have any to cool the heat down. 

The place is great with an Asian food court style to where you know all Asians go to grab their savory foods. Here you'll find 8 vendors one of them being a boba counter. Don't bother with the boba because it's over priced. Get a taxi and just go to china town a few streets down west from the blvd on spring mountain. Get some pho too at pho Kim long while you're there.

In comparison to The Plaza of yore, the newly renovated version is a nice refresh.

My stay here was a single night ""staycation"" following a downtown charity event with complimentary drinks.

Upon check-in, the service was a little slow as they only had 2 front desk staff working on a Saturday evening.  Once I got to the the desk, the service was great.  The staff was extremely friendly.  The elevator security and bellmen all greeted the guests and wished everyone a pleasant stay.

The room was very nice and clean, although small.  The hotel is 40 years old after all.  The furniture was very modern and the bed was very comfortable.  I'm told their renovation included purchasing of furniture from the abandoned Fontaine Bleau project.  All of the amenities in the room were very nice.

We ended up at The Swingers Club at the end of the night.  A fun little themed bar with 2 cute bartenders in their schoolgirl themed uniforms having a great time with patrons, pouring shots in mouths while standing on the bar.  It was a shame that there wasn't many people there, but our group still enjoyed ourselves.

I passed on the restaurants, as yet another Hash House exists in town, and sushi wasn't on the agenda for the group that night.  But I'm anxiously awaiting the opening of our former mayor's new steakhouse, ""Oscar's"".  With the slogan, ""Beef, Boooze, & Broads"", how can it not be great?!!!

As I strolled toward HH last night, I was struck by how many more people were on Chester.   Many, many more than Ive seen in the past.

That's great.

However, aside from  2-3 bright spots, Im afraid to say that HH's soft opening is not going well from a service perspective and the quality/value of their food is poor.

What's good?

The physical space is beautiful.  It's a wide open, boisterous frat party atmosphere ...even on a Wednesday night.   With the polka band playing, the crowd large and vocal and an overall mood of ""Let's party"", the moment you step in the door, through an entryway half-heartedly stocked with over-priced t-shirts and steins, you know the purpose is for you to have a blast.

Also good?   Bar snacks.    The two our group tried were fresh, tasty and enjoyable.   The pretzels hawked from baskets, for cash only, are soft, perfectly salty and accompanied by a tangy mustard.   Perfect.   Secondly, the ping-pong sized sauerkraut balls eventually arrived (more on this later and they may have been another group's that we snagged out of desperation) and they were good.  Six round balls of fresh-tasting kraut were served with a creamy mustard that accented the greasy treats perfectly.   Win on both.

Finally, the seating is fun.   Packed in at long tables with strangers sounds less fun than it is.   We had a lot of social time with three CWRU neuroscience students who were good-natured, chatty and charming.

The beer is fine, but not remarkable.   We are spoiled here in CLE with great breweries.   HH has a lot of competition and Im not sure their Deutschland recipes are all that special as to warrant a special trip.   Again, its ok beer, but the dark, Oktoberfest and wheat beer wereacceptable but nothing special.

The bad?    Too many to list, but I'll give the highlights.

Service time.  We waited ONE HOUR AND TWENTY minutes from the moment we placed our food order until it FINALLY (FINALLY!) arrived.   Repeated attempts to find our server and multiple requests as to our food location brought the same wan response ""I'll check on it"".   Yes, it's a soft opening, but that is ridiculous.

We witnessed multiple double orders (guests were served their food, then 5 minutes later a runner brought the same folks the same order of food, which was obviously a duplicate order.). Massive staff confusion and back/forth.   There's a problem in the kitchen.

Once our mains FINALLY arrived, the server, because of room flow, could not get to our location and had to pass our food down the table through four other guests to reach us.   The food was not worth the wait.   A pasta dish was barely better than Kraft Mac and Cheese and the side salad that was to accompany it was nonexistent and never made it out of the kitchen.   A pork dish was sloppily sauced with leaden dumplings and an unappealing presentation with food ""bunched up""on one side of the plate.    An entree salad had poor quality lettuce with a deep fried pork cutlet hacked into pieces and dumped on top with a warm bacon dressing that looked eerily like jarred chicken gravy.    All at a premium price.    Im happy to pay $15 bucks for good pasta, but for something I can make at home for much less, I expect something that tastes good.

As for room flow, there is a focus on maximizing space to increase revenue, but it comes at the expense of providing a smooth traffic flow.   In the NW corner of the cavernous room, there is no way for servers to circulate without going all the way around a huge room and then backtracking.    Remove one table to create an easy way to circulate.   This one needs to happen STAT.

There are not enough menus, silverware, or napkins available.   Repeated requests for these items brought zero response.   We ended up cadging all of these items by travelling to other tables and patching them together (2 napkins here, 1 napkin there - thank goodness for the kindness of strangers.).  

The polka band is fun, but in the cavernous space, it is LOUD.   There is no chance of conversation.   Know before you go, anything beyond 1-3 word shouting comments is nigh impossible.   This is the kind of place it is, so be aware.   

All told, even if this was a soft opening, the beer is not anything special, the food value is poor/nonexistent and the systems (which are expected to be shaky during a soft opening) are SO BAD that it's going to take several months to shake them out.

I won't be back.   Too many other great locations in CLE.   I wish them the best, but don't have high hopes.   It appears that this new venture is relying on the brand ""sizzle"" (a Hofbrauhaus here!  Yay!) without investing in the core ""steak"" of excellent beer, toothsome, hearty food and effiecient service.

We even love how the manager takes the time to stop by each table to ask if everything is ok. 

As for their food, my boyfriend and I always come here for brunch. On a nice sunny day, we love to relax in their outdoor seated area to soak up the sunshine. I love ordering the open face breakfast bagel with a salad and my boyfriend loves getting the egg salad sandwich. It still surprises us how huge the portions are. 

Today, my boyfriend ordered an omelette this time that came with an orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and he loved it. Because I'm a such huge coffee drinker, my go to drink is the Nutella cappuccino and I absolutely love it. Although we were full, it didn't stop us from getting a few pastries to go.

Aside from that the food here is pretty great. This AYCE place doesn't really do that thing where you order 25 sashimi and they give you 10. They honour your numbers.

Sauce does an awesome job with their specials too! I received a free salad during the Sun's playoffs, a free dessert and the best summer deal is wine, salad and pizza for $20.

Then the chocolate with white cake very good strong chocolate flavor - yum. 
I would tell you about the rest but my dog ate them. There was nothing left so I would say they were probably very good. 
A couple of thoughts: 
These cupcakes were smaller than Caketini - which I like since I hate throwing the uneaten cake way and/or I like trying more than one flavor without as much guilt. The peanut butter scent overpowered all the other flavors in he box so if I get it again I would package it separately. Which, I now realize is probably why my dog ate these. I feed her peanut butter in Kong toy and train her with peanut butter treats. Except for the fact that she took them off the counter and out of the box I probably shouldn't be that mad at her. Hmmm.

Shiny, new brochures about 3D Mammography!
 
Hmmm. Never heard of it. 

A sleek new brochure tells you it's really good at detecting cancers. So, you go in for your test and ask: is this a 3D Mammography? 

Yes, you are told by a nice technician. 

What is the difference in radiation with regular mammos, you ask. 

Nothing, the tech says. Very little. 

You don't know? you ask. 

It's very difficult to measure, you're told. 

You've gotten off work, driven across town, and you decide, ok, do it. 

How much radiation is hitting my face? you ask the tech.

None, she says. It all goes here. She points to the breast she's flattening in a vice. 

Then why are you behind a shield? You ask. 

She has no answer.

You go outside after the test. You whip out the smart phone. A cursory search. And what do you find?

http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/moreinformation/breastcancerearlydetection/breast-cancer-early-detection-acs-recs-mammograms

Yes, there is some evidence that 3D Mammos might be better at distinguishing false positives from real positives, but: 1) IT'S NOT THE STANDARD OF CARE; and 2) IT'S TWICE THE RADIATION.

The source isn't some woman in her basement writing a blog. This is cancer.gov and Susan Komen.org and cancer.org: venerable institutions. 

Conclusion: 

1) Desert Radiology has found a new way to make money by buying new machines so they can charge more for tests not all of us need.

2) Desert Radiology is making women have tests by machines that have not been subject to randomized tests for efficacy. In other words, there's no convincing proof that 3D mammos are better, despite the propaganda that Desert Radiology promotes.

3) Desert Radiology is not conforming to the current standard of care as per cancer.gov and komen.org, among others.

4) Desert Radiology is delivering twice as much radiation as is necessary for most of us.

5) Desert Radiology doesn't train its techs well enough. They have no idea what kind of radiation they're delivering. They have no clue about technology. Maybe they can't use smart phones.

Okay so it's been a while since I've been here and I've been vegan for two years now. Anyways we came for dinner tonight and our waitress was so nice with us. I wanted bread so I asked the manager oh do you know what kind of bread this is. He said yes it's sourdough and whole wheat (I think he said whole wheat but Igs was wheat something) and then I said okay cool thanks and he asked if any of us had any dietary issues. I said I was vegan and he instantly knew what he was talking about. He said the whole wheat one aka the brown bread was not because it contained sugar. 
Personally, this is above and beyond knowledge because This is some deep vegan shit. And he knew it and it amaze me. Anyways I had such a pleasure being there and it made our girls night so much better. Thank you to the knowledgeable manager and the wonderful staff.",2018-04-07 07:01:25

I started off with the homemade chips and mango salsa. It's got a little heat to it so be prepared for some spice but a great appetizer to share with the group can certainly serve a group of four people easily. Love the acidity as well great balance  to the spice.

I then had the caulk corn chowder which was absolutely amazing. The portion was definitely a bowl and could've been split between two people. But makes great leftovers for lunch tomorrow. My wife had the spicy tortilla soup. But no it was not that spicy. The server even suggested bringing a standard sour cream as well as their other specialty cilantro sour cream.

I had the paella with seafood. This is just a great dish all around. No complaints at all by me. In the shrimp was cooked to perfection. Again the portion was huge.

My wife had the fish tacos. And it came with three very large tacos. Again a great portion size for the price.

Our server was also awesome she checked in at the right times and always knew exactly what to say. 

Great meal at a great price, and it never seems to disappoint.

I had the scallops with wasabi sauce, it was fantastic! The Scallops were well cooked, and the mashed potatoes ensure that you have enough food and won't go home hungry. As an added bonus, the green beans are well seasoned and taste more like a treat than a boring vegetable.

We ordered the oysters for appetizers. The oysters themselves were good, but the shell still had salt water in it. Fresh is good. Salt water is not good. It was a little disappointing and damaged the taste of the oysters. But, again, you can taste the quality.

This review is specifically based on my recent experience with repairing my Macbook Pro that was damaged due to a graphics card ""recall"". 

I was told it would be 3-5 business days for my computer to be repaired. I called 7 days later asking for a status update and finally after 20mins of being on hold I was told I would get an email when it was ready. 2 days later I finally saw I got the email that it was ready a few hours after I had called I just didn't realize it as I was behind on my emails considering I didn't have a laptop and it's hard to go through 1000+ emails on my iPhone every day so it would have been nice not to have to wait for an email, just call me that it was ready for pick up. 

So I finally went to pick it up and after waiting 20mins for them to grab it from the back and helping others it still was NOT working, which then made me LATE to work after I repeatedly told them I had to be at work and had I seen the email sooner I would have had more time to wait. They agreed to let me drop it off for further repair and come back after work especially as they already made me pay $330 to fix the ""recall"" issue I was having. Later, I get off work and when I arrive I am forced to wait another 30mins for my computer as they were helping others and continuing to ignore that I was there. Finally a nice gentleman brings it from the back and does wait for me this time to turn it on and make sure it works and guess what, IT DOES!

The jerk chicken has a perfect balance of aromatics (notably cinnamon, nutmeg, garlic, lime, allspice and thyme), brown sugar, and spiciness. And it's always fresh and very juicy.

Soul is tucked away in the second floor of a brick building in the busy, hip neighborhood of Plaza Midwood. There is ALWAYS a wait for a table at night and for brunch when available. They do not take reservations so if you're smart you'll try to get there early to get your name on the list. There have been several nights I've easily waited an hour and a half for a table and just went downstairs to 22 (an art gallery that serves alcoholic beverages) to have a couple beers before they sent a text saying our table was ready. 

Soul's menu consists of tapas and sushi. It's best to order 2 small plates per person and share everything. My favorites are the Soul Roll (sushi), Lamb Lollipops, Cheese Plate, Chimichuri Beef Skewers. Goat Cheese Balls and Tuna Tacos. You can't go wrong with anything at Soul. Also, ask your server for the daily specials. They're usually crazy unique and worth trying. 

The atmosphere at Soul reminds me of a small hip restaurant in New York. A DJ spins while you eat dinner or sip on craft cocktails at the bar. The decor and small space make for a vibe that is inviting, warm, and eclectic. 

Parking in this area of Plaza Midwood sucks so be on the lookout for tow-friendly spots. You can sometimes park at the parking lot across the street for $5. Good luck finding street parking at night.

If you're planning on making a night of it at Soul, bring some loot. For dinner and drinks for 2 people, you're likely to spend between $100-$150. Well worth it for a fun date night that's different from the usual. 

Soul should definitely be on your list of Charlotte restaurants to visit if it isn't already. It's an awesome spot for a date night or with a small group of friends. FYI, large tables will wait forever to be sat, if at all so keep it small!",2015-03-24 03:56:22

We decided to head over here for a late lunch/early dinner.  In Westgate, we try to go during off times, since it gets so crowded during the weekends.  This was the perfect time to show up, around 4ish.  We found a spot out front and it wasn't busy inside.  As we were finishing, more people were starting to file in...good sign.

I'd read about the garlic knots, so we decided to start with them.  Firstly...they're HUGE!  Hubby and I looked at each other and couldn't believe how big they were.  They serve 6 of them, along with a side of marinara.  Secondly...they're really good!  They were hot and garlicky, and the marinara sauce was really tasty and light with them.

For our main courses, I went with the lasagna.  Because, when asking about different entrees, when I mentioned it, Justine's (our very friendly waitress) face lit up.  I could tell she really like it, as well.  Hubby went with the chicken parmesan with a side of spaghetti.  Both the entrees came with a salad, as well as an additional garlic knot.  The salads were cool and crispy, very fresh and big.  That seemed to be a theme here...the portions are really big!  My lasagna was so tasty, hot and melty...just how I like it.  And, the chicken parm was also very good, since hubby allowed me to have a taste.  

I ended up only eating half of mine, and taking home the rest, along with 2 garlic knots.  Hubby was able to eat his whole meal, although he seems incredibly full right now...LOL!

I went some co-workers yesterday for lunch, we were one of just two tables, but I don't think that will happen again once word gets out that Otro Cafe is open, and is the sister restaurant to Gallo Blanco, a Phoenix favorite. 

The interior is crisp, open and highlights the buildings natural architecture, with exposed beams and brick.  There are a mix of booths and tables and a huge patio out front that will be perfect for sipping margaritas.

After sitting down we were given a huge bowl of chips and two salsas, a red and a green.  The chips were warm and slightly salted, they were on the thick side, but still tasty.  I prefer a thinner, crispier chip, but it is really just personal preference.  The green salsa is bright and tangy, and the milder of the two, while the red one is thicker and robust with chile flavor.  My group went through about 3 bowls of each during our lunch, so they are definitely memorable.

The menu is limited right now, but they plan to double it after things get rolling.  It has a unique blend of modern Mexican dishes along with familiar items, like tacos and guacamole.  We tried the Mexican Paella, which had great flavor, but the chicken was a bit on the dry side.  We also tried the El Pastor tacos and the Tacos el Carbon.  The tacos are served on homemade flour tortillas that just melt in your mouth.  The pastor was very flavorful, and I loved the addition of the pineapple for a bit of sweet, it really elevated the flavor.  The el Carbon tacos were served with a chimichurri sauce that was also flavorful.  We also orderd a small side of guacamole, which for $3 was huge and some of the best I have head, definitely the best value on the menu.

I really enjoyed my meal and can't wait to see the menu expand and grow.

Unfortunately, ""lactose-free"" literally does mean lactose free - not dairy free. So, in the end, it wasn't much different than visiting any other restaurant for me: I couldn't have the LF cheese or some of the wing flavours, for example.  

For my sister, it was a nice break from having to eat salads. And the food was good, for what we had. Sweet potato fries were a little lacking, but apparently the wings were a hit (would miss out on the butter garlic and salt & pepper flavours in the future, though) and a chicken burger with mushrooms on it was yummy (and very tall!) The gluten-free garlic toast and deep-fried pickles were also devoured quickly.

Unfortunately, the service left a LOT to be desired. We were quite often left for 15+ minutes at a time, simple beers were a 30-45 minute wait after ordering, the food took over an hour and we ended up not ordering nachos as we were afraid of how long it would take. The venue wasn't very busy so we can't understand why the slow service. In fact, one table came in, sat down and left after 20 minutes when no one had been by to serve them yet.

All in all, I might be back if a group of friends was going, but there are far better places closer to home that I can go and find dairy-free menu items so I won't be going out of my way.",2013-01-07 20:19:55

o1D0Vk_khUlKqArmr3O5Lw,FjmgJIvYxt5TTJSToiPn8g,lpel3pRFAzlow7u2TJMz4Q,4,2,0,0,"Calling this a ""wine bar"" is a bit of a misnomer.  Yes, there is an extensive wine list, as well as other cocktails and even a reasonable selection of unusual bottled beer.  However, this is more of a gourmet pizza and small plates restaurant than an actual ""wine bar"".  The ""bar""  itself is pretty small and not separated in any way from the rest of the restaurant, which is overall tiny, loud, crowded and um, kinda ugly (white butcher paper covering cheap tables).  I guess that's the ""humble"" part as my usual ""wine bar"" experience is something elegant, quiet and maybe a bit snobbish that would not be so popular in a down-to-earth place like Lakewood. 

As happy as I am to have a decent restaurant centrally located in this strip of businesses - which have that miracle of miracles for Lakewood, an ample free parking lot (gasp!) in the back -  I wonder why the proprietor did not seek to place his business in an actual vacant bar or restaurant, or at least in a space that could accommodate a LARGE bar and be quiet and spacious enough that you did not have to yell across a three-foot dinner table at your companion to be heard.  This is not the place I'd go to enjoy a quiet, restful glass of wine or a drink of any sort. It's more on the order of happy hour in Ohio City. 

I still give it four stars because once you get past the noise, the uncomfortable tables, and your internal image of a ""wine bar"" as something much more peaceful, the food and wine here are top notch.  If your idea of a pizza is something with an excellent thin crust and ingredients that don't taste like they're loaded with sugar or came out of a can, then check this place out.  You can watch them rolling out the pizza and see that the process here is more akin to trained chefs than to bored teens throwing some dough in an oven. There are also awesome charcuterie and cheese plates where you can sample all sorts of tasty hors d'oeuvres, spreads, nuts, meats and cheeses, and a selection of fancy desserts.  The wine and other drinks are just the icing on the top of this most excellent cake.  The wait staff are more professional than the norm for Lakewood, and they even have a selection of pizza, dessert and wine available for takeout.  

Only reason I knocked off a star is the logistics of the dining room. As I noted above, during busy times it gets loud, crowded, and uncomfortable, and to make matters more annoying they usually don't take reservations and when you show up, if they are running a wait list, they have some policy of refusing to give you any idea of how long a wait you're looking at.  They can't even seem to tell you if you're looking at, say, 15 minutes or an hour. I imagine this is to encourage you to go wait in the bar and spend money on their wine instead of going elsewhere, but when the restaurant is crowded the bar is not a real pleasant place to hang out (no room and very noisy).  I would suggest looking through the large front windows upon arrival to see how busy the place is, and if it looks packed, go somewhere else.  If you see empty tables, by all means go on in there and eat and drink.",2014-12-28 05:34:07

We ended up at Copper because my mom was in town and we wanted to be adventurous. She lives in a small rural town where ""chinese"" is the only real ethnic option. Her question, ""Do they have things without curry? I don't like the spice.""

So the Mr checked out the menu and found just the perfect thing for her: a dish with chicken in a tomatoey cream sauce. Let's just say that my mom was victorious. She ate it all. Unapologetically.

As for the Mr, he got something with lamb. I tried the sauce and was impressed.

I ordered something with spinach and fingerling potatoes. It was ""spicy,"" but my nose wasn't running 5 minutes in, so it wasn't THAT spicy. The flavors were just perfect.

We ordered the naan, and it's my favorite of all the Indian places I've tried. It's served with a few sauces - my favorite was the fruity one, followed by the herby green one. (Yes, I know, I could look up the names, but I can't even pronounce them!)

Notes:

Service was wonderful. We arrived on a Saturday night at 6:15 with a reservation, sat outside, and were treated tremendously, despite our lack of ordering alcohol. Our server was very kind, thoughtful, offered a recommendation when asked, and according to mom, smelled good. (Always a plus.)

I don't know why other people have complained about service, because ours was just so outstanding.

So, I made reservations for our pilgrimage to Bill's Bar & Burger expecting a blow your socks off burger experience.  Let me first say that the restaurant décor is inviting.  White tiled walls, red accents and dark wood accents, I was pleased with ambiance as well as the wait staff.  Friendly, without hovering, glasses refilled and plates cleared without asking.  Can't ask for much more than that.

Now on to the food.   Bill's Bar & Burger is supposed to be known for their amazing burgers and their use of a custom beef blend made especially for their restaurants.  I've heard people rhapsodize about their burgers and all three of us ordered the ""Bacon & Farmhouse Cheddar Burger"" with thick hickory bacon (nitrate-free), aged cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles served on a pretzel bun.    The burgers are supposed to be a Pat LaFrieda custom blend, fresh ground daily and hand-pressed into 6oz patties. (We'll talk about this later.)

We also ordered their regular fresh-cut fries and ""Iron City Fondue"" which included an Iron City beer reduction, local cheddar, whole grain mustard, soft pretzels and kielbasa.  
 
So, let me just say that I was disappointed and underwhelmed by the food.  The famous Pat LaFrieda blend didn't seem to be hand-pressed at all and the burger wasn't well seasoned.  I've had Pat LaFrieda meat before and the burger that I had at Bill's Bar & Burger just didn't taste like their meat.  The burger was just okay; Not bad, just not spectacular.  I don't know what to say...  Additionally, the fries were tasty, but the order that I received had bits and pieces of fries. (Like they were the tail-end of the fry basket.)  With regards to the ""Iron City Fondue"", the beer reduction was a nice touch, but the whole grain mustard was overwhelming and the kielbasa had a strange aftertaste. (I think that it tasted a little like the fluid used to keep the fondue warm.)  There was also NOTHING distinctive about the pretzel bites. (They tasted like the frozen pretzel bites that you get at the grocery store.)

Overall, the restaurant is attractive and the service was great.  The food was just okay, which is really the main attraction.  The carpet doesn't match the drapes in my opinion.  I would go back again, but my expectation level has been readjusted.",2015-07-21 15:51:39

We read reviews that stated they don't use much rice on the nigiri, and that turned out to be true, but the rolls were piled with rice then flattened and compressed by the sushi chef.  It looked thin but it was very dense.  That is a little trick to make it look thin when it is not.  We also noticed that they use the same top garnish on a lot of their sushi and it makes a lot of the food all taste the same. The sushi chefs had little or nothing to say and were generally unfriendly.  If you said anything to them, they pretty much ignored  us.  However, the friendliness of our waiter was much welcomed.

We had salmon belly, mackerel, towering poke, Stuffed Tomatos, seafood salad, screaming O, sashimi roll, sweet shrimp (only one piece per customer), something wrong roll, and a red dragon roll.  Dessert was green tea pannacota and a black sesame manger.(pan a cotta)

We are going to stick with our prime sushi spot at Bluefin Sushi.",2015-09-15 00:14:36

The chief appeal is its proximity to Vegas proper, probably about a twenty-minute drive west of the Strip on Charleston Blvd past a whole lot of suburban sprawl. It gives you a vivid albeit modest taste of the pleasures to be had in the canyon country that dominates this part of the state as well as northern Arizona and southern Utah.

I say ""modest taste"" because the formations are not all that dramatic compared to, say, the Valley of Fire about two hours away. However, the views can be striking, even from the pullouts off the thirteen-mile scenic road. There are only three or four stops that are genuinely worthwhile for further exploring, but frankly, that's enough since you have a hot pair of dice waiting for you back at the craps table. There is a $5 entrance fee, and it leads directly to the worthwhile visitors' center with the big lizard sculpture in the middle of the floor.

By the way, the drive actually doesn't cut through Red Rock Canyon. What you're really seeing are the Wilson Cliffs. You can get to the real canyon only by four-wheel drive. There's your trivia. Regardless, there are plenty of photographic opportunities (see mine among the hundreds in the gallery), and face it, you were down $800 at the tables and needed a respite to avoid the sharks anyway. There are a lot of hiding spots between them there rocks. I'm just speculating, of course.",2010-01-28 07:13:39

That said, no way it should take as long as it does to simply take an order on a new guest and get them a beer.

Unfortunately, this place falls way short.  On the plus side, service is quick and friendly and if you like Korean Pop music, you will get your fill for sure.  As mentioned in multiple reviews the rice to raw fish ratio is 3 to 1 fish to rice.  This also applies to the salmon roe and flying fish eggs sushi, very generous portions of eggs.  The honey toast dessert is unique from other AYCEs and pretty good. 

There were multiple times where they forgot my order and had to ask again to follow up.  I didn't think it would be so hard to get miso soup.  The same goes asking for a refill of iced and hot green tea.  At least they got it right after asking 2 times, they finally got the message.

Although the fish to rice ratio was generous, the fish itself was below average quality for AYCE (look at the pics, see the grizzle).  Their salmon ""kama"" is not kama (fish collar).  I have never encountered kama in such whole pieces, a lot of unsuspecting and inexperienced diners won't may not know the difference.  This was disappointing, especially since they didn't have any hamachi kama available.

Another theme, greasy, greasy, and more greasy.  You can smell it when you walk in and applied to anything fried.  Expect excessive saucing on their rolls.

My ""punishment"" to keep my wife happy is going to Sushi Kaya the next day and things were much better.  Going to sushi AYCEs two days in row isn't all that bad when visiting Vegas.",2017-02-26 21:03:34

First of all, this place is an amalgamation of different Asian cuisines (Thai, Vietnamese, Korean, etc.), which initially made me suspicious. The waitress was very nice and our food came out very promptly. Unfortunately, I was just very disappointed in the food.

Tried the pad thai as well as a pho dish here. Both were really disappointing. The pad thai flavor was extremely strong and tasted more tomato based than anything else. The pho was also extremely disappointing. It came with a tiny sauce bowl's worth of beansprouts, so I already knew it wasn't going to be authentic.

However, I did not like the food.  We started with the cheese platter.  It wasn't great.  One of the cheeses was creamy, but the other 2 or 3 I didn't like.  I especially didn't like the Parmesan--it was so dry and did not have a good taste to it.  For dinner I ordered the Tagliatta.  It was okay, but again-not great.  I liked my dates fresh sausage a bit more.  But again, not enough to ever want to come back.

Also, I absolutely hated my drink.  The waiter recommended the Camparita.  It looked good, but it tasted so bad.  My date thought it had too much grapefruit juice and was very bitter.  I thought it tasted more like tequila.  Either way, it was so bad that it sat full on my table the entire time.

Which brings me to say--I wish more waiters would notice that you aren't drinking your drink.  I always feel bad sending something back, especially since he recommended it.

The iced coffee was pretty generic, standard iced coffee.  The Gabi was definitely a dry cappuccino (espresso on the bottom, lots of foam on top).  I do enjoy dry cappuccinos but only when the espresso is good.  This espresso did taste bitter and burnt and I thought that the sugar on top (I usually don't add sugar to my coffee) was needed so maybe this was intentional for balance.

The pork burrito was excellent and the enchiladas were top notch also. I skipped the chips and salsa since they were an added few $ - Im glad I did because the rest of the meal was filling.

Unfortunately for me, Jean Marc isn't always around when my pastry cravings strike (how dare he close his shop on Sundays!), and I need to fill that void. 

La Gourmandine definitely holds its own when it comes to the French pastry game. I've been here several times now and have always been fairly happy with my selections. I've never tried their desserts, but as far as breakfast pastries go, theirs are solid. The croissants are quite delicious -- buttery, flaky, and chewy like a good croissant should be. Occasionally I find that they are *slightly* more crispy and overdone on the top than I'd prefer, but it's not a huge deal. Their La Gourmandise breakfast pastry is probably my favorite...puff pastry filled with a not-very-sweet vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips. So flaky and tons of flavor in each bite...it's divine.

And is it just me or am I the only one who hasn't seen the white squirrel?!

pros: close to my house. fantastic staff. reasonable prices. 20% off on tuesdays! smells ridiculously awesome. and the desserts look amazing!

Tangra is a go-to restaurant for flavourful, spicy, comfort foods. They primarily focus on chicken, beef, fish, and shrimp but also offer a variety of noodle, rice, and vegetarian dishes. Most of the dishes are wet and saucy ie. their chili dishes, mango dishes, sweet and spicy, sweet and sour dishes are heavily marinated with sauces and stir-fried onions. If you are looking for something dry however, I highly recommend the Tangra-Villa Meat dishes. 

To say Tangra is flavourful is an understatement. With every bite I can taste the garlic, the spices, the onions, and the parsley used in the seasoning. This is definitely an upgrade from the typical garlic and soy sauce dressing in other local Chinese restaurants.

The lady manning the phone was polite, the portion sizes were fair, and the overall takeout experience was pretty great. For around $22 tax included, my family of four was stuffed with enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Good deal.

However, do call ahead of time because it takes them 20-30 minutes usually to cook 2-3 take-out dishes, and you will have to wait in the car since the store itself is quite compact.",2016-07-07 15:28:55

One Saturday afternoon we decided to make the trip and I was excited to see all the crazy weapons! Action Movies are one of my favorite choices when catching a film, The Matrix, the Crow, Underworld! I have my Selene costume ready for Halloween already! I thought that the gun show would be filled with gruff super villain types. Whoa was I wrong!

Booths and tables were set up throughout the giant space so to see everything that was offered you would zig zag back and forth. A lot of the tables displayed the usual loads of knives, tazers, and mace. Display cases are stocked with ammunition and all sizes of handguns, rifles, and antique weaponry

I don't know why but I love weapons. The first time I ever went to a shooting range I felt a huge wave of relief. I had been terrified of hand guns for the longest time. (A trait instilled by my father as a child to keep me away from firearms.) I realized that the weapon in my hand capable of ending life was also simply a machine or a tool, nothing more. Training to use it made me feel like I was in control rather than helpless. Moral of the story I actually like going to a shooting range to shoot. It feels pretty bad ass I must say. 

The pearl handled 22  I spotted was so cute! I had images of hiding it in a boot or garter belt strolling around a dangerous menace to be reckoned with, but then I thought where would I ever wear that? Will this be my new signature accessory? Obviously not, but in my fictional life Hell YES! 

It was quite amazing to see the amount of weapons that are legal to own, machine guns, army gear, a bazooka! Why would anyone have those at home? It was a learning experience to see what was out there and a little scary. 

While I was picking out a Tazer these guys were messing around with them pointing at each other. It did make me step back from the table and I could tell the vendor was fuming! I ended up with a pink tazer (I wanted black) and a secret knife necklace. My boyfriend at the time convinced me to get pink because black would get lost in my purse. What I really wanted was a switch blade, those were pretty sinister looking! Illegal to carry though. A new experience at the gun show for sure! Now if someone ever messes with me I'll be standing over them with my pink tazer laughing! You just got zapped by the pink lady!",2011-04-30 14:11:31

From the moment I made a reservation till the check came the service was excellent. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was my entree was a little bland I was hoping for a little more - but you know I didn't listen to the waitresses suggestions so maybe that was my bad. 

The menu is filled with fresh fish, and steak options. I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers the calamari was some of the best I've ever had prepared Asian style with peanut sauce and wasabi I could have devoured the whole dish myself...next was the smoked salmon carpaccio I have been thinking about this dish ever since I left. Next time I just might eat the carpaccio as my meal. 

My dad and sister had the lamb and they raved about it and my little sister ordered the Mahi Mahi there was nothing left on her plate and they do serve you a decent size plate here folks.

The entrance to the restaurant is somewhat odd as it is right next to the nightclub entrance - with hoards of people lined up waiting to party, it doesn't feel very welcoming as a restaurant. When we made it inside, the hostesses were really nice. We had arrived early so we had a few drinks at the bar while we waited.

The bar is arranged pretty terribly. It is a tiny bar against the back wall probably big enough for about 10 crowded stools. Considering the number of people who probably have a drink while waiting to eat, they should have made it more spacious. The drinks, on the other hand, were a standout. We tried quite a few of the specialty cocktails and all were absolutely delicious!! (Be prepared that they are quite pricey.)

The layout of the restaurant itself is also odd. It felt like being inside of a bento box! Sets of a few tables were cordoned off with high walls so that you felt like you were walking through a maze to get to your table. I'm sure they did it to give it an intimate feel, but it took away from the high-energy club feel which I actually went there hoping for.

The food was pretty good - I give it a solid three stars. Had I not known the chef who started it had a Michelin star at his other place, I would have been pleasantly surprised by how good it was and probably given four stars. However, I went in hoping for food that was more innovative and special. Still, everything was tasty and we were really happy! We sampled 9 items from the menu (plus dessert), and the crispy duck salad appetizer was my absolute favorite.

I went during lunchtime on Saturday.  It took me awhile to decide what I wanted.  $6 for a plain ol' sandwich?  Yikes.  I could get a sub from Harris Teeter for half that.  I opted for the under $4 spinach, egg, and cheese breakfast bagel.  The guy behind the counter seemed like he was stoned; it took him awhile to assemble the simple sandwich.  Once I was on my way, I stopped by the unkempt beverage station to fill up my cup.  It needed restocking and a wipe-up in a major way.  

Then I went to sit down...and had a flashback.  This was exactly what I remember from last time, and why I hadn't come back.  There was no line at the counter, the dining room had less than a handful of tables occupied, and yet as I looked around, every table was dirty.  Crumbs, spills, and general dishevel.

Just you won't find better prices for broccoli, tomatoes, peppers, onions, cilantro etc. anywhere else.  

     Last week I bought a bucket of orange peppers for $2.  I got about 7 good peppers out of that.  $2 for two pounds of cherry tomatoes?  Yea they have it here and they weren't moldy!  They were really good tomatoes.  There are a lot more fresh products here that you have to check out for yourself!

     Most of the fruits and vegetables are outside but don't forget about the inside too.  I usually buy candy or some supplies for work in there.  They are mostly expired food, candy, or products but they are cheap and are usually just what I need. 

     If you come here in the winter and colder months they still have good fresh products here but you might be better off going to Aldi's.

It's not very often I get hankerings for the food at one restaurant which can't be satisfied anywhere else on Earth (I used to get that with Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles, until they realized that most middle-class white people have no palates, and the quality started slipping).

If you bothered to read the above parenthetical remark, you'll note that I am not even a vegan. I'd *like* to be a vegan, because large scale farming processes are usually inhumane, but it's just hard to find the wide variety of culinary experience I enjoy when completely excluding animal products from my diet. That's why Desert Roots is so great: their food just tastes great. It's unique. And you're not going to get the same meal twice. Even if I didn't *want* to be vegan, I'd still eat here as often as I can.

The way the place works is as follows:
1) You walk in the door, and look at the items available for the day.
2) You go with the wrap-of-the-day, because it's going to be awesome, unless you're that person who inexplicably hated the wrap, yet her only other review was glowing praise of the super-shitty Green.
3) You nearly go mad because you're too indecisive to pick which other two items you want out of the four or five sides that look totally delicious. And you want the hummous too! Aargh!
4) You enjoy the hell out of your meal.

That's really all there is to it. This is just well-seasoned, fresh, home-grown food that's not gimmicky, not oversauced, and not something you'll easily find in any other restaurant.",2015-10-10 03:00:39

Easily spilt among 2. Their homemade mozzarella is delicious; my favorite way to savor it is on a sandwich with roasted peppers basil and sundried tomato. Clean fresh taste party in my mouth. The antipasto platter is a great addition to your favorite pie. Dad enjoys fresh smoked mozzarella and I buy it as a treat for him, since while I'll pull fresh mozzarella a couple times a year during holidays, smoked is outside my realm of expertise. 

My family and friends enjoy the regular pie well done and a variety of sandwich specials and dinner items. Stand outs have been chicken Marsala, pasta dishes and many others we've tried in 9 years patronage. We've made a small army of fans out of friends and by word of mouth. 

Some of the items others have referred to as decorative and unnecessary have been great finds for a transplanted NY girl: Ronzoni Pastina to make chicken soup with egg and escarole like Nona made. Cavatelli in the frozen section is my go to pasta for when I make Vongole con cavatelli bianco (white.clam sauce that allows the bivalves to sneak into tubular pasta = mangia) the homemade sausage is a hit with the fam as well. It is by no means a fancy dining room, the star here is the food. 

On several occasions I've ordered custom to go platters for office parties or to show clients what real Italian tastes like from the standpoint of a second generation L'American. They fill cannoli to order and carry a variety of cookies, gelato in pre packed pints and fresh zeppoles (fried pizza dough, in a paper bag with confectioner's sugar) During the holidays, be sure to order cannoli and cookie platters early; they even make honey balls (strufoli)

The Italian ices, sauces to go and NY Daily News to read only add to the authentic vibe. For all of the people who complain about waiting: call ahead. Quality takes time. And quality is what Rocco's through owner changes and many years, has delivered without fail over the years.

Maybe I just have lower expectations than some. The only other donut shop I've ever really loved for great donuts is near a beach in Orange County.

Everything perfect! I didn't take a picture of my food because I was starving and picked the fork up immediately upon receiving it. 

Between the four of us we ordered a kids cheeseburger with fries, a grilled salmon Cesar Salad, the farmhouse chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese garlic fries (bomb.com). The pepper jack cheese is extremely spicy because it has ghost peppers in it. The lady behind the register warned us so that was fine. Lastly, I ordered the grilled salmon plate with grilled asparagus, beet salad and cauliflower. Everything was excellent. We dined in silence .... you know what that means 

The set up is .... you walk up to the counter, order your meals, get a buzzer and a drink cup if you order it and grab a seat. They'll bring your food out to you. The restrooms are outside.

The first thing the employee does is tell me they have free guacamole and that they are better than Chipotle because they charge. Really, the first thing you do is bash Chipotle Mexican Grill? Which is not only a far more superior restaurant in every way, but also kills your guys quarterly and yearly sales. 

Next I had to wait for them to restock the white rice. Which was 1/2 scoop of old rice, and half of the new batch. The second thing I noticed was the rap music playing from the back. It COMPLETELY overpowered the Mexican music playing in the dining area. Who wants to listen to rap when they are eating Mexican food? I know I don't eśe. 

After getting the rest of my condiments and chicken out on, the female manager was arguing with an earlier customer about the sizes of some weird bowl or something. I don't even frickin' know. I was standing there with my food getting cold until I said, ""Excuse me, can I pay for my food it is getting cold!?"". Her and the customer apologized and each took a step back. Before my receipt even popped out they were bickering again and I had to point and remind her to give me the receipt! That process took awhile. 

By the time I sat down my burrito was completely cold. Some slight warmth coming from the rice, but overall there stoves must of been WAY to low. 

Thank god is was great weather out or I would of been stuck inside eating a burrito listening to rap like a cholo. 

Would not go back, at least to this location. Will stick to Chipotle from now on.

Atmosphere - Small, but comfortable. Great music. Walk up to order.

Service - You order your food first and are helped by the line. Everyone was friendly.

Food - The star. You order your meat/chicken and then how you want it. On the line you can customize your tacos or burrito or bowl. The key is the tortillas, and the corn and flour tortillas they use are great. Street tacos - Mixed the meats and all were great. You get to customize your tacos. Chorizo Breakfast Burrito - They use a fried egg and the chorizo is diced. Not too spicy but lots of flavor. A visit to the salsa bar offers a lot of options, some with some good heat. Lot's of beer options in the bottle or draft, and the draft is at least 22oz.

Reservations - Highly recommended.  Place was extremely busy when we arrived at 8:30 and even after we finished dinner.
Parking - Structure, street or valet nearby.
Service - Good and friendly
Decor/Ambiance -  Cowboyish (not a word but you get my drift), dark, wood.
Price - Not extravagant, but pricey.  Worth it since you probably won't try fusions like this anywhere.
Food - Don't eat here if you are picky.  The fusions/flavors are very unique. 
1. Mini Mushroom Pan Fry- Good amount for 3 to 4 people as an appetizer.  Quite rich.  I wouldn't call it exceptional like other Yelpers but definitely good to at least try once.  Huge variety of mushrooms (although it seemed like mainly button mushrooms or something very similar) sauteed in a rich tomato cream sauce over grilled polenta triangles.  

2. Stetson Chopped -  I yelped this place before trying.  However, I could not find a real description of what this salad was.  Now I know why.  It's sooooo unique and the texture is unlike anything you've tried.  It's one of those dishes, you have to try to truly understand.  Most people would describe it as ""very different but good.""  Even the menu doesn't describe the ingredients.  Server brings it out with the ingredients perfectly lined. a) Bruschetta tomato compote minus the bread of course, b)  Dried kernels of corn, c) Pumpkin seed trail mix, d) Chopped spinach I think, e) Couscous, and f) Cured wild salmon, similar to lox.  Then the server mixes it with a mild dressing that is similar to ranch.  The end result, a wildly unique texture of crunchy flavors with the occassional taste of cured fish.  You have to try it to know what I'm talking about it.

3. Stuffed Pork Rib Chop - Disappointing.  It sounded sooooooooo good on paper and via other Yelpers.  The pork chop was slightly dry although my friend and I ordered ours medium.  The blue cheese stuffing was really overpowering.  The ancho bread pudding was weird tasting and a bit too mushy.  The raisin/fig compote was a bit sweet and a good contrast at first to the strong blue cheese, but then tasted really weird after a while.  The flavors didn't mesh well to me.   I felt that every flavor was too drastically strong and were all competing against each other.

4. Espresso-Rubbed Filet Mignon - Highly recommended.   You couldn't taste the espresso but it provided a rich earthy taste to the meat.  The meat was nicely salted and very tender.  No one cared for the bright yellow chipotle aioli which was just creamy but had added no other taste to the meat.  The glaze was good as were the potatoes. 

5. Bacon/Chocolate Chip Cookies - Everyone was stuffed so I didn't order the blue cheese cheesecake with black pepper ice cream. I really wanted to try it!  However, the cookie was good.  We were a bit timid, but all agreed that it was better than it sounded.  A bit of salty and sweet.  The bacon is cooked first and then added to the cookie dough along with bacon grease.  Therefore, you could taste the bacon note but then you are left with a chocolate finish.  Quite delicious.

I would definitely come back here though, if only for the Stetson salad.  The fushion of ingredients are truly unique and I have to give the chef two thumbs up for trying to blend flavors that you don't ordinarily pair together.",2009-03-30 21:38:03

I've never found the coffee to be anything spectacular, but it is kept hot and full, which is nice.

The staff are consistently friendly and service is good. Although it slows down a little as the place fills up, there are usually plenty of servers available to handle the crowd and they turn over tables pretty fast at breakfast time. During lunch, it seems that people tend to linger a bit longer, so the wait is likely to reflect that.

I decided to try the Flamingo again because we were traveling with friends with children, and felt that they would all enjoy the pool.  I should have picked another hotel.

When we arrived at the hotel at noon, we were all eager to hit the pool.  The front desk informed me that if I wanted to check in before 4pm, it was an additional fee of $30!!!  I asked if my room was ready and they said yes, but unless you pay the additional fee you cannot check-in until 4pm.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I have only heard of this at one other hotel.  I could not believe after paying the nightly rate, and $30 per night resort fee, they wanted another $30, so that I could enjoy their resort and start having fun on my vacation.  If you want a late check out it's another $20 per hour additional fee.

The Flamingo is located in the center of the strip, walking distance to many strip attractions and show.  It's across the street from Caesar's Palace.  Parking is free.

The Flamingo has restaurants, shops, a very nice pool, a gym.  There is no business center but they have several pay to use computer kiosk throughout the hotel.

The fitness center is at the spa and is open from 6am to 7pm.  There are 3 different pools, the main pool is adults only.  They have the beach club pool for families, which is just a standard pool, and they have a water slide pool.  The pools are open from 9AM -7PM (in the summer) except for the slide pool, which is only open from 11am -5pm.  One of the negatives is that they allow smoking at the family/kids pool, second-hand smoke is the last thing I want my kids inhaling when they are trying to have fun at the pool.  Make sure you bring your ID when you go to the pool, not sure why, I asked 4 different security personnel and lifeguards, none of them knew why they have to check for ID.  They don't ask for a room key to confirm you are a guest at the hotel, just ID?!?!  You cannot bring any food or drinks into the pool area, even items that you bought in the hotel or hotel restaurants.  They will not let you in, you have to purchase everything from the bar/snackshop inside the pool area.  The drinks and food are very expensive and not worth the money.

Our newer ""GO"" room was small to average in size.  It had a sort of retro 60's decor, with marble counter tops.  It was clean, but maintenance could have been better.  The walls needed painting and the mini-frig was dented. It had a spacious closet iron/board, medium size flat screen television with cable channels and PPV for $13.  It also had a stereo system, coffee maker, mini-frig, desk and chair, and a room safe. The resort fee included WIFI for one device, and the signal strength was good.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.

The bathroom was medium sized, with a walk-in shower with multiple shower heads, a separate tub, a marble sink, and a television in the bathroom mirror.  The bathroom was clean and also included a blow dryer.

Overall this hotel is not bad.  Before a negative customer service experience in 2012, I had stayed at the Flamingo for 20 years.  Ever since the Harrah's and now Caesar's Properties have taken over they have gone down hill. The very annoying part is that you never feel like a valued customer, but rather just another person who the corporations want to continually up-charge for basic items that are free at other hotels.  I would have given it 3 stars, but because of all the hidden fees it's going to be 2 stars.

The constant additional charges and poor management will ensure that I never stay at this hotel or any other Caesar Properties again.  I would advise my family and friends to not stay here also.",2015-08-12 05:36:24

We were in the area and wanted something quick and tasty so I remembered Simon's and we drove over here. It's a cozy restaurant and I immediately noticed how chill it was. 

There were only two people ordering ahead of us which gave us some time to peruse their menu. Though small, there is variety and vegan dogs, the sole reason I wanted to come here. The folks at the counter were super welcoming and friendly and even called us by name, which I felt was superb customer service. I ordered the traditional Colombian and added jalapeños for a kick. I had a choice of the California vegan dog or a tofurkey vegan dog and I chose the former. I made it into a combo for $3 more and got fries and a drink.

We forgot to tell them our order was to go, but they were great about changing how they packaged our orders so that we could take them with us. Once we got back to our destination and dived into our dogs, we all agreed that they were delicious and the fries were good as well.

Sometime last year, I drove to this location and backed into a parking spot. There are plenty of parking spaces. It wasn't a stressful evening. However, an impatient woman was not thrilled that I spent an extra two seconds to back into a spot. I am a decent backer-upper when it comes to parking. She honked at me. She managed to swing into a parking spot rapidly after I got out of her way and run into the store. Talk about dashing for craft supplies.

Last week, I visited this store. I got out of my car and closed the door. In doing so, my work photo ID card attached to my pant pocket pulley (say that fast!) got caught. I had to unlock my car and open the door. Meanwhile, I was taking up some seconds for the gentleman parked next to me to get into his car.

He did see me get my work badge untangled. I apologized. He smiled and said that it was all good. That made my day for being a klutz.

I was there to check out patches. I was wearing a pair of corduroy pants that I love. I managed to tear the area just above my left knee. I did some investigation on how to salvage my pair of pants and browsed around the store.

I have often come here for sewing and calligraphy supplies, fabric dye, as well as stickers for when I went on a cruise and had to decorate my cabin door for a contest. Ah, good memories.

I like this store. I am hoping that friendlier shoppers continue coming here.

For lunch.

Yes, Jerry's is known for its prime rib, but it's equally famous for its desserts. I'm not a prime rib person, so I skipped the big slab of meat. And I'm usually not a dessert person, but I decided to splurge today. I had a piece of chocolate cream pie, which wasn't that tasty, to tell the truth. My boss fared better with his strawberry shortcake, and he also grabbed our co-workers two pieces of cheesecake, which were well received. 

Although I wasn't a big fan of my pie, I was a huge fan of my entree. I got the keftedes (Greek meatballs), which were perfectly seasoned and served with a side of Greek spaghetti, feta cheese, olives/cukes/tomatoes, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce. A ton of food for a reasonable price. My boss had some sort of chicken sandwich that he was pleased with, too.

Jerry's Nugget is close to my workplace, so it's surprising that I don't go there more often. (In fact, this was the first time I'd been there in years.) But the keftedes were so tasty that I see myself returning again soon. And maybe next time I'll have better luck with my dessert choice. (Blueberry pie, anyone?)",2015-01-23 02:08:39

You take it back to your table and then you activate BEAST MODE on your food.

We ordered Biscuits and Gravy, Brisket Hash and a coffee. Weirdly, the Brisket Hash was not on my menu. Another table also got a menu with the item missing as well. Why not throw out old menus?

The coffee came out in a French Press, definitely a unique experience in a restaurant. If you're in a group of 4 and each just want a cup, definitely go for this option. For a table of two, we'd have preferred just a cup each. My Biscuits and Gravy was delicious, so buttery and creamy and sausagey! It would have been perfect if it had come out warmer. I had a piece of my fiance's brisket and hash browns and it was so good, the brisket was so flavourful and tender.

Doesn't affect the rating: As for the servers, I couldn't tell if they were good or bad. There was something off putting about the way they spoke to patrons, but they did their jobs well. It's probably just me.

I am glad BeeGee opened up in my neighborhood because mainly I was tired of the lack of healthy affordable options around the Spring Valley area. 

What I enjoy most about the yakitori (skewers) at BeeGee is that the meat is actually decent quality and lots of TLC was put into making each skewer. They're closed on Monday, but must be because they're preparing for the week. I know because I tried to go on a Monday, but the door was locked and they were busy prepping. The great variety of different skewers such as chicken breast, gizzard, heart, squid, scallop, and beef for example combined with the smokey flavor from their unique (charcoal!) grill that is supposedly hand crafted from Japan makes BeeGee a winner. 

Best deal has to be the 6 pick your own sampler. Reason is that you can have anything! Some skewers like the scallops cost $2 something already. Plus you get a discount on their many drinks. The adjusted price is $2.25 from $2.85 I believe. The drinks now come in the trendy JUMBO cups that don't really fit in your cup holder lol. My favorite would have to be the honey green tea citrus and the mango yoyo. Yoyo drinks are yogurt based, kind of taste like Yakult (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakult). Don't worry my non-meat eating friends they also have veggie options for your tasting.

Aside from the yakitori, they also offer udon, sukiyaki, sizzling plates, and... dun dun dun.. teriyaki bowls. Their teriyaki bowl comes in a good meat to vegetable to rice ratio that would make an excellent substitute for that weak salad you could eat at Quizno's. Lastly, its quality over quantity over here, so if you're a big eater that is starving, I wouldn't suggest it if you're on a budget.  


Note: Wait time is longer than most traditional restaurants, mostly because it takes lots of love to make the skewers nicely cooked :). So if its for lunch that you're picking up.. call ahead!",2011-06-09 17:56:16

Both were HUGE! Like seriously filled with yummy ingredients. The grilled one was really juicy but I think the tempura one was better. Was just under $5 for the two tacos and if you want the combo (2 sides and 2 tacos) it is $6.99 I was not too hungry tho so I just got the tacos. Will likely be back on a Tuesday for $1.50 tacos,2014-03-02 02:00:49

When I lived in the South Side, I used to walk by this restaurant almost every day and sniff, ""Hmph. Hipster bar. Who names their place 'Dish'?""  It reminded me of an episode of Family Guy where Brian, Stewie and Frank Sinatra, Jr. opened a pretentious nightclub called ""Place"". In retrospect, I was being kind of jerk about Dish.

Thankfully, Dish offers fantastic food and service. When we arrived, we were about ten minutes early for our Friday night reservation, so we ordered beers at the bar. Oh, I should mention that one of the only reasons (besides a positive word of mouth) that Boy wanted to try this place was because they carry a wine whose label name is also Boy's surname. Holy potatoes! Of course we ordered a bottle of that red wine, which was very dry, and had a pleasant, mellow tannin. It's a good wine so if you want to know what it is send a self-abused stamped antelope (or DM) to me. 

I chose the mushroom soup (with crimini, portabello and black truffle oil) to start. I have to say... AMAZING. Hands down the best mushroom soup I've ever had. Boy? Hates mushrooms. One of the many people in my life who hates them, in fact. What is with you people? Penicillin is from a fungus too, you know.  I bet that won't stop you from taking it when you need it to save your life. Haters. 

For the main course, I had the stuffed veal and my date chose the steak. The veal was outstanding, tender, and I ate every last bite. My entree was accompanied by pillows of ricotta gnocchi and julienned brussels sprouts. Very tasty and surprisingly light for gnocchi. The brussels sprouts would convert any veggie hater into lover in two seconds flat. Boy (and I) were less than enthused about the steak. It was simply ""ok."" 

Dish's servers are friendly and knowledgable. I feel bad that I ever made fun of this cozy establishment with great food.

The water station was mission from the cafe.  Not sure if this was just bad timing or a permanent change.

The bigger disappointment was the reconfiguration of the play area.  This museum used to be one of my go-to suggestions for places to take babies and toddlers because you could keep them quiet in a stroller/carrier long enough to see one or two galleries, then let them play with all the educational toys.  And it was the perfect place for crawling babies with the low, wide platform steps in the play area.  My kids absolutely loved it.  Well, they took all of that fun stuff out, and put in a bunch of new virtual reality-type fun stuff instead.  So it looks awesome for adults, and probably much better-suited to the elementary and middle school age crowd.  But all they have left for the youngsters are a few books.

Except instead of a small humble eatery full of Spanish locals, 
you have a lavish and swank eatery full of King West suits sharing small plates.

Patria is under the same ownership as Weslodge and similar to Weslodge, this place is jam packed with beautiful people and crazy busy.

I called at 6:00pm realizing that I forgot to make a reservation.
They told me that the earliest reservation was at 9:30 pm.
So, I showed up and I asked if they could accommodate us.
They said that I could have a table for exactly two hours.  
That worked for me.  

The server was attentive and quick with the drink recommendations.
The Amor Joven ($13) is a tanqueray gin cocktail with black currant cassis. 
It was a fantastic choice! 

They also have JUGS of sangria (red or white) for $30 bucks!

As for the food menu, there were so many items to choose from!  
My friend couldn't eat dairy or seafood, but there still lots of options.

The dates wrapped in bacon was one of my favourite dishes.
Simple, salty, sweet, and moist.

The fried potato bits topped with a fried egg ($9) is surprisingly popular, and even though it reminded me a bit of breakfast, it was flavourful and filling.

One of the veggie plates we ordered was the blistered peppers and sea salt.  They got increasingly hot as you ate them.  I stopped when I lost feeling in my mouth.

I ordered the grilled octopus.  Since my friend couldn't eat seafood, this dish was all mine!  It was a large portion and I didn't have any issues scarfing it down.  Perfectly cooked and chewy, one of the highlights of dinner.

As for dessert, we shared the churros.
Honestly, I didn't love the churros.
A bit average and I would have preferred a nicer presentation rather than churros plopped on a plate of dulce de leche sauce.

As we were finishing dessert, we were given the warning glance as we approached the two our seating limit.  I looked up at the restaurant manager and he looked at me.  We exchanged glances, not sexy-face glances, but okay-our-time-together-is-up-time-to-pay-now.

I ordered the smoked salmon pizza. The pizza crust was perfect and the portion was decent. I would not have ordered it though had I known that they used pesto as the sauce; I think it is too strong of a flavour and takes away from the salmon. But this is a personal preference. My friend had the chicken supreme and enjoyed it. I sampled one of the potatoes and a bite of the chicken - nothing mindblowing, but good. Our server was fun and added to the experience.

So I dropped in to check out this new pizza joint at Aria called Five50 with a friend after work. It is the second restaurant opened by Chef Shawn McClain (Sage) at Aria, so the expectation of excellent food was high.

The Five50 name seems strange, but according to them is the ideal temperature for cooking your pizza in the oven (so is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?). And until just last week, 5:50pm was the start of their Happy Hour and the promotion was 50 cents beer.  Now HH is from 5PM to 5:50pm (is it still considered a happy HOUR if it only lasts 50 minutes).  $5.50 might also be the starting price of their pizza by the slice (don't hold to it in case I am mistaken, but it would fit the pattern of this gimmicky name). 

The restaurant is beautifully designed.  It looks great from the outside, although the ""VIP"" area near the back and by that ""wall"" is just too cramp to be fully functional.

Service was friendly and efficient. Since the restaurant is still new, it also appears that they have way more staff on duty than are needed.  Will be interesting to see if the staffing level will remain at current level in 2-3 months.  

After looking over the menu, which is mostly a beverage menu (the entire outside cover of the menu is the wine, beer, etc menu), while the inside menu consist of Snacks (5 items), Small Plates (your upscale appetizers), Salads, Pastas, Meat & Cheese, and the 8 pizza selections or you can customize your own.

Tried the Forager Pizza (Mushrooms, Spinach, Rosemary, Whipped Ricotta) and it was good. The pizza crust was the star, while the toppings were quality it was also  not exactly generous.  If I was hungry and didn't have a late lunch, I can totally finish this 16"" pizza myself and not break a AYCE sushi coma sweat.  So it was not even a challenge to split it with another person.

If I come back I will want to try their Gotham and Truffle pizzas.  Their Small  Plates and Pasta items sound interesting too, which may actually be the more exciting offerings from Chef Shawn McClain's new pizza joint/craft beer sports bar.

Food:  3.5/5  Quality ingredients used on tasty flat bread pizza, part of the overall tasty crunchy crust was sadly burnt.

Creativity:  2.5/5  Nothing that I have not already seen done somewhere else.  Considering the talent of a chef that bested an American Iron Chef, I know this place has way more to offer in this department. 

Price/Value:  3/5  Casino pricing for the convenience of not having to walk or take a cab somewhere else.  If you want better value for your dining dollars, get a panini sandwich from Jean Philippe Patisserie (in Aria and Bellagio).

Service: 3/5  Never had bad experience from any of the wait staff at Aria, but waitstaff could be better trained on what is offered on the menu.  Are breadsticks complimentary? If so, we didn't get any while we waited for the pizza.

Decor:  3.5/5  Hip, upscale decor with dim lighting that fits the overall darker color scheme of Aria (not my style preference, but I just like the brighter more energetic look of other interior decorator's executed vision more).

A-OK and perfect for guests in Aria and CityCenter complex.

But that's beside the point. These guys were happy enough to receive my money, but once I wanted it back ( I brought the scale back after less than a day, all of the packaging provided, no fuss, no drama) they decide that they want to play games with me and start arguing that I actually DO want this scale and shouldn't return it.

* If you are hungry and are low on funds, this is a good choice.
* Peach Ice Tea... Oh yeah!
* Alcohol available
* Even cheaper if you sign up for the Rewards Card

Cons:
*  Located inside AZ Charlies where the parking sucks
*  Everyone walks out smelling like smoke
*  Service here is bad bad bad!
* I ordered the Banana Creme Pie to go because they took so long to return to the table.  When I got home, I realized I was duped and given a Key Lime Pie instead.  How do you mess that up ?  How'd it taste?  Not a clue... I'm not a fan of Key Lime and left it in the fridge for a curious soul to discover.

Green Beans -  Gotta have some veggies.  I wish I got broccoli though.
Banana Creme Pie - MIA
All this for under $10.00 w/ the rewards card!

Verdict:
  Okay, I was close extremely close to giving this place a 2 stars because the service was extremely slow ( and that's an understatement), but I after much contemplation, this is a place where you go when you want cheap eats.

Hobak Family Combo ($51.99 for Small, $84.99 for Large) - Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak, Hobak Aged Short Ribs, Angus Boneless Short Ribs, Grilled Spicy Pork Belly, Bean Paste Stew, Steamed Egg, Vegetables, Cheddar Cheese, and Rice Pop Ice Cream

We had also ordered a Peach Soju to drink for fun :) It tasted pretty good. One of the better flavored soju's i've had so far (including the red and blue ive had in Seoul in April, 2016). I still Q_Q at the price difference though... Lol 

We were notified before things were coming out that they had ran out of the Angus Boneless Short Ribs which now i realized was a little contradictory because they gave me the option of Aged Short Rib not being available and able to get the boneless short rib or rib eye at an additional cost of $4 or brisket or angus short rib. But i still ordered the angus boneless short rib. Now im confused at the time of writing this review ?!?? LOL 

WELL no matter. English barrier i guess. 

I had been told by a coworker that the bean paste stew and steamed egg were unlimited refillable but being 2 people, we were quite stuffed and satisfied with just our order. 

All the meats were amazing. The marinated skirt steak was amazingly flavored. Nice and light. Not too sweet or savory like most american KBBQ places. Reminded me of Seoul, Korea. 

According to my friend, the grilled spicy pork belly was a bit spicy for her to handle. Yet she was able to eat the green onion salad. So those who don't eat much spiciness, be aware. 

Short ribs both beef and pork were amazingly tender and well cooked.

All of us had a range of experiences and overall, even with inconsistencies, we were very well taken care of. The manager made sure that anything that was wrong was corrected. My stepdad's steak was almost raw and he asked for medium. My moms asparagus was cold. My aunts hamburger had way too much pepper.

I'm a huge fan of the lunch specials.  A few of us from work come here like clockwork (yes, I'm betting you COULD set your watch based on our arrival) on Fridays.  Monday through Friday, they have 4 daily specials.  Sandwich and fries, or a salad for $5.  FIVE BUCKS.  Our pathetic little group consistently gets the french dip on Fridays.  Yes... all four of us.  

And, can I say it??  I would not typically order a salad from a dive bar.  I'd picture crappy veggies, and probably icky iceberg lettuce.  My girlfriend ordered a salad, and I was looking at it with lots of interest.  So much so that she started moving her plate closer to her side of the table.  :)  

The waitstaff is interesting.  The one regular girl is quick, and understands that we are on lunch, and hustles our stuff to us, and gets refills and checks out quickly.  Luckily, we usually get her. She's a cutie.  The OTHER girl... well... ummm...  yeah.  This past summer... she wore very VERY short jean skirts.  So short in fact, that when she came out onto the patio, walking towards our table, we could CLEARLY see her hot pink panties (god, I DETEST that word) flashing at us from under the skirt.  My buddy that was sitting eye level to her crotch as she came sashaying up to the table is still excited.  So, there ya go.  

If you go on a Friday, you'll see us there around 12:15.  We are a loud and happy bunch.  Say hi!  :)",2014-12-22 16:44:14

Service was attentive, waitresses were always coming around to check in and refill water. Ordered a large sashimi boat ($60) to share as a group of 3. I thought the price was reasonable given that the sashimi slices were decent in size and fresh.  

We also ordered a seafood pancake appetizer. I would pass on this, as it was mainly an omelette with random pieces of seafood. Also ordered a beef bibimbap, it was good and filling, but otherwise pretty generic.

Ambiance = Needs improvement.
Service = Very friendly, but slow and disorganized. 

Tavern Americana has a nice space, but it needs to be utilized much better.   There's a nice open wine room that is pleasing to the eye, but other than that and a couple of TV's, there's nothing to look at.  The walls are grey and plain.  A few photos or paintings would do a lot for the atmosphere. The acoustics are also awful.  It is loud in there.  The restaurant was packed, and hostess was trying to tell us that we could wait in a small ""lounge"" area, and order a drink, but I could only catch every couple words she said.  I know I'm getting older, but at 33 I shouldn't be freaking out that my hearing is starting to go.

Service was slow, and it was obivious the servers and runners were a little over whelmed.  We didn't have any major problems, but a couple of the tables around us were brought either the wrong food, or the runner couldn't tell which person ordered something sans a topping, etc.

The food is great.  It's a tad pricier than it feels like it should be, but the ingredients are all fresh, which makes the price very forgivable.  We had the roasted chicken pizza and a tavern burger.  The pizza was good, but a touch oily.  The burger was also good, but it felt like it could have used something to make it special.  The fries are awesome and served with a house spicy ketchup.

The good news for Tavern Americana is that the flaws of the place are all fixable.  Put some art on the walls, figure out a way to quiet down the background noise, and get a better system for running food.  Definitely would go back.",2013-02-06 01:21:38

l4uJsLDJj05gbA7UE-CEJg,vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,bw_bCNXNBrgarlmrgURkoA,1,3,0,0,"Normally I wouldn't review a mainstream fast food joint but the service and food I got at this Wendy's last night was so awful I have to share.  

My husband and I had a very late lunch which spilled over into a very late dinner and decided around 10:45pm that Wendy's sounded good.  We went through the drive-thru and were greeted by a female employee who, at first, seemed professional and friendly.  I was driving the car and after her greeting us and asking what we would like, I politely (and I'm especially polite at fast food restaurants out of fear of food sabotage!) asked her to give us a minute to look over the menu.  She very nicely said that was fine and instructed me to order when I was ready.  So far, so good.  

No less than 30 seconds later, she got back on the speaker and curtly said, ""Are you ready yet or what?""  I'm not sure what could possibly have happened in the half minute since she last spoke to us but her demeanor had changed drastically.  I wasn't really ready but again, in an effort not to piss off someone who's making my food in a sight unseen kitchen, I obliged and started to place our order.  She interrupted me probably 2 or 3 times while saying my order; it was just so rude.  I'm well aware that I need to indicate what size value meal I want and what kind of drink I want - no need to continually interrupt me while I'm speaking to ask me.  Wait until I'm done talking and if I haven't told you exactly what I want, then feel free to ask away.  But to interrupt me over and over again?  Hello?  Common sense and courtesy, anyone?  Both are highly lacking here.  

I pulled around to the window and gave my money to a gentleman who was nice but not overly friendly.  Not a big deal.  However, when the woman who was obviously the gem on the drive thru speaker (I say obvious because she was the only one there with a headset on) came to the window, she literally handed me the bag of food, did not look me in the eye a single time and started to close the window.  Not a word was spoken.  No thank you.  No enjpy your food.  No come back again.  Nothing.  I wondered if she had suddenly become a mute.  I said thank you as she was handing me the bag and she literally kept looking over my car and out into the street. Annoyed at this point, as she closed the window I yelled out to her, ""Hello?  I said thank you!"" She looked at me with a blank stare and walked away.  Again, not a word was spoken by her.  

Unfortunately, the food didn't redeem the horrible customer service.  The fries were obviously old and the tortilla on my grilled chicken wrap was so hard around the edges that I ended up just taking everything out of it and eating it like a salad (which, to be honest, wasn't that bad but I wanted a wrap, dammit!).  My husband did enjoy his burger but his fries were old, too.  

Look - I get that eating at a fast food joint is hit and miss and I understand that going late at night can get even sketchier but there's just no justification for an employee acting like that and most definitely no excuse for the food to be old and hard.  If you're open until midnight or 1am, I should be able to get food that late that's as fresh as it is if I come at the dinner rush.  I'm sympathetic to fast food employees - it's a thankless job, they're not paid well and I'm quite certain that a lot of their customers (especially in this shady area of town) are real pains in the ass.  

With that being said, like I mentioned before, I am NOT a pain the ass when ordering food at any restaurant establishment, and most definitely not if I'm ordering at the drive through of a fast food place.  If I'm being rude and condescending, by all means - dish it back out to me! I don't expect to be treated well if I'm not treating you well.  But if I'm nice, friendly and respectful, is it too much to ask for the same?  

And now I'll close - with this being the longest Yelp review I've ever placed.  Whew!  I'm coming up for air and if you've made it all the way to the end of this, I salute you!",2016-06-02 23:24:44

Minh and I met up with our friends who live in LV and we decided on coming here after dinner for some drinks. 

I cannot remember what the bar name was but it was a nice loungy type place. It had swag appeal and some pretty good prices on drinks. 

*Warning* this bar is limited so do not request any fancy drinks. 

Ashley and I ordered Sour apple martinis and the boys had beer. The lounge area was nice and dark, the music was okay. But all that mattered was us drinking and having fun! Drinks are semi stiff, and the bartender was a nice guy too! 

LVH hotel is not the type of place you would catch us hanging around at! Honestly, I really do not like the people who are here! On our way out there were a couple of guys (who were older) walking out and clearly, you could tell guy #2 had just a little too much to drink because he his friend was holding him up and trying to get him to walking straight. Well drunk guy by accident bumped into this chick who was walking past him with her friends, his buddy said ""sorry he's been drinking"" but that didn't stop her, she took off her sandals and went after him (think Jerry Springer style) yelling at him and trying to step to him. Holy poop it got real hood up in the LVH, any buzz Minh and I had was pretty much gone after that!

Got the foie gras tasting menu for $85, half of the dishes you could not even taste the foie gras!  The appetizer was a gazpacho with foie ice cream.  Just some cold soup.  The salad was ok, but a tiny tiny portion.  However there was a silver dollar size of foie on it, tasted good, and a bit of lobster.  The only dish that was completely finished.  The wagyu eye was tasteless and kind of dense, although it was soft, but I didn't care for it at all, and the foie mousse was more like liquefied beef liver.  The dessert of beignets I actually asked for to go bc I could not stand being in there any longer.  The foie gelee you dip it in just tasted like fruit jam.

Other things worth noting:
We had reservations for 6pm.  There were only a few tables in the place, but it took so long between courses for the plates to come.  We already informed our server that we had time constraints as we needed to be someplace afterward.  I left approx 7:30.  Took forever to get the bill too, which came out to $111 for the tasting menu and an order of oysters ($18 for 1/2 doz)  The oysters were ok but I can get those anywhere for much less.

Also the server was really annoying by always asking if we were done with a dish or not by saying ""are you still enjoying this?"" *rolleyes* If I was enjoying it, the plate would be empty.

The duck fat fries were the amuse buche.  They came out lukewarm.  The Old bay seasoned ones were way over the top salty.  Nothing special, they are just fries.  Don't see how the duck fat made any difference.

The music they play is terrible.  Who's that singer guy that was in the club scene in the first Nutty Professor movie?  ""This is how we do it"" song?  they played that.  Yes, that song.  OMG  That was when my bf walked out.

I was craving Soon Du Bu (steaming tofu soup) and called ahead.  Even though it is not on the menu, the server asked the kitchen and they custom made it for me. (Impressed!)

After you order, server brings you 5 plates of various pickled vegetables to snack on before you entree arrives as is typical of Korean meals.  

The Soon Du Bu arrived bubbling in a hot pot.  The chef apparently made extra and gave me the rest of the stew in a separate bowl.  Half way through my meal, a Korean server (owner?) came over with a to go container and 2 plastic bags knwoing it was going to be too much food for me to finish in one sitting (she was right.)

I asked for an extra bowl of rice to go, since I had leftovers.  She gave that to me complimentary as well to thank me for visiting the new establishment.

For the good:

- I love the restaurant itself. The setting is beautiful.
- The chicken is good.
- The fries are good, albeit the greasy good kind.
- 13$ for a combo would be reasonable for a good lunch

Now the bad:

- I went the 2nd day after opening, the process was understandably disorganized. That's not an issue. The issue is that the process is weird. You walk in and: 1) you order at one end of the counter, 2) go pay at the other end of the counter and 3) return to the 1st place to get your food. That's so counter-productive. What's wrong with 1) order and pay, 2) get your food and be on your way!

- The sandwich is 80% bread and 20% meat. Oh no! That was such a disappointment. Put some of that delicious chicken inside your sandwich!! 

- The combo doesn't include a drink! WTF? The combo is sandwich + fries + salad. You don't make friends with salad. Salad sucks. Give me a exciting drink to go with my  delicious sandwich!

The first myth I want to address is that this is a ""healthy"" restaurant. It really isn't. I mean other than ordering a salad, which you can get anywhere, most of the other options aren't healthy (when was the last time a burger was healthy!?). The second myth is that this is a vegan restaurant. As my friend and I found out, there were many items on the menu that were vegan, but others not. So if you are strictly vegan, make sure you order accordingly. 

I had a salad while my friend the burger. Both meals were good, but nothing special. 

I have to admit everything else though. was lovely. The space is beautiful and has a lovely terrace in the summer. The service is also quite good.  

Another consideration is that there aren't that many good options for a nice meal on the area, Lov is really one of your better bets.

So this place is an all you can eat hot pot restaurant. Depending on when you go, you either pay a lunch or dinner price. The lunch price is $13.95 and I think the dinner is around $20. The lunch price doesn't include the appetizers you can see on the menu, but you don't have to worry about that for dinner, just order away! I personably enjoy myself the hot pot part of the meal, and that's what I focus on the most. 

You are given a choice between a half and half pot or a pit of one kind of broth. With my family, I get the half normal and half spicy broth, but I personally just like the normal broth. It's all you can eat and the way you get your food is that you go to the fridge that they have of all the meats and vegetables. The selection I had to choose from was beef, chicken, pork, pork belly, shrimp, fish, cabbage, lettuce, broccoli, eggs, tofu, bok choy, fish balls, and there could be more depending on the day I would say. You can get as many as you want as many times as you want. Don't forget to use a tray! They also have a sauce station for you to visit. It's hard to say what you would like. It took me a few trips trying different combinations before I found what I really liked, but I did find it!

So after you bring all your food to your table, you cook your food as you wish. Being as that you are your own chef, you can't blame the way you cook your food on anyone but yourself. You can, however, blame the restaurant that the food you are getting is old and stale, but I wouldn't think that a problem like that would be a problem. 

The only thing is that if you go during non busy hours, you can accumulate quite a bit of plates from all the food you get. The problem that I had when i went with my family was that since it was during lunch, not many people were there, and so not many servers were there either. They don't give very much meat per plate, and so you have to bring quite a bit of them back to your table if you want to fill up your pot. I had a lot of plates laying around for a bit just because they didn't come pick it up that often, maybe 4 times throughout the hour and forty-five minutes I was there. It wasn't a big deal since they sat us on a table with extra space on the table, but I could imagine this being a nightmare for anyone that is sat at a small table. Other than that, I don't have any real complaints about this place. Unlimited food, cook it yourself, and all you have to do is enjoy!",2013-12-17 21:43:20

I stopped in on a Saturday around 5:30 after reading Taric's review.  And yes, this place is everything the folks are saying about it and more.  I already know that I'm going back.  I want to try a few more things on the menu.

So far, 
I've had the chicken skins..  Honestly absolutely delightfully tasty... The crispy skin and the sweet and spicy drizzled honey sauce pairs well with their Okra Hot sauce.  (just be careful pouring the sauce out of that bottle... it has a wide mouth and you'll have a plate full of sauce)

I also ordered the Tennessee style fried chicken.  A leg and a thigh.  I was not quite a impressed with this as I was the chicken skins.  The chicken wasn't seasoned well enough and to me, Tennessee hot style chicken (like Gus') is not wet, its actually dry.  Nevertheless, the chicken was still very tasty and I would have it again, but request the sauce on the side.

No time soon, there are things on that menu that I must try...Here's a todo list:

Since they seem to always be baking it smells heavenly from the wonderful breads to the soft flaky delicious crossaints and beyond!

It is a must to try one different pastry each time to experience the culture!

I cannot go on enough about their pastries!! AMAZING!!

The sandwiches are a culinary experience that's takes you on a mouth watering tour.

I like the combo on baguette ... Thereis not a ton of meats but enough to satisfy and you can always order double meat for cheap

The sandwiches are less than $5.00 and are on a soft crusty delicious fresh baguette or you can opt to have it in a crossaint so ordering double meat for those who are super hungry still makes it a very reasonably priced meal!

Also tons of drinks to choose from be it Thai tea to coffees to cold drinks and  they have fresh sugar cane drink which as you can imagine is sweeter than I can handle... But was fun to try.

There is ample seating and the place is always clean!

They decorate for holidays and when you walk in the door you feel the welcome!

ywgOj2IDp-yOdCNGWbtNXw,SrF972IxsELYQ3eaWB5X4A,ViErpcikhbAjsDcpdAfwSQ,4,8,8,8,"Aloha!

It's been a couple of years since the Beautiful Carin and I took one of our vacations in the islands.

Clearly, it's time to go back and ""Hang Ten"" (I told Carin I could ""Hang Ten"" when we first met, to get her to like me...by the time she found out I couldn't surf, she had fallen in love with me for my mind).

Since we were on Maui last, it looks like they've invented an entirely new hot dog...the Maui Dog!

Well, maybe not ""invented"" so much as ""enhanced"" the good old ""Pooka"" dogs that you find in the islands.

""Maui Enhancement""?

OK, I don't know for sure that these bad boys (and since hot dogs are wiener related, I think it's safe to assume that they are boys) originated on Maui, but wherever and whatever fertile imagination created them deserves a hand-y!

But we have always preferred Maui, when we visit the islands...""Maui No Ka Oi""...now, I guess I can add ""Maui Dog No Ka Oi""

I've seen a few reviews for Maui Dog on Yelp, lately...and I was watching Hawaii 5-0 http://tinyurl.com/yazfcs5 on the TiVo last night and that pretty much decided my lunch plans today (It's sweet of you to worry about my health but don't...I detoxed like crazy this morning, so I was ready and able to handle the nitrate/salt/fat onslaught at lunch today).

I strolled in and looked over the menu...and I was momentarily confused (a hazard that us seasoned citizens learn to deal with by yelling at those younger than us, in an effort to confuse everybody and not feel out of place).

The very nice proprietor came to my aid, briefly explained the workings of the menu, and off I went!

I selected wisely and soon I felt like I was back in the islands noshing a tasty and satisfying Spam slider (Spam = Scientifically Processed Animal Material...I know, more for me)...so very, very tasty!

I was also the proud possessor of a very satisfying Maui Dog!

They started my Maui Dog with a nice big, beefy wiener (that's what she said!) and they put plenty of toppings on him...Spicy Maui Mustard (sadly, mayonnaise on the wiener just doesn't work for me) along with a sort of mango topping and dill spears...Maui Waui!

The sweetness, the spiciness, the saltiness, the grilled flavor of the wiener...all coming through for a first rate Maui Dog experience!

I know, seems like an awful lot of stuff happening on the Maui Dog, but somehow, it all worked for me...I haven't really been a fan of overly dressed wieners in the past, but these guys could change my point of view...a little, at any rate!

So, I now have a Maui Dog ""mahalo"" card (no it doesn't mean ""trash"" in Hawaiian...it means ""Thank You"") and I plan to use that rascal whenever I'm back in town.

That Maui Dog was delicious...good to the last drop!

Aloha!",2010-10-12 21:54:50

However, I have not been going there as often because with the better restaurants that has been popping up in the Richmond Hill area, Big Mouth Kee has not improved at all, in fact it is going downhill...

We went there for dinner on a Sunday evening. The place was not packed at all. We got seated quickly. Though the seats are not the comfy one, as  it tried to imitate the feel of food stalls back in Hong Kong.

There are so much choices in their menu! We decided on the Wonton Chicken Soup, Garlic with Beef and shredded duck with lettuce wrap.

I found everything so salty, so oily and full of MSG! The soup has so much oil floating on top and the beef was deep fried then stired fried! The lettuce that provide a few of them when turning colour!

The only thing I really enjoy was the free dessert: tofu pudding! Yes the tofu pudding saved the meals! At least it was not salty or oily and has no MSG!

There were a lot of tables ordering the fresh seafood from the water tank... BTW, a pound of Vancouver red shrimp cost $26! And all they did was steamed them and give you some chilli soy sauce!

I have to agreed with Reuben Z that this place is not really clean... is it how the street stalls suppose to be? :)

If I come back again, I will make sure I request less salt and less oil when I order my dishes.

On to the drinks now.  Love me some cool crafted cocktails.  Their ""elixirs"" here are sometimes really out there, and I've liked some and hated others, but that's the fun about trying new drinks!  ""What's in that?  Honey and serrano pepper bitters?  LAY IT ON ME.""  One of my favorite bartenders Alex has set up shop down there, too, and he is a kick ass mixologist.  My husband was excited because they are aging some stuff in oak barrels right in the bar.  I don't know much about that stuff, but apparently, that's REALLY COOL.

And the fact that this place is named after a beloved children's book makes the third grade teacher in me smile.  Literature and cocktails...not a better mix than that!",2013-11-03 11:59:55

As always a great time and enjoyed the night.

The Con's:

* The bathrooms kill me. Have to walk up stairs to the second floor. Not easy when you have had a few.

* Again, we got there early and decided to wait at the bar and enjoy the night. Only issue is they let all the bar seats go to diners at the bar, Thus no one waiting and enjoying the evening can sit for a glass of wine. 

The Pro's:

* Great hostess staff, very nice gals.

* Waiter and staff are great, Robert made sure we had everything we needed and check in at the right times. They have a very well trained staff, and support waiters, they always seem to be right there when you need something.

* Food is always top notch.  By far the best consistently good quality we have ever had at a steak house. (and we have been to them all). The are always right now with any special requests and its perfect.

* Wife really enjoyed the baked halibut special.

* They created our desert per my wife's request and it was perfect.

The hostess has the worst system of seating people - first she will give you a number and call you when a table opens up that seats your specific amount of people.  For example, even if I came in before table #65, they might get a seat first because a table of 8 has opened up and I only have 4 people in my party.  Therefore, don't get upset if you think they're randomly calling numbers.

The dim sum here is yummy.  They have these little time discounts, so for example: eating before 11:30AM is cheaper than eating from 11:30AM-1PM, and it becomes cheaper again from 1-4PM (check the pictures).  There are small, medium, large, and special; all different prices.  This is completely worth it for a lot of the dishes, especially the steamed pot rice - it is literally $3 for a pot of rice with beef ribs and a chicken claw. Yuuuuuuum.
Everything else is very average with 0 complaints.  They serve you within the first 10 minutes of you ordering .. but there is a very slow trickle of your food at the end. I waited and extra 10 minutes for the curry squid.  You have to double check what you order because they do tend to forget items sometimes.

Overall, make your reservations and come enjoy a nice Chinese dim sum meal with your fam :)",2015-11-08 23:43:14

Checked this place out on a Saturday evening with a friend for dinner. We were seated immediately, as I made reservations earlier in the day and the hostess was nice. I ordered the Brumbleberry cocktail. It was strong, so be prepared. Basically a shot of bourbon with some mashed berries. Too much ice.... annoying. For $12..... since this is a higher end establishment, I guess it's to be expected. 

I ordered the Scottish salmon. It was really good, but not impressive. The portion was just enough that you would no longer be hungry, but you wouldn't leave stuffed. That being said, the lentils were tasty and I wish they would've had twice as many. The presentation was nice.

My friend had the pork chop, which she said was fantastic. Because she has false teeth -childhood accident-, she couldn't eat around the bone (the best part :-) ) So I had a taste of the pork chop and it was great. The side of mac and cheese had some sort of meat in it.

Why only 3.5 stars? Nothing was special. This is a consistently good restaurant, but I expected more because I heard such great things. Yet there wasn't anything that has me itching to come back soon. They appear to have an interesting happy hour menu that's worth checking out.",2016-05-09 21:11:42

The staff was friendly enough.  There was a general sense that this place was a springboard for locals to use before taking in shows and events on the strip.  People were dressed up and everyone was having fun at the kind of pace that tends toward ramping up not settling down.

The menu is diverse and satisfying.  The kitchen produced some tasty entrees but the standouts for us were the appetizers and the dessert.  Puffy tacos, Tuna nachos and Buffalo bites landed at our table and were engulfed at the phrenetic pace of the surrounding crowd.  However, nothing prepared me for the pending dessert.

I love peanut butter, but this dessert arrived at my table and I knew something good was about to happen.  Fried peanut butter sandwiches with strawberry jelly dipping sauce.  The name says it all.

I met two of my colleagues there and we quickly ordered our plates along with 3 mimosas. We waited maybe 10 minutes before our food arrived which was pretty decent considering how busy it was. The plates were nice, combinations were good. The salmon croquette was excellent. The ham croissant was delicious. Mimosa were also pretty fantastic. You might be thinking why am I giving it a 1 star then. Two main reasons:

First there was hair in my salad which totally grossed me out.

Second the response of the waitress Annie when I told her, and I quote ""I hope it wasn't curly"" then she laughed. Maybe she found that funny but I certainly did not.

We have had Heist on our list for months and finally felt hungry when we were on that side of town.  What a tremendous let down!
Service: Wasn't great, in fact it was nearly non existent. 
Atmosphere: fantastic! We sat right by the brewing area and had a big table to ourselves.  The restaurant was dead aside from one other table. 
Menu: Their offerings sounded really interesting but I don't eat any beef or pork and there weren't any options to substitute chicken for beef on any entrees.  Their vegetarian menu items sounded typical and uninteresting so those were immediately taken off my radar. 
Food: Bland! Chicken and Waffle sushi tasted like nothing.  Chicken was insanely dry, waffles tasted like nothing, the syrup was nonexistent.  A bland overcooked nightmare.  Our jerk chicken flatbread pizza tasted like saltine crackers with burned chicken and a smattering of roasted red peppers.  

I was super thankful we decided to only order a couple of things to try instead if going for a dull meal.  After this overworked, under flavored sampling we had to drown our sorrows at Amelie's.

My friend's loft is steps away from HB, and it is definitley a good and bad thing. Great since you can go anytime, have a great time, and walk back home, bad, I would definitley spend way too much money and pack on a ton of calories at this place!

Thursday evening, we had a table right next to the bar, so very convenient. It was a special night, as they were unveiling the beer tap handles. Professional photos were being taken, some delicious hor dourves available, and felt like I was in a monumental moment as people were purchasing glasses of beer as people cheered on. 

This place is a lot larger than I had expected, as there's a huge area beyond the front bar. There, you can see the brewery through glass, and it's a large open space of tables and bar tables.

I was introduced to the Moscow Mule, a Russian version of a margarita. It's also poured in these copper (or silver) mugs that keep the drink extra cold the entire time. It was AMAZING! Very addicting, as it's not super strong. The ginger beer was refreshing, especially with the lime provided. I could've drank these all night, and only $9!

We shared a bunch of appetizers, which they have a lot of unique combinations plus your typical bar fare with a twist (strawberry bun anyone?). My favorite by far, was my local friends' favorites as well, the 6 cheese pimento and sherried crab dip. Delicious, especially with the parmesean flatbread provided! I could not stop eating it! Their spinach and artichoke dip was just as good as well! I ordered the jerked chicken flatbread pizza, which was good, but I'd have to say the root beer BBQ duck pizza was even better! We also got the forked-up ahi, which also came with a wasabi soy mist in a mini bottle! How clever is that? 

Great ambience of locals dining and drinking, and definitley had a great night here that ended my trip quite nicely. Would definitley recommend this place and feel like one of the locals in the trendy NoDa area!",2012-10-16 17:39:06

It took me a while to visit this place because of the mixed reviews I've heard. However, I was heading downtown anyways so I was like..why not? The process starts with selecting the components of your drink - syrup OR powder, sweetness level, tapioca, tea...just follow the assembly line. Once you reach the end of the line/the cashier, they will craft your drink. It doesn't take too long but it's not super fast either. Keep in mind they are making a custom drink. 

I found the place to be ""sticky"". While everything seemed fairly clean, it maybe wasn't ""science-lab-experiment-spotless clean"". You're visiting a (boba) poppin' beverage shop on Bay Street, and minutes away from some of the most frequented areas in Toronto. 

I got a Matcha-Blueberry flavour with blueberry pearls, which was surprisingly good. Initially, I thought the pearls were like regular pearls but they actually pop... I wish they would've labelled them as ""popping pearls"".

Appetizer: 
Champagne pate with radish & pickles: The pate was a little too salty.
Frisee salad with toasted egg & brioche: This was one of the best plates of the night -- the vinagrette dressing went very well with the frisee, bacon, and egg.  The brioche was light and good!

Entrees:
Sauteed salmon w/ artichokes, new potatoes, onions:  Decent sized salmon fillet.  It was good, but nothing spectacular.
Duck: The duck itself was cooked medium rare, tender and yummy! However, the sauce that it came with wasn't all that great.  It could've been tastier and made the meat stand out more!
Macaroni au gratin: Yummy! As expected!

Desert: Orange creamsicle dome - Pretty interesting.  Little pastry like dome filled with cream and orange jelly.  Also served with orange meringue.  

Atmosphere: On the louder side.  Upscale, classy feel and look.

Service: Good

Pulled up to the drive-thru at 9pm, no line, a couple customers eating inside.  As I would expect for a fast food establishment in the first weeks of opening, there were a ton of employees.  Ordered a 4 piece all white meat meal with fries.  Paid extra for all white meat (expected), even had the cashier ask me if i was sure I wanted all white meat.  Saw the cashier tell the 5 people filing only my order since no one else was in the drive-thru, nor ordering inside.  Got my food and home.  Now, my stupidity for not checking at the window like i know i have to do at KFC. Figured since the cashier asked, and i saw him tell the five people, it works be right.  Stupid on my part.  Drove my 4 piece dark meat meal back to the store.  As i walk in, the girl says ""you're the guy from the drive - thru, huh?"", like she anticipated my return.  No big deal, the manager apologized and gave me a four piece all white meat.  What was aggravating was the 5 teenage/young adult employees throwing food at each other, running around in the back.   Perhaps if the manager set some rules for her employees (like no food fights, running around in the back, screaming ask within view of the customers) they would actually get it right the first time.  After all this, got home, and the chicken was saltier than a salt-lick.  It was inedible, i ate half a breast and had to throw the rest in trash.

I knocked on the drive thru window repeatedly as the girl who waited on me had closed it, for what seemed like an eternity. When she finally came to the window with a disdainful look on her face asking what I wanted.  I explained the issue and not only did she not offer to remake it, she seemed pissed that I had a beef. When I suggested an Orange Julius instead or something comparable, she only pointed out the higher price difference. I then asked for a large diet soda, which she obliged but didn't bother to refund the difference in price. (I should have got back at least .40 cents) Clearly the advertised product and what you will find waiting for you at the window are two different things.

The service has been quick every time, never a problem with waiting for a table or waiting for food. The drinks, such as their bellini, are also a reason to go. I plan on going again to try some of their other unique pizza options.",2009-01-05 04:23:47

Not just Domino's sloppy pizza, but a pizza that made you feel gourmet, a little healthier than the usual stuff. Well, we turned to google maps and came across this tasty little joint. From the outside, you wouldn't be able to tell that the interior is surprisingly updated and clean.

Me, my fiance, and my daughter sat at a table right in front of the big screen TV over the bar to watch the Cards game. It was happy hour, so we had $2.50 draft beers, and ordered their appetizer fries, complete with ranch and nacho cheese dip. They were uh-mazing. I ate so many of the fries that I was almost too full by the time they brought out our pizza. I went with the chicken pesto and tomato pizza (DELISH) and my man went with a build your own creation, similar to a chicago style pizza. The kid ate free (bonus). We had plenty of leftover pizza to take home with us, which, BTW, it heats up nicely and tastes great the next day.  

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because they don't have pineapple as a topping choice. I have been eating pineapple on my pizza since I was 12, so this was disappointing. But, it did force me to try something new, in which I was impressed with. As for gourmet-I would say a lot better than a run of the mill pizza joint. The dough isn't greasy, and the topping combinations/themes were unique (i.e. prosciutto & pear), but also classic (i.e. pepperoni). Would definitely go back with the family.",2014-01-05 08:39:15

I have only tried a few of the items, but they were great and you can't beat the price!  

The nigiri sushi at Yasu is wonderful.  My absolute favorite is the albacore.  It is to-die-for!  The albacore slices are topped with dried (or fried?) garlic and onion then a light sauce is poured over the top.  You have to try it to understand.  The spicy tuna hand rolls are another winner.  Plenty of fishy goodness, and some rice, bursting out of the nori cone.   If you like Tobiko order the ""premium"" spicy tuna, but be sure to nix the romaine lettuce.  It overpowers and adulterates the tuna and Tobiko flavors I love so much. The specialty rolls are good, but there aren't many to choose from.  Also, the roll ingredients aren't listed on the sushi order sheet...or anywhere else for that matter.  It is a pain to have to flag down a server to ask what's in a Phoenix or Sun roll.  

My major disappointment here is lack of a real sushi bar.  There is a bar, but you can't really see what the chefs are making nor can you call out your order to the chefs.  One of my favorite things about sushi restaurants is drinking and getting chummy with the chefs at the bar.  Not gonna happen here...

All in all, a great place to grab some sushi.",2011-09-30 20:18:00

Just as the sign says, they do cook the pizza's on charcoal so expect some burnt bits.  It's not a minus by any means....it is definitely a plus to have some char to the meal.  Who can resist that?  
When hubby and I stopped in it was pretty busy since the restaurant opened up the week before.  
Alot of seating outdoors but we opted for inside.  We were seated at one of the high two top tables.  I don't recommend sitting at one of those because they are set up in the middle of a busy thoroughfare between the bar and the booths. Every time a waiter/waitress came by, I got bumped.  In addition, there was a blinding glare coming off of the floor because the sun was sitting just right.  So we moved the table sideways and it wasn't so bad.  We did try the sampler beer, which was a nice touch.  Not too much of one but little tasters of many.  
Our waitress brought us a 'sample' chicken wing. For us, it was just OK if you like all of the stuff piled on it.  Underneath, the wing was crying out for the heavy topping be served on the side.  
Pizza was wonderfully charred all around but we noticed that the center got soggy a little bit.  Wouldn't recommend ordering out and taking them home if you lived far away because it might be soggy in the middle when you get home.  Besides, once the box is closed, it takes away the crustiness of the pizza dough!  Pizza should be eaten just as it comes out of the oven, no?  
The pizza, the newness of the restaurant/bar, it gets a 4!  Would definitely come back.",2012-09-14 20:09:57

Since Glory hole doesn't yet have a storefront space, and I can't write a direct review for them without an address, I'm going to enter my Glory Hole Doughnut review here:

Oh. My. God. So they are called ""Glory Hole Doughnuts"", but my enjoyment of these doughnuts went well beyond sexual, all the way to religious and communing with the divine. 

I pray to the church of Glory Hole Doughnuts.

I'm actually quite bothered by the name, the irreverence doesn't suit the serious nature of these bad boys. This is a real triumph of baked goodness. I've only had the lemon meringue, and I don't need to try any of the other flavours. I'm sure they are great, and I'll list them in a second because they may be even better than the lemon, but I can say that this is one of those times that I may only have lemon for like the next 2 years, because I am already that addicted, and will be unable to try any others till my addiction runs its course. The lemon meringue doughnut is RIDICULOUSLY PHENOMENAL. It is a glorious triumph of doughnuttiness. It is a revelation. I really can't say enough about it. The lemon curd is potentially the BEST lemon curd I have ever had, and I'm something of a lemon curd aficionado. It's tangy tart sweet fantastic, and it tastes like ripe lemons warming in the sun after a light summer rain. The doughnut itself boasts a marvelous doughnuttiness, that perfect textural amount of give and resistence and chewy yum that makes a pastry so enjoyable when you bite into it. It's just plain tasty. The lemon curd and the perfect meringue complete the Glory Hole package, and it's simply magnificent in every way. 

Given the incredible wonderfulness of the Lemon Meringue, I do one day look forward to trying their other flavours: Maple Bacon, Coconut Cream, Apple Pie, Fried Chicken & Waffles, Cinnamon & Sugar, Dolce de Leche & Hazelnut, Peanut Butter & Grape Jelly, Puddin', and Smores. Holy. How did the world get this far without these flavours! Evolution is a powerful and beautiful thing.

Glory Hole Doughnuts are apparently still looking for a storefront location in TO, for now they deliver(!) by the half and full dozen, and are available at Thor Espresso and Burger Bar on select days. They Tweet @gholedoughnuts. Definitely grab one at Thor with a creamy Americano. 

It's rare that a bakery comes up with something entirely their own, truly unique and special. Glory Hole Doughnuts has transcended the standard whatever, and these doughnuts are something so high in quality, execution, and flavour, soooooo fresh and tasty and wonderful, well, I just wish them all the best in the world. Keep on baking, peoples! Everyone needs to try these doughnuts!!! 

PS. I am not crazy, I just really like doughnuts. :)

PPS. Thor is really awesome too. Great coffee and an awesome space, futuristic ordering and really nice people. I like to go to there. You go too! :)",2012-01-09 03:13:30

-it's cheap
-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)
-there is plenty to choose from on the menu
-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...

That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.

I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!

I'm preeeeeetty sure I'm always the first person to like their photos but I was avoiding this place because I knew that it wouldn't be great for my waistline. All their photos looked amazing and their newest location in Kensington is closer to where I live.

My gf and her kids were coming in from out of town and it was my responsibility to look for a kid friendly place. So first, kids don't eat much, second, they tend to be really picky yet simple, third, they love sugar. BURGER 320 it is!  They have two locations, one in the heart of Kensington and a smaller location in Bridgeland. The Kensington location is bigger and has more options on the menu. Parking is easy on the weekdays after 6, weekends may be another story.

There is a large display of gelatos right near the entrance which they are quite famous for. They offer burgers, sweet or savory waffles, crazy shakes, drinks and they have some cookies up front for sale too. You first order and pay then have a seat. My gfs got burgers and fries, the kids got cookies & cream waffle and a plain burger with a side order of fries and I got the Farmhouse savory waffle. 

The presentation of the cookies and cream waffle was amazing. Oreo waffle, topped with chocolate gelato, whipped cream, chocolate drizzle and oreo crumbs and some chocolate bits to top it off. Oh to be a kid again.... My Farmhouse waffle's presentation on the other hand wasn't the greatest. It definitely didn't look like the photo they have on their website. Two eggs, Italian sausage and bacon all on top of a savory waffle with a side of maple syrup. Unfortunately, the sausage and bacon were overcooked and dry but the eggs were okay and the waffle was good! Waffle has a slight crisp and fluffy on the inside, I wish it was crispier but it probably got soggy from the hot items sitting on top. My gfs said they enjoyed their burgers and I stole (aka ate all) the kids fries. The fries were OK, I feel as though they were undercooked because they didn't have the delicious fry taste.

Next time I will definitely try a burger but wasn't feeling it when we went. Overall, Burger 320 is a cute burger/waffle/gelato joint where the kids will LOVE. It's a place to hit up on a cheat day where you'll order sweet waffles and crazy shakes. It seems as though it will be a great conversation piece for a first date.",2017-03-17 16:59:36

This chain restaurant is indeed offensive on many levels to a person from Chicago: typical corporate chain restaurant wall flair is everywhere, and that schlock is indeed Chicago themed. There is a scoreboard that looks like Wrigley's, a sign for Rush Street, and everywhere you look are old timey pics of landmarks etc. etc. This in and of itself would not be so bad, but the fact that the chain so buttfucks the idea of Chicago deep dish pizza is irredeemable. The thing that they call deep dish likely has most of the ingredient groups of a Chicago Style pizza, but it is so unlike a Chicago Style pizza I refuse to discuss it anymore for fear I will throw my keyboard in rage. A quick look at their corporate website and you will note that this place has dozens, if not hundreds of locations, with only one in Chicagoland (Elk Grove, on the Iowa side of O'Hare).

So why does this patently offensive joint get an 'A-OK'? The thin crust pizza was pretty good. It was not New York Style, but the cheese had the same saltiness and was cooked to perfection: crispy, with slightly orange cheese, and served hot as hell but not yet burnt. I had it with basil and roasted garlic, which were chopped up and added under the cheese and complimented the pizza very well. Their Cheesy Garlic bread is absolutely divine; I have to get that again next time. 

They also have beer. Basically every mainstream domestic and popular import you have ever heard of. About 30 on tap. Not as many obscure micros and craft beers as you will find at the Pig and Crane Alley or even at Radio Maria, Boltini and Seven Saints, but it is a great selection for a chain restaurant. Kinda disappointing in that regard, but understandable as this is obviously a company that buys thousands, if not millions of barrels yearly and is not interested in getting a cask here and there.

I went on Tuesday night, when they have 1/2 price pizzas and $2.99 Two Brothers' Beers. This made the meal much more palatable. My 14"" thin crust pizza full price would have been about $15-16 with 2 toppings, which is a little much for a pizza that feeds two (they say 2-3, but dont do that to yourself). 

Service was great. Jacob (Jake) was attentive, efficient, and accurate. He was courteous and intuited our needs. We were playing trivia there via the NTN boxes, so of course he always seemed to come by when a question was being asked, but that is just how life seems to work.

They have a ton of TVs, most of which are flatscreen HD. They also have a bunch of very high quality video games including new golden tee and new safari hunter as well as a few others. This would be an excellent place to watch a game.

So, the experience was pretty darn good, even if it was in an obnoxious corporate atmosphere. Prices would have been a little higher than is reasonable for Chambana, but I went on a night with a deal (check their website for that). Had a talented server, and that made all the difference.",2010-05-26 13:59:10

The first time I tried this a few weeks ago I bought an upgraded Kwikset deadbolt that wouldn't work on the thin security door.  The bolts were too long to pull the two locks tight on the door.  I had to return that one and didn't have time to do another re-key.  

Last week I got the new deadbolt home and it didn't have the problem I had before, now the mail locking bolt was too thick.  The design was different from old one.  It had some stupid twist thing so it could adjust it's length, so... back to the home depot.  It wasn't even 30 minutes later but the first guys were gone and a less knowledgeable helper was in the locks & keys.  I asked for help and he tried to refer me to security door specialist store.

He didn't think it was but I found a previously open package that we dug into and compared.  Yep, this one matched my deadbolt that fit.  So... I know more about deadbolts than the guy working at Home Depot.  This shouldn't be.  I do marketing for a living.  I've changed a few door knobs and dead bolts over the years, but I'm no expert.

5p2tpoZV7LwWOQIQUlJBmw,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,50XvIvOubxwUsiSgyzaM0w,4,6,1,1,"I usually wash my own car, but when the wife got a used Acura MDX in BLACK of all colors...I gave up.  No matter what the Hell I do, when I washed it all it left me was streaks and sore wrists.  Black leaves scratches and swirls no matter what!  It drove me crazy.  Not to mention every time I washed it, the darn thing took a chunk of my afternoon.  One weekend after I got it washed and waxed...and it rained two days later...I said 'F this'.  I'd rather be chased by a horde of hungry walkers than have to waste my time washing this car again.  I am taking this thing to a car wash from now on!

But I hate most car wash places because of the stupid brushes they use to clean your car.  Majority of them are very harsh, and they leave tons of scratches!  I have on occasion come back from a car wash and have had to use touch up paint to cover up some spots those brushes managed to mess up.  But after much looking, I have finally found a decent car wash spot near me.

I noticed that Craig Road Car Wash has a few real low scores.  That's kinda to be expected with the volume of cars they do on a daily basis.  Come on, desert dust mixed in with 100+ degree heat!  Pay to wash my car?  Yes, please!  This place is almost constantly busy.  Of course there will be some unsatisfied folks.  Here's a few tips about Craig Road Car Wash.  Go early:  they usually open around 8:00 AM most days.  Go there early when the sun isn't at it's hottest and the place isn't that busy yet.  You will get a bit better attention for your sweet ride.  Don't like the work they did?  Go over it as soon as you get your keys back and keep asking for things to get addressed.  Water stains leftover?  Have them wipe it over.  Streaks?  Have them wipe it over.  Something missing?  Definitely get this looked at BEFORE you leave the car wash.  I always make them address something before I give them a tip, and on all cases so far they've taken care of my car.  But, go earlier in the morning before it gets busy if at all possible.  Also, think about it...workers are more productive at the beginning of a shift than at the end of a shift where they are tired and sore.  The Las Vegas heat makes people go crazy, yo!  

One reason I go to the Craig Road Car Wash is because they use soft cloth brushes for cleaning cars.  To me it makes a big difference with seeing less scratches and swirls on your ride.  The brushes move slower and are less damaging to your car.  Another reason I go to the Craig Road Car Wash - prices!  Some of the most competitive prices in town.  I don't want to constantly pay $100+ to get a black car detailed, but at the same time I don't want a $7 cheapie car wash that will leave a black car worse for wear.  Craig Road Car Wash has several different options and packages to get your ride ready for easy Sunday morning cruisin'.  I usually stick with the Super Wash for my car.  It's under $19 and comes complete with just about everything your car needs to be clean, inside and out.  For those in the know, the Wash 'n Express Hand Was Manager's Special will get your car washed and waxed for under $32.  This seems to be one of their better specials.  This is what I get when I want the black MDX to shine just a lil' bit more.

Craig Road Car Wash also offers different full detail packages at good prices for you folks with fancy rides.  Tons of people with sweet rides are here often.  I've seen a Lamborghini getting detailed, as well as a classic Mercedez Benz from the 70's.  All walks of life.  Craig Road Car Wash also offers additional services such as headlight restoration, and windshield repair at reasonable prices.    

Another good thing about Craig Road Car Wash is their free car club.  Use your license plate to join and every time your car is washed it's tallied in their system.  Once you get 10 washes, your next one is free.  Not bad!  I notice I'm here at least 1-2 times a month.  Probably more since the dusty season is just ahead.

So in the end, if you want a decent car wash visit Craig Road Car Wash.  No regular car wash here is perfect and folks will miss things from time to time.  Just be sure to watch them like a hawk!  Once you go black (car)...you might just go back!",2013-04-23 20:19:16

Before she disappeared, we needed to call her over if she wasn't acting like we were invisible.  Also bad, is that the menu is basically a few sandwiches and burgers, unless you want ribs.

I've never heard of Presotea before so from the get go I was shocked by the huuuuge selection of bbt that they offered. As well, their options to create the unique drink to fit your needs kind of reminded me of Cha Time. Their prices are quite similar too but the sizing of their small, regular and large beats cha time i think. For sure their regular beats cha time's regular.

So far i have tried the mango slush with lychee jelly, wintermelon milk tea with grass jelly, passion fruit green tea and panda milk tea. For all the other drinks aside from the mango slush I always asked for less sugar and less ice. All of them were pretty good in my opinion EXCEPT for the grass jelly in the wintermelon milk tea...I thought it was just bad luck but i tried it a couple more times to be sure...each time I got grass jelly, I'd have some jelly and them some really chewy stuff which I have no idea what they are and it kind of ruins the drink. It's like having tapioca but a bad kind and it just ruins your whole experience with the drink. In any case I stopped getting the grass jelly and switched it to tapioca which so far hasnt given me any issues. Even the lychee jelly was fine like all other places...not sure what's up with the grass jelly...

Service has always been fine. I always get greeted by the girls that work there and I only wait a few minutes to get my drink. Mind you all the times I've went so far, I have never caught their busy time. They do only have 2 people there usually so I don't know what it's like when they have a lot of customers.

To be honest, I don't have any major issues with this place and I would definitely recommend it to other people to try it out. It's pretty much like any other bbt place and I guess the two things that really stand out for me are the variety of bbt they offer and also the size of your drinks.",2016-04-26 12:22:54

After our visit to Ticoz on Saturday evening, I would say that Ticoz is FEZ's sexy Latin sister! Loved the dark amber tones that decorated the interior, and even though we sat in the main dining room, we peeked in the bar area and it looked very inviting. Our server was super nice and pleasant, and paid us just right amount of attention. We arrived a little after 7 on the Saturday night and were seated right away. The only real negative about Ticoz is that you can miss it if you don't know exactly where it is because it's not in a well lit area and, even though there is one sign near the street, you can easily miss it.

I had the watermelon sangria to drink and it was delicious! It was like drinking a watermelon jolly rancher, and I liked that it came with a slice of watermelon which I enjoyed after I finished my drink. We split the calamari appetizer...while it was not to die for, it was still better than what I imagined getting in the desert; plus the breading was very light and the appetizer was only the rings and no yucky tenticles, so kudos to that! I had the chicken torta sandwich with waffle fries as my entree. The sandwich was a great size and the chicken was so tender. Their were two things I didn't like: one was that the sandwich came on grilled flatbread - I would have preferred another bread option and second, with the fries and cole slaw, it was just way too much food. It barely looked like I ate anything even though I ate the whole sandwich and quite a number of fries, which were tasty. Chris had the chicken tamales which he really enjoyed.

Our bill came to $49 before tip. We used the $10 gift certifcate Chris won at the Fez UYE so after that was deducted and we added tip, our total was $50. Not too shabby at all. We'll definitely be back in the future to sit at the bar and enjoy some more good food.",2008-12-30 20:10:07

For appetizers we had the meatballs, fried cauliflower, oysters and beef carpaccio. I loved the beef carpaccio. It was delicious and smokey with the cheese on top. I also loved the oysters. They were on the smaller side and it comes with lemon and a garlic olive oil sauce. They were fresh and delicious. 

For the entree I got the filet mignon medium rare. I also got a chance to try the ribeye, and sea bass. For the meats you had he option of adding on a side of shrimp scampi or lobster tail. My friend got the lobster but I ate most of it. The lobster with the butter sauce was very good. A little over cooked because the ends were dry and chewy. My filet was perfect. It was a perfect medium rare throughout. It was super lean but very very tender. It was juicy and flavorful. I absolutely loved it. The filet came with broccolini on the side. 

Usually the ribeye is my favorite cut of steak because of the marbling but I tried my friends ribeye and I definitely liked my filet better. It was a little chewy I felt that the cut was fatty but the fat wasn't well distributed. It was still good but the filet is better quality.

And so we did. Now my parents aren't really big fan of American style restaurants like these and I think that this place didn't change their minds about it. 

First of all the service was okay...our waitress seem a little preoccupied or rather annoyed with us taking our time.....so I didn't feel like her service was all that great but it wasn't all that terrible either....I would like to think that she probably just had a long day and was really tired.....so I will let that go. 

Both my parents ordered the Pumpkin Soup and I didn't like pumpkin but that was the only soup they were serving so I didn't get a starter. My bf tried their Blue Corn Pancake with bbq duck....it was really meant for one serving...actually after seeing that I realized all the appetizers were made for one serving....bf said it the duck meat was overloaded with Hoisin sauce so it was pretty sweet. I didn't know that the appetizers were going to be so small because I didn't really want to eat that much so I ordered the Blue Corn Lobster Taco as an entree....turns out it was three bite sized tacos....it was good but for the price it was just not worth it.

I ordered the Veal chop for my mom and the Green Chile  Cioppino for my dad. I guess he really didn't like the flavor because he only ate the one jumbo prawn and the scallops but not the Bass, Clams or the Mussels. He said the fish had a weird texture and the flavor was weird. My mom liked the veal chop...I tried a piece of it and it was indeed very tender and flavorful. We had a side dish of spinach - $9 dollars for a small bowl even though it was meant to be shared.....ehhh not worth it. My bf apparent enjoyed his Mango Spiced Rubbed Tuna Steak....it did look pretty good and I tried a piece of that too and I guess it was pretty good. 

The bill came out to be around 250ish plus tip....I was expecting a three digit bill however I didn't expect it to be in the 200's.....the quality and quantity of the food was just not worth that amount of money and I don't really think I would come back.

Let me start by saying I love their location. Anything modern is a given plus for me. They are clean and occassionally even played house/lounge music when I came in (Places in AZ dont typically play this type of music which made me sad :-[ ).

Staff has always been friendly, welcoming and helpful (including the front greeter).  Another huge plus. 

Hairstylists:
Jenny had been my main stylist for about 1 year. She is awesome, cut my hair the way I wanted it without me having to explain much. She is also friendly. I would recommend her expertise.

Unfortunately for me, she recently changed her schedule. She is no longer doing Saturday. So per her previous recommendation, I switch to Cassondra. Actually had my hair cut done last weekend. Cassondra is another friendly stylist to work with (its like you ladies agree to be on friendly cult or something). I decided to change my style a lil bit and cut my hair few inches shorter to prepare for summer and my upcoming vacation. The down side,  she cut my hair a lil shorter than my request. I generally dislike how I look with shorter hair so that was a bit unexpected. The good side, even if I personally dont like shorter hair, I have gotten few compliments for the cut after I styled it. So its not an awful cut just personal preference of not liking shorter cut (Note: it still about shoulder length. But I consider it ""Shorter"" cut as usually my hair length is about my nipple. Haircut aside, Cassondra gave me advice on shampoo as my current shampoo might cause issue in the future. I wasnt asking for the advice but her initiative to tell me I may be using something that damage my hair in the long run is a plus. So far I like the product she recommend. Despite the shorter cut, I would also still recommend Cassondra. I believe we are in the initial stage getting to know style preferencesand communicating it properly.

We ordered the Lychee Mojito, loved it, but so much mint, clearly not muddled enough. Then we were told that the sushi making was baked up, so it might be a while. So we ordered an app of chicken lettuce wraps. It was fairly tasty.  I'm not sure if there was chicken in it as everything was so finely diced. I It looked more like tofu and tasted less like chicken. However, every once in a while a wave of chicken flavor came in. Ok, upon suggestion of Yelpers, I tried the lemon twist roll. A little too much lemon flavor for me, almost overpowering. Pretty good, but that thick piece of salmon that topped it was too much for me, I removed it. I remember the Blakeney roll tasting better last more, more salmon. Wasn't into it. I will say that the Sweet 18 was my favorite. I was wrapped in some pink soy paper, I think. I'm not sure what was inside, but l think it had crabmeat, avocado, and cucumber and was topped with a fried fat shrimp and had a honey glaze. Delish!!  I'd go back.",2015-08-22 14:45:37

We had a cheese dip and burgers and were shocked at the price. So reasonable! For a Saturday night, the place was busy, but it wasn't like you were fighting for service like a Southend bar. There aren't a lot of good quaint spots in South Charlotte that do a burger right, and I'm so happy we found this place! Don't get me wrong, we love our southend spots, but sometimes we just want simple.

If you're looking for a place with simple, classic bar food, a nice patio, and really friendly service, head to OPPP! It's super close to the breweries off Old Pineville (OMB, Brewers at Yancey) so if you don't want to wait for food there, OPPP is super easy to get to.

We tried to go to Jack's a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch, and we got there at 10:35 since their website and Facebook pages both said they open at 10:30.  We got there and the hours on the door said 11:00 a.m. Sunday.  Argh.  Consistency in publicizing hours seems like the easiest thing a restaurant/bar can do, so that stuck in my craw, especially since I was starving.

We went again today - at 11:15 - and the place was about halfway full.  Our hostess and waitress were nice, the food selection was great and the prices were almost too low for what you get.  I ordered the Hungry Jack - two eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes AND pancakes for $8.99.  For all that food, I would've expected to pay a lot more!  Fella got the Chicken Biscuit, and I think it was an entire fried chicken with a fried egg on a biscuit; it also came with taters or grits.  

All in all, a good experience, but I just felt like I was eating breakfast in a bar that the nightly attendees had just stumbled out of a couple of hours before.  I love Jack's as a bar, but as a breakfast restaurant, it's still dark and dingy with nighttime bar music playing, which just isn't my favorite on a Sunday morning.

Now about the food. Our party of four began with a dozen of oysters - Fanny Bay, Blue Point and Skookum - and it came with a variety of sauces.

Spicy Tuna Tartare with Waffle Fries was an unexpectedly delicious combination, and Grilled Shrimp Salad came with soba noodles and baby arugula, which seemed odd turned out to be a great assortment of protein, green and whole grain.

Caviar and French Toast with Crème Fraîche was another interesting dish. Unlike the normal toast or baguette, tiny pieces of pancake-like soft savory toast came out and it allowed us to appreciate little by little, rather than swallowing all the caviar at once. We got another batch of toast and I even ate the toast alone - it's that good.

Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings was the only meat we had, and it played a nice and crispy role in the interim of seafood dishes.

Then the Amberjack nigiri special - it literally melted on my tongue.

And finally, the Japanese Cheesecake with Raspberry Mint Sauce - it didn't really taste like a real Japanese cheesecake, but it's definitely on the softer and fluffier side. I would say, an Italian cheesecake. Tasty piece of it, nonetheless.

The service can be really spotty, but today we had the best I've ever had there!!!  Most of the reviews have complained about the service, but if you ask for Bobby you won't have that problem.

Each table gets a loaf of delicious bread and whipped butter to start the meal.  The bread is unlimited so ask for more if you run out.   

I always order the exact same thing because it's always really good.  I get the 6oz sirloin medium rare, with a house salad, and broccoli.  I recommend getting the dressing on the side.

The salads are brought out before the meal and are always sooo yummy!  Outback publishes all of their nutritional content online, which is a plus for me.

Outback has curbside pickup, which I normally do.  They do a good job packaging the food and they even bring it out to your car.

We had our Easter brunch here. Sure, it is pricey, but if you have the stomach capacity to go with it you might be very satisfied.

The buffet items are good. There is a lot of variety, ranging from sushi and salad to freshly cooked soup noodles and sliced beef. I especially appreciated the noodles because it's not often to find those in an American bistro (Mandarin Oriental would have been a good bet tho!), but it is not really price efficient, I suppose. There was also a dazzling array of Easter desserts, and it'd be impossible to leave hungry after trying everything at the buffet.

We also had to choose a main dish, which is a bit ridiculous because that is a lot of extra food. I picked the steamed fish dish, hoping that it will be lighter than the other offerings, but it was disappointing -- the fish was steamed for too long and the texture became rubbery. If anything, Mandarin Oriental should have done this dish right -- it's a Cantonese staple and showcases the chef's skillz. The mister's waffle was a better choice - it came with green tea whipped cream and passionfruit preserves, and tasted fantastic. 

Overall there are some 4-star moments, and some 3-star. I really wanted to like this place, but the price-to-quality ratio is not quite there. I will likely visit again for their dinner menu just to try it out.",2015-08-11 06:38:35

I've come here about 7or 8 times over the last several years. 

Today's experience was no exception - superior kitchen. 

However we used to enjoy the service as well. Great servers who had personality, tattoos, and guided our dining experience making great recommendations. Fabulous. 

Today was a little different. They have moved to a team serving style. Therefore we met no less than six people all of whom wanted to take our order, bring us things, or see if everything was ok. Which meant that we had to tell several people that we had already ordered, the guy who did take our order looked confused/perturbed that no one had already had taken our order (he looked around and said, I guess I'll take your order) and people we had not met actually delivered our food. A little chaotic. NBD. No fewer than three people said, ""first time here?""

When we received our food (sensational Banh Mi, not very authentic but great), one of our waiters asked if we wanted a second round of drinks - we said ""sure.""

Fifteen to twenty minutes later, as we finished our light meal, the drinks - a beer and a glass of wine arrived. We'd already written them off as MIA. Again, NBD. 

At this point the nice young woman in a great Guns N Roses UK t-shirt looked confused and said ""but it's been poured.""  I still don't understand the relevance of the comment. I said it was too late, we were leaving and I'd like my check. She apologized and got a manager. Here is the odd thing - all six or so people wanted to apologize so we had a parade of people I had barely met offering free drinks, one offered to comp the meal, and a profusion of ""we're so sorry!""  I didn't want a fuss or an apology. I just didn't want to pay for drinks that arrived too late to enjoy them with our food. I refused the offer of a free meal. I just wanted to leave after this ""tsunami of apology."" They made a big deal out of a tiny incident. 

Conclusion - I'm sure a team serving approach works well somewhere. However this was bad. 

I'm sure the server who put in the drink order went about his duties. I'm sure the bartender might have gotten busy. I'm also sure that if the waiter was watching the tables he owned, he would have bugged the bartender and said, ""I need those drinks now!""  However it was obvious no one had primary ownership of my table so if there is a hiccup in the service no one sees it. Finally, it seemed to take a committee to comp those last drinks. ""Service By Committee"" was ineffective and heavy handed.",2018-01-14 07:58:15

The sauce was salty and one of the pizzas had all of the ingredient sort of thrown in the middle with no love on how it was made. The crust was thicker on the last one and did not taste at all like the usual pizzas we have been getting here since it opened. One of the owners told me nothing had changed on the making of them but we disagree. They were average at best and not at all like the previous thirty or forty pizzas we have ordered here in the past. I will give them a return visit at some point in the future but not anytime soon. There are lots of other choices out there and we need to try some of them.,2016-03-21 00:07:44

This place is one of the largest and nicely accommodated salons I've ever been in. Everyone is extremely friendly. 

However, my real reason for making the 16+ mile one way drive is Suzanne! The best gel nail tech I have found in the valley!! My nails have been wedding ready since May thanks to her beautiful work.

Through that district, I was able to navigate my way to the Eaton Centre. I later found out that it would have been SO much easier to have just gone from the street and follow Yonge street all the way down but that's neither here nor there. 

I really liked this mall. There was everything I needed in a big shopping mall like this. I found really really good deals but then again, it might just be that the US Dollar was so strong and maybe that may have had an influence on my views but nonetheless, I liked the deals here. 

I suggest not going to the upper floors as my experience was that they are retailers who deal with the more financially lucky out of us all.. unless of course you're looking for that kind of thing. What I liked most was all the Holiday decorations they had up. The giant tree and those huge deer/elk, they made the place look really magical.",2016-01-09 17:18:18

This trip I decided to changed it up and try the rare ahi steak, lightly grilled. This dish is excellent and lighter fare than I generally go for. This meant more room for dessert and having perfectly paced this evening, tonight was the night for Churros! Not just any churro, but Bobby's special churros dusted with cinnamon sugar and star anise,

Although its not my first choice of bars, I stop by from time to time to enjoy a ""well made"" (read: strong) cocktail, and catch up with buds. The best nights (my opinion) are Karaoke nites, when the place normally packs with a very diverse crowd.

A quick Yelp search brought up Sugo, so we gave it a shot. Given that it was early evening, the place was pretty dead when we arrived but by the time we were left it had picked up quite a bit! The space is gorgeous, although the floors are not exactly heel-friendly (almost took a spill walking to & from the bathroom!).

We were seated and had a very cute waiter, who I think might have been new, given the quality of service we received. The menu changes slightly everyday, which I sort of like, because everything was so fresh. What I don't like is their little disclaimer on the bottom of the menu re: splitting the bill. I completely understand that policy, but didn't like the way it was worded. Found that quite rude, and will keep that in mind for group dinners. 

We ordered a small cheese plate to start, one of which was recommended by said cute waiter, and I was very impressed because it was exactly the kind of cheese I wanted! It came with a nice side of pickled veggies (but no pickles - odd) and a little bit of duck breast. We also ordered oysters, which were good, but not the best I've had. I had the Spaghetti with Prawns & Clams and my mom had the Gnocchi with Veal Medallion. Both of our entrees were absolutely delicious! We found them to be somewhat small portions, but I was glad for that, because we were just SO full after the appies and cheese (not to mention the bread that comes with the table, mmm!).  We skipped the dessert because we were stuffed, although I wish I hadn't - seeing as how I love creme brulee - and it's mentioned in previous reviews!

It was a very nice experience, even though our waiter did tend to 'forget' about us on occasion, and it is on the pricey side. I also wasn't a big fan of the bathroom - it seems trivial but the hallway where it's located was dark and there was no signage - making for an awkward trip to the girls room.

Surprisingly, the strip or ""the city"" as we refer to it in my household (something about a small child saying 'strip' is bothersome) is only 4.2 miles long. So, if you come to Las Vegas the first thing you should do is bring some walking shoes and of course extra cash to put into the slot machines you just may hit the jackpot.

Flocks of people from all over the world come to see what can only be seen in Las Vegas, 24 hours of glittering lights, food, gambling and entertainment.

They don't call it the ""Entertainment Capital of the World"" for nothing. There's so much to see and do so let me start by sharing a short list of fun facts.
  
Did you know that out the 27 largest hotels in the world 20 of them are on the strip?
Did you know that on May 1, 1967 Elvis Presley married Priscilla at the Aladdin?
Did you know that my niece Sofia was proposed to in front of the Bellagio?
Did you know that I still have not taken the kids to the Tournament of Kings?
Did you know my mother-in-law was a stewardess in the 50's and would work the ""Champagne Flights"" into Vegas and earned bragging rights about the famous passengers she saw like Elvis and Rita Hayworth...just to name a few?
Did you know that many noteworthy celebs have tied the not on chapel strip and a few were also headliners...with the most recent being Britney but most notable Elvis and Sinatra?  

Back in the ""olden days"" the strip was famous for offering cheap dinners, free drinks and lots of glamour.  These days you will find street performers, hobos, coupon peddlers handing out ""girlie club"" flyers, $15 drinks and expensive buffets. But honestly, the entertainment and glamour has literally elevated to amazing circus acts in tanks of water, mind-boggling magic shows, world class performers, high-class cuisine and tons of luxury shopping. Not to mention all the gorgeous hotels and ""free"" entertainment like the famous Bellagio Fountains. It's no wonder people travel from all parts of the world to get a taste of ""What happens in Vegas"".

I'm not a big fan of walking the strip or taking the kids here for a stroll, I prefer to drive my guests down it to see the lights at night-but traffic is horrible. I stay away from the Bermuda Triangle...a word I coined to describe the the three big hotels on Flamingo (NY NY, the castle and MGM).  I do feel a bit safer walking from Bellagio to Cesar's but you will find hobos on those walking bridges too.  Another option is to take the tram, a double-decker bus or wait in a taxi line at a hotel. 

It's the only place where you'll see all the 20-somethings wearing a yard of Strawberry Margarita drink around their necks or groups of girls wearing matching tiaras celebrating a bachelorette party.  It's the place where every woman wears her sparkly glittering outfit that's been sitting in the closet or those outrageous high heels and mini skirts to flaunt at the hottest clubs. It's the place where you can have an Elvis Wedding.

If you love roller coasters you can ride a few and even bungee jump off one of the hotels.  Soon you'll be able to ride a giant ferris wheel.  It's the place where you can see a super star celeb performance every night you're in town.  It's the place where celebrity chefs lend their name to a restaurant in hopes of getting a five-star yelp review.

Regardless, if this is your first time, you'll want to take it all in and thankfully there are many vantage points to do so...Eiffel Tower, Stratosphere Tower, Mandarin Oriental lounge, Mandalay Bay lounge, Maggiano's, etc.  For those that want to see an aerial view of the strip you can take a helicopter ride or for a fun time ride a limo and stick your head out of the moon roof!

Whichever way you choose to see the Las Vegas strip it will be an experience like none other, especially on a night like tonight where many brave the crowds drunks and chilly weather to ring in the new year!

The steak is certainly phenomenal, but I'll leave that to the other reviewers to rave about.  I don't think the steak is the BEST in the world, but my best might not be your best.  Once you hit a certain level of goodness, it's becomes exponentially difficult to stratify what is best and what is second or third best.  

But I think I've fallen in love with our waiter that night.  If he was my waiter at every restaurant I go to, then all my yelp reviews would probably end up with an extra star.  Friendly, engaging, accommodating, caring, smart, eloquent, polite, perceptive...I've ran out of adjectives...   Too bad he's not the person who actually bring you the food or takes away your food; they were not as A+ quality.

The restaurant is beautiful and if you're lucky or special or important enough, you'll be able to get a seat at the window/balcony and watch the fountain show every 15 min.  But don't expect to get those seats if you're not  some VVVIP.   And unfortunately, being that this is in sin city, you will occasionally see diners in t-shirt and jeans...just look away and stare at the pretty decor instead...

The food is delicious (especially the pulled pork-MELTS in your mouth) and they give you very generous portions and it's inexpensive! My husband and I ate there, each had a beer and a full meal and the bill was around $20. We were both full and satisfied. 

If you plan on going there, go earlier than later.  You do have to wait by the door until a table opens up and then someone will come to you and tell you when a table is cleared off. I think that's typical of every restaurant though! Sometimes, the wait can be considerable but you can always grab a beer at the bar. That's what we do. BTW, they have a lot of really good beers, not just your typical domestics.

The corn bread is amazing. It's not heavy or dense. The sweet potato fries are 1000x better than the ones at Seven Saints (the first place I ever had them).  I already mentioned the pulled pork. You can't go wrong! 

The only downfall is that it's not a huge place.  If you have more than 4 people with you then you might have to wait quite a while because there's not that many tables but a lot of booths. If you don't have more than 4 then it usually isn't too bad and you'll get seated in a decent amount of time.

Our server handed us an iPad since they don't have actual menus. They only have a handful of items to choose from. We asked for hot tea. Instead of a tea pot and tea cups, we got drinking glasses with rust-colored hot water that tasted nothing like tea. But somebody smelled like strong BO and I tried really hard to deal.

Pepper Ribeye with Mushrooms:
Peppery ribeye chunks. This was ok. 3/5

Noodle Soup:
I was confused by this. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be ramen or Taiwanese beef noodle soup because it was a combination of both and it wasn't great. 2/5

Beef Fried Rice:
This was their saving grace. The only thing we tried that was actually decent. However, it may have MSG. If I were to compare this fried rice with other Asian restaurants' fried rice, it may not even compete. 3/5

So, today (Sunday, Mother's day week), I finally gave it a try. 

The atmosphere is nice. Unique. But what l experienced today will not make me review their food entirely. Too bad. It's more about how I felt while I was there. When the waitresses and the servers outnumbered the customers, I learned that it is potentially intimidating for customers like me. I realized I dressed differently from any other customers! Especially when it's warm outside! So, seeing a person wearing a scarf with long and fully covered outfit in this weather may be subject to examine. I'm aware of that. But, when you were eating and kept being stared almost the whole dining time, it was inconvenient! I was no longer enjoying my food, as I didn't feel good for being stared by a bunch of servers and waitresses all the time from the bar! 

I wish I could review the food more, but the way I was 'treated' just shifted it. This is not my first time to be examined like this, due to my appearance. But today is just a bit too much. The wait staff is the worst. We thanked her and were very polite only to get some rude attitude. 
The first waitress was kind though. When l asked her to move us to a brighter spot, she was very kind though she also let us know that we would be no longer her customers. They apparently have different section for each waiter/waitress. I apologized several times. The old spot was too dark and I didn't want to have meals there.
She was fine. Our next waitress was also fine. While the waitress and server were trying to serve us well, their service is overall disappointing.
I really hope my hunch was wrong. In all, I didn't feel comfortable and so sad too. I hope my appearance will not make others feel inconvenient and will not make myself a subject to stare at. 

Aside from the non-food review, I regret to say that there's nothing special with their burgers. You can go to other nearer place for better burgers.
But we did enjoy their peanut bomb! It was fun. And the peanut shooter was nice.

down at the very west end of Fremont Street; one big negative is they don't let non-hotel guests park in their garage, so you have to hoof it from an outdoor lot; the inside has obviously seen a fresh coat of paint in recent years, so it's decent enough for a downtown casino; mostly miles of slots, of course; the William Hill sports book is actually fairly modern & cool; there is a very nice outpost of Hash House a Go-Go here; also, tucked away on the 2nd floor is Oscar's, a nice steakhouse that is a living memorial to Oscar Goodman; and best of all is the deal at the Beer Garden - buy one of their tasty sausage sandwiches, and it comes with a side dish, plus a free beer, all for only 8 bucks!; best craft beer bet = it's the Beer Garden, of course; they have about 20 taps of mostly craft beer, and you get to sit outside in their nice garden area to enjoy it while listening to the hubbub of Fremont St.",2015-03-09 05:28:23

My second visit was great. I called ahead to order. The owner told me my food would be ready in 15. When I arrived he was standing up front, holding my food. I paid, and joked with him on how he was so quick to rebuttal the bad yelp reviews. He laughed, and said that he just wanted his customers/potential customers to know both sides of the story. I like that-

My food was excellent. Beef noodle soup is what I usually order from my top pho joints.. Sekong's is on par with them. I do notice slight differences between Sekong's soup, and pho. Sekong's toasted garlic gave their broth a delicious flavor. My spring roll was also delicious. My only complaint would be the sauce choice for the spring rolls. This is just personal preference though. Don't get me wrong, I like the sauce Sekong provided, but I love the hoisen/peanut sauce most Viet places serve up. Not knocking Cambodian tradition or anything :)

Note-
Last time I got the soup with all the guts in it.. I wasn't a huge fan. Maybe someday I will acquire a taste for it. The intestines were a little.. ahem.. ripe. Rightfully so, I mean, doo doo has touched those pieces of membrane in your bowl at some point.. pretty regularly too considering how the digestive system works. Usually I am into all the tripe, and tendons..even gelatinous pig blood at my spot in Tempe.. Shit, throw a knee cap in there too. Intestines just aren't for me right now.

I ordered the O&B Mac and cheese with roasted chicken and peas based on recommendation from a friend. It was really bland with tiny strips of chicken and not warm enough.

This is an exotic pet clinic meaning bring in all your reptiles, pigs, parrots, and rabbits.

Oddly enough can you guess what I brought in? A cat. Not any cat but an F2 Savannah cat so she is 25% wild. She is probably at the far end of what they will accept at the clinic. The first time I brought in my cat everyone that worked there said they had never seen a cat come into their clinic.

With that said before you bring in your dog or cat call them and see if they will accept it - we did and still amost didn't get in.

I adopted/resuced my Savannah from someone that could no longer take care of her. She is far from a lap cat and would probably rather be sitting hidden in a secret perch near the apex of my house spying on anyone that walks by than sitting on the floor. With that said she has been through two families and we had no idea what she had seen or been through. We did notice that she had some discharge coming from her mouth as to what the previous owner said was allergies. We wanted to verify this claim so we brought her in to see Dr. Todd.

Well, besides her being 25% wild she acted like she had never been to a vet. She pretty much freaked out and wreaked havoc in the examination room. The only option she left us with was to knock her out... via a blow-dart. Holy crap! Once she was out Dr. Todd got to work on her and found that she had a bad infection in her lower jaw that had rotted all her teeth out. They literally fell out when he touched them. Now she is on some antibiotics for 3 weeks to kill off her lower jaw infection.

Long story short I don't think that another vet could have done what they did there. I mean, how many vet offices do you know that have blow-darts much less have used them? Probably none. Luckily he has experience with wild cats - he used to be the doctor for that crazy guy on the Tiger Next Door documentary (check it out). Hitting a cat with a blow-dart was probably tame to what he has seen, honestly.

I've been back there twice now (initial and followup) and the second time he didn't charge me for the visit since he didn't feel there was any real benefit of taking her out of the carrier. She is eating and behaving as normal as she can so there wasn't a reason. I felt this was a good call and it was greatly appreciated that the visit didn't show up on my bill (just picked up the new lot of medicine).

On a separate note, I also like everyone there. Working with different animals seems like an awesome and rewarding experience... at least much more than sitting in a cubicle and having your superiors demand paperwork just to have them take your name off and put their name on your work.",2014-02-10 03:17:15

I love eating it at the places back home so I was excited to try this place.  They may be similar is some senses to other asian cultures but they are uniquely their own too.

Tried the Loat Cha and pork pâté sandwich. The loat Cha was a new Cambodian dish for me. Compared to other dishes I've had, I thought the flavor was just ok.  Nothing I'd get again. The noodles were fun shaped but the texture was a bit hard in the middle so not sure if that is normal or it just happened to not be cooked right that day. 
The sandwich was good. Took it to lunch the next day so it held up pretty well when you have them separate the veggies. Very similar to a banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich). 

Prices are higher than what I'm used to at home but I'm assuming ingredients aren't as easy to come by either nor is there a huge competition.  The place is nicely decorated.

This morning though I took a little detour on my way to work and jumped in to see what they had.

They have a number of baked pastries including strudels, doughnuts, croissants, cinnamon buns and cookies. Prices were $1.50 per pastry (or $8 for 6) and $0.80 per cookie. I tried a doughnut and chocolate croissant, and while both were OK, but they didn't stand out from what you could get at any other bakery, or even your local supermarket. They weren't bad though. To be fair, I don't have a toaster oven at work to heat up the croissant. 

They sold pies for $7, but when asked when they were baked they said last Wed or Thurs, so I didn't pick one up. the lady said they usually bake them once a week.  I wouldn't be surprised if they did that with a lot of their pastries and baked goods. 

They had some buns as well that looked alright, and sold delis and meats as well.  Nothing looked especially good, pretty standard fare.

You get a free pound cake if you spend more then $30 at the bakery. (while quantities last).

So to sum up, if you live in the area it's not a bad bakery and you'd get fresher food than the Food Basics that is in the same plaza, but the prices are average for a bakery or supermarket. You may want to ask when they make a fresh batch of baked goods so you can time it and get freshly baked goods.",2011-02-22 16:44:52

The second time was still pleasant but had some misses. Stick to their seafood share-ables and you should be good for the most part! 

Highlights (In order)
1) Tuna Pizza - Usually not a fan of sushi pizza but this is just so amazing. Delicate and unique flavours - A must try!
2) Truffle 'Bomb' Croquette - This is really THE BOMB. That potato sauce makes you tempted to lick off the plate. It comes in three's, the awkward moment when you decide who gets the last one. 
3) Hot Mess - Sashimi Poke in a Sushi - If you're feeling like a roll this is it!
4) AB Tuna Tacos - It's just so good. Enough said. 
5) Salmon Tataki - Sliced seared salmon, it's simple but perfectly flavoured
6) Kimchi & Bacon Fried Rice - Another simple dish but executed perfectly and just delicious

Do not recommend (Ordered from the worse) 
1) Toban Filet Mignon - Big miss! It's served on a sizzling skillet with a lid on top and they will open it in front of you for a smoky show. The meat was missing the grilled charred element and tasted like it was steamed from being under the lid. The worst and really nothing special. I've had better for way less than $39. [waiter recommended it over the lamb we were thinking of ordering]
2) Brother from another Mother - The sushi is too rich from the combination of foie gras and having the sushi sit on a puddle of creamy sauce. It makes it too heavy...  
3) Dessert, in general, is not their forte - I didn't like their Black Sesame Cheese Cake - Lack sesame flavour but looks like a work of art! Matcha-mousse cake and the apple dessert was probably better of the ones I've tried but not worth $12.

A place like this you can expect consistent top-notch service, they will take your coats as you walk in. Our waitress was stylish with nice nails - matte grey with gold accents (love that combo, couldn't help but notice) and the waiter we had the second time was very friendly/personable. We reserved for a birthday, and our server even provided a pick from the dessert menu on the house. 

The first time experience was 5, second time was 3, so averages out to 4 star. It wasn't hard to get a table on a prime time and on weekends so that's a major plus.

My absolute favorite salad in the Valley is the RW&B gorgonzola walnut salad.  When I first started ordering it - it was COVERED in gorgonzola, walnuts and onions.  You could not see the greens below all of the toppings - YUMMY !!  However, over the years I have watched this salad dwindle into a pathetic wimpy option that isn't worth the $$ you pay for it.  Remember, this salad doesn't have a protein - the meat of it is the gorgonzola and the walnuts which have decreased to a splash of ingredients.  To the OWNER of RW&B - if the prices of gorgonzola, walnuts & onions have raised that much over the years - I suggest you raise the price of the salad and not reduce the quality of the salad.
Needless to say, I won't be ordering the salad any longer and since that is the ONLY thing I order from there I won't be patronizing the restaurant any longer.   Which is soooo sad because I love that salad & there are not many restaurant options in my area - shame on RW&B !!",2018-09-07 20:00:57

I stopped in the other day to pick up a DVD and was really impressed by the friendly service. Though the shop itself isn't terribly large, they still stock a wide selection of hard-to-find and obscure titles, particularly horror and cult films. And speaking of obscure, if you still have a working VCR they also have a pretty robust collection of videotapes too. 

The rental is cheap ($3.50) and while I was in there they were giving one of their regulars a break over late fees. I like that. That said, do make sure to read their list of ""top five lamest excuses"" for returning a movie late. I enjoy any store that uses humor to make the point: don't be a jerkface.

I also love street fairs that bring together a ton of local vendors to sell their products (especially things like marinated olives, the best!). However, I feel like the Market at MacLeod tries to do both of these things and instead of doing one well, I feel like they do both just ok. 

Don't get me wrong, you will find some produce and some great local products. However, I feel like the presence of one somehow detracts from the other. For instance, there were a ton of food stalls but the actual market part (with you know, fresh fruits and veggies) was super limited. Plus, I feel like if the whole was to have a robust food court, the vegetarian/vegan options were also incredibly limited. That seems counterintuitive to me. 

The vendors present, though, had quality ingredients/products but the prices were super high and like I said, the selection was pretty limited.

This branch is convenient for us as it is only about 20 min away from our house. We also were pretty happy with the service and the food the first time, we decided to come back. 

During those two visits, we ordered pretty much the same thing with small changes. We ordered a catfish basket the first time and tried the cod fish basket the second time. The catfish basket was definitely our favorite in comparison to the Cod. We felt that the cod was not seasoned well and was lacking salt in particular which brings me to a very good point, why is there no salt shakers on any of the tables?? 

We also ordered shrimps. In both times, we chose the trifecta sauce, mild, but the second time, they were flexible and accepted to offer that to us with the shrimp boil as I am trying to avoid dairy (the regular sauce is a butter based sauce). Between the two, really, butter is better! We also always order corn. It also tasted better when it was in the butter trifecta sauce. 

This time, my husband decided to try their Angry Edamame. I didn't try any but my husband said they basically use the trifecta sauce on it and he said it was pretty good. 

My absolute favorite order here is their fried calamari. It is always crispy, fresh and seasoned perfectly. We always enjoy it very much. 

Our server in both times was Lita! She is very attentive and is always close to her tables without being annoying. Her service was excellent! 

I always say to myself that I will order trifecta with extra garlic the next time and I keep forgetting. One thing I love about a competing restaurant is the punchy flavor that is always spot on. At Angry Crab Shack, the food is good but it just needs that extra kick (not heat) to hit the mark perfectly.

I substituted the rice for fries (because honestly, I'm middle eastern and I'm tired of eating rice haha).

I mean maybe its the setting that throws me off because if you were to go to cheesecake factory it would probably be the same cost if not more. Maybe because it is a smaller restaurant, I was expecting cheaper prices. Regardless, the flavor of the food along with its freshness had me happy so no worries there. And that garlic sauce!!!

We were offered the $13.95 all you can eat menu, but it didn't include the seafood. I wanted to try everything so we went with the $44.95 dinner for two.  

How often do you find a place that provides 5 star food with a great price? In addition, the service was some of the best I've experienced.  Our drinks were always full and the entire staff somehow served us simultaneously without any hovering.  We barely knew they were there.  

We had Bulgogi, Galbi, salmon, chicken, pork, scallops and shrimp.  Everything was great, perfectly marinated, tasty goodness! My favourites were the Bulgogi and shrimp.  

Banchan, the little appetizers that are brought out at the beginning really added to the experience.  The sprouts with peanut oil were the delicious, and seeing that we'd eaten everything they brought out another round.  I've never seen that before.

The restaurant is enormous with even more seating downstairs.  The decor is stylish and hip, very untypical of most Korean restaurants with nary a Hite beer poster to be found.

We were promptly seated, then greeted by a young man who brought us breads. Three kinds to be exact, a jalapeno, a raisin loaf and roasted corn muffins. They were all okay, non blew me away. The jalapeno bread was still a bit warm which was nice. The cocktail menu had 5 signature Chef Flay inventions that all looked like liquid dreams. Seriously yummy concoctions with obvious though and effort. There was an ample wine selection, like 22 pages of vino separated into categories by grape, not region. With that many wines, I often prefer it this way. Mesa Grill is a true Tex Mex establishment, and being such they had an entire menu for tequila and margaritas... 22 tequilas broken down into 5 separate categories!! Wow, can you say fun with a lime in your mouth?!  

I ordered the pork sandwich and it came with a side of fries. The pork was well seasoned and juicy, the baguette crispy and soft and of course there was a ton of sauce that was infused with the smokey heat of Ancho Chili peppers that Flay has built an empire on! Oh and the herb spiced fries were quite tasty as well. So why only 3 stars? Honestly, it was A-OK, the food excellent and tasty, the service phenomenal, but there just wasn't any atmosphere...

There is some excellent talent with the show.  Generally the singing is very well done.   Standouts were Sheriff Dodd, Miss Mona, and Jewel.  The singing and dancing by the ensemble is also good.  A standout in the dancing was that done by the Aggies when they pay their annual visit to the Chicken Ranch.

There are some problems with the show: 

The showroom's stage was not designed for a Broadway musical and the scenery is very sparse--a staircase to the girls' rooms, here merely a landing--a chair, and a love seat.  At one point, there's a desk but that's the only major change in scenery during the entire show.  It would be difficult to do more than this.

Given the limitation imposed by the stage, when the crusading journalist first broadcasts, it's in front of the gold stage curtain.  Since he's supposed to be at the state capitol building, couldn't a generic capitol building been projected onto the curtain to at least make an effort at reality?

The sound was an issue tonight.  At one point, many of the wireless mics failed.  It was especially important because the governor was making his appearance and his mic didn't work.  When he launched into his song, one of the cast members gave him a hand mic which didn't work at first either.  Another issue with the  mics was that some of the cast, when they punctuated their words, there was a sound from the mics that detracted from what they said.  This is an issue which the previews should solve as the cast and crew iron out the problems.  I had some quibbles with the lighting but it was generally OK.

Finally, why did the woman who works with the photo concession have to go down the steps to the front tables three or four times during the show?  Apparently she was delivering photos, but it was distracting, unnecessary, and rude to the artists on stage who are working to provide a good show for the audience.  The photos can wait until after the show.

I will come back and see this show in a few weeks and I hope I'll be able to raise the rating.  I have seen some of the cast in other shows in Las Vegas and they need to have microphones that work, consistent lighting, and respect from the other workers at the showroom, i.e., photo person!",2012-04-03 04:49:27

Joel Robuchon was at the top of my long-term bookmark list, and he told me to make a reservation.

We missed out on the golden limo by one month as that service was discontinued - bummer!  We were seated in a corner booth, with a deep purple hue.  The restaurant is very intimate and from our corner we could see everything, including the private room through the window with a living wall.

We had several servers, one for drinks and desserts, one for taking our order, and one for breads and savory dishes.  We learned that most of the staff has worked there for over a decade together as a team.  I had a glass of Veuve Cliquot Brut and Eric R. had off-dry Riesling Kabinett.

Eric R and I opted for the menu that included a choice of appetizer and entree, and also included the amuse bouche, bread cart, and mignardises cart.  We tried several breads accompanied with the whipped butter and sea salt and Spanish olive oil.  I tried the saffron brioche, olive baguette, and gruyere roll to start.  The amuse bouche was a strawberry gazpacho with sheep's milk cheese, balsamic and pistachio.  It was very refreshing.

For appetizers, Eric R got the caviar atop salmon tartare with saffron and coriander crisps (for a supplement).  I began with the sea urchin and langoustine medallions in seaweed gelee and pureed cauliflower.  For entree, Eric R. ordered the roasted lobster with morels and asparagus in shellfish jus, and I got the caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy and freeze-dried lobster roe.  The entrees were accompanied by Robuchon's supposedly famous whipped potatoes.  Now I like potatoes but Eric R. doesn't.  We both tried them and both agreed they tasted like paste, that you may tile a floor with perhaps?  It was really a weird consistency and flavor, so that was yucky...at least that just came with the meal and wasn't our choice.

For dessert, we went wild on the mignardises cart.  I had yuzu truffle, pecan dark chocolate, coconut eclair, hazelnut macaron, and lemon meringue.  Eric R. got blackberry opera cake pecan dark chocolate, strawberry pistachio tart, strawberry margarita gelee, blueberry white chocolate cake, and a made-to-order mini creme brulee.

We finished the meal with a pot of gyokuro green tea.  It was a wonderful experience in a beautiful ambiance.  At the end of our experience, I was given a lemon pound cake as a parting gift.  I think it is a great place for a special occasion.",2015-05-18 23:07:39

Because there are kids, you probably shouldn't try to get tanked here, but they don't create a distraction or prevent adults from having a good time. There's a solid variety of games for all tastes.

The food is equal to above average bar food, which is fine by my standards. The real reason for ordering food is so I can get the Dine & Play combo, the best deal by far. The combo lets you get certain entrees plus a one hour ($15.99) or two hour ($21.99) game card. I'd pay those prices merely for the card, so throwing in an entree on top makes the combo a great deal. It's much cheaper than paying the cash rate. The game card doesn't let you earn tickets, but you can still play most of the ticket games without earning. I don't care about winning a stuffed bear, so that's not a problem.

My suggestion for students is to look around online and at the bookstores and see which options bet suits you whether you need to rent or buy.

The staff are pleasant and about every time I come someone approaches me if I need help locating my book. Aside from the books I also come here for my rebel gear.

My family loves this place and, although their palettes are less sophisticated than my own, I admit I got the crappiest dish at the table. I ordered the cioppino because....well, I LOVE cioppino. This one sucked. Seriously, it sucked. The broth was thin and flavorless and, most strangely, it had a really strange color. When I pointed it out to my mom, she comfortingly said, ""Yeah, I'd be afraid to eat it."" For whatever reason, I wasn't, and I did eat it but the quality of the seafood was pretty low and dish was severely lacking overall.

That being said, the bloody mary I had was pretty good and they make a good cosmopolitan. The salmon cakes, fried scallop, mixed grains, and ahi steak I tried were all pretty tasty. I also enjoyed my walnut salad though it really could've stood to have apple/pear/cranberry or some sort of fruit. The salad dressing was acceptable but not delicious. The fresh bread they serve before the meal was very tasty and I approve of the sauce assortment adorning each table.

Number one: There was no food poisoning and no mistake in my orders! So i hope this kind of kill the other that gave ridiculous small marks.  IMO if you say on a public thread you got food poisoning from a restaurant maybe there is something else to it: Like taking too much alcohol, having the flu, being sick from something else, anyway!

Yesterday was one of my new struggle when i decide on Japanese food but new place versus one tried more than once ...Imadake won. First, the Decor kind of remind me of M:BGR second of all, I kind of stuck comparing meal with Kazu which is their competition who has been on open for a long time and has a way smaller place than imadake. So without going into deep description, i will say that this place scores the same as Kazu and the only true difference would be physical ( larger place).  I think this place doesn't have much mistakes. Most staff are polyglote (speaks more than 2 languages which is a big plus compare to Kazu where some staff might not be fluent in french).  But at the end of the day, if you were to ask me where will you go next time Kazu or Imadake: I might say Imadake because I will not wait! Kazu is overpacted and you now need to get there at least 20 minutes before opening and right now it's cold outside.

Ok Ok, I think i will have to make this review a comparaison between Kazu and Imadake after all!
Well food wise, it's really similar presentation execution and taste. The upper side might go to Imadake in term of booze! They have sake that i have never saw at Kazu
IMO the Okonomiyaki is a bit better at Kazu because they had a nice salad to the meal but Pancake VS Pancake it's equal! Imadake serve it more classical.
They are missing one item on their menu: Onigiri rice balls. Kazu win that one!
On the other side, i would argue that they have a slightly larger menu and the booze got all to do with it! 

If you want to try it, i would suggest you to buy everything you can humanly eat and share it with a friend. It pretty much reduce the price of the bill and you end up trying so many things! it's really fun.

Imadake me fait penser à M:BRG comme décor, dans le genre branché, clean, pas trop sérieux avec des murs en tableau noir d'école. Je m'étais dit que j'n'allais pas faire de cette critique une comparaison entre Kazu et Imadake, mais j'abandonne. C'est vraiment semblable, c'est simplement plus gros chez Imadake ce qui se résulte en moins d'attente avant de pouvoir manger.

La différence des deux dans le menu c'est quelques trucs. Imadake ont quelque trucs que Kazu n'ont pas. En revanche, Kazu ont des (boule de riz collante assaisonnée) Onigiri et pas Imadake et Imadake ont beaucoup de choix d'alcool et peu chez KAzu. C'est comme comparé des jumeaux non-identique. Ils sont pas mal semblable mais pas pareil. Je donnais la partie pour la crêpe japonaise (Okonomiyaki) à Kazu à cause de l'ajout d'une salade et d'une vinaigrette légèrement acide plus relevé. La Crêpe chez Imadake vient plus neutre, seule, sans accompagnement sans l'assiette: présentation plus traditionnelle. 

J'ai une prédiction pour les Nihon Bar (Pub Japonais) à Montréal et c'est que ça va explosé en nombre dans 10 ans!  C'est une cuisine hyper accessible au occidentaux et c'est de la bouffe pour la classe moyenne: bref, c'est pas cher, sans prétention et sans ôté à la complexité des saveurs et la «pureté» de la façon de traité les aliments en cuisine japonaise, le Nihon Bar c'est la nouvelle affaire qui gagne à grossir en nombre à Montréal car Imadake nous prouve qu'ils sont compétitif à Kazu et ont un avenir prometteur devant eux.",2011-12-04 18:16:08

Over the years, I've eaten at other O&B chain restaurants and I come away with less than stellar impressions of their food. I feel that it's never great or fantastic, it's just always OK. But Bannock is different.  

I came here for lunch with my new team members. It was a celebratory ""get-to-know-you"" lunch as I just joined the team. 

Firstly, the atmosphere at Bannock is reminiscent to a log cabin, a fancy log cabin that is. I liked how you can either sit down and to eat in the dining area or be in the café area, but the look and feel of the place remains the same. 

We were intrigued by what ""Canadian Comfort Food"" was and Bannock's version of what comfort food was impressed us.

We ordered as a lark the Salt Cod donuts ($(9) for the appetizer. The flavours were  a nice touch of not being too fishy or salty, or too doughy.  For the main, I ordered the St. Canut Pulled Pork Tourtiere ($16), a small version of a traditional tourtiere served with roots vegetables like beets, parsnips, turnips and ginger root. The way they make the dish is different: the pulled pork is cooked and then ground to be added to the tourtiere. It was a dish I really enjoyed. 

For dessert,  we had the Warm S'mores Pie ($8) and the Canoe Firewood Butter Tart ($8), the latter being an instant favourite. Pricey, yes, but it's bigger than you're normal size. It's sweet but not as sweet or chemical-tasting than other butter tarts you eat. It's very unique tasting and one to try whenever you're there. 

I tried to buy a tart on my way home but sadly, they were sold out. It's not surprising that it's one of Bannock's most popular treats.",2012-02-05 19:31:36

They have a huge chalkboard with all of their options as well as printed lists for those of us who are vision challenged when we forget our glasses.

They will gladly sell you a new growler of several different types or you can bring your own growler as long as it is clean.

The staff was super friendly and is interested in any beers you might like to see.

I ended up taking home a 32 oz growler of Deviant Dales from Oskar Blues in Brevard but usually I like to have a pint or so of a beer before I take it home in growler form so unless they have something that is in high demand that I cannot get elsewhere, I am not sure how much I will visit this store.",2014-07-16 13:15:17

Let me start with the good.  The interior is gorgeous - they did a great job making this a classy and comfortable place to dine.  The music was perfect for the setting - a combination of big band/jazz music on the night we visited.  (The volume could have been turned down a bit, though.)  Seating was far enough apart from your neighbor that you could have a private meal.

However, prices for some of the items are quite high.  My hubby loves meat and cheese trays, and very few restaurants offer them in CLT.  Port City offers separate trays for meat and cheese--at $12 each for three meats or three cheeses--and you have to take what's available that day.  While they tasted good, we feel they were overpriced in comparison to other restaurants with similar offerings.  Vivace, for example, offers a ""pick six"" for $13 and ""pick eight"" for $15, and you can choose from both the meats and cheeses.  We paid almost double at Port City!  I suggest that the chef reevaluate these trays and make some changes to be competitive.

But to be fair, some of their other items are well-priced.  I had the shrimp and lobster rolls for $12.  They were served slider-style, with three per serving.  I absolutely loved them!  They had little to no filling other than the seafood, and the dressing was light and tasty.  I chose the potato salad as the side, which was also good.

My hubby had a sandwich that was about the same price as mine.  He chose the greens as his side, and he enjoyed both.

Our server was initially a little annoying, as she proclaimed it might be hard for us to choose because the menu is so big.  Come on - the menu barely fills three pages!  She also disappeared for 15 minutes at the end when we were waiting for our check.  I hope we get someone different the next time.  And there will be a next time...we just won't get the meat/cheese trays again!",2013-11-01 20:20:51

I didn't make it very far without sneaking a bite, and in the future I'll know not to press my luck and just enjoy my food with the others parked out front.

There are definitely no frills here, I walked in the doors to a long counter with a woman standing behind it, a series of reach-in coolers behind her filled with assorted jamaican drinks amoung other things I didn't catch, and a fairly open kitchen with a stove, a steam table, a warmer, and some equipment around the corner I couldn't see. As noted in another review it was (refreshingly) very clean. The menu is posted on the window as you walk in, along the wall on the inside, and also on a chalk board inside. I don't know if the chalkboard changes at all, but it seemed to have the same items on it as the printed menus.

I was a little torn by the options: red snapper, oxtail, curry, a stew, goat, jerk chicken... but I went with the jerk chicken. And then comes the decision on the sides... mac n cheese, cabbage, more rice n beans, greens.. I went with cabbage. A small plate is a whole to go container of rice & beans, chicken, and cabbage - so I have no idea what kind of food you get in a large plate. The desserts sounded fantastic, I almost got a rum cake but stopped myself. (That was the one moment I was happy I couldn't sit down and eat, because I knew if I had more time to debate with myself the rum cake would have been purchased.) My small plate and a ting came to around $11. Not bad. 

After I ordered, the box was assembled as I stood there, everything either sitting hot on the stove or warm in the steam table. I was a little surprised as she flashed the filled container to me in approval before she shut it, but looking back it was nice touch to be able to check my order right there instead of getting to my car (or home) and being disappointed. I got to my car and noticed a few others eating, took a few bites myself, and then continued home. (windows down, windows up made it too tempting to nosh at every stop light)

The jerk was really nice, very mild and sweet. I almost wished it had a little bit more heat to it, but very good. The cabbage was a little on the salty side but once you start mixing it in with the perfectly cooked rice and beans it all evens out. 

I definitely want to try a few other items on the menu, and if they are anywhere near the caliber of the jerk, I know I'll be very happy with them as well.",2011-02-28 22:38:02

Service
The first disappointment was waiting.  We had a reservation and even so I can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  However, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  Our ""leader"" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  That didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of ""oh, I'm sorry I thought they came and got you.""

Maybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  However, things didn't get better from there.  It seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  Easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  It just felt like everything was so slow.  After the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  I mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  I think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.

If you look at the prices at Mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  We got none of that.  I would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  You aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are ""good"".  We asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like ""what do you mean""?  I mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  There is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks....""oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled""....thanks.

This was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  During the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.

I will say that the food was good.  The steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  Usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  The asparagus was nothing special.  The lobster mashed potatoes were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  Crab gnocchi was good, but I'm not crazy about gnocchi so I'm not an expert.  The problem in Vegas is that you can find a place equal to Mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.

Needless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  With so many other options in town for steak I probably wouldn't come back for that.  I will say I tried the ahi tuna sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  I didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  I would come back if I was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better.",2013-06-28 19:27:11

This is because, unlike most other Korean foods, these dishes are very difficult to replicate at home.  Many good cooks can whip up a good dwenjang jjigae, ddukbokki, or jun, and even more can fire up a kbbq or jungol on their portable gas grill that every Korean family owns.  But trying to perfect the sauces that are the catalysts for these two noodles so that they taste just like the ones from the old country, that is a monumental challenge.  For this reason, jajangmyun restaurants that make great sauces are known by every Korean in that community.  In Vegas, apparently there is Island Style.

I guess to non-Koreans this is a Hawaiian place?  But in the Korean community, this place is known as Baek Li Hyang, a Korean-Chinese restaurant that serves up Jajangmyun, jamppong, and tang soo yook (sweet & sour pork, Korean style).  They also have other Korean dishes, one of which I noticed is the beef jun.  We were here specifically for the noodles, and thus ordered a dish of each.  Expectations were high because we heard consistently that this is the best Chinese noodle restaurant in the valley.  As a result, disappointment was also high as we realized that it was not going to meet those expectations.

First the good.  Jamppong is pretty good.  The soup has that requisite taste required, and the ingredients were ample with fresh and plump seafood pieces.  The deep red color is accompanied by an equally deep taste, although not quite as spicy as it appears.  Now the mediocre.  The noodle on both dishes were just okay, not as firm and chewy as it should be indicating it's not handmade.  Take note, noodles are a big differentiator in these two dishes.  When they are not proper, it will ""tire out"" the dish.  This will result in the symptom where you will initially like it, but then find yourself not finishing the dish.  It was such here.  The bad is the jajang sauce.  It was too sweet, and did not possess that distinct taste required to qualify as good jajangmyun.  The combination of that sauce with the noodles made it at best an okay dish.  

The bare set up did nothing to enhance the experience, but the servers were pleasant.  While the Korean-Chinese dishes we had were only mediocre, I'm wondering if there is something that they to well since the place was decently busy.  Maybe I will give it another go on some of the other dishes... But based on what we had, I can't do any better than 3 stars.

I was about to panic until my little brain realized I was 2 minutes from Pac-East!  She was a beginner with the sushi thing, so I got California, Shrimp and avocado, Alaska and spicy salmon.  She liked all of them. And for good reason, great rice, good portion of fish and we got to scarf them down at the house!

I really like this place, super consistent, good service, good value, and bitchin fish! This is my favorite sushi joint in the 216 not named Ginko! This is my go to place!

That said i found myself near austins and decided i would try it once and for all. My first recommendation to you is to stay away from the jerk chicken. While im sure its fine, their method is inauthentic, they just bake chicken and throw a jerk sauce on it, you can do this at home. A proper jerk chicken is actually ""jerked"" whereby its marinated and slow cooked, smoked and or bbqd. I opted for the oxtail instead, and boy was i impressed. To the largely whitey  audience on yelp, you need not be afraid by oxtail or its cousin curry goat, they are both delicious cuts of meat and mostly are raised locally (my friend in town farms goats). Oxtail was succulent, saucy, not too spicy, and braised just right. Beans and rice was perfect and even the collard greens were good. Extra point for having Ting, which is Jamaicas sprite. 

Definitely will return. They are even pretty friendly, which is unique for carribean spots.

Past that, though, there really was not much that I could enjoy about the place.

MENU: They have the random assortment of food that most BBQ places seem to have. Salad, burgers, and pretty much everything that no one goes to a BBQ place to eat, But hey, I guess people sometimes accidentally wander into here and forget it's a BBQ place.

FOOD: I got the pork, mac and cheese, and BBQ slaw. Hush puppies are served on the side. The pork was moist, but had no smokey flavor...or any flavor of any kind. They could have prepared this in the oven for all I know. The mac and cheese tasted good, but lacked any kind of originality whatsoever. Throw some bacon on it. Top it with some herbs. Use a unique cheese. Do something, anything to separate it from the stuff from the box. The BBQ slaw was good, but I was expecting a red slaw, not a yellow one, which is more traditional to NC.

SERVICE: If there is one thing that I hate, it's greedy management that cannot be bothered to hire enough waitstaff to tend to customers. As the customer, I should not have to wait for a refill, to get my bill, or to order just because management has decided to under-staff their restaurant. The server herself was actually fairly decent, though, towards the end she decided it was more important to talk to one of her friends who was dining there than it was to bring us our bill. She did come running over to make sure that she was tipped after I left some cash and left.

The juke box is blaring classic rock at just a little too loud of volume (with no dance floor), a solo folk guitarist is setting up for a Saturday night performance, the beer selection was mostly domestics with very few craft beers to choose from and the cigarette smell hits you in the face as soon as you walk in. Am I in a ritz gone wild joint?

The service is a study in contrast as well.  My girlfriend and I were greeted almost immediately with a smile. We promptly got drinks and a menu then were left as if forgotten for about a half hour till the bar maid remember to come over to cheerfully take our order.  About another thirty minutes passed until the food came.

The menu itself doesn't appear to be able to make up its mind what kind of establishment this is. You can get steak, ribs, pasta, chicken, seafood, etc . ranging in price between $18 to $28.  Or you can get your standard burger, hoagie or sandwich for under $10

I ordered the chicken parm and spaghetti and my date ordered a half slab of ribs with red skinned mashed potatoes. I must admit though that the food was delicious!

- green tea with red bean - my second fave!
- mango - good but I think it could have a bit more mango punch

- rose - could use a bit more rose, but not too much to the point that it taste like soap

Right off the bat, the waiter who yelled at me ""YES???"" when I walked in was, I assuming, his way of asking me if I had reservations. We did and he asked if my friends were at the empty table. Um empty?  He then grunted and wagged his finger in a ""come here motion"" to what I, again, was to assume was his way of saying ""come and sit at your table."" 

When the rice rolls arrived, my friends asked for warm soy sauce (the ones that always accompanies these kinds of dishes and comes in small soy sauce bowls), the waiter pointed to a small bottle already on the table saying ""soy sauce"". My friends again asked for warm soy sauce in the little bowls, and the waiter again pointed towards the bottle on the table ""Soy Sauce"". This exchange went on for a bit, but each time the waiter's voice got louder ""SOY SAUCE!!"" and his eyebrows got angrier. My friends just left it and spoke to the manager. Again, she pointed towards the bottle on the table, but this time around, she actually explained to us that since everyone orders the rice rolls, they no longer serve the soy sauce with the dish each time. They just put the soy sauce bottle on the table permanently.

Tea pot always unfilled. Trash on the table never cleared. Waiter attitudes (the ones we encountered) are atrocious.

Food? Can't even say that makes up for anything and has not improved since the last time I came here: dumpling and Har Gow skin still thick and dry. Egg tart very dry. Peking duck was such a sorry excuse for a Peking duck: sparse pieces of dried meat. The second dish came on top of crispy wonton noodles (to make up for the lack luster amount of duck meat) and mixed into the already lack-luster amount of meat was rice...as filler. A complete scam.

And yet for Sunday dim sum, this place was incredibly packed. Like table-waiting busy. Reading other reviews, I am relieved (in a way) that the horrendous service was not experienced by just me. (It's not personal...yeah!) It appears to hit other customers as well.

I get that in this immediate area, this is the only Dim Sum place...but really, if you want ""Chinatown"" food and service with ""Chinatown"" prices, then don't come here because what you get is really bad ""Chinatown"" food and service at ""Four Seasons"" prices. If you were planning to spend money at Kwan, than I would highly recommend you to spend it elsewhere like Lai Wah Heen (my fave) or as other reviewers mention (and my friends included) Crown Princess at Bay for incredible food.

Back when they started there was quality wine, small venue, quality music, quality location.  Today they have inflated prices, average to below average wine, music that does not match with wine crowd (actually really bad music), large venues, everything costs extra, etc.   It is obvious that the founders are chasing the dollar and their venture is at an end.

My husband and I both agreed that the eye exam was one of the most thorough we've ever had.  He checked everything, far, close, reading, computer, light, dark, etc.  Then gave many lens and power options.  The eye exam was $68 each.

I ended up chosing a no line bifocal for reading reports and computer use.  and for my free pair a straight reading pair. 

My husband got a no line bifocal for distance and reading and a Calvin Klein distance sunglass for driving.

I've never minded waiting for him...because he's a great doctor, listens to ALL my questions and concerns, and is NEVER rushed with me.

However, I called Friday morning, with an emergency with my IUD and I needed to be seen. They got me in on Monday, July 1st, but it wasn't going to be with Dr. Torres.

Monday comes, and I show up at 850, because I couldn't remember if my appointment was at 9, or 915... better to show up early anyways, right?

I was told by the ladies that I was seeing a ""Connie"".

 I had my daughter with me, and my guy showed up about 930. An hour goes by, and they come get me around 1030 to weigh me, take a urine sample and my blood pressure. The nurse told me that they were just ""waiting for a room"" and that it shouldn't be much longer.

Well, another hour goes by, which means that we had been sitting for two hours, and no doctor has seen me. I finally get called back, and the nurse asks me ""what I am here for "". I tell her that I am not sure, that the scheduler did not tell me what I would be doing.

She tells me to undress from the waist down. 

Ten minutes go by, and I have lost my patience. What the EFF is the point of having an appointment and being seen two hours later? I had other things to do that day, and my guy had to get back to work. 

I put my pants back on, and we are leaving when this ""connie"" who in all the years I have been coming, have never seen. She asked my why I was here today, and I told her. She felt the need to question that. And then she asked what I was suppose to be ""had done"" today as well.

REALLY? 
You and your nurse are going to have me take my pants off and you don't even know what you are doing to me?

No checkout paper was given to me. Only a paper for blood work.

I now have a $43 bill.
I have never paid more than $20 for a copay here.

But I'm rating it on whether or not they deserve an excellent rating for what category of restaurant/food service they intend to deliver based on price per meal, the type of food served etc.

They get 5 stars for the following:
- good customer service
- consistent food quality and taste 
-freshness of food served
- cleanliness of restaurant 

Smiles at every turn...yeah they were fast but never rude. And if they were ever less than friendly - it's a fast food place with 8 dollar plates...if you want to build a relationship with someone - I'm more concerned for you and why you'd want to do this at a fast food place?!?

Food tastes just like the mall, just like the other stand alone restaurants and is consistent with what they promise...fast, fresh, Americanized Chinese food. Better than a burger or burrito most days and makes you feel like you are at least making an effort to not eat crap everyday.

I was impressed with the transparency of the veggie fridge and the cooks in the back...high fired woks and chefs preparing very nearly as they probably do in higher dollar restaurants. If you have a hankering for Chinese, Panda Express is always a quick fix with satisfying results...this location is no exception.

It is Korean owned, managed and the sushi chefs are all Korean, too.
They spent quite a bit on decor, and it reminds me a bit like a Scottsdale type establishment in decor, but considerably cheaper food than your RA's or Sapporo in upscale Snotsdale. 

It is large, with a Z shaped sushi bar with a high counter. Jay is the main sushi chef, Jason the second, and although he is middle aged Korean, he learned the trade in Cambridge, MA from an older Japanese chef. He has also plied his trade in Irvine, La Canada and Santa Barbara, CA before coming out to Goodyear. This is the only Japanese restaurants in this neck of the valley. 

The bar area has large red paper lanterns, and you can order sushi while guzzling your favorite adult beverage. In the dining area, the sushi bar is decorated with bamboo covered lanterns. The surfaces are of solid heavy materials. A copper 3/4 moon platter designates each sushi bar seat. 

As is typical of a made-for-Americans-Korean-owned Japanese sushi bar, you order off the check list menu, which is handed to the chef. Jay served my nigiri selctions in rectangular platers of heavy ceramic. The dishware was modern and esthetically attractive. The sushi was OK for Goodyear, but certainly not to major coastal city standards. The prices were perhaps a tiny bit high, perhaps to pay for the decor.

The dining area has 3 plasma TVs: 2 showing sports, and the center one running a commercial for Tomo itself, with names and pictures of Chefs, and colorful pix of some of their signature appetizers (i.e. baked green mussels) and sushi rolls (the regulars plus others)

It is funny, even though I could pass for a Mexican Terrorist, they were initially suspicious of me, like I was scoping the place out to open a competitive restaurant in the area. Maybe because I only ordered nigiri. They relaxed after I kept reassuring them. 

You are served miso shiro right away and a crispy salad after that, included. They charge for green tea, though, $1.95! But then, the couple to the left and right of me both drank large sodas with their sushi! Maybe with Safeway sushi, but dining out? Well, it is Goodyear AZ after all, not known for its restaurants or epicurean elite. 

Service was excellent on this slower Monday, with at least 2 waitresses checking on me constantly. Beerand cold sake bottles are served in wooden bowls filled with shaved ice ...nice touch. 

For Goodyear, this is a good choice. It is clean, pleasant, with nice decor and ok sushi. They also offer other Japanese dishes.",2008-06-03 05:28:54

Service: They are very knowledgeable with the supplement world and very friendly.   Again, at checkout they provide free samples of usually either protein, BCAA or pre-workout, fantastic.

Inventory: Like a kid in a Candy store, I can sit there all day and just read products and research stuff all day.  However, the good thing is I just roll in there and pick up what I need.

Here's my favorite part about this location, they have RTD/Ready to drink bottles chilled in their refrigerators in the back.

The hummus, is amazing too. I typically get the hummus trio, it's got a little of everything that I want. The pickled beets, mmmm! The green hummus is a mix of scallions and parsley and it's become my favorite fast! 

The Vegetarian platter is a delicious mix of everything a vegetarian would want. Delicious hummus, stuffed grape leaves and falafel. So good.

I buy plenty of those 99 cent frisbees and tennis balls as my dogs/hyenas chew threw them like al-dente pasta.

Expecting the typical Mexican restaurant with the typical wooden booths and plastic covered seats, I was surprised to find the interior was actually really nice. I was even more surprised to find the menu prices weren't as nice. Looking to spend no more than $7 on some tacos and rice and beans, I wasn't thrilled when I saw entrees for $12-$15.

Luckily they have a killer (but limited) lunch menu for $5.95. To your table in 30 minutes or less or it's free. Of course, it came out in less than 14 minutes. And it was pretty good. I should have asked for soft tacos instead of hard but the meat was good and the toppings were decent. The salsa was odd though. I'm used to thick and chunky but this salsa reminded me of pasta sauce and that was odd but I ate it.",2012-09-17 22:38:39

I've been here a number of times, but I also went last wednesday, it wasn't slow, but it wasn't busy either.  I stayed for about 2 hours total.  It was a good time and everyone took care of me quite well (as usual).  I've never had horrible service here.  There's been some mishaps, but they always take care of me and are quite attentive.  

I started out by asking the bartender about some new beers.  He described them, but I wasn't so sure, so he poured me some samples without me even having to ask.  I liked one of them, so I got a full glass.  I also go the burger topped with a giant hunk of mozzarella, and a side of fries.  That was also good.  

I would say the menu represents good bar food, but nothing fancy or wild.  You usually have a couple varieties of sandwiches and burgers, there's a gnocchi of the day, pizza, and various apps and such.  I think there's a couple salads too.  Overall, I like their food except for the gnocchi.  It's Ohio City Pasta gnocchi, which I've never been a a huge fan of.  It stays too gummy when sautéed in a pan.  

XYZ's pizza has a lot of comments, so I'll add my own.  I like the pizza.  It's not the best by any means, but it's above the middle-ground for large-slice, soft-crust pizza.  And the price isn't bad.  I will usually get a slice when I end up at XYZ later in an evening and I have a good craving for carbs with warm and melty cheese.  Pizza at any place seems to be divisive amongst the public, but I think this one beats a few other local shops of similar style.

They usually have like 20 taps running, and a number of bottles.  They have the traditional domestics and imports, and then a ton of great craft brews.  They change out the taps regularly and I can usually find one or two beers that are new to me and not generally available across the whole damn town.  

And the whiskey... well, they have a shitload of it from high end and unique, down to the usual suspect swill.  I love the selection of brown liquor.  I love going there and finding out that they got a new variety and sharing in the excitement of drinking the best thing to come out of humanity's ability to turn sugar into alcohol.  

The jukebox sucks.  Even the employees play their own music rather than the jukebox.  It's not an issue until some random person decides to actually use the stupid thing.  I know everyone's tastes differ and I know that I'll never find my kind of music in a jukebox, but this thing just isn't good.

Overall, XYZ is a place I enjoy.  Good beer, good whiskey, good food, good people.",2012-09-21 18:33:50

Do you like mussels that tastes fishy and like they've been sitting in the fridge for too long?

Then get the seafood risotto. 

If you're not a fan of the aforementioned (like me), stay away from seafood risotto. It was just plain bad. The onion and garlic lingered for hours. The risotto was hard to the bite. From watching lots of Hell's Kitchen, I get that risotto is hard to get right but for $26, I expected more. The seafood was also far from fresh. 

Apart from the risotto, the service was great and I dig the decor and the open style kitchen.

We ordered our food earlier in the day because my dining group had another activities planned in the evening and were short on time. The food was ready when we showed up even though our party was not. Mercatto was very accommodating of our request. 

Can't comment on the other food but that everything is on the expensive side and the quality is not there. I might give Mercatto another try, perhaps the other items are better, but until then, the risotto gets a 2.5.",2016-03-21 23:11:42

I had the links with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The food was way better than I expected!  My date had the pulled pork sandwich (same sides as me) and loved it.  The portions were generous.  We ate and watched the Sirens of TI (which was kinda lame) from the best seats in the house.

We split way too many apps, but everything looked so darn good!!  Smoked almonds (house smoked, with a touch of sweetness - love, especially for $3!), wings (expensive but OK, with sauce that catches up with you around wing #3), Texas caviar (with black eyed peas and hominy - very nice) and chips and salsa (meh).  Drinks all around too.  I had a bloody mary made with horseradish vodka (yum) and a margarita made with hoppy tequila (yum!!!).

I ordered a combo plate.  $12 for your choice of two meats (I had burnt ends and pulled pork) and two sides (spicy potato salad and pit beans - both delish).  Really good amount of food for the price!  Others at my table had the brisket (dry), sweet potato fries (an upcharge but very worth it if you're a fan of them), the burger with brisket, sauce, onions and cheese on it (she loved it) and the twice-baked potato casserole (everyone wanted to lick this bowl clean).

This was my first time trying burnt ends, and I must say I was disappointed.  I expected blackened meat all around, like I've seen on the Food Network, and these were just the black ring around brisket that I normally get... when I order brisket.

We all loved the potato salad and the potato casserole.  In fact, we loved all the sides and apps.  If there was a way to get just a plate of sides, I'd never leave.

KINGYO is like the grown up version of Guu. It's got the izakaya feel and vibe, with a bit of class, quiet, originality and fun. 

We walked in to its high ceilings and blinking antique pachinko machines along the wall and a silent projection of Doremon reaching for his red bean pancake on the wall. This place is going to be fun. 

The servers are extremely attentive, knowledge and friendly. Food came quickly and with good timing between them, not too close together and far apart enough for us to digest. 

The menu has a lot to offer, and lots of unique dishes. Not a lot of fried tempura stuff which is really an easy cop out. 

Their presentation of the food is really nice, with different ways of containing some of the side dishes. Although repetitive with the banana leaf on everything it made for some nice photos. This is like AsiansTakingPhotosOfFood heaven. 

What we ordered:
- LOTUS ROOT  - Renkon Kimpira (okay, good to share not amazing, not spicy) 

- TAKE WASABI, pickled octopus in wasabi to wrap in seaweed (if you don't like wasabi skip this, also if y)ou don't like slimy foods would skip it too) 

- SEA URCHIN SHOOTER. I wanted to try this egg with shiso, yam, yuzu and sea urchin.. It's awfully expensive at $7 and really have to be adventurous to like this one. You would be able to share this with a close friend or partner

- STONE GRILLED BEEF TONGUE ($10) - it's quite gimmicky cooking your own meat on a stone, but it's a great way to impress people who have never seen it before (my first time too). Impressed this rock stays so hot, and almost instantly cooked the thin pieces of meat. A good sharing plate

- BIG SHORT RIB - they weren't kidding, this thing was huge. It came nicely at the end of the meal and filled everyone right up. A sweet and tangy vinegar sauce made the braised meat crunchy, sticky and tender. Get this one.

- PORK BELLY - Cream Buta Kakuni - This had to be the best dish of the night. So fatty it was creamy. But so much flavour it was explosive, almost. Get this too

- CHICKEN KARAAGE - the first dish that landed on our table. Whatever this magic powder is, I want some. At $8, it was one of those that was worth its value for sure. Good for sharing (ask for a knife). Soft and succulent inside, and perfectly crispy on the outside. Get this three.

- KINGYO YAKIUDON - this was off their special menu. I love kimchi udon and since starting to make it at home my husband feels that it's not special anymore and wanted to try something more plain. But this was anything but plain - filled with mushrooms and beef and seasoned with their magic powder (no really, how do I get some of this)

- UNAGI DON - off the special menu - best unagi don I've ever had. something about the unagi mariande gives it a sweet soy based flavour. served in a stone bowl, it was hot and cripsy without me having to leave the rice in there and pressing it so it will cook. 

- GRILLED SQUID KABAYAKI - off the special menu - wasn't amazing. It was a little tough, and not that tasty. 

We skipped the sashimi this time because of cost and the fact we wanted to try so many other cooked dishes. Based on the careful preparation of all the food here, I'm sure it will be amazing and worth the price tag. 
They also have a special vegan menu that is limited and is an all day lunch box. Worth a try for $15

For dessert, they had only a few. 
ALMOND TOFU - soft and silky, but still prefer the one at Guu
EGG PUDDING - a creme brulee basically, still very good
CASTELLA SPONGE CAKE - you know the cakes you get from the Korean supermarket. It was this drizzled with some sweet sauce and served with ice cream. It wasn't spectacular. 
We skipped the dessert on the special menu but maybe we should have gotten that too. 

After all was said and done, 5 people, a few pints of Sapporo and a bottle of sake with all this food, it all came out to about $45pp which was a lot less than my first outing at Guu.

Two weeks ago I came into test drive a 2015 Camaro after corresponding with Daniel L, from the Internet Sales team. I had expressed that my first visit here (to the service department) was terrible, yet he found a way making me leave very satisfied. 

Daniel was patient, intelligent, and not pushy. No one enjoys wheeling and dealing at car dealerships, but Daniel made all of those anxieties go away. 

While I didn't really come prepared to buy a car, I left a couple hours later with my dream car and I have to say that it was all because of how amazing Daniel dealt with my questions and concerns. 

I get my window tint tomorrow at the dealership, which was part of the deal, and I will continue to come back because of his amazing selling skills.

There's a big banner out front now and there are pictures all over the place of the owner (i'm guessing) and Guy.  Anyway, this is why I decided to try the place at all so maybe it worked.

My friend ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and I went with the Linguine with Red Clam sauce.  Its a very tiny place with plastic patio chairs.  We waited for about 20 min so we had time to check out the decor.  

The prices are crazy!  They charge as much as a full Italian restaurant does - I've never seen a diner, drive thru or a dive that charges so much per plate!  Skimming the menu, I'd say the average entree is about 12, appetizer is 8, desert is 5.  

So by the time we got our food we were starving, but we managed to drive home which was about 5 min away.  They gave me a few pieces of bread for my pasta which was very good (and very surprising because bread is on the menu for like $5).  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was WAAAY salty.  The portion wasn't what I expected for the price I paid at a ""dive"".  The sandwich was a little better, but nothing special.  I work at a hospital and I'd say their chicken parmigian is better.

All in all, this wasn't the best experience.  I say if they want to charge so much, open an actual restaurant.  Then maybe they can serve some liquor instead of just having pictures of wine bottles everywhere and empty vodka bottles holding flowers.  (Its BYOB, $5 corkage fee).  I'm very disappointed in Food Network.  :\",2009-06-24 00:33:32

My Tech was silent the whole time.  There wasn't even a smile, I was getting a little nervous.  Would it be the lack of English, or just not in the mood to talk?   She didn't even offer the types of polish they had until I over heard my friend's Tech.  I still wonder what type of polish I would get if I didn't ask.

The heated rooftop patio is pretty sweet, although not the most scenic (overlooking Winners!). Came on a Saturday night and the crowd was very Jersey Shore and the DJ was playing dance mixes of Top 40 songs - think Katy Perry, Pitbull, etc. So it feels like a club, although there's no dance floor or anything. It definitely seems like a place where people come in big groups, as there are lots of long couches. The projected movies are cool. They were showing some Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers flick, and then later a black and white animated movie. It reminded me of Foreign Cinema in SF. 
The cocktail list has lots of yummy sounding choices, including a bunch of sake and soju cocktails. I went with the caramel apple martini, as per the waitress' recommendation, and it was delicious:) They bring you complimentary popcorn to snack on with your drinks, which is nice. 
The indoor area looks fancy, although maybe trying a bit too hard... It's an odd combination with greasy diner Fran's just below. 
Overall, it's a decent option in the area if you want to chill and grab a drink but don't feel like going to a pub/sports bar, and the patio is nice!",2011-10-05 02:45:05

The hostess greeted us at the door and after a short wait, we went to  our table.

Portobello artichoke dip was very good but was  served in a tilted bowl which is stupid if you're trying to share.  It was served with corn and flour tortilla chips. 

I love peanut butter and was pleased by the Punchin the Nuts Amber Ale's light peanut butter taste. I attempted to sneak by and requested it as the Nuts Amber Ale since we were at dinner with my In-Laws. However, the server caught me and I had to say the full name. My  husband likes their blueberry beer. Their beers are smooth, not overly hoppy.  I've heard rumors that their Christmas Ale is better than the Other Christmas Ale. 

The Pacific Beach Tacos with cod were surprisingly good. The flour tortillas were crisp. The mango salsa was just right with a touch of sour cream. Blackened tuna steak sandwich was well seasoned. Beer battered steak fries were good accompaniment but average. The Mac n Cheese was a hearty portion of  tomato cream cheese sauce, noodles, roasted red peppers, tomatoes and sausage that had a slight kick. I've had it without the sausage and it is worth every carb. 

Service was attentive, relaxed, and efficient. The bar service was very good even though the place was packed.

After avoiding your curry Tofu scramble at B* and opting instead for the Vegan Burger, I finally decided to try it. I avoided it, because I'm often hesitant when restaurants try to jazz up bland ingredients with exotic spices that nothing else on their menu has. Think, veggie ""oriental"" spring rolls on a menu that has no other Asian ""inspired"" options. It makes me jump to two conclusions:

1) This is coming out of a giant freezer bag and is either being reheated in the microwave or tossed in to a deep fryer or both.

2) The chef has never made anything vegan before, and did what my Dad used to do when he was tearing his hair out trying to make ~*something*~ for his angsty vegan teenage daughter: Unloaded the entire contents of the spice cabinet on to an unsuspecting block of tofu, and mashed it GOOD AND DEAD.

Now, since I had enjoyed their black bean Vegan Burger on several occasions already at B*, I was hopeful that this would not be the case and went ahead and ordered the Curry Tofu scramble. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time and came with half an avocado, two grilled slices of beefsteak tomatoes, a dipping cup filled with blackberries and strawberries, and rye toast. 

The Tofu scramble wasn't what I'm typically used to when I make it at home; it was chopped rather than crumbled and was smothered in onions, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. I won't knock off a star because of the sundried tomatoes, even though I loathe them unless they're blended (so I don't have to be subjected to their baked Trojan texture). This is entirely personal preference, and I was happy to push them off to one side of the plate. The Tofu scramble, as I suspected, though, was bland. All the flavor was on the outside, because it was chopped and didn't have a chance to cook long enough for the Tofu to absorb the spices, so every bite in to a piece was a dance of nothing, curry, nothing, curry. After salting down my plate and asking for hot sauce, though, the scramble was vastly improved. And, everything is better with avocados. It's like nature's bacon fat!

Coffee here is always good, orange juice was good, although - probably not the best idea combined with coffee and a slight hangover ;). Service was pleasant and quick, even though they were swamped with Saturday brunchers, and we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table. The café has a cozy feel to it, and I honestly really do appreciate that they even make the effort to have a Tofu scramble on their menu, AND a vegan burger (which is always predictably delicious). I also appreciate the fact that a majority of their sides are vegan as well. 

So, hi-five, Dairy Lane :). Thanks for having non-dairy things! xoxo",2012-08-21 15:59:43
-P24mpDs22s-bYTC6maZLA,-RhRXVW9z9fs5zzxhFfnHg,o9ncq8xQo_hd427lMsQQZw,2,4,4,1,"First off, let me say that I live almost across the street from here and have been waiting for a grocery store downtown for almost 5 years.  I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their ""grand opening"" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market.

Boy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe I'm weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didn't get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and I'm just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesn't make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing.

My next complaint is the selection.  I'm not even going to complain that you don't have basic things like fruit or butter.  I'm going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms.

Finally, what's with the ""wine bar""?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?  It really feels like too much room was wasted on the sandwich/wine bar counter area and not enough was set aside for actual groceries.  

I know this place will get better but right now one would be pretty hard pressed to do their grocery shopping here.",2009-11-03 22:23:47

Always a creative couple, my girlfriend and I ordered one and had them top it with sausage while another party in the group topped theirs with pepperoni.  Overall, I'm a big fan of their pizza.  Their crust (fermented with spotted cow beer) is lined around the edges with cheddar and that by itself would keep me coming back.  It's something truly unique and utterly delicious.  I thought the toppings were on point but the sausage was rather dull and lacked the fennel, hot pepper flakes, oregano that makes up a good italian sausage.  On the flip side, the pepperoni paired excellently with the rest of the vegetables.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The space (two stories with a basement) is light and airy.

When we walked in, the restaurant had a one group of 7 only. We don't see any host so we decided to prop ourselves at a booth. The décor is nothing like you would think at a Chinese restaurant. It was really modern/Ikea like.

A small Chinese lady greets us and gives us paper menus, which I think was a little weird. It seemed like there were no other employees except her and the cook. Service was slow. We were there for a whole hour and fifteen minutes! However, I really didn't mind all that much. At first, the restaurant was pretty empty so I thought maybe they didn't have many employees because there aren't many customers, but as the time went on, more and more customers walked in. We left there and there were at least twenty customers after us. I don't know how they will be able to service that many people in a timely manner. So I think maybe they just need to hire some help.

Anyway, let's talk about the most important part and why I am giving them 4 stars. The food was fresh and it was really good! We ordered the house special fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and Mongolian beef. My favorite was the Mongolian Beef - you need to order that! It was packed with flavor! 

I am not one to brag about Chinese food...I actually am pretty critical on Chinese food so for me to compliment their food, that really means something!

Also, when we were given our check, we got fortune cookies AND a small ice cream cookie!! It was such a treat!

I'm almost ashamed to say I've been here a few times. My last xperience before this one was bad, it took everything in me to not be short with the unprofessionally immature waitress that tabled us. But I figured I will let it pass since my family actually enjoys Swiss chalet and this is the closest location to us. 

However, our most recent experience has made us realize driving to Any other location will be better than going back here. The service just got worse. It was the worst sit down experience I've had in any food establishment much less a respected chain like Swiss chalet. The waitress was a nightmare and the manager (I later realized) is just as bad. Our party had 4 kids and a few adults,  all of which ordered their individual meals. The kids ordered drinks with their meal but only two arrived.. no re fills.. and the other two never came, even after reminding the waitress. I suppose she forgot. The kids who ordered chicken never got the Swiss chalet gravy.. apparently according to the manager, it's this locations policy to not give chalet sauce to kids... unless this location puts alcohol in the sauce, I don't see why this location would be so particular. Every other Swiss chalet location if been to in years have given sauce.. like why is this even an issue? Oh, and the cherry to top it all off? This location doesn't give treats OR desserts with kids meals. Even if the kids menu promise these aspects of your meal, this location chose to disregard their company's policy and follow their own. No drink. No toy/treat. No dessert. That'll make the kids want to come back for sure. 

The adult meals came next. They got sauces, haha, nice to be ""of age"" i suppose?? The chicken was burnt. Like black edges burnt. my friend didn't eat it and we just left it on the plate. After the waitress insisted the chicken was fine, we asked for the manager. Her immediate response was that the manager was busy and will come later. Fine. When we followed up with our request, she said she already spoke to him and that everything was fine. We won't need to address the manager since she spoke to him already. We were going no where with this service and had enough trying to reason with hot air balloons.

First off, Hobby Lobby has just about *everything* you could possibly buy at Michaels, Pier One, and Party City all in one big store.  Second part - their prices are great!

After those 2 main points of huge selection and great prices you have customer service.  I have never had a problem here with bad service, in fact I find the staff really friendly and willing to help navigate the store.

The lines may have been long a few times before, but not so bad that I'd say ""eff it, I'm not coming back"".. nor that I'd be furious about.  Honestly, the only big negative I could find was that I want to buy too many things when I come here because they have so many cool things for the house and for crafts.. but is that really a negative??

After reading all the hype, decided to take a chance and spend $30/ticket. I am a  fairly new Marvel fan and went with someone who is a [middle-aged] Marvel fan. The VIP tickets might have been a better bet IF I could have afforded them (about $100/ticket).  The ""hyper reality"" is just HYPE. Poorly executed event, to say the least. The lines were incredibly long and once you got to do or see something, it only lasted a couple minutes. We only got to do three things in our 3 hours there! We stood in line for one 3D event for over an hour and the even took just 2 minutes. In our experience, there were numerous equipment malfunctions and glitches, so many kinks have to be worked out yet. We went on 12/30 so assumed any issues would have been fixed by then, but nope! The staff was poorly trained and at times, many of them did not seem to have any management or guidance around. A couple staff members completely ignored us when we asked questions, and others simply did not know or seem to care. 
OH and let me mention the $10 parking fee that they don't bother to tell you until you show up. Sadly we did not have cash on us and ended up being late to the ticket start time. Not a big deal in the end because at our 5pm start time we stood in line and waited for almost 20 minutes before being let in.
At the end of the event you get a free cheap plastic bracelet for completing and passing the Shield training and becoming a Shield recruit, whatEVER. Also at the end is a souvenir store where you can pay for overpriced this and that. Walk right on out folks.
This was a partial Christmas gift to someone I care about. I think it's safe to say we both felt let down. The hype says this event is geared to older kids and adults, however, it was clearly set up for younger kids, and kids under 6 were apparently free. Really young kids were the only one who seemed to enjoy it. And of course, food and beverage prices were astronomical.

This is the first time I've started a review with an epigraph but it was so well put and completely warranted. Sheesh. From the sound of these reviews, it seems like a revolt to the backdrop of Do You Hear The People Sing is just around the corner. Yeah, it's an expensive Mark McEwen helmed resto in the glitz district of Toronto. Yeah, drinks are expensive. And yeah, it's frequented by douchebags. But most comments here bespeak an irritance not with their food or drinks but with opulence and pretention; and while One sells the former pair, it didn't invent the latter. This is the same as shitting on the dollar store because it's ""cheap."" You know?

ANYWAY, I sat at the bar for lunch and it was pretty good. The bartender was friendly, the douche-count low, and my noon-hour cocktail was pretty solid: a Maker's Bourbon Sour. For lunch I grabbed a pulled chicken sandwich with avocado. It was good, but a bit mushy like other experiences I have with avocado this month. The food certainly was expensive, so it's more for the expense-account crowd but the ambiance and service were pretty solid. I'd give it a try for dinner, or maybe stage my next proletarian meetup in their lounge.

The omlettes were both very good (especially the tomato sauce that comes with both!) Of course we all got the biscuits, which are giant and come with spicy apple butter (I'm a fan)

qoBdSXG46syiCFLEMpENqw,4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,q-BIBN88JkOXaK2FIlPpuQ,4,3,0,0,"I stopped by here with my girlfriend for a snack this past Sunday afternoon at Coffee Buddha.  We had attempted to get tacos here the previous day during the food truck roundup but the line was simply ridiculously long and barely moving.   So whenever we pulled up this past Sunday I was pleased to see that the line was only about 15 people long with some people obviously a part of a single group.  It was cold out and I was determined to wait although I certainly didn't think that it would take the half an hour to forty five minutes that it did.  While the owner of the truck was clearly working very hard and was also amusing to talk to, I can't exactly say that the operation was efficient since every taco is made after it has been ordered.  Granted that is nice from an eating standpoint but not so for efficiency.  Originally my girlfriend and  I had only planned on trying three of the tacos from the truck but after the long wait I figured that I would we should try all five because who knows when either one of us would want to wait that long again.  On this day the taco truck had a butternut squash with chipotle cream (I think), a pork one with a fruity salsa, a jerked chicken with avocado cream, a Korean BBQ with kimchi and finally the americano which is steak, cheddar and salsa.  After being handed the bad and sent on my way I made it upstairs inside Coffee Buddha only to realize that I only had 4 of the 5 tacos I had ordered.  Apparently the owner knew that too as whenever I went back down to ask about it he quickly provided me with the missing taco.   I enjoyed all of them to an extent as the tortillas that they are all put on are quite good.  My favorites through were the jerked chicken with avocado and the pork tacos followed by the Korean BBQ and Americano with my least favorite of the bunch being the vegetarian.  The jerked chicken taco was my favorite as the chicken had a nice spicy flavor and the avocado cream sauce was simply amazing.  It had a slight taste of avocado combined with the taste of lemon that reminded me of a good lemon aioli and if I could buy some more, I would.  The pork taco was also great with the pork being extremely tender which combined with the sweetness of the toppings perfectly.  You could tell that the Americano taco was made with real pieces of steak which was nice although I thought it was missing a little pizazz that the others had.  My Korean BBQ seemed to be the same way and I think a little more of the soy based sauce on it would have made it much better.  Finally I was not a huge fan of the butternut squash one (disclaimer that I am not a fan of butternut squash) but it was slightly sweet and better than I had expected.

The bottom line for me is that if I was rating the truck on food alone, I believe it would deserve 5 stars as it definitely hit a home run.  However, I was not a big fan of the wait even though I understand why there was one.  Due to that I would definitely head back here again in the future but only if there was no line or a fairly short line waiting for the truck.",2013-02-26 20:58:24

I applaud the owner for believing in the forgotten East Charlotte and decided to continue what Foskoskies started. Yes, this is the same spot as the former Foskoskie. 

The decor stayed virtually the same. It's a small intimate spot, very warm and down-home feel. The space can get a little loud because concrete walls just don't do well with sound. The entrance is my least favorite area, because you literally walk into the edge of the bar. There's no space to stand to wait without being in the way. Speaking of the bar, while the main dining room is dimly lit, the bar is quite bright in comparison (which is odd... normally it's the other way around).  

I took mom to here for brunch on Sunday (it's only open for brunch on Sundays FYI). I expected it to be busy. What I do not understand is, they should expect it to be busy too, and somehow everyone looked overwhelmed. It took awhile for us to be even RECOGNIZED at the door, let alone seated. I didn't mind the wait, but a ""hey ladies, I'll get you seated as soon as possible"" would be nice.

Once seated, I was dragging the possibility of not getting any service. After all, I have a feeling there's not an organized waiter sections here. So I literally went ""old school."" See, growing up in Hong Kong, most restaurants didn't have sections, people just grabbed the nearest waiter walking by. In this case, I established strong eye contact, and got myself a waitress.

Our waitress doesn't normally work there, but she was nice. In fact everyone was nice, it's just disorganized and chaotic. The menu looked good. The price looked even better. My chicken & grits with sasuage gravy and biscuit was $9. Mom had Country Fried Pork Chop with Eggs for $8.50. I also had a cup of the lentil soup for $3. Our order took awhile to arrive unsurprisingly. I asked them for some biscuits to keep us from starving, and their biscuits and scones were delightful!

My order came out a little disappointing. It was literally chicken fingers on top of grits. I had to ask for the missing gravy and biscuit. Mom's order came out looking great. The pork chop was tiny (and a little dry/tough), but honestly that's probably what a normal portion should look like. It also came with a little fruits and roasted potatoes which were yummy. Lentil soup was very thick, it was more like lentil stew. I didn't taste much of the curry, but it did its job as being filling.

So yes, while the visit was not at all the most positive, and the food was not perfectly done, somehow I find this place still a charming spot. I hope the service improves, and I will definitely support my neighborhood MOST affordable brunch spot!",2013-05-13 22:28:17

That said, I am going to be as straight up as I can be about the SpringHill Suites at Bakery Square.

The good . . . 
The hotel location is great . . . a short drive to all things important in the Burgh.
They have FREE covered parking.
They offer FREE passes to the adjacent fitness center (not that we used it, but I have friends who belong and they are more than impressed with the facility.
They have FREE breakfast -- which includes a few hot items to boot! It's actually pretty good.
The room/suite has a defined desk/workstation area with great lighting to do work.
FREE internet.
Microwave and fridge in the room - a huge plus!
Nice plasma screen TV with adequate channels.
Bed is very, very comfortable.
The staff is very friendly.

The bad . . . 
If you are staying more than a couple of days, there is hardly enough hanging and drawer space.
Each suite has two bath areas -- one with a shower and vanity, the other with the toilet and a pedestal sink.  Don't believe for one second that you can actually use the pedestal sink for anything other than washing your hands!  Try to put your toothbrush or toothpaste on the side and it falls into the sink.  The vanity in the main area is not large, either.
While the bed is comfortable, the sheets barely fit it, so you sheets do slide . . . and the box spring sticks out like a sore thumb.
Housekeeping is spotty -- one day they forgot to replace the coffee and cups; one day they forgot to replace enough towels.

The ugly . . . 
While the hotel is relatively new (open about a year), it is already showing wear and tear.  The furnishings, while modern, are starting to look shabby.  They have not used top notch materials -- laminate instead of wood, and faux tile in the showers.  I am sure after another year or so, the shower (no tub, by the way) will look horrid and grimy.
Carpets were not swept daily.  I know this because there was thread on our floor the day we checked in, and it was still there when we left . . . five nights total.  Also, there were many carpet stains throughout.  Ewww!

I don't think I am being overly picky.  It just depends what you want in a hotel. I think it is nicer than the Marriott Courtyard a couple miles down the road which charges the same amount of money for their rooms, but doesn't give you the complimentary internet, breakfast, parking or fitness center pass.

There was a live band, everyone seemed to be having a great time, a little whooping and hollering. A couple of *DRUNK* ladies exited while I was waiting by the door complaining about not getting any attention from the men here. So funny. Perhaps it's couples hot spot? None the less, its a fun joint.

-They are cute, but with that ""IM THE BEST SHIT"" that ever happened to brand STEAKhouse attitude,  their faces can be EASILY overlooked and masked with a  ""BI*CH YOU UGLY"" if they keep their snobby ass attitude up! 
-they will stare at you from a good 5 feet away, even while you walk up with NO smile or grin. than wait for you to speak. they WAIT!
as soon as i say ""party of 5"" it's like they are programmed to not say anything else! 
""Do you have a reservation?""

-No...

""ok, wait on the side and we'll call you right up while they set up the table""

-Here i am thinking, THIS SNOBBY bitch was too bust hatin on me that she didnt even ask for a name??? how the hell is she going to call us...
""Uhh hey you??""

RUDE, WHICH TOTALLY puts THIS HI-END STEAK HOUSE in a bad light!

Anyway, Our server was great, he was very attentive and friendly.
My party had exactly 5 people which meant tip is automatically deducted.

So with the tip immediately added, i would hope for nothing less than excellent service!

THE food here is GREAT, their steak is cooked to soft PERFECTION.
IT IS NOT CHEWY NOR RUBBERY.
WELL, DUH WITH THE PRICES THEY CHARGE HERE, I WOULD NEVER WANT TO GNAW ON A RUBBERY PIECE OF MEAT!

the bread is brought out *ONLY UPON REQUEST* SO i suggest you ask for that cause it was delicious!

BUT IF ONLY THEIR BUTTER THAT came with that WERE SALTED, which it wasnt! it was plain unsalted butter with regular oven baked dinner roll type bread.

nonetheless, that is the only thing that is free besides water.
so don;t pass up the opportunity.


*their spinach was a tab bit bitter-

*their hash-browns are ok, nothing out of the ordinary, i would not pay $13 or so for regular hash-browns.

*they were out of a few items we ordered! after 15 mins of placing our order than he comes at let's us know (it;s like why not be considerate and add a note in the menu, or even word of mouth?)

vfKp6zvORrCoHvpAnfLJjQ,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,bDtsc7WTwEJZFuvjXy8wng,4,3,1,1,"Bestellen had been on my radar of must-try restaurants for awhile, but with so many new restaurants coming out of the woodwork - a food blogger really has to sprint just to keep up!

The namesake of the restaurant is German, meaning ""to order"" but don't expect any schnitzel here.  Top Chef Canada runner up Rob Rossi and business partner Ryan Sarfeld stray far from being a typecasted restaurant.  Rossi sites German, Italian and Spanish cuisines as influences for his meat-filled menu.   Like the founders over at the Social Feed, Rossi hopes to bring communal dining to the masses.  This is reflected in larger cuts of meat (unless you can take on a 32 ounce steak on your own) and lots of sharable options.

The focal point of the restaurant is the meat locker featuring all the aged cuts of beef and house-cured meats.  The recollection of Mark McEwan's meat locker at Fabbrica had but crossed my mind when the celeb chef himself walked past me!  Talk about coincidence.

The decor is interesting with its Edison-inspired lighting, wooden church pews, and mural of cuts of steak.  Opposite that, you will find their wine list neatly scribbled on chalkboard.  The only downer is the garish beam of fluorescent lighting that emanates from the open-concept kitchen towards the rear of the restaurant.

For starters we opted for the Small Charcuterie Platter ($13) for the table.  It consisted of Coppa (a pork shoulder salami), Mortadella with black pepper and pistachios, Housemade Spanish Salumi and pickled Enoki, pickles and radishes.  It was served with a few slices of their house-made brioche which was very good!  Having your own meat locker really does make a difference as the charcuterie board was fresh, and the meats were all delicious.

We also sampled the Pork Belly Croquette ($12) which sat on a bed of lemon ""tartar"" sauce, topped with a fried egg and accompanied by a radish slaw.  Pork belly is something that I'm quite particular with, seeing as Chinese restaurants have no shortage of them and they're all usually very juicy, succulent, and mouth-watering.  The croquette, for me, had a rather dry exterior, with a protective barrier to the pork belly filling.  The dish was beautifully plated, but for me, was lacking in pork flavour.  I also found the meat itself was on the leaner side and therefore, not as tender.

Our server had informed us that to truly experience the goodness of their aged steaks, that the 16 ounce striploin or the 32 ounce côte de bœuf were the way to go.  Unfortunately, my belly was already quite full so instead I opted for the Bestellen Burger ($18).

I was surprised when we were asked how we'd like it cooked.  I recall having read an article not so long ago stating that Canadians are deprived because the ""burger law"" dictates that our beef patties have to be cooked to a level of doneness that pretty much ruins a potentially good burger.   Further reading indicated that restaurants who grind their own meat in-house are clear of the ""All burgers must be cooked medium-well and can't have any pink in them"" nonsense.  Phew!

I will tell you now, that nowhere else would I fork out $18 for a burger, but it is so worth the splurge at Bestellen!  The house-made brioche made a repeat appearance as a hamburger bun, housing the succulent burger and caramelized onion raclette.  The fries were equally delicious, and no doubt double-fried.  I almost didn't need to dip them into the Smoked Paprika Ketchup.  But for those of you who know me - I never say no to ketchup, and I definitely couldn't resist this one.  The smoked paprika kicked things up a notch!

To finish off the meal, we couldn't say no to the Coconut Donut ($7) which was served on a bed of creamy and luscious lemon curd.  Again, nowhere in sanity's reach is $7 a price I'd pay for a donut but for these - I'd promise my first-born.  This pillowy-soft creation sprinkled with toasted coconut, coupled with the smooth lemon curd was dessert heaven!  I definitely recommend you hold off and save a little room for this if you dine at Bestellen!

V E R D I C T

Bestellen has definitely won me over with their unique decor, yummy food and stellar service.  Chef Rossi is talented for sure, and the front-end staff are stellar.  Our server was very attentive, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.

I had actually ordered a cocktail (which I didn't like), and she was happy to take it back and bring me a new one (and I wasn't charged for the first one).  I would happily recommend you try the Desert Mule cocktail.  It is a refreshing quaff.

I live in the east end of the city, but would gladly hop in the car and drive on down to eat at Bestellen.",2012-04-13 14:58:17

The Short Rib Mac & Cheese was delightful. The Onion Rings had a nice pop to them. The Chicken Meatballs were delectable. 

What got me the most was the 14-oz Prime Dry-Aged Sirloin, medium rare of course. Delicious.

As for dessert, we got the Strawberry Shortcake Bars. Wow. THIS IS A MUST GET FOR DESSERT. Doesn't matter if you're full. Got a taste of some other desserts as well, but the Strawberry Shortcake Bars stole the show to end our meal.

We made reservations, but were an hour late due to the rainstorm. They still had room for us and were so nice about it. We started with the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip and the Mussels. The bean dip was amazing. The chips were fresh and warm and the dip had a great taste to it. Yum. The Mussels were my pick and they were just ok. The sauce was amazing, we were even dipping our chips from the bean dip into the sauce. The mussels were too small.  I love mussels and I am not saying that I am someone who really knows all about mussels but these were really little and about half of the mussels were empty. 

For my dinner I ordered the Tropical Paella. It had chicken, chorizo, shrimp, scallops, mussels, peas, pineapples, and red peppers.  I love paella. This had a nice good taste to it but it had too much tomato and it overtook the dish. I did not see/taste any scallops which to me would mean that they were so small that I couldn't detect them. The pineapples were not overbearing and they were a nice added ting of sweetness. The mussels also were the same as the appetizer, small and sad. Overall the meal was really nice and I enjoyed it.

After my second visit here, I am confident enough to say that they are quite simply a traditional sub shop, like subway used to be before Jared waded over and lost all the weight. Lets discuss the pros and cons of Jersey Mikes - Tempe.

~Fud/Drink~
Jersey Mikes, first off, has solid, traditional, sub options. If you want a simple Italian sub with extra olive oil, and tasty Italian meats, come here and munch down. If you want a foofie Hawaiian pineapple open faced mozzarella sub (just made that up, it sounds good) then go elsewhere. Their food options are pretty simple, but the meats help make each sub. Overall, they offer just a a couple of add-in options to your sub and they aren't high quality, especially the lettuce and tomatoes.  The tomatoes are pretty slimy, not super-fresh and the lettuce seems to be of the bagged variety. The bread is average as well, nothing amazing to write home about. The onions actually looked nice, they were presented in their dish all pre-strung, rather than chopped up. They were also white onions, not the traditional red, which I actually enjoyed better on the sub. But once again, the meats...they are great. Overall, its a shame they don't put more stock in everything besides the meat, because they did a good job there. They have no beers by the way, a soda fountain with regular options will do just fine. If you need a beer, Wingstop next store has a number of beers on stock.

~Atmosphere/Service~
The service here is near-perfect. They are fast, friendly and intelligently listen to your order. The sub came down the assembly line and was in the hands of the toppings-adder (what is the title of this person anyway?) quickly. I did take issue with the fact that the pieces of cheese they added on the sub were about as thin as I get at the deli at a supermarket, super-thin, that is. Normally you expect a couple semi-thick slices of cheese, but the provolone slivers they gave me were so small I could barely taste that flavor. After accepting my request for extra lettuce and tomatoes I went and asked for some sides in cups which he dished for me in fast order as well. There is no true ambiance to the place, they have a simple set up with chairs and tables, music isn't a priority. Its a sub-shop guys.

~Extras/Rating!~
They taste MUCH better than the generic Subway. Please just discard Subway and eat at a real sub shop like this one. You get so much more when you eat a spot like this. I do hope JM's takes a look into better quality minus the meat.  They do a real good job at customer service and the management knows how to train their employees well. The subs hold up well against other competitors. However I feel as though I am paying more than necessary for a sandwich that is pretty average besides the items I already laid out for you.  I wish they would let us do take home service of their meats, that would be great. This place is deserving of better than 3 stars, maybe 3 1/2...But we don't have that option, do we ;-) ? Would I come back? YES! I have tried two completely different items, and it seems Italian is the best route. I am not an Italian sub guy per-say, but this is a tasty treat if I am in that mood. Try your best to make your first sub an Italian one, and ENJOY!",2013-02-06 14:31:12

We asked to be seated in the outdoor area, which we were told had a long wait. No problem, we'll sit inside. We are seated at some type of food bar where we sat for over 10 minutes without even being greeted.

Nope. My chair must have been in some walkway. I was constantly bumped. Like 5-6 times, before I politely mentioned to a passing employee that it was difficult to enjoy myself while my chair kept getting knocked around. That happened again a couple more times, but an effort was made after that.

So what to do? Settle for his other nearest restro- Bouchon! 

Bouchon is not a Vegas flashy restaurant and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. The price is very reasonable. You also get that great customer service (as we did). Bouchon is located in a weird hidden spot and we actually made resos 2 months in advance, we didn't really know how busy it'll be... so we decided not to risk it. FYI it wasn't that busy when we went, but then again it was a Sunday night. 

We started off with the table bread- which was delicious and homemade as they have their own bakery. My BF couldn't find a beer he liked and the server was nice enough to let him taste several. We decided to feast and ended up ordering the charcuterie plate, dozen oysters, mussels, steak frites, and bouchons dessert. Man they were all delicious! The charcuterie board came with patay and it was the best thing ever. I would love to have that to put in my Vietnamese banh mi! My entree was the mussels and they were cute small mussels but there were literally over 50 mussels! It was more than plentiful and delicious. The saffron broth was amazing. The steak was good too and the oysters were very fresh. The dessert- 3 bouchons, a pretzel ice cream and a marshmallow thing with a salted caramel bar inside was amazing.

The place is fast food setup, but it not very fast. When we arrived the place was not busy at 6:30 dinner time.  The girl at the register was very new. She didn't know what some of the menu items were even. My wife ordered 3 chicken tacos,  and she got 3 shrimp tacos instead.  I tried the Carna Asada Taco combo, and a bowl of Passole.

Well after waiting about 15 minutes for our food, and the order being wrong,  my wife was not happy.  I have to say that the food was very simple,  and very traditional Mexican recipes, I found the Carna Asada tacos to be dry and lacking in flavor. The Passole was just homany, and pork in a thin red broth.  That's how the peasants make it.

There weren't enough seats at the bar for all of us so the host told us to sit in the couch/lounge area and he'd send a server over. The lounge area was cute and casual. The service was fantastic! I wish I could remember our servers name. He kept coming over and checking on us and getting us drinks even after a wedding party came in and it started to get busy.

Simon's Wok has been around for many years and is hidden at the far end of Toronto's Chinatown east (that's the smaller Chinatown).  It has been over 10 years since my last visit to Simon's Wok, and it's as if the prices have not changed.  Almost every dish is $5-$9 and is a good portion.  

I'm always recommending this place to friends, but I understand their apprehensiveness.  Firstly, it's vegetarian and most non-vegetarians balk at the idea and secondly, the place looks like crap.  It's small, it's dark, and it looks like you just shouldn't be there.  Hopefully you can get over this little minor issue and try it out.

A girlfriend and I stopped since we needed dinner and a study break.  The place is literally on the casino floor with no barriers between you and the slot machines.  The sports bar is also nearby so you can hear lots of cheering (or booing, depending on the game and people) if there's an exciting game on.

My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders and fries.  I got the beef brisket sandwich ($8.99?), fountain drink (makes me wish the M still offered free soda), and fruit tart ($4.99, say what?!).  My bill was $16 and some change.

Note, napkins are only available at the counter where you pick up your food, although plastic ware and stuff is located near the self-serve stuff.

Our food came out pretty quickly, just enough time for the two of us to devour the delicious and beautiful fruit tart.  My sandwich was huge, I could only eat 1/2 of it.  The beef was moist and tender and covered in just enough BBQ sauce.  This wouldn't be a good togo or take home dish though because the moisture from the meat and sauce soak the bun.  It was good, not great, but good.
The fries were hot and good.  I liked that they weren't overly salty so you can still salt them to taste.  
My girlfriend's chicken tenders were ahhhmazing.  We couldn't finish all 5 of those huge suckers.  They were so moist and had a perfect amount of breading on them.  

Next time my girlfriend and I go back, I think we'll just get one order of fries and tenders to split between the two of us!  And I won't order a fountain drink.  Just not worth the extra couple bucks.  But I'll definitely be back.",2013-03-21 03:06:49

Flower Child has pulled off a difficult trifecta: it's trendy, healthy and delicious. 

The Healthy:
Everything is fresh, locally sourced and organic. Even the staff. There really isn't a single thing on the menu that is bad for you. Lots of fresh vegetable options, lots of healthy grains and rices, lots of healthy proteins, and not a lot of cheese or pasta. This is food as it should be. You won't leave feeling engorged or disgusting. Just full and satisfied.

The Trendy:
Normally this warrants a degree of trepidation from me. Oftentimes trendiness comes at the sacrifice of tastiness. Fortunately this is not the case. I have a natural prejudice against ingredients like quinoa. Do people eat it because they really enjoy it, or because psychologically it feels good to eat ""healthy."" But Matt, the host, recommended it so I ordered it, and tried it, and it was incredible. If you are going to order anything, order the corn and quinoa.

The Delicious:
Again, the corn and quinoa is incredible. Also good is the avocado hummus, the steak, and the glazed sweet potatoes. The broccoli is just simple steamed broccoli, but it was fresh and still firm and nicely balanced the meal. If you're a little crunchy and feeling adventurous, don't miss out on the kambucha. It's an acquired taste I haven't acquired yet, but don't let that hold you back.

I like you, Flower Child.",2014-09-15 03:34:14

Here's where it differs:
1- it's historic. Built in 1908, it is older than the state of AZ and they have pictures of it's history to prove it! So very cool to have a gem like this in our own back yard.
2- We told the lady working that it was our 1st time in and she gave us a tour with mini history lesson! She was super friendly, knowledgeable & nice. Don't get that at Circle K!
3- Oh my goodness, the chorizo breakfast burritos made hot & fresh on the spot (Deli is open 7am-2pm Wed-Sun) are incredible!!! Best I've ever had.  And inexpensive.

But the servers are cheery and down to earth and just after your drinks arrive the busboy will set a fresh warm bowl of chips and cool salsa on the table.  Two salsas actually.  The red salsa (salsa roja) has punch.  You can taste an exciting splash of fresh individual flavors instead of the usual tomato-onion-lemon.  And it also comes with a spicy green salsa (salsa de tomatillo aka salsa verde) that has a great spicy kick.  

We ordered the ground beef tacos and the waitress didn't flinch when I asked for things like ""no onions"" and ""no sour cream"" and they came to our table perfectly.  I like it when both the servers and the cooks pay attention.  Needless to say the tacos were impeccable.  Flavorful and fresh.  They came with a side of cilantro rice with a few beans as garnish.  I could say it was slightly overcooked, but it was a nice alternative to the usual spoonful of plain beans and rice.  

They have more tequilas than your average saloon!   An impressive list of martinis, margaritas and enough tequilas for several rounds of shots without using the same tequila twice.  Just remember the old saying ""One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor..."" before ordering too many.

At $22 for lunch and all we had were tacos and diet cokes, it was a little high, but more of a unique experience than I expected and well worth the investment.  I'll save Cantina for special occasions, especially for dinner, because I know when I go to Cantina I'll have a great time in an upscale atmosphere and there are plenty of things to try on the menu.

So upon past experiences, we tried to make a conscious effort to refrain from over ordering. As much as we love our dogs; we are trying to cut back on the literal doggie bags going home. (The vet hasn't been very impressed with our mini dachshunds recent weight gain, Thank goodness our other two are mastiff breeds) And don't worry, the dogs did end up with tako leftovers. 

So, we decided to order one apps, drinks, & then tacos.  We have always loved the tacos & thought we would start with one order each and could always order more! 

To begin with. The service was awkward. Upbeat and hip as one would expect from tako but items arrived without a flow that one would expect at tako. The chips took forever to arrive at our table. About a minute before our takos arrived. We had quite a long amount of time sipping on our artisanal drinks but they would have been much more enjoyable with the chips and house made salsas. Each salsa accompanying the chips were awesome. Three come with the chips. One mild, a medium, and a hot. Fresh ingredients mingling and hitting the tongue with not just heat but flavor & spice. It's amazing- Except when you really need a drink refill. And nobody returns to your table to offer another cocktail. 

Water is available at the table, which is nice. Cocktail features being the star of the show at tako; it can be disappointing to settle on a glass of water when you really something like a hand pressed juiced drink to accompany the salty spiciness of their chips.  So the chips ended up being mostly abandoned and taken home in a literal doggie bag. Bummer.  This is why our small dog is fat. 

As for the takos. I went with my favorite. Chicken. One of the tamer choices at tako. Typically the chicken takos are a beautiful mix of grilled chicken, avocado, salsa verde, cilantro, & onion but these ones weren't as warm as usual and just - eh. Still good but not what I was expecting. Again, a tako taco ended up going home for the dogs. 

So. I still would suggest tako for a night out. It's good. The ambiance is almost too cool to function all the time. I can't say it's my favorite place. Which is disappointing because I was hoping for it to be THE MOST amazing place.  It's good. It's not my favorite at this point.  But it's fun and festive. Entertaining.

The night we visited they were offering a lobster boil meal for $50 which included a whole lobster, corn on the cob, herb roasted potatoes and a glass of wine or craft beer. A great deal but we weren't in the mood to mess with our dinner (taking a lobster apart takes a bit more effort then we were willing to make at that point lol). That having been said, would love to come back again some day to try!!

We sat at the bar and the bartender (Hillary?) was super lovely and attentive. We chose an order of white wine garlic mussels to share to start. The mussels were cooked perfectly and we didn't find any closed shells (yay!). IMO, the sauce was a bit too light on the flavour but the dish was very tasty overall. I think next time I would try the curry version. 

We both ended up ordering a plate of fish and chips for our entrees. The portion size was massive! I ended up taking my leftovers home to my fiance who promptly devoured them. The fish was fried very nicely - light and crispy, not greasy. Both the fries and tartar sauce appeared to be home made, so so good. Very satisfying with a nice pint of craft beer!

Overall, we had a great experience. Definitely will return again someday!",2018-02-13 18:45:20

I've been here quite a few times and have had brunch, dinner, and even takeout (Pro Tip: use the takeout spot right in front of the restaurant to make a speedy getaway). Some of my favorite dishes include the guacamole which they mix fresh by the table side, the chicken tortilla soup, and any selection of the tacos (Marco Polo is always a solid choice). They also have a fun brunch menu I suggest checking out if you are interested, which is impressive considering all of the competition close by. The space is large and can accommodate both large and small parties and I would recommend reservations during peak dinner times.

I will admit that service here can be hit or miss from time to time. During my most recent experience, my wife and I went to sit on their patio to enjoy the nice weather with a beer and some guac. I realize it was towards the end of the day on a Sunday, however our waiter often went MIA and seemed like he couldn't care less about us.

Would I be greeted by hipsters with noses in the air? Would it be out of my price range? Well, today I actually had some time before work and a little extra dough courtesy of Uncle Sam, so I entered this establishment, cautiously, enemy of gentrification that I am...

...and here I was greeted by light jazz music and a pleasant young girl who reminded me of a cousin of mine. It's a coffeehouse sans pretension, filtered through the idea of a neighborhood diner. It was classy, but not so much that I felt out of place in my t-shirt and worn jeans.  I used the restroom, which was clean, came back out, and ordered up. 

I was hungry since I'm salt of the earth and all, so I tried the Pumpkin Pancakes AND the Smoked Salmon Omelet. I mean, I love pancakes, but they seem more like a dessert to me but also keep in mind that there's a childlike side to me that beckons me to eat dessert first...because I can! I actually live near The Dor-Stop, recently made famous by Food Network's ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"" which also has a similar pancake. Well, since my schedule's a little rock 'n' roll, I can't get over there (I will someday), so I had to try Coca Cafe's version, and I must say that it was a tempter if there ever was one. It came with their own hot syrup, powered sugar, and sauteed pears.

Yes, pears. I HATE pears! Normally anyway. Coca Cafe made me love them. How sneaky is that? Wow. It's a great sticky stack that you could put birthday candles on. 

With the pancakes out of the way and in my stomach, I went for the omelet. I paid the extra 75 cents and got it with the goat cheese. I mean, goat cheese! How can I pass that up? I hardly ever get to have it. Yes, I'm a deprived foodie. Anyway, it was big, fluffy, thick and packed with cherry tomatoes and scallions, and of course the salmon, which was but an afterthought. This pillow of egg didn't need it. It was that good. I got white toast on the side. Do they teach toast-making in culinary school? Can one major in it? 'Cause it was the best toast I ever had. The slices were thick, crispy, and were already buttered, perfectly I might add. There was even one of those twisty orange slices on the plate as a garnish. No, I didn't eat it. I'm not a total barbarian y'know. 

The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent as well. I didn't read the menu thoroughly enough (I was in a slight rush) to see that it was fresh, but upon tasting it, I could tell. Sunny D it wasn't, and I certainly appreciated that. 

Speaking of being in a slight rush, man is this place ever lllaaaiiiddd back. I mean, they want ya to relax, hang out a while. It's ok though. Old industrialized (institutionalized?) me still got to work on time. Next time I go, I'll try to get there a little earlier. This isn't a place where one wolfs down food, and for that Lawrenceville is a little more human. 

To sum up my experience I will say that Coca Cafe offers a quality, gourmet brunch that won't leave you eating Ramen noodles 'til payday and is essentially the restaurant equivalent of petting a cat. Saunter in, eat...slowly and just loosen up and quit rushin' arahnd 'n 'at. The world 'aint goin' nowheres. Jeez.",2009-03-25 04:31:56

The grills in the center of the tables are a charcoal and gas combo. The charcoal makes the grilling a little more challenging than say, the non-stick gas 'domes' at The Honey Pig, but the flavor from good ol' coal is hard to beat.

We've eaten at Yagyu 7 or 8 times this past year and on a few occasions it seems as though our Kalbi order came out to our table as Prime Kalbi at no extra charge - the meat was intensely marbled. Maybe the restaurant ordered too much Prime Kalbi that week? Their regular Kalbi is gristle-free: consistently the leanest Kalbi I've experienced. At Yagyu, one order of Kalbi ($7) is 11-12 boneless pieces. Boneless Kalbi is unusual and I like it. (It is always awkward when we order Kalbi somewhere else and the server puts the Kalbi bones on the grill last, as if gristle, cartilage and marrow are some kind of bonus course. I always feel less 'Asian' when I realize I don't enjoy gnawing on short rib bones. In those situations I usually end up spitting out the undigestible wad of short rib cartilage after I chew on it for a minute. This will never happen at Yagyu.)

At Yagyu we recently discovered the harami (outside skirt) which tastes as good if not better than the Kalbi. 

The Dinner for Two ($26) is HUGE!! It comes with a staggering amount of food, including soup, salad, an assortment of fresh sushi, a generous assortment of katsu dishes, a bunch of banchan sides, several different meats to grill plus vegetables and I think I'm forgetting like 2 or 3 other items that come with it. Usually we don't order the 'Dinner for ___' at Asian restaurants, but this one is not to be overlooked!

I really, really like the Wakame (3.95) seaweed soup. It is served in a big bowl - could almost be a meal in itself.

In addition to food, Yagyu serves 29-degree draft beer. This beer is so cold that a thin sheet of slush floats suspended in the frosty beer glass. 29 degrees would make even a Schlitz (not available) taste great and transformed the Sapporo (available) that I ordered into the coolest Sapporo experience one could have. We have done a lot of winter touring during which we've practiced sticking longneck beers in snowbanks next to hot tubs, creating a 'snow bar' of cold beer. Amazingly, Yagyu's is even colder. Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.

It's perfect to come on a date or with a few friends.  The place is small, and gives off an intimate vibe.  The restaurant decor is vibrant and colorful, so you'll feel cheery as you devour your tapas.

They have great sangria that I highly recommend, just don't get two pitchers of it like my friend and I did.  It's stronger than it seems my friend, it's stronger than it seems.  

They have a long list of tapas to choose from, and it's fun to get a few different ones to share with your pals.  The prices are very reasonable too, most of the tapas are anywhere from $5-8 and the portions are a good size. 

If you haven't tried tapas before, this is a good place to do it.  The servers are friendly and fast, and they'll help you order if you aren't sure how or where to start.",2007-06-19 02:31:24

This is a nice location and has both inside and patio seating. I decided to sit inside because the patio was pretty crowded. Good buzz in this place. It was fun listening to the guy at the counter greet people.

There was hardly anyone when we got there about 5pm but it filled up rather quickly.

The layout is quite simple ... rows of long communal tables and chairs and seats at the bar.

It was quite busy. People would leave and be replaced with others.

They have a lot of interesting beers, both on tap and in a bottle. I had a couple Beau's Lug Tread Lagered Ale.

You have to go order your own supper at a separate counter and pay for it there. There is quite a choice of sausages ... traditional like beef, pork and chicken, to game like duck, wild boar, rabbit and kangaroo.

I ordered a Kranjska sausage (pork and garlic) in a bun ... it was $6. Gord ordered a duck sausage (maple and fois gras) sausage and onions in a bun ... it was $9. So sausages aren't cheap. We split an order of large fries ... we had curried dipping sauce (which I liked) and black pepper and onion dipper sauce (which I didn't like). At $5.50 for fries, they aren't cheap either.

My sausage was good ... really juicy.  Gord said his was okay, not great. He liked mine better.

They give everyone a couple raffle tickets. At 6:30pm, they give away a couple tickets for the Maple Leafs' hockey game ... alas, we didn't win.

I happened to be driving right past the location today so I stopped in to pick up some chaat, just a quick little snack. It is indeed nearly impossible to find the restaurant. Just when you're about to give up, drive 100 feet farther and it's on your left.

The woman in the front was nice and smiled a lot, but understood very little I asked, so I just went with an order of Samosas and an order of Aloo Tiki. She told me, ""No credit card."" I said fine, that I'd brought cash.  She said she would go drop off my order in the kitchen and come ring me up.   I stood at the counter for five minutes before I decided to sit in one of the plastic chairs. I realized she wasn't coming back for awhile.

She brought out my food about ten minutes later and told me it would be $7. I handed her a $20. She went in the back, then came back and asked me if I didn't have $7 exactly. I said I didn't, and asked if she'd take a check or something. (Lots of miming with my checkbook here.) She shook her head and made a phone call. I spent another 5-10 minutes waiting while she was in the back with my $20 trying to figure out what to do with it.

Finally she came back to the front and went over to the cash register, that had been ignored throughout this whole time. While still on the phone she tentatively pressed a button twice and *woosh!* the cash register drawer flew open and her eyes lit up. Yes, she had to make a phone call to figure out how to get change for a $20.

I left, amused at how screwy this place was and expecting never to return. Then I got home, and I tried the food. 

Here's the deal, the Aloo Tikki was the most flavorful Aloo Tikki I've ever had in my life. The Samosas were incredible. It is quite clear that there is a master in the kitchen at Bollywood Bites.

But it is equally clear that the management of this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant is horribly inept. Both from the reviews here, and from my own personal experience trying to simply order $7 worth of food from them. 

Whoever is running the show has made a series of bad decisions and wrong turns. The location is terrible. The lack of tables is ridiculous. Leaving a woman to manage the orders who can't communicate and doesn't know how to open a cash register is laughable.

I don't know whether to love Bollywood Bites or hate it. I am absolutely sure I will be back to try more of the delicious food, but I won't get too attached to the restaurant. It just doesn't feel like a place that's going to be there more than a couple of years at the rate it's being managed.",2012-10-19 19:59:38

My fiance and I had been wanting to try this place for a while. We live quite close, and drive past every time we go to a movie or to the grocery store. So tonight we finally had a chance to stop in and get some pizza. 

The first thing I noticed is the attempt at an ""upscale atmosphere"" pizza joint. I kind of hated it. A nice looking bar, tarnished by a bunch of pizza joint style table seating (four tops mostly, and one long booth that has chairs on the opposite side). Nice decor on the walls, nice music, silverware and quality condiment shakers on the table... But the plastic plates and bottled soda is the opposite of everything this pizza place is trying to be. 

I personally thought the menu lacked variety. There are only a few selections of ""specialty"" pizza, and I wasn't really wowed by any of them. Nothing really stood out to me. Sure, you can customize a pizza... at $3/topping on your $18 pizza. 

First we ordered the wings. I didn't like them at all. They tasted like any old chicken wings baked in the oven with black pepper, rosemary, and the faintest hint of garlic. Kind of bland, except when I got a little spring of rosemary in a bite, and then it would be overpowering. 

We ended up ordering one pie with half mushroom and pepperoni (can't screw that up), the other half with tomato, mushroom and onion. It was okay. I'd give it a 5/10. The crust was...okay. Nice and crisp, but nothing special. The sauce was barely there, and tasteless. The mushroom and pepperoni were the best part, but isn't that typical of just about any pizza? The tomato and mushroom were fresh, which was great. I absolutely HATE places that use jar/canned mushrooms. So, kudos on that at least. The onions were supposed to be caramelized. They weren't... they were just sauteed, in olive oil I think. Most people probably don't notice the difference though. 

We also ordered a white pizza, which we added tomato to. Thankfully we did, because, again, it was pretty bland. No garlic, and I had a difficult time tasting the ricotta. It was dry. Again, nothing special. The tomato added a little more moisture and flavor. 

For the cost, its totally not worth it. We spent over $60 (not including tip)... and for that you get plastic plates and soda served in a plastic bottle. No thanks, I'll stick with the neighborhood pizza places, or the Hop House.",2015-01-07 08:46:12

Had a corporate rate of 184$ and the room was absolutely heinous. 

Notes:

-You have to take 6 steps down from the elevator to get to your room (So you're wheeling a bunch of giant bags....good luck, I guess)

-2nd floor: windows frosted over because they're close to the street (see Crystal H.'s review) OR you get to have a view of the back of a building's air vents or something. I had to keep the blinds drawn because it looked like I was in East Berlin a few decades back.

-There was water damage on the ceiling in the room (bubbling paint)

-The bathroom door was a glass slider that could not close (good luck being in the room with another person)

-The shower stall looked like it had been done by bath fitters (plastic) about 15 years ago. It was shoddy all around.

-It appeared the painting of the walls had been done without tape or by a small talentless child

-There was no chair for the desk or any room other than on the bed.

This was a horrible hotel. I went down after checking in to see if there was something better available and to complain (never done that at a hotel before) and they told me for an extra 150$ they could move me to another room for only my second night. Rightttttt....

I used to live in Florida and survived on Mahi Mahi salads, sandwiches, and blackened fillets... 

At lot 17 I am always ordering the blackened Mahi sandwich no bun with veggies,(usually broccoli or beans). This is a highly flavorful and tender good sized; piece of fish that had no fishy flavor. One of the mildest white fish. I have eaten it on the bun and it is very tasty too. The blackening can be a bit heavy and chard so if you don't like that burnt taste you may want to have it grilled.

I expedited my visit here based on a friend's recent rave review (Chris V), and ordered several similar dishes, only to find most options underseasoned with a better version merely on the other side of the block.

FRENCH GREEN BEANS: Tempura beans with spicy mayo and toasted almonds. I like the cooking method and these were solid, and admirably light on grease. But the nearby CK has a larger portion with a great dipping sauce that this version can't hold a candle to.
TODAY'S SASHIMI/TARTARE (TUNA POKE): This was just okay. Poke was oddly seasoned with large chunks of onion and a lot of spice, rather than the citrus-garlic-ponzu punch I'd been anticipating. It was really fresh though.
LAMB TACOS: The dish I was most anticipating, with a clever concept of crafting a taco shell from fried eggplant. I really enjoyed the sweet pepper chutney, which was reminiscent of a ratatouille. But the lamb itself lacked the familiar, meaty flavor. Seemed to lack any sort of seasoning whatsoever.
CRISPY DEVILED EGGS: A fried egg white with nicely fried crispy texture, topped with a bland but creamy egg yolk filling, and entirely too much paprika. I had anticipated a version similar to a Thai hard-boiled egg, yielding a barely-cooked yolk. This just didn't work for me. Other that the paprika, there wasn't much going on... and for $8/4 pieces, CK's version with caviar is the better option.

I was dying to try their sticky toffee pudding, but my BF refused to order anything else and experience additional frustration. Around this time, our server disappeared for a solid 20 minutes and eventually the super-sweet food runner settled our bill for us. This spot has great decor and the menu all sounds like food I'd love, but the execution and/or consistency are just not there at this time- perhaps Chris and I had different chefs working on our visits? I'm too hopeful not to give them another try sooner or later, but right now I'm underwhelmed.",2015-12-12 15:21:18

The owner is an absolute delight. You are warmly greeted as soon as you walk through the door. He has such a warm & light spirit and it makes coming into his restaurant a treat. 

The only negative thing I have to say about our past experience was how busy it was...it was early January on a Sunday around 12:30pm (party of 4) and it was a little too cold to sit outside (where they have the majority of seating) but every table inside was already being used.  

We ended up outside and thankfully a table of 4 finished right before our food came out so we quickly bussed the table and enjoyed the warmth. 

The food was wonderful. I did 1/2 sandwich 1/2 soup. The soup was broccoli and I am so glad I got to try it on a cold Vegas day. I choose the chipotle sandwich with chicken and it hit everything I had hoped from it.

I have had some mixed veggie salad that was completely forgettable, and their mozzarella and tomatoes-on-a-vine salad, which is actually pretty tasty (albeit small for the price), drizzled in thick balsamic vinegar. HP finally won me over last night when I had the brilliant idea of ordering the pizza well done. Was it the crackery crispness I craved? Well, no, but it certainly helped, and my usual day-after pizza routine (heat on a dry hot skillet till cheese is melty) crisped it right up to almost Parlor quality. Cool!

I came out with a sleek, layered, armpit-length hairstyle with shorter bits framing my face that everyone in my dorm said looked wonderful on me.

Brionie is a jewel; she listened to my vague descriptions of how I wanted to look and my usual hairstyle and then took that and turned it into something I completely did not expect but love more than my old cut.

In addition, the girl who shampooed and blow-dried my hair (didn't catch her name) was fantastic; she was professional, friendly, and skilled - probably one of the best shampoos and blowdrys I've ever gotten.

I walked in and was immediately greeted with a smile by the friendly workers! Top of that, the place was well presented. I didn't feel like I was in Sin City.

Came in at 10am and the place was filled with students and moms lol. So it's not the best place for quiet studies. I would say a great place to grab a cup of tea or coffee with friends and family. 

I tried the white chocolate latte and it was perfect! Not too sweet and not too bitter. I still need to try their pastries and desserts! Dessert is served starting 3pm! I'm guessing everything is made fresh on a daily.

The menu is fairly creative with anything from a margherita pizza to a proscuitto and pear pizza. They're reasonably priced, from about $9-14. They also have some great looking salads, and some pasta including a delicious macaroni and cheese!

I went with the margherita and was pleasantly surprised. The sauce was great, and it had the right amount of cheese, tomatos and basil. I'll definitely be going back, and think I might give one of the more exotic pizzas a try.

I live right behind it for now - not in the alley (haha!) but in a cozy condo that matches this stunning neighbourhood. I love Bridgeland. Today I had an old friend come by and see me from out of province. I took her to Main Dish for lunch knowing that she would likely love it. I had seen before that they had a nice selection of wine and we were ready to try a glass! Being a foodie, this place draws me in all the time. They always have a good variety of fresh food to go behind the massive glass displays and it changes somewhat day to day. What a great place for single people or couples or anyone to drop into after work especially when the urge to cook is just not there. What I have ordered in the past to go has been pretty good. Staff, hit and miss, today they were pretty good and not all looking like they wished they were elsewhere. Now, this place is not cheap. We did not come here to save money but I wanted to see what the ""stay in and eat"" meals had to offer. It was lunchtime (late lunch) so we split a pasta alfredo, the pasta being penne. The pasta was cooked to perfection, to the tooth! The alfredo sauce was to die for as were the big chunks of mushrooms and fresh chicken breast. The staff agreed to split the meals for us on 2 plates and the ""75"" wine we ordered was very tasty. I wish bread had come with the pasta plate but, no. 
I got a couple of items to go including my husband's favourite lemon dessert bar from there and strangely, the bars are the same price as usual but in the last few weeks, the bars have been cut in half so you get less bang for your buck. Hmmm...
For some reason I knew the prepped meal at this casual spot would be quite good. The dining atmosphere was casual and we went at a slower time which was very good for conversation.

1. The line is always long and they don't do reservation which I can understand but they don't even let you call ahead to put your name on the waiting list. My house is about 20 mins from the restaurant and a week prior our first visit my wife and I tired to go there and we called and the wait was about an hour. We ended up went elsewhere but if they let us call in to put our name on the waiting list we probably would have gone. 
2. Our servers were great for the most part expect one of them screwed up my pork belly. It was over cooked and it was dry. She turned the belly to early and the heat probably wasn't high enough in the first place.
Now I got the negatives out of the way, here's what I like:
Marinated skirt steak was very good, tender and juicy with great flavor. 
Kimchi and the pan cake banchan were very good. The kimchi was not too strong but still has a nice flavor to it. But others banchan were just okay.
One of the best things was the rice pop ice cream. It's not a culinary master piece but it was very fun to eat. Great texture contrast. It's like an ice cream sandwich with rice cake which was very crispy and then I  bit into it then I had the nice and creamy ice cream and then I felt some thing grainy which was the red bean paste(I think). All different kinds of texture in one bite. I like it a lot. 
It's not the best high-end Korean BBQ but I found great value to take my kids and wife to there. But if just my wife and I for a date. I'll go to another Korean BBQ place which is my hands down favorite.",2016-08-30 04:57:27

on Wednesday they have their fried chicken served a la carte, so u pick which pieces u want.  Got the thighs and breast (mild) -omg, JUICY goodness!!!  They give u a bottle of their hot sauce, I tried it, but not a fan.  My dining partner got his chix spicy (u have a choice, mild or spicy), and he loves spicy and he could not handle it!  I tried it and I love spicy and it was burning!! He actually say there w/an ice cube sitting in his mouth! If u like spicy pain, then it's for u!   Sides r sold separate and we got the deviled eggs (u get 4) and the Mac-n-cheese., both very good.   

As u wait they serve biscuits with an herbed butter and a jam.... DELICIOUS!!! 

For an app we got the stuffed peppers and those were very good!! 

We sat on the patio outside and it was very nice.  Only downside was the lady that sat us was also the only server for all the tables, and there were at least 8-10 tables between inside and outside.  She did good for having that many, but still was very slow to get drinks/then order/and the bill.

Maybe from the day we were at the speedway I touched something with peanut oil from someone's hands being on the railing.  But I always use my right hand for everything. Weird how it's isolated on just my left palm. 

The next doctor to come in for urgent care was at 4PM, I was not thrilled with the wait time I'll admit. I was waiting for nearly 3 hours until I was seen because people kept piling in and I was the last priority since I only had minor pain.

When I FINALLY met Dr. Shin was very understanding & caring. I appreciated him taking the time to ask questions about my past medical conditions very kind of him. He gave me a topical steroid & Hydroxyzine.  He said to take a picture of my hand,  if it got worse he'd refer me to a dermatologist.. We'll see.

The service was very quick and checked on us frequently, and the menu looked very appetizing. There were so many unique taco options, ranging from fried octopus, salmon and tuna to steak, carnitas, etc... many options and lots of variety! Although I wanted to try five different tacos my husband and I decided to share the Pescado Borracho (fried snapper). How can you not?! We also order the PB Street Corn and a side of charred jalapeños. 

The Pescado was very juicy and flavorful but be prepared, it is the whole fish so watch out for bones! Although it was very good, it is like eating crab or crawfish, a lot of work for little protein. Overall glad I tried it but I think the tacos would have been more of my style. The street corn was delicious, and the habanero butter added nice heat but it was very buttery and thick. I would definitely recommend, just be prepared to consume a heavy amount of butter. We also ordered two cocktails which were good but very sweet.

We got there early and headed out to the patio since it was a beautiful day. We sat next to another table having drinks and watched the golfers. The people at the next table were super loud and were using really foul language. Let me be clear, I have a potty mouth. I am no saint, but this was bad enough that it was making my kids uncomfortable. Next, they light up cigarettes. On the patio. Not 10 feet from the door that has the no smoking sign it. Pretty sure that's illegal? Anyway, we got up and moved all the way over to the edge of the patio. Problem solved, or so I thought. As the patio filled up with diners, more and more people started lighting up. The restaurant did absolutely nothing. 

As for the food, they don't have a kids menu, so heads up to any parents out there. Their burgers were very meh and the tator tots were no different than what you get at the grocery store. The mac and cheese is of the Kraft variety. My daughter found a hair in her burger. Oh, and everything tasted like an ash tray because of the smoking on the patio. The server was super nice, comped the burger, and did a good job, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the rest.

For the life of me I cannot figure out how this place is so highly rated. I'm guessing it's because of the members of the golf club? Maybe they get perks? Who knows. I definitely will never be back.",2017-03-07 00:25:24

This place is located in Chinatown, below Ichiza. The neon sign and anime characters outside are hard to miss.

Right when we walked in, I was greeted with bright neon colors of anime characters all over the restaurant. Anime cartoons were blasted on their flat screen TVs. The cute waitresses in their costumes looked like they stepped out of an anime. The attention to detail and the execution of their concept was impressive!

I was a little ticked off at first because the waitresses took a while to take our order. The place wasn't that busy and it seemed they didn't have their priorities straight when we've been sitting there about 15 minutes and one waitress was sweeping. 

My husband and I ordered the Karaage Chicken Wings to start. He ordered the Shoyu Ramen and I got the Tonkotsu Ramen. Luckily the food didn't take long. It was weird that they brought the ramen out before the wings but no biggie. My husband and I tasted each other's soup and although I liked the Tonkotsu Ramen better, it wasn't that great. Like other Yelpers said, it just doesn't compare to Monta.The chicken wings were actually boneless and were also mediocre. 

We had the Honey Toast for dessert and it was my favorite part of the meal. I always hear how good Ichiza's Honey Toast is, but I have always been too full to try it. I don't know which one is better, but I really enjoyed the dessert here.

The waitresses were good about checking in on us after our food was brought out so the initial annoyance I had went away. I also have to give them extra brownie points for being so darn cute!

I already had a bad experience at the Matsuda at the Steeles location which I gave 2.5 stars to. However, I tried to have an open mind and enjoy the food.

The parking situation was a little iffy because they have about 10 spots at the front of the lot which were all full of course and the space at the back is all owned by a school which had ""Private Property"" signs all over. I'm sure it's extremely rare for someone to get their car towed there but I couldn't help but feel agitated thinking about it.

The service was much better than the other location because it was much less busier. To put a disclaimer though...the group I went with had regular customers so I feel that my opinion on their service would be heavily biased since I felt like they went out of their way to treat us better. However, I can say with confidence that they are not understaffed like the Steeles location. Orders were not missed and the overall atmosphere was better.

I found the menu to be lacking in variety compared to other AYCE restaurants for this price. The raw fish was not good enough even considering it is winter season so the quality in fish is worse than normal. The beef tataki was OK. I did not order any hand rolls. The sushi rolls were really mediocre. The tempura was way below average quality because the batter was bad and the sweet potato tasted strange. Their miso soup again was really mediocre. However, the fish/mushroom soup which came in a large pot they specially made for us (perks of going with regulars I guess) was delicious. The saving grace of the meal was the meat they used for the teppanyaki specifically the sirloin steak. It was high-quality, tender and cooked to perfection. The duck breast was not bad either. The dessert options are similar to the other Matsuda which all come in the small glass like mango yoghurt, jello and various mousses. Ice cream options were limited to vanilla, red bean, green tea and mango. I tried the mango one and it wasn't as good as the one at Ten Ichi but it did not taste cheap and overly sugary at least.

To sum it all up nicely, this Matsuda has better service than the Matsuda on Steeles but has worse food and vice versa. I would not go to either Matsuda's because there are much better options for Japanese AYCE for the same prices that do not falter in service and food quality.",2016-01-07 21:50:40

The place is very small, maybe 8 tables. But that is good because there was only one server but even with about half the tables full the service was very good. I had the green curry which was absolutely spectacular and would say that is on par with what a great curry should taste like.  In my opinion the consistency of the ""broth"" was perfect, with a nice creamy flavor with not too much heat as I requested a 5 on the spiciness scale of 1-10. The lady ordered the pad thai which I thought could have been a little bit better. It was sort of blah, I think it needed some lime, possibly cilantro and some chopped peanuts. The lunch pad thai also came with a side salad that will catch you off guard if your not careful. The salad doesn't look like much but it packs a ton of flavor. It was hard to determine what was in the clear white dressing that was on the salad but it was sweet and spicy which was very tasty for this dude.

A girlfriend and I went on a Tuesday after work, and when we got there at 5:45, the bar area was already half full. (As another reviewer noted, I almost went in the wrong door. Oops.) It took awhile for the bartender to acknowledge me even though there seemed to be a few staff people hanging out at the bar not doing anything, but that was the only blip in good service.

The bar was pretty cozy and had multiple TVs (there was even a TV in the bathroom!) so you could watch the game. I think there may have even been USB outlets for phone charging at each bar seat, but we didn't bend over far enough to completely confirm.

The wine, draft, and tap lists were solid, and there is a different drink special every night. For dinner, I got a salad and my girlfriend got chicken fingers and fries; hers came wayyyy before mine, which was odd, and the bartender finally offered to check on it. My salad was fine, and my friend's chicken fingers looked like real chicken fingers.

Overall, this appears to be a solid addition to the neighborhood, and I'm looking forward to trying it again after they've gotten into a groove.",2015-12-09 20:48:45
hpnJa0Ex9ty6z1bsfOZ5mw,ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,SZEFE5hL7aN5nM-A44iPwQ,3,4,0,0,"This steakhouse inside the Bellagio is rated one of the best steakhouses in Las Vegas and from the minute you step inside you know you are in for a couple of things.  Great ambiance and very hefty price tag. Magnificently appointed from the small 8 seat bar when you first walk in to the large tables placed not to closely with views of the fountains through the large picture windows its pure Vegas.   Table for 9 on this Saturday night and we are given a large round table where we are seated very comfortably.   Fresh baskets of bread, pretzel bread, are a nice start as we peruse this shall we say ok no way around it Ridiculously overpriced menu. There I said it. 

The wine list is long as it is equally if not one of the most expensive wine lists I've ever seen.  In fact most were 300% mark up.  There was an exceptional vintage a 2008 Justin Isosceles which for $131.00 was simply marked up 110% which made it the best value on the entire list.   Note 5 bottles were consumed tonight.  The menu itself is your typical steaks & chops menu with some fish thrown in.   Don't think I'll be able to get to each appetizer and entree but I'll try. 

Appetizer Highlights:  
Shrimp Cocktail exceptional, Cesar Salad authentic and outstanding. Special tonight Burrata cheese over watercress was really unbelievably good, A dungeous crab cake also as good it gets.  Knocks off for poor Seared Foie Gras. 

Entrees: 
NY Strip Dry aged incredibly tasty and cooked  to perfection but the typical dry aging left it no juice whatsoever.  (8) out of 10

 (2) Small Bone in Rib Eye with Shishito peppers was tasty with just enough marble to give it some excellent secondary flavor (10)

Rack of Colorado Lamb was simply killer, not gamey and rich in color texture and taste. (10)

Prosciutto wrapped pork chop was dry and lacked flavor (5) Nice looking but didn't get it done.

Pan Roasted Dover Sole was fresh and tasty but completely overpriced at $65.00 (7)

Veal Chop was grilled and tasty and hanging off the bone as it should be.  Very rich flavor (10)

Filet Mignon with Shishito peppers everything a filet should be and then some (even for my friend who tried to ruin it by ordering it medium well :(   (10)

Sides: 
Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes (6) Nothing special

Baked Potatoes large giant with all the fixings (10)

Mac & Cheese crusty topping and rich and creamy underneath (10)

Creamed Spinach lacking that extra kick (6)

Glazed Mushrooms again nothing special bland (6)

No Deserts were tried.  Service was exceptional throughout the meal from every direction.  

Bottom line is was the price tag worth it?  Really borderline as almost every entree except the Sole was top shelf, and the appetizers were great. Ambiance, service exceptional as well.  Negatives All but 1 of hundreds of wines were so overpriced we were lucky to find a bottle to order.  Sides and prices of entrees were completely outrageous.  Kind of a 4 star if you have unlimited spending in your budget as it certainly was not a 100% slam dunk perfection and 1 star off for price points and wine list.  3.5 stars is more like it but we have to be fair.",2012-10-15 18:46:32

Our group of 6 shows up for lunch at 11:30. Tiny parking lot already full. Inside of restaurant only half-full (as everybody in Phoenix drives one to a car), but patrons are seated in such a manner as to spread them out as thinly as possible in the very small interior space, meaning there's noplace for a party of 6 except outside in the alley - I mean patio. We go outside as instructed, told a waiter'd be right with us.

We sit down and are completely ignored for the next 20 minutes. We go inside twice to ask for wait help. A waiter comes finally, he says he just arrived. Another 10 mins for water and to take our order. Food comes out   s  l  o  w  l  y,  one and two plates at a time. 

It was pho and bun and banh mi, but the pho came with brown and withered basil leaves, brown-tipped bean sprouts, and not much else. I'm accustomed to seeing scallions and cilantro and lettuce with pho, but not here, not today, not even for $10.

Another diner's spring roll order was one spring roll - 5"" by 2"" diameter, and it cost $4. I thought this totally failed the bang-for-the-buck test. 

My saigon bun (salad) was ok, pretty much what you'd expect, and fresh enough. It had no basil or cilantro though. The dressing tasted of nothing but straight fish sauce - far too fish-saucy for me. Co-diners complained about the strong odor of it. I've had fish sauce preparations in other Viet places and they were never this potent. 

The Viet coffee I ordered at the beginning of service came out at the end of the meal, after our plates had been removed, this after the waiter promised on at least 3 previous occasions that it would be served immediately. 

The interior design is pleasant. They need to learn not to seat a party of 2 at a 6-top at the beginning of lunch - you might just get a party of 6. The service was tense, frantic and way too slow for an urban work lunch - we were there for just under 2 hours. It was difficult getting out of the crowded lot because, well, because it's really too crowded for cars. I recommend parachuting in.

We ordered nearly half the menu trying to get full, by to no avail. I will mention that we had to avoid pork, so maybe if we ordered one of the large dishes which were pork based maybe we could have been full.

Wb_qwrogpLXAh_UeveuDeg,dA0QWjx56wIVbGaL_r52mQ,07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg,2,2,0,0,"Okay Im a sucker for AYCE Korean BBQ. As much as I care about the price, the taste is like 100x more important. Service was okay, since I was Korean the waiter just waited for me to call him for drinks and to change out the grill (which you must change out the grill once you grill marinated meat so the rest of your meat doesnt burn). Wooche charges only $19.99 for dinner. The banchan (Korean side dishes) were absolutely horrible! Not that it wasn't edible, but so many random dishes like assortment of Chinese dishes that you can tell was sitting in for a long, long time... The egg roll & potstickers were like hockey pucks, the beef and broccoli were shriveled up in the sauce. They only Korean banchan they had was lots of namul (vegetable dishes). Really? A Korean BBQ done properly should either be expensive (~$25) and have tons of great tasting banchan, desserts, and meat OR have it for cheap (~$15) and have a few, but great tasting banchan. I really dont know if corn out of a can & mushy cucumber kimchi is necessary to fill the space. 

Now onto the meats, at WooChe you can find chicken, pork, and beef plain, marinated in either soy or hot pepper paste. They also have an assortment of spicy baby octopus and shrimp with the shell and head on. I am sensitive when it comes to the gaminess of the meat and as soon as I put the pork belly and beef steak into my mouth I tasted something really unpleasant... Sadly the only meat that comes to mediocre is the kalbi. After 7:00 had passed, a lot of Korean people were coming in to eat & drink. A lady from the kitchen brought out raw, spicy blue crab. The seasonings were mainly red pepper paste with jalapenos, sugar, and sesame oil... nothing great. 

My boyfriend and I are always willing to give places 3 or 4 tries, but this was a total no-go... We will stick to either Tofu Huts AYCE Happy Hour $13.99 (great for simple pork belly, beef brisket, or spicy pork belly with excellent salad) or Honey Pig AYCE $24.99 (same table side service like Tofu Hut, but the quality of meat, banchan, and service is great)!!!",2011-07-16 04:30:28

I bought like 4 of each flavour that Sasaki's had that day to bring to a bbq. I got Matcha, Hojicha, and strawberry. I really dislike cream of most sorts, from both a textural and flavour standpoint. And this is where these are so amazing to me. They at soft, with just the tiniest bit of a chew due to the Mochi. The interior is enveloped by red bean around this creamy flavourful filling. Both the hojicha and the matcha maintain the slight bitterness of that tea flavour. The Hojicha has that added roasted flavour of the tea leaves. I was not in love with the strawberry one. The flavour is definitely still there but wasn't to my taste. The cream added to a richness and smoothness, whole still remaining oh so light on the palate.

Had to wait for about 10-15 m while this supposedly occurred. Sort of s long wait when you have a reservation I thought. Once seated, we ordered two apps, the Mac and cheese and deviled egg of the day. Deviled eggs were good, but we're not homogenous my filled. Some were pretty light on filling while others were over filled. I was surprised at the lack of care taken in the presentation. The Mac and cheese was delicious however.

They come with Apple butter not regular, and it was very strong tasting (personally I am not a big fan of Apple butter but those who enjoy it would probably like theirs). Dessert was the apparently popular home made deconstructed smores. This was tasty but messy. The chocolate covered bacon was good, but large and overwhelmed the other components. Still tasted good over all though! Price for two with red hen beers was $90 without tip. Overall, our waitress was sub par, not very friendly, lacked full knowledge of the menu, and reacted strangely to standard pleasantries. She sort of stared without replying when we answered her questions. However the food was quite tasty, better than many places I have been but not the best I have ever had.

I let them know it was my bday. We get there and had to wait about 15 minutes before we got seated (when we got in, over half the tables were empty...) Whatever - thats fine. I got a little happy bday card from them and the waiter was really cool at first. Then I let him know we had a restaurant.com certificate and I don't know but I feel like maybe it went all downhill from there (not sure why they would be upset with this bc they still make the same tip amount if we didn't have the certificate.)

We got the duckfat fries. They were mediocre. So many people raved about these fries and I just didn't think they were anything special. They actually came out room temperature and seemed over cooked. I would have rather had some bread.

Then we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the Gold Label Kobe NY and I told the waiter that I wanted the Kobe Rib Eye and then the waiter convinced me that I wanted the Kobe Rib Cap. I said that I wanted something super tender and buttery and he said definitely Rib Cap. We both ordered our steaks ""medium."" We also got a baked potato and the bacon creamed spinach. I asked for a wine that went well with my steak and I said I normally drink white sweet wines but i would do a red wine if he could recommend one. He didn't know anything about wine or he was being sort of condescending towards me bc I said that I never really drink red wine. I dunno. I just got a glass of riesling. 

The food came out rather quickly - maybe thats because they barely cooked our steaks!! What the hell - they both came out RARE ( we ordered medium.) And this rib cap I got - it was super chunky and chewy and bloody - just not what I wanted at all :(  My boyfriends $85 steak was a bloody massacre. The inside was just pure mush- you couldn't see any grain in the meat at all. My bacon spinach was almost too bacony- I LOVE bacon but the flavor overpowered the spinach. My boyfriend said his potato was good though and the sour cream that was served with it was delicious. 

Since I saw peoples' bday desserts from Yelp photos, I was waiting for them to bring me an ice cream or something. They didn't, so I just ordered off the dessert menu - I got the Dunking Donuts- since our meals sucked, I was relying heavily on these donuts to make up for it!! These donuts literally took about 30 minutes to bring out - this took longer than the steaks lol. They wrote happy bday and I got my candle then we ate the donuts and... they were ok but I would have rather had Dunkin donuts or krispy kreme!!! When we ordered the donuts, we asked if they had vanilla (instead of the caramel that went with it) and they did. He asked if we wanted to swap it and I said I'd rather have just one caramel and one vanilla scoop. Who knew they would charge $5 for the little tiny scoop that was smaller than a teaspoon and that we demolished in one bite. lol. 

So then we get the bill - $286.... yeah. thank goodness for the certificate we had then it came out to $236. We didn't even order appetizers!!! They charged $24 just for water. They charged $12 for the little donut things plus the freakin $5 for like the smallest scoop of vanilla ice cream I've ever had in my life. This place is a rip off. We have no problem paying $300-$500 for a fabulous dinner experience but this one was far from it. There's hundreds of better places to eat in Vegas.",2012-02-06 22:44:19

I must start by giving TruFusion shout out for not only hosting and welcoming Yelpers. But more so for hooking up all Yelpers that went with one week of free classes. I think might have been the only one to follow up on it. I wanted to get more in but was grateful for another Hot Yoga Yin class. Melanie one of the management talk about taking care of your customers. In the process of signing up for more classes on our free week. I realize something was off because had problems singing up for classes. I email her and same day responded back that needed come down set up account then set. I think speaks volume about management even if week free classes they took the time answer my questions and in timely fashion. Really the whole staff from management down people at the front desk setting up and checking up are the best. Greet you with smile. Friendly. It positive stress free environment from the moment walk in. You would expect but never know not that I know much about any of these places. More of gym or outdoor training for triathlon/marathon guy. It definitely helps relaxing mind, body, and soul before take on any one of the classes offered at TruFusion.

I went for Yin classes both times. I even made sure took the classes with same instructor Randall. I know Yin they offers different instructors and really not just for Yin. The times of the classes are awesome!! Most part all week they have classes running from morning till close at night. Think sunday only day that classes might go half the day. Sign up for classes is easy once your in the system. They give list of all the classes, type, instructors, and times. Just type in the class plan on taking and just show up at the time. I do believe they have limit on the classes. Think is fabulous cause really who wants be crammed into room doing Yoga or any of the other classes. Once the door closes no one allowed in so if running late not good idea. The rooms themselves are amazing with temperature control, clean, and the Yin room truly with the budda portrait the hardwood floors. It screams Namaste. The locker rooms are super clean. They even had juice bar if want smoothie after your workout plus they serve food. Overall its really nice high end facility that provides only the top notch environment. Wish could afford it. But there no cheating you out of value. If I could would sign up for monthly membership.

Randall need give shout out. Yoga and flexibility SOOOOO not me. I have been getting into Yoga more or trying. Randall if looking for patience instructor especially if new and might feel embarrassed to take that first class. Randall does amazing job. He adds some humor something always could use in life. You can tell he has HUGE passion for Yoga, knows what he doing, and all about sharing that same passion with rest of us. I stood out easy with lack of everything. He came over lot fix my position but the whole time never felt single out, or uncomfortable. Talk with him after and during asking me question all positive vibes. I really enjoy his class. Unfortunately only class took but am sure the rest of the classes and instructors are just as awesome.",2015-10-20 01:09:37

Needless to say, you won't find me driving 15-20 miles to Chandler just to have a cup of tea. However, Urban Tea Loft is much more than just tea--it's a stylish and warm gathering place inspired by tea but also featuring a full menu, friendly staff, and a full bar (with tea-infused spirits). While I still probably wouldn't make the drive to downtown Chandler just to go there, I would definitely stop in again if I were in the area. 

I first encountered this spot when Myles M and I met Jim W and Audrey W to try Latitude Eight (which is right around the corner on Arizona Avenue). After we finished our so-so lunch there (review to come shortly), we decided to pop into Urban Tea Loft to check it out. Even though I don't love tea, I was way too full to have any sweets (and coffee was naturally not on the menu!), so the four of us decided to share a pot of tea.

On to the food - the tofu skewer appetizer was good, but a little on the pricey side for 5 pieces of tofu. It was perfectly lightly fried, came with some dipping sauce (peanut based I think) and a mini cucumber salad.

Green curry with scallops - your typical curry but had scallops and eggplant in it. I was surprised to see this as an option because I usually don't see it on other Thai menus.

Crab fried rice - delicious. I always want to order this at every Thai restaurant. Very savory, hit the spot for me.

So I went to call in my order and the nicest lady picked up.  After a few questions, I placed my order of: The Sampler, Massaman in Pineapple Boat with Scallops, Pad King Sod with Calamari, a bowl of Tom Kha Gai, and a bowl of Seafood Soup.  Here's the breakdown:

- Sampler ($12):  You get two Thai rolls, two golden curry pastries, six buddha's delight, and six kew krob.  The Thai rolls are your standard little spring rolls with nothing too remarkable, the buddha's delight is your typical fried tofu, the kew krob had an interesting medley of ground chicken and spices, but my favorite were the curry pastries.  Puff pastry with curry chicken, onion, and carrots?  Yes please!  I think I would skip on the sampler if I come back and just order the curry pastries.  

- Massaman in Pineapple Boat ($16 + $3 for scallops):  Advertised on their site as a Mother's Day weekend special, I decided to order this because I love massaman curry and the added pineapples intrigued me.  While I think the $3 up-charge for like four scallops (cut in half) was a bit much, I enjoyed this dish!  The pineapple really adds a brightness to the otherwise heavy dish.  They even threw in the pineapple boat... which ended up getting tossed after I kept spilling curry all over the place.  

- Pad King Sod with Calamari ($13):  Squid stir-fry with ginger, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers in its simplest form.  I was hoping for a balanced dish but all I got was an overwhelming garlic flavor.  I love garlic but whoa!  It was a bit much.

- Tom Kha Gai & Seafood Soup ($4 & $6):  The Tom Kha Gai here is delicious!  It might've been the blinding craving for coconut milk soup but this stuff hit the spot.  It was silky and coats the mouth!  The chicken was a bit dry but what can you do about white meat chicken really?  The Seafood Soup was mainly eaten by Mr. Dubs.  It tasted of your standard hot & sour soup with lots of lime.  The seafood soup was definitely not my favorite.

The decor was lovely and I almost wished I dined-in instead of carried out.  The service was friendly but for $61, I was hoping for a little more.  The portions are a bit small and they're pretty stingy on the seafood but the flavors for most of the dishes were great.",2014-05-11 06:39:37

My opinion on Frostys (Frosties?): They  are best after they've been in the freezer for a couple of hours and then eaten with a real spoon, not a plastic one. 

However, the service at every Wendy's seems to be seriously lacking. We've only ever gotten drive-thru at this location, and they always forget something or make an error. The staff also appears to be overstressed and overworked and surely underpaid.

The pulled pork was super dry - making it very hard to eat - threw a lot of the hogfather bbq sauce on it. Brisket and chicken wings were ok. Everything is smoked in house overnight apparently.

While located in South Side, it's comfortably removed from the chaos of Carson St.  The actual restaurant is a small, dimly-lit European style place in the first floor of a converted row-house.  As soon as you enter, you'll notice a fully stocked and nicely decorated bar area equipped with tables for those unable to make a reservation.  In the back of the restaurant there are 15 or so small tables.  Overall the restaurant is quite cozy and has a very intimate vibe.  

We started our meal out with the mushroom bruschetta, which consists of three different types of mushrooms served on ciabatta bread.  The appetizer was prepared fresh, brought out relatively promptly and was excellent.  

For the main meal I had the Rigatonia alla Scarmoza sans prosciutto.  This dish is essentially a rigatoni pasta dish with smoked mozarella, peas and crushed pistachio nuts in a heavenly Parmesan cream sauce.  The pasta was simply out of this world.  My girlfriend had the Grigliata Mista di Pesce which consisted of salmon, calamari and eggplant.  She recommends this for the fish lovers out there.

We capped our meal off with pumpkin flan: two thumbs up.  All this food with a couple of Peronis to wash it down...probably one of the best meals I've had in a good while.  The service was fantastic and I appreciated their willingness to accommodate us despite being 20 minutes late.  Give yourself extra time to find parking...

Look, this place is pricey and probably isn't somewhere you'd visit often; however, if you are looking to go out for that special occasion, definitely consider it.  You will not be disappointed.

We ordered wings and poppers for apps. Wings were good with your basic traditional sauce and the poppers were, well, poppers. I ordered the Sage Burger which is a bacon cheeseburger topped with onion rings and sautéed onions. It was cooked just right. Jen had Pork Spring Rolls which untasted and thought they were OK.

When we walked in we were greeted by Conner. He told us we could sit anywhere we liked. S and I found a good spot and Conner followed us to get our drink order. He mentioned that you normally order at the counter but I guess since the dining room was not very busy he offered us table service. Let me start off by saying Conner was awesome. He was genuine, polite, and made appropriate small talk when necessary. He talked with us for a moment about the menu and then went to fetch our Iced Teas ($2.95ea).
The dining space is small but they manage to have quite a few tables, both 2 & 4 tops available. Straight back you'll find the self-serve drink bar. When you need a refill of tea or lemonade, just get up and get it yourself. The beverage bar area was clean and it appeared everyone using it was being respectful of this area. The inside is very quaint. I would imagine, however, that with the spacing of the tables if the place was packed it would be quite noisy.
The Crepe Club obviously has Crepes, savory and sweet. They also offer Quiches, Croissants and Croissant French Toast, Paninis, Sandwiches, an Acai Bowl and Salads. The beverages consist of Pressed Juices, Shakes, sodas, Coffee with various incarnations, Iced Tea and Lemonade. I feel the pricing is very good EXCEPT for the Iced Tea ($2.95). It's a buck more than soda. Not sure why. 
S & I decided to each order something different, split it, and then order and split a sweet crepe for dessert.
S ordered the Chicken Florentine Crepe ($8.95). The filling consists of grilled Chicken, sauteed Mushrooms, Spinach, Mozzarella, and Bechamel Sauce. The flavor was good. The crepe itself was a bit thick, about 1.5X what I was expecting.
I ordered the Turkey & Swiss Croissant ($8.95). Turkey, Avocado, Basil Mayo, Lettuce & Tomato. The Croissant was good but not as flakey as I feel it should have been. The carved Turkey was not dry and had good flavor. Unlike the crepe, I feel the amount of filling in the Croissant was a bit lacking.
We asked Conner to choose a sweet Crepe for us. He brought us the S'Mores Nutella ($7.95). Filled with Marshmellow and topped with Nutella and Biscoff crumbles, ours seemed to be filled with something more along the lines of Marshmellow foam and again, the crepe itself was a bit thick. The flavors were good however and it was actually quite enjoyable.
Having a cute place to eat at the Biltmore that charges between $6 & $9 for most of their items is amazing. It may not be exactly like a crepe you had in France but The Crepe Club does offer a great value. As a bonus, you can get a small version every crepe for a little more than half the price of the regular. Add a scoop of ice cream for a buck and you'll have a perfect desert for any occasion.

The food from the deli section is pretty good and they keep it fresh. All the isles are always stocked. The pharmacy is efficient but they do take for ever. Must be because of their close proximity to St. Rose de Lima, their demand is high.

The students spend the last part of their training out on the floor, allowing them the chance to interact with their future potential clientele. I could see how nervous some of the wait staff was. It did not help that one guy was being told in front of the guest how he is doing an improper job. I am not a fan of this style of education, but it is a valuable lesson on serving etiquette. 

The food was better than I was expecting. Yes, the price alone is a reason to try Technique, but the food was quite good. Few mess ups, but the implementation of questionnaires would go a long way. Meat is always the most difficult station to work.

First course was either the soup of the day or the three onion soup. My whole party got the latter, because our server suggested against the leek potato chowder. Our first course was superb. The rich broth was full of sweet onion goodness. The untoasted bread was a bummer, but it soaked up the soup well. 

The second course was the duck confit and lobster salad. The dish was excellent, the poultry and seafood complemented each other nicely. The citrus dressing tied everything together.

The third course was the Technique salad. A mound of greens topped with eggs and avocado tossed in a French dressing. Both this dressing and the Caesar lacked a tang and were more on the creamy side. Neither were bad, but could use a little more acid.

For our main course; three of us got the filet mignon and one got the salmon. We ordered all proteins to be cooked medium rare, but they were rare. None of us are particular as long as it does not cross medium and over line. The meat was tender and flavorful. The beef dishes came with a pile of mashed potatoes, cauliflower in bechamel, roasted carrots, sauteed spinach, and bernaise sauce on the side. The dish was overall pleasurable. The salmon came out at the right temperature on top a won ton pouch of vegetables and a grilled pineapple slice. It was difficult to eat, but not bad taste wise.

Our last course was a choice between the trio of profiteroles or the creme brulee. The burnt cream was prepared in the classic fashion with a crust that gave a satisfying crack. It was accompanied with a chewy ginger cookie. The three flavors of ice cream puffs were also a good way to end the meal. 

Remember to call ahead and make a reservation. I had accidentally came the week before and crashed an engineering awards dinner. Our waitress was nice enough to let us know that our tip does not go to them, but to the school, allowing me the chance to change it. I opted not to since the school uses the money for school trips and other educational activities. Just something to keep in mind when your bill comes around.",2011-08-03 05:13:42

Its upscale decor and sunroof area exudes a modern flow of hip vibes and good times. The courtyard with the cornhole arena is an excellent touch. And the food... Well the food was dec.

I had ordered the hangover helper, a monstrous plate atop of which sat a tower of chilaquile layered with pork, cheese, sour cream, and housemade salsa. Then nested above this foundation were two over easy eggs. Was I served a plate of food or a work of art?

And upon first bite, the flavors were very good. The textures were varied - starchy tortilla against gooey cheese and shredded pork. And the housemade salsa made everything taste incredibly fresh. 

But then halfway through the dish, I found the flavors began to lose their pop. The dish became heavily reliant on the salsa to sustain itself. It had very quickly begun overstaying its welcome... The chefs here must learn that less is more. While great proportions is generally appreciated, sometimes it can very often do a dish more harm than good. Pride is not the opposite of shame, it is the source. And the only true antidote to both is humility.

We searched ever chain furniture store in town to find a couch to fit a certain dimension in our living room. Settled on the LEFT facing version of the ""Raines"" sectional from Living Spaces.

Purchase was pretty painless, however, PAY ATTENTION when the cashier goes through their return policy. They charge some sort of restocking fee, blah blah blah. This is the first of many glaring issues I have with Living Spaces, and if you read reviews all over the internet, you'll see why it's bullshit.

The warehouse guy loads up our 2 sofa pieces and our flat packed bar stools into my truck. Even though both pieces looked to be the same length, I never bothered to check the sofa before he loaded; it's packed pretty good and he verified the part numbers. First mistake...

Get it home, unload in 113° heat, wrestle it into the house. We unwrap the first long piece, and get it into place. We unwrap the second piece, and before I even cut the plastic, I notice it isn't taped the same way and already has the feet installed. Get it out of the packaging, and discover we're the lucky recipients of a mislabled, returned item. The second piece was the long part of the RIGHT facing ""Raines"" sofa. We didn't have a corner piece; put the two together and you'd have a 12ft long continuous sofa, not a corner sectional. Lovely.

I inspect the wrapping a little more. On the outside is our part number, but then there's another label with someone else's name and sales order number crossed out in pen. I root around inside the plastic, and of course, I find the correct/old sticker with the part number for the RIGHT facing sofa. 

I jump on the phone. Turns out, you can NEVER call a Living Spaces store direct, only their call center. What the fucking fuck!?! First lady I talk to is clueless, and when I ask when they can redeliver the correct piece, she has the audacity to tell me that I WOULD HAVE TO RETURN IT MYSELF!?! Uhhhhh, why should I pick up the slack when the warehouse incorrectly labeled, restocked and loaded the wrong piece? I was totally livid.

So for the next 2 days, it was constant phone tag. Asking for a supervisor gets you the canned response of ""they're with another customer"" and ""they'll call you back."" We did that a few times, no call back. Eventually, I demanded that they put a supervisor on the phone, and I would be holding until they did. That worked.

Explained the problem to her, sent the pictures of the 12ft mega sofa through their incredibly archaic photo uploader, and she eventually did call back. Assured us the correct piece would be delivered that evening. It did show up, at 9:30pm on a Sunday night. This is the only reason they get 2 stars, because they corrected the issue fairly quick, and I felt so bad for their delivery guys. They told me that had 7 MORE STOPS after mine. Wow. Someone was likely to get their piece after midnight. Who the fuck is running this half-assed operation!?!

Back to the return policy. Luckily, the wrong piece for me was the previously returned piece. I paid for a NEW sofa, not a sofa that has already taken a trip to someone else's house and stayed for who knows how long. If they are charging a restocking fee on $1000+ furniture, then turning around and selling as new, then they better prepare to make a deal. Totally unacceptable, and I advise you to inspect your item's packaging very closely to ensure it's not someone else's return, with someone else's funk on it. Read other reviews about this common problem, and don't accept delivery or leave will call without getting a discount. 

Moral of the story, expect problems, act aggressively to have them addressed and corrected, refuse to let them marginalize you, but most importantly, cross your fingers and home for the best. Good luck!",2016-08-18 23:36:44

Apparently many others in Charlotte were doing the same thing because we didn't make reservations and could not be seated until about 9PM. 

In light of the deal above, my date and I ordered the following:

Shared Appetizers
1. Ahi Tuna - Excellent (a predictable, over-ordered restaurant appetizer -- but Dressler's did it justice!) - 4*
2. New Orleans Style Shrimp w/ Baguettes - better than Ahi - 5*

Salad (shared)
1.Tomato & Mozzarella - 5*

Entrees:
1. Filet w/ mashed potatoes & asparagus - 5*
2. ""Just for the Halibut"" (my date's favorite -- was sold out) so he ordered the NY Strip instead. IMHO, the NYS was not anywhere close to as good as my filet but it came with french fries so all things balance out. ;) A strong 4*

Dessert
1. We shared the chocolate cake with ice cream and it did not disappoint. 5*

We were so full and we both loved the meal. The waitress was great too. A great Monday night out in our beautiful Queen City. I have to say, however, Dressler's is a great choice with or without a deal. I am not sure they'll offer this deal again but will readily return. 
Enjoy!",2015-09-29 18:11:29

Sim was our server and he was incredibly funny and entertaining. Definitely ask for him as your server ! I really like how they cook the food for you (since I'm a very lazy cook). Keep in mind this place is not AYCE but the meat here is high quality and the food is delicious. I much rather have quality and feel just satisfied than over stuffing myself at AYCE. THE SHORT RIBS WERE SO FREAKIN GOOD !! My favorite part though was the green tea rice pop at the end which comes in the combo :) Love the ambiance here too. The music they play here is fire !! I highly recommend this place for a date night , or even a casual lunch/dinner with friends and family.",2016-04-27 05:56:43

So I decided to try Bobby's in search of my Chinese staple and unfortunately it was just OK for me.  We came on a Sunday afternoon so the main location was closed and all customers were redirected to their Pho Side.  We were still able to order dim sum and they also had a tea time menu.

It wasn't really busy at the time and service was ok - typical Asian service where if you need something ... just ask!  I'm ok with this as you don't have a server standing at your table and it's just what's to be expected.

We ordered:  steamed bbq pork buns, hargaw, cantonese chow mein and 3 types of bbq w/steamed rice.  Everything tasted ok just subpar and nothing memorable for me.  The bbq was quite tasty and fresh.  They brought the steamed rice in a metal container to keep warm - nice touch!  I just kept comparing it to my fav place in Toronto so everything was ok.

When Kuge arrived, he noticed Sushi Mon was more packed than the his Smackdown Hotel.  But luckily Kuge and two of his friends were greeted instantly upon walking in by the friendly hostess and were placed at the sushi bar.

It was as if a double rainbow appeared in front of Kuge as he gazed at the AYCE menu and what Sushi Mon had to offer.  With a great selection of sushi and nigari, Kuge knew he had to try many different kinds of rolls to get the full Sushi-Mon experience.

Some rolls The Great One ordered:

Chubby Roll - Phenomenal,  it was only a 5 roll count but it was a great size and Kuge had no problems with the roll.

Sunrise Roll - Since Kuge isn't a great sushi elitist, nor is professional food reviewer, he is stuck using generic terms without much description.  But other wise, Kuge believes this roll had a variety of flavors and was decent.

9-1-1 Roll - The Great One never takes spicy rolls seriously since he loves to pretend to be Mexican and believes he can handle spice.  The 9-1-1 roll completely destroyed Kuge's tastebuds with insane spice he never expected to happen.  Unfortunately the spice overcame any flavor Kuge would try to find.  

Fresh Water Eel - Alright

There were a few other ""special"" rolls that Kuge ordered, but he is sadden that they were only average at best.

The service from the cooks and speed of the order Kuge received was great.  The staff was friendly, although the friends of The Great One complained that they didn't have that good of service which displeases Kuge.

No worries though, Kuge acknowledges that he strives to create perfect reviews but even they are long winded.  So in order to please his fans:

TL;DR - Kuge was saddened that most of the rolls he ordered were average (with an exception of chubby roll) and even though the service was good for him, he cannot give Sushi Mon  no more than 3.5 Rock Bottoms out of 5.  He definitely prefers Sushi Mon over Hakari for AYCE but that's as far as he'll go.",2011-01-22 00:23:18
hRCqEoRxgkCBuSZzAJYHhA,KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,OFCvoGqjZ8LpFvRIIFA71Q,3,1,0,0,"I was here last Friday during their 7th annual Happening Gourmand promotion, where a few restaurants in the Old Port take part in reduced price table d'hote menus. I have dined at Vieux Port Steakhouse on another occasion and can say the quality and portion is usually better when you're paying full price.
When we arrived close to 6, the restaurant looked empty but were told everything had been reserved and we would either have to sit at the bar, or finish our meal within an hour and a half. We opted for the latter and were seated at a tiny table, below the staircase, but near the fireplace.

I remember the previous time I was here, my friend and I, early 20's were dressed casually, despite it not being a busy day or time, we were seated on the second floor. It seemed that the main (and nicest) dining area downstairs was kept for the best dressed diners, or fancier looking, mature crowd. I rarely feel this way elsewhere, but I really believe they wanted us hidden. So I strongly recommend a reservation if you want any chance at a good table.

Naturally, serviced was speedy since they wanted us out fast. I ordered a mesclun salad with a dijon honey vinaigrette, filet mignon medallion and blueberry cake on a fixed 25$ menu.
My starter was delicious, so simple and sweet that it made me salivate for more to come. Beef was cooked the way I wanted it, accompanied with shrimps and supposed roasted garlic mashed potatoes but I couldn't taste it. The green beans and shrimps were dry, I actually had to smear butter onto them that was intended for my bread. 
Right before ordering, the waiter did warn us that it was going to be just one medallion, which implied that there might not be much on the plate and he was right, the portion is much smaller than what I would normally expect. As for dessert, my cake was nothing memorable, I've had tastier supermarket treats.

The special menu is a teaser, a sampler for what this establishment can offer. It may seem like a good opportunity to try this restaurant if you like deals, but for a few dollars extra, you'll be a lot more satisfied. Forgo the salad and generic gateau, get 2 of their filets mignons medallions on a fuller size plate for 29$.",2014-01-22 23:29:30

Upon walking into the restaurant, the host is very courteous, greets me and takes me up to my reserved seat. Less than 30 seconds after I sat down, the server swung by and served me water right away and provided the menu. I decided on the crispy polenta fries and small napoli, and these were definitely a decent choice. The crunch the garlic bits had added exquisite texture to the napoli pasta; there was plenty of seafood and roasted grape tomatoes. The salsa verde gave the pasta a Mexican edge. The portions were generous and prices were reasonable for the quality of food--I was stuffed to the brim with a small pasta dish for $14.98. The server was very prompt and visited our table often to check on us--excellent service.

The burger has this crust around it that kinda hurts the gums and roof of your mouth when you bite into. Pretty sure it was the cheese the melts over. Get by the crusty part and the burger does taste fresh. If you like skinny shoestring crunchy fries then you will love these. For me not so much it was like eating warmed up potato sticks from a can. I did see managers and maybe a owner going around asking what they thought they never did come by our table prob since most of the fries and 1/3 of the burger was sitting there untouched. If it was the owner he was sitting outside playing with his cell phone more then asking people what they thought and it was lunch time. Personally I'll stick with Five Guys. Little more expensive but you get what you pay for with Five Guys!!!!,2013-03-06 19:45:25

Those were my EXACT words when I tried the sesame chicken. This place is definitely worth a try. The chef here is a magician.. its like turning a cow to tofu while still maintaining the same beef texture. Neat-o! Overall the quality of the food was good however the flavors were just.. not quite right. Everything tasted like soy sauce to me. The restaurant was super clean and the service was great. 

Here's a list of what my friends and I ordered:

Sesame chicken: This was probably my favorite dish. The texture of the 'chicken' and the crunchiness of the coating was really just perfect. The flavor however was a little off for me.

Crunchy spicy eggplant: Definitely a must order.  

Pineapple duck: This was probably my least favorite dish. The texture of the 'duck' was alright with me however the flavor tasted a little burnt to me. Can't really describe it but it didn't taste good to me. 

Walnut shrimp: One of my favorites from dinner too. Texture was good and flavor was good.",2013-06-05 01:08:29

Breakfast is one of my favorite meals. It's so simple and yet it can be so exciting if executed well. It was with high hopes that I walked through the doors of Black Bear Diner. Upon initially entering the establishment, I was overwhelmed with bears. Bear pictures, bear statues, bear memorabilia everywhere! It was cute and welcoming so I went with it.

Unfortunately, I didn't find the food as charming. I ordered the California bacon benedict. Love benedicts and love bacon. Also love avocado. What can go wrong?

Everything went wrong. Well that's prolly too harsh. It'd be better to say that I was served a plate of mediocrity. The dish was drenched in hollandaise. Soaked the English muffin and made it soggy. Drowned out the nutty buttery flavor of the avocado. And it cascaded through the spinach. Gave it the texture of seaweed. At least it didn't kill the bacon which was cut rather thick and tasty. It didn't taste bad or anything. It just kinda didn't taste like anything. Just very slimy with hollandaise sauce. And the sauce itself was pretty bland too.

Also, a perfect breakfast can quickly go south if the hash browns aren't done right. And to do hash browns right, they need crispiness. The hash browns here are not crisp at all. They were crazy mushy and soft, failing to provide the complimenting crunch that goes so well with the thick strong creaminess of hollandaise over eggs benedict.

But it was served with fresh yummy fruit which was nice I guess!",2012-02-09 19:02:59

Ok I've challenged myself more than once with the car bomb only rule. DO NOT DO THIS! Trust me - your tomorrow with thank me. It's a great idea in theory though. They also have a great selection of beers on tap, highlighting local brews of course. And the whiskey.... yeah they aren't running out any time soon. 

Surprisingly the food is pretty good. I mean its bar food... but is good. The fried mozzarella squares appear not to be frozen and the dipping sauce doesn't come from a can or jar. STOP! People are making bar food from scratch? Fancy! The salads are pretty good. 

So the idea is to go to Kennedy's on Monday - all you can eat crab legs. So good! Never over cooked and they steam the legs with some magical ol' bay something or other. The legs come with garlic butter and some hot sauce wonderfulness which you can never have enough of BUT I always give mine away because the crab legs are so sweet and tender tasting that it would be a shame to mask the flavor. Sad news though, The price is about to go up again to $29.99 - bummer. Still an outstanding deal in my opinion.

M&B is a bit tricky to find the first time (enter from Ontario Street) but well worth the effort.  They serve up a high-quality casual Italian experience with old classics as well as some creative flair -original, but not out in left field.

My companion and I shared the Caprese salad to start.  In enjoyed the light, bright dressing and loved the touch of coarse salt that gave an occasional crunch-and-punch without getting in the way the rest of the time.  Some pepper for the tomatoes would have been dandy, although I'm sure some purists would argue that next to the mozzarella, they're better without.  I'm a firm believer that tomatoes should be seasoned once cut, and I'll be sure to ask for the mill next time.

The pizzas are must-try's; although flesh was sparse on the menu I found myself spoiled for choice once I resigned myself to the reality that a real pizza isn't supposed to look like a killing field.  As it happened, I had the Tirolesse (speck, brie and arugula) and was happy to see enough dry-cured ham to put the greens in their place when my dish arrived.  My date had the Margherita, but swapped smoked provolone for mozzarella - a nice choice.

The pizzas were served uncut but without pretense (unlike a certain Terronto joint known for its unyielding adherence to traditional presentations), with a trio of hot sauces that made great dips for the crust.  The crust was delicious on its own, and I found myself dipping sparingly.  As for the toppings, my trio made a great combination although (carnivore that I am) I found myself pulling the speck off and moving it down on its own on more than one occasion.  Not to worry - Brie and Arugula enjoyed time together all the same (they make such a cute couple).

I also found a new wine to enjoy - the Toscana Chianti was absolutely fantastic and I'll be sure to make it a part of my home stash just as soon as I can hit the LCBO.  

Just two gripes, and minor ones at that.  While we were competently accommodated, I felt a few times like we were getting a big-box-style upsell.  And some sharper knives would be nice if you're not going to cut my pizza for me.  Neither issue was nearly enough of a bother to cut into an otherwise spot-on meal.

I now find myself looking for a reason to head east again - I'll be back to try the pasta post haste.",2011-02-19 19:11:56

To be honest, it's the attitude on King St. Although I found the food and service to be excellent both times prior, I avoid the King St. corridor because of its somewhat douchey vibes.

Buca still has good food, but the ennui we experienced on the part of almost all the staff except for our server, was staggeringly inhospitable and bordering on rude. We arrived and the hostess was more like a miniature undertaker than a person who is responsible for first impressions. She checked for our reservation without a smile and devoid of any sign of humanity. She informed us our table wasn't ready, and that we could wait on the bench. My friend and I waited for about 10 minutes and another reservation for 2 at 8:30 arrived. They, too, had to wait for their table in the hall. However, the hostess asked them if they wanted to wait in the bar and have a drink. If we could have gone there 10 minutes ago, why were we waiting in a temporary entrance hallway with all the charm of a holding room for human cargo? So we approached the hostess and asked to wait in the bar. 
She took us there, again, without a smile and both of us were definitely not feeling very welcome or happy to be there. We thought a drink might cure this. We were approached by a very stiff sommelier who recommended a new cocktail, which I agreed to. My friend needed a moment and he seemed completely irritated by this. We also picked a wine for dinner ahead of time. We were very good customers. You think he would have smiled or been friendly or gracious. He was like a dark cloud that we didn't want to return. And I always want someone who has wine to return!!!

I think that food and warmth go hand in hand. Even most of the waiters who served me in France were more gregarious than these two members of staff we first encountered. Major douchey attitude.

Our server was thankfully, very nice. She was sweet, smart, coursed our food out well for us and deserved her tip. I don't need someone to be fake or irritating, but at least be someone that doesn't make me wince each time you come to the table.

Olives and bread knots were nice. Pig's Ears were delicious and crispy. The gnocchi with fiddleheads were like soft carb clouds and the pizza with mushrooms and Gorgonzola was thin, crisp and offered a perfect splay of cheese and toppings with each bite.

Our food was great, but what's with pretentious, surly people who greet you? The food doesn't taste as good when you're around unhappiness. You don't make yourself more attractive to customers by frowning and acting like you couldn't care less. And you don't have to be stiff as a board to be professional. What I loved about Alo, was that the service staff were not canned-- they were real and displayed traits of their personality. But they were knowledgeable and happy to help. To be fair, perhaps management is poor and that's why the staff were unhappy. People often have reasons for not smiling. So if poor management is an issue here, it should be addressed and perhaps the staff will treat the guests better.

With all the other Italian places in the city, I probably won't come back to Buca again. The food was good, but the hospitality, with the exception of our server, was quite sour.

With the lack of warmth, I'm surprised the food gets cooked!",2017-05-16 13:03:00

My starting point was to start calling the local shops that showed up on the yelp search. Some of them declined outright and some said it will be sent via FedEx overnight for a ridiculous sum! not being the one to give up easily I stumbled upon to this gem.
I called in and the sales person asked the name of the hotel and said I would be called back within 5 min after she has had a chance to talk to the local delivery service they used. 
Like clock work I got a call back and I was offered a delivery for a very reasonable charge. I already knew what kind of chocolates I wanted as I had a chance to look at their website. 
Icing on the cake was I was assured the box of chocolate will be delivered within 2 hours with a note from me. This is how service is supposed to be folks in a city where it is hard to come by unless one spends big $$$.

They talked about it a lot, so of course we had to go when I was visiting Toronto last week.  I've had pretty good experiences with all-you-can-eat sushi places in Toronto, this place now included.

We went at lunch time, so the $13.95 price was great for the value.  Inside is a very clean and simple decor, nothing overwhelming and not too dull that you are bored.  We had a great laugh at the fact that they were playing Kenny G's Christmas album as background music (as identified by my friend's roommate - apparently his parents are fans).  I was told that they actually play this music all the time, which is ok though because it's not too loud to be distracting.

I found the quality of the food to be quite good.  The rolls stayed together, not too much rice was used, and orders were presented relatively quickly.  The salmon on this particular day was absolutely delicious and a fave of mine is now the Green Dragon Roll.  Miso soup was also acceptable, not too salty or anything like that.  (Actually, just writing this review now is making me hungry for sushi!)

Service was quick and efficient and there was no wait to get water refills, they're always there!  Everyone that was working on that afternoon was quite pleasant.

It was great that you could tailor the event to fit within your specific major and needs. We learned a lot and my kid won a raffle at the end of the event as well.  I will mention that almost every one doing a presentation should have some speech or presentation courses. I've never heard so many ""UMMs"" by so many presenters. One (who wasn't a student but an alumni) in particular had 172 UMMs in a 40 minute presentation about campus housing!

I ordered a lychee bubble tea with half pearls and half popping jelly. They seem to have a number of flavors in each to choose from as well as from their regular jelly.

It wasn't the most flavorful bubble tea I have ever had. And I really should've just gone for the regular jelly instead of the popping kind ( which seems better suited for frozen yogurt ) 

The sub  was a different story - it was  generous portions of both chicken and beef cooked to perfection and let's you chose  what you wanted on top ! 

I decided on cucumber, cilantro, grated carrots and the thai sauce on a whole wheat bun. It was quite a large size and I was able to split it with my girlfriend.

My significant other and I were meeting our friend who had arrived earlier. We were all immediately greeted and told we could either wait for a table in the main area or an immediate one in the back room. We choose the back room. It is just a smaller room with only two table, nothing wrong with that! I did like that is was more quiet and private.

We started out with drinks. I tried the honey ginger sake hot. They infuse it in house and I have to say this was delicious! The flavors paired very well with the residual sake flavor. It was nice and hot which was a nice contrast to the rainy dreary day it was. 

For food I ordered the Miso soup to start and the Fire Roll(the table shared this one), Spicy Shrimp Roll and the New York Roll. The Miso Soup was one of the best ones I have had in the area. It had your classic Miso flavor but with a little bit of heat and was not bland at all. 

All of the rolls we had were very fresh tasting and had great flavor to them. There was not to much rice which was nice. Overall our meal was very balanced. We mostly stuck to sushi but some of there hot entrees look very good as well. My favorite was the Fire Roll this one had a kick to it and tempura Salmon. I had never had Salmon in the tempura style before but it was very good.

This is a small, slightly funky down home Thai place, probably family run and authentic.  It is the authentic that is important to me, since I've spent time in Thailand and have somewhat of a working knowledge of the food (not an expert by any means, tho).
Had the pad thai with no spice which was good, and the papaya salad which was super fresh--amazing, cause every other place in Phoenix I have ordered it seems as if it had been pre-made and sitting an hour.  HOWEVER, unless you are really into hot (I am not), watch what heat level you order.  I ordered #3 level of heat, and the papaya salad was SO hot my face turned beet red.  I could eat it....but whew! I was drinking water with it like crazy.  The trick here for people who aren't into alot of heat is not to order it done by the cook, but do it yourself as they put a tray with spices on the table for you to spice up your own things if you wish.  I'm doing that next time I visit here.
Everyone at the table seemed to really like their food, and it all looked good, too.  I'd like to try some of their drunken noodles and coconut soup next time around.
Service was more than decent considering what a crowd was there (maybe 12+ of us alone), and this was a Wednesday night so who knows what it is like on weekends.  Regardless, you will be served as efficiently as they can since the food is not premade it seems and totally fresh.  I wouldn't go there when I was in a rush, because--with these Thai one owner family run places that cook each order separately and super fresh--it takes a little while for the food to come, so patience is a virtue at these sorts of restaurants.

Three Rivers Arts Festival was founded in 1960 by the Women's Committee of the Carnegie (that's Car-NEG-ee for you non Yinzers) Museum of Art, and started as a small outdoor venue for local artists. This year there were 280 booths in the juried artists market, with everything from metalwork jewlery to paintings to sculpture being offered for sale. I'm impressed anew each year as I stroll through the market at both the quality and scope of the art that's displayed here. The festival brings in both local artists and those who travel the country with their wares. It's also a showcase for performing artists, with the Dollar Bank stage featuring quite a few great acts this year, including Buckwheat Zydeco, who played last night to an appreciative audience. I think he forgot he wasn't in New Orleans at one point, as he tried to rouse us with a ""Who Dat?"" call and response. I think Doug and I may have been the only ones to get into it. I could have told him, ""Yinz are in Stiller country"". (that's ""you're in Steeler country"" for you non Yinzers). There's dance and theater, with performances scheduled every day during the fest, and lots of activities for the kiddies. The food is your typical festival fare for this neck of the woods...sausages on rolls, chicken on a stick, pierogies and stuffed cabbage, dogs and burgers, smoothies and lemonade. I understand there was a lobster burger available this year, but I was busy eating too much kettle corn to try it. We put off our visit to the fest this year until the last day, as we wanted to hear Buckwheat Zydeco play. Next year I'll try a week day, as the narrow walkways were clogged with people yesterday. That's my only gripe; it's congested. However, that also means it's thriving, so let's focus on the blessing of that. The festival is free, including all musical acts and performances.

What I did enjoy about the Elara was the convenience of having the Planet Hollywood mall attached to the Elara which made for easy access to Planet Hollywood and to the mall and restaurants. The pool over at the Elara is also really nice and the smoke free and casino free hotel made for a better stay. Overall I probably wouldn't stay at the Elara as their are better hotels on the strip for a cheaper price.",2015-05-19 02:48:44

I ordered the Ruben - which I never do - because I wasn't in the mood to be picky, it was very good and reasonably priced. The fries were over salty I couldn't eat more than half of it. This no gastro-pub: burgers, chicken wings and the traditional sandwiches, no plates - I honestly don't get the raving five star reviews, they raised my expectations way too high.

The rebranded Avenue Club and Bubble Up Bar has been given a much needed facelift but stayed true to their mid-century roots with both the decor and menu. 

The space is peaceful, sleek and modern, yet comfortable and not at all pretentious. We attended a pre-opening event the Friday before their planned Sunday public opening. They said there were a few furniture items yet to arrive, so they will continue to enhance the decor.

The cocktail list is diverse and impressive. The menu includes pictures of the drinks, which I thought was a nice touch and practical. I love bubbly cocktails and quickly gravitated to theirs. They also premix a tiki drink and one other and have them kegged. We shared samples of both and they were excellent. The tiki drink is a great throwback to the mid 20th century cocktail party vibe.

The food we sampled at different stations throughout the night was excellent. They make their own hummus, chicken pate and wonderful bread, including a pretzel bread. I was particularly fond of the hummus and the lightly pickled vegetables for the bahn mi. Throughout our visit, servers brought around samples of many menu items. The fish fry was so good and the slaw was perfect. My husband even loved the slaw, and he's usually critical of slaw. I also enjoyed the pork chop sample very much.

The staff working were all eager to explain the food and drinks and were genuinely excited about the opening and how great the menu is. I loved their enthusiasm.

I've never experienced baos, at least not in this kind of modern format, so I don't really have anything to fall back and base a solid review on how bao's in this style are meant to be.

My fiance and I actually stumbled upon this place when we leaving after a dinner's night out at Kiku AYCE right next door, so we told ourselves we'll give it a try since it's something we've never ventured.

Upon entering, the place was completely empty. It was just me, my fiance, two staff members and a TV playing CP24. On first look, I thought the place was kept very clean, has good interior design and straight forward of where you gotta order your food. The one thing that did irk me a little is aside from the main menu right above the cashier, they've got specials written on this huge chalk board, that on first glance I thought was just for design. But there was actually a few other food options to be offered and kicked myself in the butt for not looking more carefully.

We both ordered two pork belly steamed baos and a bulgogi kimchi fries to share, or it might be called a poutine, I can't recall.

On first glance, the food looked really great! Presentation is what I expected of it since it looked relatively close to the menu picture above the cashier area, very Instagram worthy. On a personal level, I grew up never really eating pork so I have a bit of a sensitive pork tongue I guess you could say. The pork belly bao first hit me in the face with this really pungent pork flavour, though, don't hold this against the restaurant since it's not their fault, I just didn't expect the pork flavour to be that strong. For whatever reason it tastes that strongly, I will never know, but after two bites I was done with it. I did like the flavour of whatever sauce was inside, the fresh vegetables and the actual bao bread (?) itself. It was light with that perfect amount of sweetness, I actually wouldn't mind eating it on it's own!

The bulgogi kimchi fries were a bit of a disappointment though. The fries were great on their own as they held up their own crispiness and delicious flavour among the heavy hitters of the kimchi and bulgogi. What got me down about this dish was how the kimchi tasted a little old ... I know it's weird to say, but it's almost as if it was almost 'over' fermented I guess? Maybe not enough people order anything with kimchi so their using really old kimchi? I couldn't really say. The bulgogi was nothing mind blowing. It tastes like my homemade bulgogi when I had first self taught myself how to cook, that's what it reminded me of.

I really am willing to try It's a Bao Time another chance since I don't seem to know any other places like this in the Markham area as I am not as open to travelling downtown. I'm really looking forward to their Japanese karaage bao and their deep fried fish bao which also looked phenomenal!

- Awesome array of sauces to choose from
- Normal selection of beer, but good thing it comes in tubs!
- Offers other things on the menu, but come on, why would you bother?

- The Hot Scale... pretty true to scale, I also find it gets more vinegar-y as you up the hot scale.  We were wavering between Superhot and Death, and I think we would have been able to handle death...
- Suicide, let's talk about this, it will make your eyeballs sweat.  I'm not kidding, I tried it once in Philadelphia, the sauce hit my tongue and it went numb for 15 minutes... 'duff said.",2010-07-18 01:17:38

It is a winning company that dates back to 1967 when Ralph Ward and Bud Williams founded Waremart Foods (sound familiar). Ralph and Bud were visionaries. Their vision was a supermarket chain retailing food in gigantic stores at low prices. Their vision was over and above certain competitors including one on the other side of the 215. Instead of the shortsighted vision of using people by paying them so little and asking for so much, Ralph and Bud reached out to their employees. What certain companies call labor, Ralph and Bud called shareholders. In 1985, Waremart became an employre-owned company. Employee-owners became involved in their company. One of the decisions they made was in 1999 when they renamed Waremart to Winco. Winco would stand for Winning Company and the original states they operated in: W=Washington, I=Idaho, N=Nevada, C=California,  and O=Oregon. Eventually Winco would grow to 93 stores that now include Arizona and Texas. The stores now average in the ballpark of 85,000 square feet.

  The vision statement of Winco is charging the lowest prices. When I shop at Winco, I shop in a no-frills environment. It is something that I accept to get value. I cannot pay by credit card. Winco accepts cash and debit card. Overhead music is the pipes and fans. At Winco, I bag my own groceries. And at Winco, I could wait on a long line because there are only a couple of employee-owner cashiers.

  This very Winco is off Decatur Boulevard, immediately south of the 215 exit in North Las Vegas. It is a similar location to the Henderson Winco which is off Stephanie Street immediately north of the 215. The Winco strategy is to build a few stores in a city instead of flooding every 5 mile market area. The Winco strategy utilities very little advertising. Again, this goes to saving money. The people drive a distance to powershop at Winco.

  The neat thing about this Winco is it is 24-7stop shopping. At the north end of their clean parking lot is Target. The way I see it is that on a nice day, people could park their vehicle, then walk to Target for the pharmacy and general merchandise. Then they could shop in Winco for the food and consumables. 

  The thing that impresses me about Winco is that it is clean and surprisingly upbeat. Food 4 Less, a smaller competitor is dingy and unappealing to spend time in. From the moment that I walk into The Wall of Fame, where Winco showcases the best deals; I enter a bright and clean store with bright white exterior walls. The layout is different with long horizontal aisles in place of small vertical aisles. But the aisles are wide and the shelves aren't too high up. Unlike certain superretailers this is an enjoyable place to shop.

  For the most part, Winco is the bomb for pricing. A couple of examples. Birds Eye stir fry dinner which is $3.78 at Walmart was $2.98 here. Sunkist Strawberry soda was 98 cents. Cheeto's which is currently $2.59 at Walmart is $1.78 here. And Campbell's Select Italian Wedding Soup which is $1.98 at Walmart was $1.48 here. Winco is at least 85,000 square feet featuring great bargains. And the best part was zero out of stocks.

   Winco is a winning company for food value. I rate this Winco a winning four stars.",2014-07-01 04:08:20

I am happy to report that the place is as fantastic as it looks.

All the dishes we tried were delicious. My favorite was the oysters on the half shell, which were served with a wonderfully flavorful mignonette. We also tried, and loved, the broccoli, the cauliflower, the beet salad, the spinach flatbread, and the prosciutto/cornbread board.

The only item I was disappointed with was the restaurant's signature cocktail--The Libertine Social. It just didn't work for me. I probably should have focused more on the ingredient list (""Will I really like Campari with limoncello, orange juice, and egg white?"") before I ordered it.

The service throughout our meal was exemplary. We arrived slightly before 6 p.m. on Sunday night, and we let the hostess and the server know right away that we had tickets for the 7 p.m. Blue Man show at the Luxor. They not only ensured that we got our food very quickly, so that we actually had time to enjoy eating it, but they also let the manager know, and he stopped by to make sure that the service was meeting our time constraints. I was impressed and appreciative.

Two final notes: First, like almost every other restaurant on the Strip these days, Libertine Social's prices are high. The signature cocktail was $17. For two of us, each having one cocktail, sharing a half dozen oysters and one salad, two sides, one flat bread, and a board, the total bill, including tax, was $138. We were happily stuffed, but this is not bargain dining. Second, Libertine Social accepts MLife Express Comps, which is happy news for gamblers who like to eat well. The staff also knows that the restaurant accepts Express Comps, and the payment process was quick and easy (MLife players will know that this is not the case at every restaurant that accepts Express Comps).",2017-03-07 20:19:47

Simply put, everyone needs to visit the Mattress Factory. 

It's very inexpensive and well worth it. You're also allowed to take photos throughout. The staff is very friendly and the gift shop is great. Only downside to the gift shop is they didn't have a shirt in the size I wanted. I requested to be notified when it came in, and here a few months later, I've still heard nothing.

However, the exhibits make up for it. They are very unique not only in the aspect that you won't find them anywhere else, but the mediums are of a large variety. The day I went I was able to go to both buildings. The first one had a lot of wooden and metal exhibits as well as a floor that was completely dark and had some light exhibits. When you get off the elevator it is pitch black with only a spotlight over a plaque on the wall informing the visitors how to get into the rooms. 

The second building had amazing art work in the way of room decor which was great to see.

This location exceeded my expectations.   It's in an old building which is really cool.  The rooms are very modern and laid out well.  The other nice thing is the security aspect.  You need your room key to get to the room floors which is a nice touch.   It is in he heart of downtown and close to anything that you need in Pittsburgh.  

The only miss that I would point is that the valet parking I have seen that comment on past reviews.   I think that $32 / night for parking is a little ridiculous.   I would have no issues paying $20 but anything over that is a little much.

i was really regretting not getting the 60-something gig iphone5.

i decided to sell my 32g on craigslist and started calling around ATT stores to find the next up.

everyone was out of the 60-something gig iphone and no one knew where to find one. all the stores i called basically said calling around myself was the best way to find one because they have no way of tracking them. 

until Jaime answered my call. he took down my number and got to hunting FOR ME. he found one some how somewhere and told me he could have it at his store within the hour.

WHAT?! ok magic man! 

come to find out he picked it up himself and brought it to the store. when i got there he traded out my old cell case for a brand new one and gave me some of the best customer service i have ever had.

he was friendly and really went out of his way. 

even after i finished my purchase he was willing to answer questions for the guy who purchased my phone from craigslist. 

jaime is worth the drive. the other guys who were working were also SO friendly. two of them were going on their lunch and offered to get me a soda...and i wasn't even their customer. seriously. so nice.

Maybe because this establishment was rated so high and all the hype about the Lobster Pho...but anywho, here it is.

We ordered:
Lobster Pho (MP - today was $30): Sure there is a lobster presented in this bowl, but seriously, it's just the typical beef broth, and a broken down lobster where the meat is pretty tough to chew.  It probably would have been better if the broth itself is made of a seafood broth?  Pretty disappointed. 

Braised Pork Belly in Young Coconut Juice ($9): Few pieces of cubed pork belly, one egg (halved), served with a bowl of rice, and a bowl of pickled cabbage and carrots.  Earl enjoyed the pickled cabbage.  This was an ok dish.  Nothing that will warrant us to order it again.

House Special Oysters ($10): We ordered the smaller portion (consisted of 6 oysters).  They were topped with soy sauce, tobiko, slice of jalepeno and something else.  The oysters were small and not sweet.  

Sculpin ($8): Earl was pretty excited that they have Sculpin here.
Overall, food was mediocre at best, based on the items we ate.  Taste does not justify the cost.

The ambience, however, was great.  There was a bar, and many tvs to watch sports, news, and whatever else.

You order things that your friends like and you order a lot (more than you could possibly imagine eating). You eat a little bit of everything (you share!).

I've been back two more times since the first, and my appreciation for this place grew each time (a visit to 8oz made me appreciate this place even more, but everybody else seems to feel different).
 
You pay more than you would at all ayce place, but the quality, the flavor, the sides, and the portion size all make it worth it. I have a relatively big appetite, and I've always been satisfied well before dessert arrived at the end of the family combos. 
 
So, yeah, I recommend you go for the family combo. My favorite is combo 3. I like the option for skirt steak because that's not something I usually see offered at the kbbq places I go to. And the spicy Angus short ribs are super tasty. The sweet and spicy is so well balanced - not too sweet with plenty of kick. I've had both the pork ribs and the spicy pork belly. It's hard to choose, but I do love a the occasional crunch of brisket bone you get with the pork rib that you don't often get as frequently with pork belly.
 
Make sure not to neglect your veggies. They're tasty, but it's easy to forget to give them adequate grill attention when you've got soup, meat, rice (don't forget to ask for some), and banchan to consume as well. Also everybody loves the rice pop ice cream sandwiches. I enjoy them. They're good. I'd throw them a 4/5, but whenever I come with someone their in-the-moment review of them typically feels like a 5/5. 
 
Their service has been good every time I've been there. My only complaint in that department is Halloween. I would prefer they not wear makeup that mimics disfigurement. It didn't stop me from enjoying my meal, but I found it off-putting.

Hostess was friendly and informed us of a 10 minute wait asking if we wanted to leave a phone number to shop which I thought was very nice, but we chose to wait on a comfy couch as my feet were hurting from shopping in heels. 

Mija & I perused menu while waiting less than 10 minutes. We were asked if a booth was ok and seated at a large and comfortable booth in back. Previous reviewers have knocked the decor, but I liked the industrial feel to black walls & high ceilings and those big red booths. 

Our server arrived promptly and was very courteous. We ordered immediately: a to go Lobster Roll (which I intended as a treat for my Dad, more on that later) Repo Man for me (small, expensive but packing a punch) a strawberry milkshake for Mija (small, expensive but she LOVED it). I had the veggie burger and Mija build your own with cheddar and avocado. 

My veggie burger is pictured: I found it to be very good, but impossible to eat without fork and knife as it was very loosely packed and almost undercooked (no sear on outside) however it was very moist and tasty and anything but run of the mill (4*s) the bun was a brioche but rather greasy for my taste. Accompanying chips were great. One thing I truly missed was a pickle: how are you going to serve burgers and no pickle?! Mija's burger was cooked to a perfect medium and she proclaimed it ""bomb"" Service was attentive though I did have to ask once for water refills. As in previous reviews, I have to agree that there did appear to be a large number of staff on the floor. 

There were a couple of odd instances that occurred at nearby tables: a woman knocked her chair over and took out an entire tables worth of a poor waiters tray with it: immediately several staff members rallied to clean up and even reassured the visibly shaken woman that ""it happens all the time"" thought that was nice. Then, a very pregnant lady with her husband and toddler were seated across from us in another booth. Both the husband (and I) said ""she can't fit in there comfortably"" and then, oddly, she tried and when they asked for another spot the hostess replied ""yes but I'll have to check where because I'm not sure how to work who's table is up next!"" strange thing to say, almost like she was thinking out loud. 

Here is where my Pet Peeve-omoter kicks in: the waiter boxed our leftovers & I was perusing bill. It was $49 & change with a $1 ""to go"" charge added for Lobster Roll. Personally, at a ""premium"" joint, I found this to be tacky. When I got home and looked at the ""lobster roll"" my heart sank. It was literally minuscule on a brioche the size of a golf ball! The claw meat was so tiny I was convinced it wasn't lobster at all. (see photo) tasted it pre run this morning and it was not at all what I was expecting: very little ""lobster"" lots of peppers:filler..not at all the juicy succulent New England/Hamptons Lobstah Roll. Sadly, it went into the trash. 

So, we had some hits: service, atmosphere, shake & we both enjoyed the burgers. I do however agree that for the price, you are not receiving bang for your buck. Burger Bar, LBS are better value IMHO. Lobster Roll a complete miss. 

I'd go back for sure, there are several salads that sound divine (particularly a pear/walnut ensemble) and I enjoy Tivoli as a nearby destination to shop, listen to music etc. 

Hopefully they will work out the kinks. I rounded up from 2.5 to 3 because I see potential here and have been searching out ""the perfect veggie burger"" for a while now. As a former vegan & mainly pescetarian, a great veggie burger will make me loyal beyond compare.",2012-06-02 19:15:16

The shelter keeps an awesomely cute and updated website listing all their available animals (dogs, cats etc) and even have little write-ups and cute pics about EACH ONE. This is a tremendous effort and so special! Their website is updated almost every day.

 Having had 3 dogs (all of them being SPCA rescues), I cannot gush about how amazing the experience of rescuing a shelter animal can be. I think about my wonderful dogs (2 have passed) every single day. 

I urge you to support shelter animals (they have lots of pure breds here too) and to also support this particular SPCA as they do very good work, they are not government funded and they are no-kill.

All local restaurants, foodservice giant Compass Group chefs, celebrity chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Anthony Bourdain and more made it a true food experience.  

Taste of Charlotte used to have a fair amount of local restaurants.  Most no longer participate because it's not worth the money and time to set up a booth (I've talked to several owners who feel this way).  The tokens also now cost more, and are a bit of a pain.  This year there are only 30 restaurants, and almost all of them chains.  They really need to rethink this and maybe try to bring some of what Charlotte Shout once was.  The only good thing about Taste of Charlotte is walking through and getting free samples from some of the sponsors.",2011-06-11 00:15:31

They take reservations and were really accommodating even on a Friday night. The server was super nice and gave us tips on what to get and how much food to order. Its a small plates restaurant with small portion sizes so we ordered a lot of food. 

We got mac and cheese, pork ribs, pork belly, spare ribs and beets (we wanted to try and be a little healthy) and the apple cobbler for dessert! Perfect amount of food for 4 people. 

The mac and cheese gnocchi was so yummy! Smothered and cheese with bread crumbs on top- one of my favs for sure! You could also add additional pork belly to this dish as a topping and unfortunately I only found that out after ordering but that would be awesome! Highly recommend this dish. 

The spareribs was my second favourite - the meat was so soft and perfectly sauced with quinoa and mushrooms added to it. Really great dish. The pork ribs were also really yummy.

The pork belly was deep fried and too fatty for me personally. It could also use a bit more flavour to it. The side of potatoes were perfectly flavoured though. 

The apple cobbler - I didn't like much. The apples were sour and I like my dessert to be sweet but that might just be a personal preference since my friends seemed to like it. Also, there was way too little ice cream on top of it! Come on now! More ice cream always.

I digress. I'm here for the coffee. That's much more important than the wall color. I ordered a cappuccino in a ceramic cup (an essential element if you wish to enjoy the real flavor). It was smooth and didn't tempt me to add some sugar to temper the flavor.

They do have quite an eclectic menu so you don't have to come here just for coffee. Morning beer is also quite popular for the patrons who were already sitting at the bar at 9 am on a Saturday.

The drive through is cool and utilizes the garage concept perfectly.

The concept of putting a coffee shop in a defunct garage reduces the number of empty car shops  and improves the ambiance of the neighborhood. 

This coffee shop is easy to find on Indian School and the only tricky part of parking is if you are driving east and need to cross the traffic that may be backed up from the light. You'll probably need to make a u-turn and approach the store from the east.

There is a large parking lot behind the coffee shop. You should be able to find a parking space most of the time.

Sapna: He is actually trippin' on himself. Out of the blue, he looked me dead in the eyes and told *me* that I want to get with *him*. I'm sorry... do you need some help getting up from under that ego of yours???

Friend: WHAT?!?!?! Is there even anything *to* like about him?

I've climbed at Red Rock Climbing Center, and Origin so this is how Refuge measures up against those two. 

First off, it's a bouldering only gym!  No top ropes, no autobelays!  So if you're looking for climbing routes, continue looking.  There is a tiny section for sport climbing - but I think you need to be special to use it because I never see anyone on it, haha.  

Second - the bouldering problems are SO FRIGGIN hard!  I'll have a great climbing sesh at Origin or Red Rock, bouldering V0s - V2s (like I said, I'm a newbie).  I get to Refuge though, and I can only do a couple of the V0s and still haven't topped out on their V1s and am not even close to touching a V2.  I think they responded to another review stating their problems were too easy and responded by making them so hard.  So keep that in mind - if you feel you're having a good climbing streak and you pop in here to do some bouldering you're in for a harsh ego check.  

I love the fitness area here.  I climb so much better when I get a 15 minute cardio warm up and some strength training in first.  

The atmosphere is pretty great - while I get the vibe that most of the patrons are elite climbers, everyone is always super helpful when I ask for beta.  

I have been a member there for a little over a month and I love it - the location is super handy and easy to get in and out of, and the staff rocks.  

Hopefully I'll be able to start conquering some of those super hard bouldering problems!  Anyway, it's great practice.  Climb on!",2016-04-26 23:55:18

I want to say the food here is good (for a pub) but there is something nagging me that holds me back from that.

The wings were ok, nothing bad, but you can get better at many other places.

Service is what drops this place down the list for me. The last server I had was obnoxious.

This is a nice ballpark, but the best time to get to the park is early. Why? Because parking becomes crazy the later you arrive. 

It's a great park to attend if you want to watch the team work out and get some pictures and autographs with your faves. The players walk along from the stadium to the huge practice field and vice-versa and anywhere between there is easy access for autograph seeking. Word of warning: Manager Mike Scioscia requests the fans walk along with him as he's going from one place to another. This doesn't bode well because people run to catch him and more times often than not someone gets hurt.  Other than this, it's a pretty decent area to hang until the players trek back into the stadium for drills on the field. 

Their team shop for souvenirs is a bit small and gets crowded fast. I found a good bargain in there the day I went and came away with an ANGELS visor for $6.50, which I got autographs on that same day, so not a bad souvenir to pick up to support the team.

I have a hunch that people are too nice to tell me that they think I'm crazy when I explain how I make my list of 'licious options...and it's quite possible they're right.  Without going into the details here, when I made that list, I should have known that including a restaurant offering duck on their menu meant that I was definitely going to that restaurant with the boyfriend (aka the duck fiend).  

We arrived in a very small restaurant...It had about 10 tables in all.  But it was cute, and I enjoyed it.  I do have a soft spot for anything French though so I'm slightly biased.  We were seated at a prime table by the window and presented with the menus.  I didn't notice until later but, strangely, some of the ingredients on our menus were not what was described online.  For example, the MIDI salad didn't have pine nuts, it had walnuts (if memory serves me, but it definitely wasn't pine nuts).  Also, the duck was served with a blueberry sauce instead of a mustard sauce, which if you ask me is a pretty big difference.  Personally I'm not a big fan of sweet sauces on meat, most of the time.  

For appetizers, I had the salad and my date had the soup of the day - dairy free mushroom soup.  The salad was HUGE, a full size plate full.  It was very tasty though.  I didn't hear any praise or complaint regarding the soup.  For the mains, I ordered the fish of the day which was Marlin with a raspberry sauce.  Surprise of surprises, boyfriend ordered the duck.  The Marlin was very tasty, and I even liked the raspberry sauce.  The duck was also very good, but he didn't seem to like the blueberry sauce very much.  

For desserts, the orders were crème brulee for me, and profiteroles for him.  The crème brulee was described as vanilla and cardamom.  Admittedly, I don't know exactly what cardamom tastes like, but I didn't taste any more flavour than usual.  Even the vanilla wasn't that strong.  It did have a nice crisp top, but the crème itself wasn't quite as thick as I usually prefer it.  The profiteroles went over very well.

Sorry, had to get my pun in there like everyone else.

I came in on a Saturday afternoon to find the place fairly quiet. I didn't know how things worked so I just pulled up to a bench and waited. A staff member came over and explained that you have to order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.

After perusing the menu I took Sarah L.'s suggestion and went with the Curry Wvrst. I also went with the staff member's recco on lamb for the type of wvrst. I piled on some duck fat fries and topped it off with a pint of Weihstephaner.

While I was waiting for my meal someone came over who identified himself as a photographer for the Toronto Star. He was doing a story on the restaurant and asked if I would move over to the next bench so he could include me in some of his shots. I gladly obliged.

After a short wait my lunch arrived. The meal was delicious. I definitely recommend the curry. It was tomato-based which went well with the wvrst and the fries. The fries come with a dipping sauce so my choice naturally was the Wvrst sauce. It had a nice tang to it but wasn't as spicy as I would have liked.

I had plans with Christina P and after reading her review, I asked if she'd be interested in returning to Humble Pie with me since she had several positive experiences there already...

I arrived first, and was seated right away.  The staff was attentive and friendly - Alan was our server and took great care of us.  We started with  a glass of prosecco each and decided to share the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and the shrimp pie.  Sounds like a ton of food, but it was perfect for the two of us.  I eat a lot - especially of veggies, and I love that HP has a large selection when it comes to veggies and salads... I have to return soon to try the butternut squash and the veggie salad (both sounded great to me).

I'll preface this by saying, I like the flavor of burnt food.  So, the fact that the brussel sprouts were a tad bit overdone, was fine with me... although for other patrons, it may not be so appealing.  The cauliflower was not burnt, but it didn't have so much flavor either.  Regardless, I wanted to get my vegetables in for the day, and they seemed fresh despite the way they were cooked.  Does that make sense?

As some of the yelpers before me commented, we noticed the use of lemon zest in our shrimp pie.  It was light on the shrimp, sauce, and cheese, but it did have a zesty flavor to it.  I added some chili pepper flakes and parmesan as well... mmmm.

As if I hadn't eaten enough food, Christina requested a small sample of the olive oil gelato so I could taste it... and I actually enjoyed it!  If you're open to trying something new, the olive oil gelato is the perfect sweet ending to your meal at Humble Pie.

My 4 star rating is for my overall experience at Humble Pie - I was in fantastic company, a casual environment (which I love), and lots of veggie options to choose from... the pizza was fine - I'll try another selection next visit.

I also noticed that there is plenty of bar seating for those that like to sit at the bar, hang with the bartender, etc... good to know in case I ever return solo!  Either way, I'm sure I'll be back soon.",2009-01-06 23:26:50

I went in for a late supper last night with two limey Brits, and it was a lovely time. (Tut tut, pip pip, cheerio.) You'd have to be a real so-and-so to not love the casual booths and candle trinkets linking the blue windows and bar.

I had the mussels and one of their specials, the warm fiddlehead salad. Fiddleheads can do no wrong. The chef prepared them with garlic, butter, lemon and bacon. This will forever be a dish I copy and tweak and likely never quite match. Delicious. The mussels were grand and in a white wine tomato sauce, which normally isn't my thing, but it had a great bite. I want to go back for this dinner right now.

Austin Powers and Camilla Parker-Bowles had the chicken curry and greek salad with calamari respectively, and were thrilled. They even smiled through their stiff English upper lips.

I was comfortable and didn't feel rushed (some places that I have been with they rush their service so that they can service more clients - client experience in this scenario not very good because I feel they don't take as much care to do your nails). The girl that was doing my nails, did a very good job - my cuticles looked so nice. Price wise, it is en par with other nail salons. Overall, I am definitely coming back to get my nails done.

As my girlfriend and I sat down to eat their employees kept walking by us making eye contact and just flat out staring at us, making us uncomfortable.

It was a cute little restaurant inside J-TOWN and it wasn't difficult to find. Walking in, the first thing I saw was a drum set, and I thought to myself, is this a place where they place music? However, I don't think the drum set is used occasionally. 

I would definitely rate lunch over dinner as there were less people and the food was actually tastier during lunch. This time, we went during dinner.

From the photos that I posted, we got:
1) Unagi-don ($17)
2) Shiso Clam Vongole ($15)
3) Shrimp Okonomiyaki ($14)
All three of these came with a complimentary soup and salad and a piece of garlic bread on the side.

I've never heard of a Japanese pasta before, but I'm glad I tried it because this tasted really good. Instead of having pasta with the regular tomato or alfredo sauce, this added a twist to regular pasta. The unagi, shrimp and clams were delicious as well as it was rich in flavour and cooked to the right amount of time and temperature.",2015-09-28 16:08:11

I made a reservation for our party, which was to celebrate 2 birthdays on Open Table. I called to check on their Groupon policy, and was very rudely told they only take 1 per table ""do you understand?"" click. 

Wanting to cancel the reservation I had another person in the party call and speak with a manager, which did allow us to use the 2 Groupons and a note was put in with our reservation. 

When we got there at 6 on a Saturday we were immediately seated at a round table with MJ. It was near sunset so the sun was blazing through the windows which they have no blinds for. 

We ordered the french onion soup, the salmon with tomato risotto, and the skirt steak medium with green beans, to split between my husband and I because we really couldn't decide between steak or salmon. My husband also ordered a Manhattan. 

The soup I thought was very good. Good french onion soup, nothing that made it stand out from others, but very good. 

The food came out and the salmon was very good. I thought the risotto was watery, it was sitting in a puddle, which may have been a sauce, who really knows. The salmon had a really good flavor to it, I didn't really enjoy the risotto. My medium flank steak I thought was a little under cooked, but still had good flavor. The green beans were grilled and also very good. 

Toward the end of the meal my husband ordered a second Manhattan. We were finished and our plates were cleared by the time he got it. The waiter then said ""here you go"" and spilled it on him, and did not apologize. Weird. 

We ordered the peanut butter chocolate cheesecake for dessert, and it was to die for! Get it if you can! Yum!

True patriot love... and give me duck poutine pizza.

So, after a half bottle of (Niagara region) wine, I'm now writing this review.
I'm not a huge fan of O&B restaurants, so I was very surprised of how great my experience was here.

Service was 5 star.
The hostess was friendly, fun, and engaging.
Our server did a great job recommending his favourites.

Bannock's oh-so-popular duck poutine pizza ($15)  was a hit and lived up to it's reputation.  Loads of fries with gravy, succulent duck meat on top of a thin bannock styled flat bread.  One of my friends at the table made bannock in elementary school (in Calgary) and thought that Bannock did a great job with this traditional aboriginal flat bread.

The Venison chilli was filling and very interesting.  Finely ground venison and lots of beans.  I don't love chilli, but admittedly it really hit the spot on a cold evening.

Our server spoke highly of the pickerel taco with cucumber salad ($13).  It ended up being the least liked dish at the table.  Too sweet.  Too much mayo and apple.  Creamy and sweet with a doughy, soft bread.  It just didn't work for me.

Dessert was spectacular though.
I wanted some more s'more pie ($8)!
I would have to say it's one of the top 5 (dessert) items I've ever put in my mouth.
The chocolate part in the middle was more similar to a ganache and not a brownie.  It wasn't a heavy dessert at all.  The warm marshmallow and graham bits reminded me of making s'mores over a fire pit.  Loved it.

Bannock is a great casual spot for Canadian Comfort food.

As you walk from their parking lot you're given the opportunity to experience a blast of heat put off by the intense fire roasting their rotisserie chickens.  Once inside you are offered the opportunity to watch the chefs race each order to near perfection.  Plenty of booth seating provides a great way to converse with the people you are eating with, and many seats around the bar enable you to chat it up with the staff.  And all of that leaves the food - the most important sensory experience of any restaurant.

Bandera's food is quite good and that has led me to eating there more times than I can recall.  I am by no means a connoisseur, but I feel as though I am experienced enough with Bandera to suggest some pretty solid options.  Their rotisserie chicken and cornbread (perhaps two dishes that the restaurant is best known for) are very good.  I am a big fan of ordering a grilled artichoke for my appetizer and then following that up with the chicken enchiladas.  With that dish you get all the benefits of their great chicken, but with the added variety that enchiladas offer.  Plus the management at Bandera has been altruistic enough to enable you to get an additional enchilada for $1 more.  Yet don't ask for a third enchilada for $1 because you won't get it; believe me I've tried.  And as I said just a few sentences earlier, their cornbread is really good.

What a gem! The Crepe Club is an adorable restaurant perfect to enjoy a light lunch or a sweet crepe dessert. When you look through the front window, you can see the staff making the crepes on the pan. I opted to enjoy a savory crepe (spinach florentine) for lunch with some iced tea, After I ordered, I helped myself to getting iced tea at the self-serve drink station and sat down at a table inside (there is also adequate outdoor seating as well), My crepe order was brought to me quickly soon afterwards. It was very tasty and filling. I got the large size and was unable to finish it, but the staff kindly gave me a to-go box to bring home.

It doesn't get too crowded and seeing is intimate - Good for groups. I like their menu because there's not too much clutter and easy to choose with the options they have. It's pretty simple and typical if you're a recurrent Boba enthusiast lol. You choose from Lattes, milk tea, slushes, tea, and even crepes. 

I came here with a friend to work on a computer project, so she decided Brew Tea. If you're the type to find a sport where you can sit alone or have privacy for your own personal business, this is not the place for that.(go to Starbucks or something). This place is more for group seating. 

I was recommended by the cashier to try their ""Brew Tea"" milk tea. I gotta say, it's your average milk tea.. but you can customize your drink that fits your taste buds. I like mines with light Ice, 2 scoops of sugar and almond milk as a substitute. I even had to buy their crepes because the pictures make it look so delicious and big. I went with the classic Nutella, banana and strawberry crepe with vanilla ice cream for a buck more. It sure was big!

In this development, one can enjoy chain restaurants, a movie or pseudo-Las Vegas monuments to capitalism (read: giant-sized billboards). However, one will surely not enjoy the randomness and sense of discovery that makes experiencing a true urban environment (i.e. San Francisco, Manhattan, etc.) so worthwhile. At Westgate, the 'city"" is planned. Don't expect to wander upon a trendy boutique, art cinema or bodega. This is a Phoenix strip mall writ large.

I hate the name ""city center"" for this development as it leads one to expect the kind of ""new urbanist"" development present in Reston, Virginia, Seaside, Florida or Portland, Oregon. Those are true live-work-play destinations. They are not surrounded by ""parking lagoons.""

The pho was amazing as well. I think it is a bit overpriced, but I'm originally from the east coast so maybe there's a general price difference between the west and east coast?

The afternoon was beautiful and a patio or outdoor seating wasn't available here. Forced to sit inside, I was happy to see a social style layout with a four sided bar. There were TVs facing each direction although two sides were cheated with smaller screens. The service was only somewhat attentive, not extremely perceptive, but it was friendly. The bar was clean, but a bit cluttered to look at with garnishes sitting within less than an arms reach from me. The space we sat in seemed tight. As for the general environment, it was a modern spin on the classic pub style with dark woods, exposed brick and reclaimed architectural details. The restrooms were clean, which is always important. 

Deagan's is formatted as a gastro-pub. The beer selection was extensive and interesting. There were several new ones I hadn't tried before on tap. The menu was not large, but had soups, salads, sandwiches, and small plates to big plates with a variety of ingredient flavors to choose from. What we ordered was delicious. The fries were perfectly seasoned, topped with fresh parmesan and green onion and came with a spiced aioli and a ketchup. They hit the spot perfectly with my beer. My husband had the chicken legs. A generous portion of six legs came in the order. There were three sauces to choose from and it was a nice play on the typical chicken wing option at bars. He enjoyed them.

Made to order dim sum at any hour?? Sign me tf up!

I'm so happy to have found Dim Sum Cafe for not only their awesome quality dim sum, but for the rest of their food as well. I've been kind of burnt out from having a lot of bad chinese food in AZ- still have nightmares of stale rice, not so fresh ingredients, etc.. that is NOT the case at Dim Sum Cafe! 

The chicken fried rice is the best we've had in a long time. Chicken was so tender and perfectly cooked, and rice was the freshest consistency with such good depth of flavors - absolutely NO burnt oil tastes, hard/stale rice, bland seasoning, or heavy greasy feeling here. 

I also had the soup dumplings which were out of this world, paired with the vinegar/ginger dipping sauce. Shrimp dumplings were divine and shrimp was so nicely cooked inside!

My favorite dish was the water boiled chicken, spicy and juicy with amazing flavors plus that signature numbing feeling from the sichuan peppercorns.

Honestly my experience dining here was really great all around. Service from our waitress and the owner was warm and attentive and they were ready to help navigate or explain anything on the menu. The owner was also so sweet in helping me pack up my leftovers at the end of our meal. You can tell she takes a lot of care and pride in every aspect of the restaurant from the service, atmosphere/cleanliness, and of course the food - I liked reading in the description here on yelp that she's a foodie, I can tell by the way she runs the restaurant!

I phoned the order in and told them crispy shrimp, with emphasis...instead when I got home I received soggy ""honey glazed"" chicken, which almost indefinitely was simply sweet and sour sauce. I was hoping to order a Mongolian style beef but since their Mongolian sauce is not spicy as indicated, I tried the black pepper instead and unfortunately they only have ""steak"" not beef. And it was the lowest quality of steak I have ever had, no exaggeration, it was literally beef jerky chunks, and to top it off (literally) it was layed over soggy fried rice (due to the black pepper sauce).  I am shocked people like their meals on top of each other like that.  Even Panda Express separates their dishes.  The lo mein noodles really didn't differ from Panda express except that it had some veggies here and there and dumped a cup of sugar in it, and for $9 with bland ""crispy"" yet dry chicken I will say that it was another disappointment.

She had a smile on her face the entire time when she attended to us and did so genuinely. Everything from taking our orders promptly, to filling our water cups, to correcting a minor hiccup along the way was spot on. You can tell, this business truly emphasizes excellent customer service. 

My boyfriend and I skipped the variety of beers they have on tap because we aren't avid beer drinkers and can't appreciate it. But we did try their burgers and sides.

The badass pork belly burger ($13) was really badass. There were slices of fatty pork belly on top of a burger patty, and cole slaw. I also added a farm egg for $2 extra. The combination was filling and tasty. The red peppers in the cole slaw gave the burger a mild kick and was surprising to the tongue. I added a simple salad as a side for $3 extra. The salad came with mixed greens, carrots, cumcubers, tomatoes, radish and a light citrus vinaigrette. 

The chili burger ($12) was chili atop a hamburger patty. Although the chili was tasty, the burger itself was a bit dry. Be prepared to get down and dirty with this burger because it will get messy. A side of fries were added to this order for $3 extra and it came with a side of aioli dipping sauce. 

For dessert, we tried the Reese's bread pudding. Save room for dessert because this decadent peanut butter and chocolate dish is too good to skip. Sticks of bread are stacked atop one another and served with a side of sweet whipped cream and crumbs. The portion is pretty hefty too and can serve up to 4 people!

Especially the 30-something single crowd.... So why then, you may ask would I go to a place in the heart of that douchebaggery? To meet my best friend for a beer late afternoon, Happy Hour style. 

What I encountered at this place was awesomely refreshing. So much so that I probably should not be writing a review on how great this place is, lest it become a ""cool trendy"" place to be. Great for the owners, I know, but terrible for real, in touch, sensible human beings. 

Let's talk about the owners... They are local. And a family. REALLY? A family owned and operated joint in Scottsdale? Shhhhh! Don't tell anyone! 
Something that that sets them apart is their home-made daily dessert. Our servers (I'll get to them in a moment; be still my beating heart...) kept talking about this brownie with this lost, googly-eyed in love look. Of course we had to indulge. And we did... In all 5000000000 calories of it's peanut-buttery chocolatey al a modey deliciousness. But we loved EVERY fat round belly inducing bite.

And so these servers... We had two of them. We started with Jennifer. And because we're just sooooo cool (not really. We're not very cool at all.), we ended up with Tiffany ANNNNNDDDD Jennifer. They rocked our little worlds. Beautiful, fun, friendly, outgoing, fun to joke with, awesome energies and attitudes, and did I mention beautiful?

On Valentines Day 2013 my husband purchased their largest red rose arrangement for $300.  The presentation was nice, if a little dated, but sadly within just a couple days the flowers died.  Every other time I have received flowers from this company they have not lasted as long as other florists or even the cheap flowers from the supermarket.  I would rate the quality of the arrangements from this florist as 3/5.

Most recently, my husband attempted to place a last minute balloon order at 3:30 pm from this company over the phone.  Their website states they are open until 5pm so he thought that may be enough time to pick up the balloons.  He was advised by the person who took his order that the balloons would be ready for pick up the same day.  When he arrived to the shop at 3:50 pm the shop was closed early and the store door hours stated they closed at 4pm.

How did this miscommunication happen?  Well, anyone who is thinking about ordering from this florist should be aware that the phone number they advertise actually goes to an off site call center that represents themselves as in-house.  My husband was lied to that he could get the balloons the same day when the florist closed early that day without informing their call center ordering team.  When my husband called the phone number (that they list on their website and on the door of their shop) as he stood outside the CLOSED shop, the person on the phone still tried to represent themselves as a florist on site and that the store was indeed open.  This was very frustrating and the miscommunication and outright lying wasted his time

I understand that sometimes last minute orders cannot be filled but this business needs to update their website with their ACTUAL hours and make sure that whatever ordering service they use is updated with any exceptions to their hours. The call center ordering team that their phone number directs to also needs to be honest about the fact they are not on site.",2014-10-15 16:13:17

The evening of the reservation we were quickly ushered to the back room (private room) and everything was already set up for us.

This would be a five star review but the Italian sandwich was soggy (the bread is flat bread and hadn't been fired properly). We sent it back and weren't charged.",2017-09-01 21:42:23

I've struggled the past year bouncing around between hair Extentions stylists since I moved here from LA. I was talked into Bead Extentions instead of keratin bonds from two other hair stylist in AZ and it was the worst decision of my life. For four years prior in LA I used keratin bonds and was reluctant to make the switch to beads, but I did. It ruined my hair. In frustration, I googled an answer to my prayers. The answer was ""great lengths"" keratin hair extentions, which pretty much every celebrity uses. It is expensive, but worth it. As I always say it is quality over quantity. What most people don't realize is it takes years to qualify for extention installation. Sherri was a certified hair extention specialist from the ""great lengths"" website in my zip code area. 

I  called Tuesday at 9am and Sherri said she had time that Tuesday for a consult. I came in. My hair was four different colors, but I didn't even realize that until she lifted the back hair of my head. I was so depressed about my bead in Extentions and color that I had just got redone last week. 

Sherri only works at the salon 3-4 days a week because she lives in Tuscon. However, when I came in for a consult and we discussed my options of switching to Great Lengths, she went above and beyond to help me. She spent the remainder of my consult, to her next customer appointment taking out my bead in extentions. She then told me passionately she wanted to fix my hair. She offered for me to come back an hour later while her customer's color was setting, to fix the color of my hair. She also said she would overnight the hair I needed and squeeze me in at the end of the day today. 

I've never had anyone I don't know have such a kindred soul. She didn't have openings for two weeks when we did the consult, which I reluctantly said okay I'll wait that long. However, after looking at my hair and speaking to me, I truly believe she cared because we had no intention of taking out my bead in extentions or color fix during the consult. Yet, she did that. She than offered to stay late two days later and overnight the hair Extentions. Wow. Jaw dropped. Yes the hair is expensive. But, yes it is worth it. It lasts 4-5 months and protects your hair instead of damaging it like every other extention type. I am so ecstatic I found her. :)",2016-08-19 04:14:15

I had two tacos.. One with shredded beef with the hot salsa, and one with crusted tilapia with guacamole... Both were delicious!!

The pizza is definitely their forte, but what brought me in to this location specifically was their specialty dinner menu. This menu was difficult to find, for starters, as their social media only vaguely allude to the ""seafood"" content but no menu or pricing is available on their website. I invited a large group of friends for a dinner, hopeful that our experience would live up to the hype.

Started with two specialty fry options: poutine and the aptly-named suicide fries. The former had virtually no salt or wow factor, with even the cheese coming in fairly flavorless. This would be my last spot to suggest for this dish. The suicide fries lived up to the name with a tangy habanero sauce that left a long burn, plus jalapenos and pepperoncini. 

Sampled the ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" specialty menu with Short Rib Stroganoff and Lobster Pot Pie. These were great quality and cool takes on classic dishes, but also suffered from a lack of seasoning. The egg noodles in the stroganoff seemed overcooked but at least the sauce wasn't heavy-handed with truffle. The short rib wasn't really the star of this dish though. The lobster pot pie fared better, with a richly flavored filling and a crisp topping of puff pastry. Can't say I'd get this again though. Later on, we ended our meal with the Strawberry Shortcake, which was fairly hard for ""angel food cake"" but light on the sweetness like I prefer my desserts.

But like I said, their pizza is the best bet. I came in before and had pizza logs while watching a game, and the ample cheese, layers of pepperoni, and crispy egg roll exterior were awesome. I've had the Guinea Pie at other locations and this one was comparable. Opted this visit for slices of the Naked City Pie (sans olives) and liked it better than I thought I would, but felt the corner slices had a low sauce-to-crust ratio, with toppings heavily applied only to the middle of the pie. Maybe that's just their style though, with the thick sheet-style crusts. I'm a fan of thick crusts and this one was good, I also found their red sauce to be particularly flavorful.

The main issue with my most recent visit was the service. For a Friday night, even without our group, I can't figure out why they'd only staff with 1.5 servers. The lady who most helped us was rarely around and frequently forgot items (silverware, water refills, share plates), while another lady tended mostly to a poker group in the back room. Our server seemed overwhelmed and not particularly attuned to the basic needs of diners. Might return for the next season's specialty menu, but my future pizza orders might be at the bar where service was on point.",2017-05-03 15:59:40

Be sure to **make a reservation** if you're going with other people and **purchase the Yelp deal** to save some monies! I came with my boyfriend and we purchased the Yelp deal -- we ended up getting two lanes, a bow and four arrows each, for two hours! BOGO?!

When you arrive, you need to watch a 6-8 minute instructional video of what do to, how to hold and shoot an arrow, and the proper etiquette of the range. Then you're taken into the actual range to start! 

There are 20 lanes. The first 5, I think, are reserved for the professionals (lol) their target is waaaay further -- I don't think I can shoot my arrow that far. But a lane is reserved for you along with four arrows and a bow. They show you how to properly shoot the arrow then they let you go! There isn't a limit of how many times you can shoot, just the limit of how long you're at the range. Two hours seemed long, but we ended up almost staying the full two hours. Lemme tell you, don't be embarrassed if you can't hit the target (my arrow went over the target my first couple tries), you'll get the hang of it!

The only thing that I cannot stand is that for the popular two lunch specials (combinations), you cannot order scallops. I even asked the server if I can get them if I paid extra. I was told that I would have to order a bigger platter (the captain platter I think) that costs about $3 and offers less food items. I honestly don't understand that policy.

Came for my Daddy's 60th birthday dinner while in Vegas for the weekend. Mastro's never fails to disappoint. Table for 6 in the treehouse, in the round white booths. Service was excellent like usual. The only thing was that they messed up on the peppercorn on my fiance new york strip. I know it's the ocean club but all the Mastro's are usually consistent. Can't take away a star for that b/c everything else was amazing. The server even brought complimentary THREE DESSERTs for the table for my dad's birthday. Usually they bring the slice of chocolate cake or the butter cake, but they presented a massive plate with those two and eclairs! AMAZING but prob a good 5000 calories. 
Love Mastro's and will def be back to this location next time we're in Vegas. 
Thanks for making my father's dinner a memorable one!",2013-03-21 22:03:35

We were there during happy hour BF got the house margarita and he liked it so much he had 2, or maybe 3. My Aunt and I split a margarita flight and opted for the frozen drinks.. came with prickly pear, mango and strawberry. All were on the sweet side but super tasty and VERY strong... we would have been falling off our stools if we each had a flight. I mixed the mango and prickly pear and it was muy bueno!
The bad - they bring out a big bottle of water... it had stuff floating in it, we let the waitress know and she brings another.. stuff floating in this one as well. Our guess was the dishwasher was not getting all the stuff out which is pretty yuck... especially since we had already started drinking the water before noticing.",2014-12-05 19:45:18

We tried a host of dishes.  Definitely the best item on the menu are the  Dátiles which are figs wrapped in bacon.  You should probably order 2 of those.  We also ordered the small Paella de Carrillada which was very good.  Kind of pricey for that amount of meat but it was good.

Cheese croquettes were pretty good.  

Patatas Bravas were also not bad.  That is a potato based side with some other ingredients.  Not super amazing but not bad.

Croquetas de Jamón was ok, it's basically this tiny flatbread with some toppings on it like ham, etc.

I think last time the trivia was a bit hard and it was hard to not notice the scores of people looking up answers on their smart phones.  Luckily the phone policy has been ""reinforced"" or it seemed like it was.  Trivia should be better if you actually know the answers!  Not how well you can use your smart phone.

Anyways - I got there early and ate at the bar waiting for my friends to show up.  The barkeeps were nice and also let me change a tv to watch a different sport than they had up there.  They have a ton of tvs so it's hard to miss any sort of sports action going on.

Had the fish tacos, which were nice... I liked that the tacos were ""pre-limed"" so it had a good citrus kick to it (without having to get your fingers all limey).  Maybe it's just the laziness in me, but I appreciate when the chef/cook/kitchen says, ""this is what you are eating... you have no options""  I think there is a boldness about it.  From there it can go either two ways - you absolutely hate what was given to you, or bask in it's greatness.

My side was the cucumber salad... which I didn't care for.... sliced cucumbers with paprika and vinegar... was a bit soggy and sad.  I did eat it all (begrudgingly) .

Over the past year or so, I've learned quite a few things, killed a few plants, and really learned a bit about growing stuff in Arizona.  When I moved into this apartment, I wanted a nice garden with some plants on the patio because I actually have the space.  Plus, being on the ground floor it adds to the privacy of people seeing in my apartment. 

This nursery isn't huge, but its plentiful on its stock.  The items that I have purchased from here have been hardy, lived through an Arizona summer and are big as can be.  Prices are fair, and most have lived. If they haven't lived, its probably because I killed them, or the heat did them in.  Prices are great, and let me tell you, they have a little bit of everything here!

They also have an email program that you can sign up for at the register and you get regular emails about sales, classes and other things going on at the nursery on a semi regular basis.  You also earn points when purchasing things here that can go towards discounts when you hit a certain amount. I like that! Frequent shopper points!

The only thing that makes me dock them a star is the service.  The first two times I went here, the same lady waited on me, and she was kind of rude and gave me misinformation.

We were not brought or offered bread.  What brought down this rating was service problems which obviously were not the fault of our server.  I appreciated that the restaurant offered me a reservation when Open Table indicated that nothing was available on this day.

She asked another individual for assistance and I believe that person told her simply to seat us. After more than ten minutes had passed after we were seated without a server coming to the table, the hostess came over to ask if she could take a drink order.  She was not able to answer my question about whether the featured beers were draft or bottled.  Soon thereafter, our server, a charming and gracious young man, came to take the drink order.  We asked him to take our dinner order as well, given that this was stacking up to be a very lengthy meal.  More than fifteen minutes later, our entrees came, but no sign of my wife's wine and my beer.  I asked the young man who brought the food about our drinks and a few minutes later, our server came over, apologized, and told us how backed up the bar was.  He graciously told us that the drinks would be complimentary.  We received them more than five minutes after the arrival of our entrees.  These were not mixed drinks requiring anything special to dispense, simply beverages that had to be poured.  For almost the entire time we were there, a band was playing inside at a volume that was deafening.  We could not possibly have had our meal inside near the band as it would have been necessary to use sign language to converse and to order. We were seated outside as far away from the music as possible, yet it was still difficult to speak to each other over the din.  Additionally, the placement of the band in a small room makes it particularly difficult to snake in and out when coming in to use the restroom.

Let's start with the pluses:  (1) This restaurant is decorated fabulously.  It looks like a cool, hip bar/restaurant you might find in Cabo.  Very tasteful and super sexy lighting.  (2) All of the staff was very accommodating and because the place was kind of empty, we had our choice of seating.  Probably a good thing since we dumbly started out on the patio and decided to move inside because we were freezing.  Two of us had a specialty cocktail.  I tried the Silk Road.  If you are a huge fan of tequila, you may enjoy this drink.  I did not.  The tequila was so over-powering that I didn't even finish it. 

We decided to do appetizers and ordered: (1) Pupu Platter; (2) General's Chicken Wings; (3) quinoa fried rice; and (4) Fries.  The fries were excellent and I also really liked the fish fritter balls on the pupu platter.  That just sounds wrong.  Everything else was pretty Meh.  The chicken wings had a great flavor and crispiness to the skin, but were so fatty that we didn't eat all of them.

Four of us ordered a liquor with a soda mixer and they arrived in different sized glasses and the liquors were mixed up... we had to taste them and pass them around and everyone hoped they'd end up with the biggest of the four glasses. We ordered four different interesting sounding rolls. They were plated with the most boring presentation I've ever seen at a sushi joint. Three lined up on one plate and the fourth lined up on a separate plate... what a huge miss. Sushi is supposed to be a visual culinary art. The two rolls I tried were very bland and one that was marked raw on the menu had cooked tuna filet on top... don't cook my tuna! I can buy that in a can. There wasn't much fish at all inside the rolls.

The atmosphere was dank. The staff were nice, but only gave minimal service. There was no experience here at all. Don't do hibachi, so I cannot rate that. I will go elsewhere for my sushi.",2017-02-26 02:35:04

Taste wise, I thought it was okay. The schnitzel itself seemed pretty normal. However, what elevates these things are the toppings. I had the Jaeger, and also tried the wife's Parma... both were good. They also have quite a lot of garlic, which I love (although not sure how authentic this all is... it was very different to the schnitzels I had in Munich beer gardens)

They have a yelp  check in deal for $1 off the beer. Pretty big parking lot (shared with other places). Accept s credit card

Les fois suivantes j'ai donc pu y retourner avec un peu plus de confiance en moi. J'ai aussi découvert un petit frigidaire dans le fond à droite où se cachent quelques fromages en vente. La sélection dans cette section change très régulièrement donc lorsque je suis pressée ou que je n'ai pas besoin d'un formage en particulier, je m'aventure dans ce recoin de la fromagerie et je choisi quelques fromages nouveaux.

If you are fussy about sizes they are not as broad as in the U.S. or other parts of the world.  Everything it taxed multiple times from import tax and duties to HST and on average prices are 30% more than in the U.S.. Seasonal decorations in the mall rarely change year after year and pick pocketing is an acceptable sport.   For some strange reason all this makes the Eaton Centre a tourist attraction. I guess you got to see it to believe it.  If I were to be traveling anywhere in the world a mall would not make my top ten list of sights to see.   I know this sounds negative, not my  intention.

Great appetizers, tons of meats to try, REVERSE HAPPY HOUR 10pm to close. Even if you got something you didn't like (or just messed up cooking it), the prices are great.

Spicy Tuna Kimbap:  awesome as an appetizer to start. The serving is HUGE. You won't feel shorted when you order. You may get scalp sweats, but that's a good thing. 

Chili Garlic Wings: These were fine, not the best wings you've ever had but pack plenty of meat and flavor.

Bulgogi: People seem to love this. It's not great. It's the meat I liked the least. Consistency is gummy. It's a sticky meat. Has a bit of a jerky taste to it. Impossible to really cook on the grill. It's a pass for me. 

Pork Belly: It was good. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought but it melts in your mouth. They do give you plenty of strips so it works out that way. Plenty of trays to dunk it in too.

Filet Mignon: How could you say no to this? Of course, the cuts are tender and succulent. Probably the thing that works against it is that they are THICK cuts. Eating it usually involves putting the WHOLE chunk in your mouth. But it's filet mignon, it is delicious.

Flat Iron Garlic: Great garlic flavor, thinner cuts make cooking and eating this a tad bit easier that the Filet. Plenty of meat to dip too.

Number three: it's like you're on an island mon, so lots of funky art and furniture. The bar stools are little palm trees!

They have a great selection of South American wines and beers. They change up the beers to offer tasty seasonal brews on tap, so you're able to try new things pretty often.

They constantly directed all their comments and questions to my husband (he is white) and called him by name, but never even looked at me the entire time, let alone spoke to me or called me by name.

Food was not terrible but for the price I was expecting better. The Thai short rib broth was the best thing: the broth was good, and they give you a fork for scooping out the marrow like a mini osso bucco (however I really think this needs to be a spoon; the jelly-like marrow just slides through the tines). The sushi ""tacos"" were made with yuzu jelly wraps which were very interesting - I was expecting radish wraps or crispy wonton skins fried into taco shell shapes or something. However, the fish inside was fishy, which is a no-no for raw fish. The other sushi rolls and dumplings were nothing special. The oxtail soup was terrible - the broth tasted like ramen spice packets; the oxtail was a'ight, but not fall-off-the-bone tender. The ""kobe"" beef carpaccio was chewy and thick - obviously not real kobe or even Australian kobe, and I have my doubts it was even American kobe. My spoon had a sharp bit I nicked my tongue on.

Service was also okay but I was expecting better. They trick you into paying for $9 Fiji water (that you can get for under $3 at the CVS next door) when you ask for ""just"" water - and they don't tell you their default water is bottled.

They ask for your name and room number before they seat you, but then you still have to fill it out on the check.

If you are staying there they don't give you the option of paying separately - it goes on your tab by default.

Normally I tip 25-33% for average service, so when we decided to tip less than 20% I felt guilty for days. And I'm sure they're trained to say things in that deliberately misleading way and they weren't singling us out to try and trick us.

So we were waiting in line. The driver tells two people behind us to go into the bus.... I don't mind them cutting. In fact, we don't mind cause we are all taking the same bus to go to the same place. But then the driver immediately tells us that he can't seat us three girls because he only has room for two people. Um... Excuse me... Then why did you let two people cut in front of us? Do the math!!!!!!... I am writing this review in a state of anger. I am also waiting an extra 30 some minutes for the next bus to arrive. 

This is a note to the business, people are in line and people should be admitted into the bus based on their place in line. Don't let people cut. I did feel like it was racial charged, but no evidence to that so I can't say much. But, I can say that I just have a feeling it was racial charged. I'm Asian. The driver was not. The two people the driver let in front of us were white. I don't know I just did the math in my head. 

On a more evidence based fact, every single time we arrange a set up expect for one time they did not come on time or they did not showed up at all.

We started with an appetizer of sweet potato fritters, and to be blunt- they were awful. They were way too salty and had way too much ginger and cloves; did not taste like sweet potatoes at all. If you like honey, they became edible by dipping them in the sweet honey sauce, but I would still definitely avoid them.
For my entrée, I ordered the pot roast meat and three with mac & cheese, collard greens, green beans, and a biscuit. The pot roast was exceptional - so tender and flavorful; you didn't even need a knife to eat it. The mac and cheese was pretty solid as well. It was baked custard style which I like but wasn't that cheesy. The collard greens and green beans were okay but nothing special. The biscuit was dry and crumbly but according to our server is a lot better than the cornbread. My girlfriend ordered the pork chop, but unfortunately it came out overcooked and a bit burnt on the one side. It was certainly edible, but not something you'd want to pay $25 for. Her side of ""fondant sweet potatoes"" was 5 slices of very thin sweet potato baked and with little seasoning or flavor. That leads me to my biggest disappointment- the portion size. My girlfriend isn't a big eater, but she was still hungry after her small pork chop and even smaller side dish. When I think of a classic southern ""meat and three"", I'm thinking that I'm going to be absolutely stuffed full of food and/or have some to take home, but the portions were really small. All three sides were small portions, and the pot roast was maybe 4-5 ounces of meat.
Our server was a friendly guy, and I respect that they help the homeless recover by offering them jobs, but he did not check on us much at all once our food hit the table, and he seemed very confused every time we ordered, although luckily everything was correct. He also spoke very quietly so it was almost impossible for us to understand what the specials were or what he asked us that wasn't obvious. 
I'm disappointed that I didn't love King's Kitchen since it is such an awesome concept but the food, service, and portion sizes were all letdowns for a $50+ dinner without drinks.",2015-08-09 23:21:52

Everyone is friendly and courteous. 

Only issue I have is food options. Why are there better food options outside security than inside the airport?  Doesn't make sense. And if you fly United be prepared to walk to the end of the airport to find a Starbucks. That's just wrong. I need my $5 flavored water, oops I meant Starbucks refresher, easily accessible.

From the service, amount of food you get (you get two fried eggs, some strip steak I think it was and a stupid amount of fries underneath), 'itis will definitely be something you'll need to battle.

I enjoy the Okinawa milk tea with non- dairy creamer, black tea latte with sea salt cream with half boba half egg custard. I haven't tried too many others because I know I like those so I want to stick with them. I think I should try new ones next time and be brave. I haven't been here for at least 3 months because of my recent no sugar diet. I came once and tried no sugar and I sweeten it myself. Sorry, but it wasn't good. I've decided substituting here doesn't work too well. So instead I come less often and get a drink with less sweetness. It seems to work better that way so I can enjoy my drink. 

Louis is always exceptionally friendly, nice, and cares about his customers. He remembers what I like which is amazing with all the business and customers he gets. Don't be afraid, ask for them to fix your drink if you don't like it. I'm positive they want you to like your drink and they always ask if I like it which I appreciate. I've turned many people on to BTB because it is good stuff. When I used to come more often I wasn't sure that I didn't taste the ""tea"" as much and I tasted more milk taste. I'm still not tasting as much tea but I do understand that the balance is important. I've tried their tea without milk and its strong and somewhat bitter which is not bad as opposed to weak watered down tea which is not good. I would be curious to try some teas without milk in the future to lessen the calories.

My partner loves the Tequila Lime Shrimp Tacos and orders them frequently. They bring every table a big basket of chips, delicious salsa and a big glass of water to start with. They have two types of chips and I prefer the thin flour chips, but heck if they bring me chips, I. will. eat. them. 

We will probably continue to go to the Pinnacle Peak location because it's closer to home and we prefer the atmosphere. If you don't mind unsupervised children running around while their oblivious parents stare at their phones, the DC Ranch location is for you.",2018-08-08 02:26:56

I initially thought it was a multi-course meal, but it is in fact a BENTO BOX style setup.  Beautiful presentation...seriously, almost like a work of art!  It wowed me when they dropped it in front of me to eat :P

Lots of goodies inside...let's go!

Started with the Naan with Truffle Butter. You could definitely smell the truffle once it hit the table, but the taste was fairly mild. Still good though!  It was callin my name!

Tandoori Salmon was next.  So much flavor in each bite...this is how Indian curry should be! Loved every bite!  Out of all the plates, THIS was my favorite by far!  Seriously, if I come back here again, I will probably order a full size of this bad boy!

Miso Mustard Angus Striploin, tender and flavorful beef. The miso sauce was great...I soaked it all up with the meats!  Yum

Laab Gai : Sweet and Sour Ground Chicken Salad with Roasted Rice, Dried Chili Powder and Mint. This was very light and refreshing with the mint and lettuce wrap.  Tasty :)

Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll. Probably the only dish I didn't love, but it was still good.

And to finish, Ginger Panna Cotta. This was good, with a nice hint of ginger.

Looks like it is a little spendy here, but if you are droppin the coin, be ready to receive great food, excellent plating, and friendly service :)

Make sure you drop off some Tandoori for me on the way out!

Big Pro: BOGO sushi all the time!!

For a Saturday night, this place was pretty dead. My friend and I ordered the drink special for the day, orange creamsicle while the boys ordered beers (they seemed to have a handful of local beers available). Unfortunately, the Orance Creamsicle was a major letdown. Neither one of us liked it at all.....it tasted like some type of medicine!!

We started off with a spring roll each and an order of the crap wontons. Not a big fan of the crab wontons, maybe a bit to much creamcheese and not enough crab! The spring rolls were pretty good though. 

We ordered 8 rolls for the 4 of us: a few Bagel rolls, a San Francisco Roll, a cruncy tuna roll, and a few others. They came out on this huge boat which was alot of fun. Someone sitting beside us actually asked to take a picture cause the boat was that cool!

Unfortunately, none of the rolls were that amazing. I mean, the San Francsico roll was by far the best. I loved that lemon on top. Such a light and refreshing roll. The rest were just ok. Not amazing. But not poor either. I don't feel like I have super snobby sushi tastes. Just wasnt a fan of Akahana.....maybe a bit too bland for my taste!",2015-04-21 14:47:23

I'm not that crazy about the price but I guess because it's using liquid nitrogen the price is higher. That being said at least the portions are decent and not that small. 

I wish they had more flavours though or perhaps customizable ice cream option. Their pop ice is a nice change from ice cream and quite large in size but I would prefer ice cream in general.

The Wvrsts in a hotdog bun would fill you up more than order them just by themselves with their curry sauce. I'm not sure if I had the duck-fat fries or just the normal fries but it sure tastes good together with my Venison Wvrst in a bun. I think the wvrst in a bun order come with one complimentary dipping sauce and I picked the Sweet Chili Mayo which was great for dipping the bun in, but the winning condiment was definitely the horseradish mustard, man I just couldn't stop putting it on every bite of my sausage and bun.

Went with the steak sandwich and Korean chicken. OMG, both outstanding! Steak was super juicy and prime quality. The Korean chicken I was skeptical about because it's a fried chicken breast. And, many restaurants will fry the chicken in the morning; by the end of day if still available it's old, old, yuck. Not the case here. Both sandwiches were awesome.

That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I waffled back and forth on this place, unable to decide if it was worth three or four stars.  I settled on three and a half, and rounded down because it's Monday.  Notwithstanding the rating, I recommend you try it at least once.

After a weekend jam-packed with excitement, Thursday seems so long ago but I remember vividly the group of about 20 of us that gathered to say farewell to FARC and fellow meatatarian Deanna ""if it once ate, I'll eat it at least once"" W.  I arrived late but still had a little time to case the joint before getting a beer* in my hand and my order in.  Gio Rana's is built inside an old bank**, with high ceilings and an open-concept kitchen near the back of the large dining area.  It's not that exciting, save for the Really Really cool private wining and dining room that used to be the bank's vault.

The menu consisted of a sheet of white paper, printed double-sided, in a ratty plastic sheath.  Really Really cheap-looking.  Thankfully, selection was good, and everyone at the table seemed to be able to find something they wanted.  I found lots, and ended up settling on pan-seared scallops with pork belly and jus, pork tenderloin in a walnut and gorgonzola sauce and beet, tomato and goat cheese salad. (these, and two bottles of beer, set me back $60 including a respectable gratuity).

Scallops

My first bite gave me a bit of a foodgasm.  Two scallops, and a healthy dose of pork belly.  They were Really Really big, and perfectly cooked.  Regrettably, a bit of grit (not sure if that's a given with scallops, but I wish it weren't).  The pork belly was a nice nod at the more traditional bacon-wrapping, and the jus was a nice complement.

Pork Tenderloin

Really Really Nice Gorgonzola sauce.  Portion was quite large, and the pork was nicely done.  Found myself mopping up the sauce with whatever I could find around me.  Eventually just picked the plate up and licked it clean.

Beet Salad

Tasty, but unremarkable.  It was what it was and I'd probably try something else next time.  Also, got hit with a giant piece of onion near the end of it that left me with onion-mouth until I got a few pints of draught in me at our next stop.

Service:  

Our group of 20 was handled professionally from where I was sitting.  Deanna's co-FARC Christine ""charfcuterator"" C may beg to differ; sitting across from me the poor doll was elbowed and bumped for most of her time at the table.  Still, we were taken care of and we weren't kept waiting any longer than might be expected for such a large group.

Is Gio Rana's Really Like an East Side Mario's?  Really?

I kinda think so.  It's loud and chaotic, and the décor is equally kitschy.  The service is ""run around like a chicken with your head cut off"" style (but effective) and the place is good for large groups.  

While the food is absolutely delicious, I still feel like I'm getting hosed when I pay 60 bucks at a place that so desperately needs a makeover (or at least a nosejob) and has such horribly cheap-looking menus.

Okay, do you know how many East Indian restaurants that I have been to?  A lot!  Not only that, I have quite a number of co-workers who are superb cooks whose curries, vindaloos and biryanis would put most restaurant's food to shame.  In other words please don't serve me naan bread, curry or a biryani that has been sitting around for 8 years.  To me, restaurants should treat their customers like their favorite family members.  In other words, restaurants shouldn't serve you something that they wouldn't eat themselves.  That's why Choolaah is such a departure from the average (And I do mean ""average"" East Indian style) restaurant where food sits on a hot table FOREVER!

I would rather have a little bit of a wait for fresh food rather than have old food served to me quickly.  As soon as you step into Choolaah, you get the impression that everything is fresh.  The design of the place is fresh, the wait staff always seems to be freshly enthusiastic about you being their customer and most of all, the food tastes EXTREMELY fresh!   Fresh, I tells ya!  So fresh that you can actually see items being made and being taken out of the tandoori ovens.  Yay!  It's rare to see that happening at most inexpensively priced restaurants where the owners actually WANT you to see how they prepare food and what goes into everything.  (It seems like the more honest the restaurant is about how they prepare food, the more expensive the food is...)  And I like the fact that you can find something to eat here whether you are a meat eater, pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan.  How sweet is that?  And no one there tries to make you feel guilty about any of your food choices.  (I'm so sick and tired of vegans looking at me with disgust on their faces because I eat almost everything.  Hey, my parents grew up during the Great Depression and me and my siblings didn't get the chance to opt out of various food groups.  You ate what was presented to you or you faced it again during your next meal.  End of story!)

You can have one of their tandoor oven BBQ meals with meat, fish or vegetarian options (tofu and veggie BBQ OR you can have a wrap or salad with one of the previously mentioned options.  You can also have a specialty dish (E.g.,Masala Bowl with yellow lentils and rice, Chicken Biryani or Pav Bhaji - vegetarian sliders)  And don't forget to try out their various sauces. (I'm a sauce-a-holic and so is my daughter Muff.  We tried everything and used every sauce in the place in our quest to find ""the"" perfect sauce.  Woo, Lord!)  And don't forget to wash your food down with one of their lovely drinks (E.g., Mint Ginger Lemonade or one of their lassies).

I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.

The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.

The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I can't complain too much I guess.

The thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well.

Among the fine tunes I heard were Phoenix's ""1901"" and Stone Roses' ""Fools' Gold"". Like, whoa. 

So back to brunch. I ordered the Veggie Eggs Benedict, which was perched atop fried tomatoes instead of english muffins and smothered in orange chipotle sauce, a nice change from the usual hollandaise.

The shop itself isn't glamorous, but appeared clean enough. I love the massage pedicure chairs and the fact that they use disposable liners in the pedicure tubs. That is a great feature that makes me feel confident that my feet are being cared for in a very hygienic manner. 

The prices are excellent and they have a punch card which will give you $25 towards your next  service after 10 visits. I may be the last living soul who still gets regular (not gel) mani's and pedi's. This is only $35 here, and that's about the cheapest I've found. I upgraded to a deluxe pedicure for $10 and it was totally worth it. At one point, though, during the deluxe pedi, I had to reach down and quickly wipe off the hot oil on my leg because it was TOO hot. 

My nail tech didn't introduce herself or talk to me at all. I don't need a lot of conversation during this pampering ritual. In fact, I like to turn on the massage chair and zone out with my eyes closed. But the fact that I don't even know her name isn't professional. 

My biggest issue was communication. I had some ""special requests"" regarding my cuticles, etc. that I couldn't clearly get across to the person doing my nails, and it appeared to be a language barrier. I'm very sensitive to language barriers, but it's difficult when it affects the kind of service I expect and receive. I could tell she was getting a little frustrated with me and, at one point, who I can only assume is the manager (since he answers all the phone calls), came over and clarified/translated for me. In this situation, it's important that the onus for clear communication in the face of a language barrier falls on the business itself, and not the customer. I recommend, then, a translator asking customers in advance if they have any special requests, or for the employee who doesn't quite understand what's being asked to request translation sooner. This would help to avoid miscommunication, mistakes, and a level of discomfort and embarrassment for the customer. 

I don't like having to dry my nails at the small desk fan when they're done, but I guess dedicated nail dryers are becoming obsolete since most people are using gel now. The employee assured me that my nails were dry and, as soon as I got in the car, I smudged one of them. 

In the end, my nails look very good (besides the one smudge). The treatments were not rushed and I felt like the tech was very detailed. I will definitely be back in the future to try again. But I hope the experience is a little ""easier"" next time.",2016-07-18 23:49:00

Our server was average at best, and seemed pretty disinterested.  I would recommend some prompts at various stages in the meal vs. his approach of just standing there.  Here are some examples (I base these on having dined out once or twice):

-May I get a drink order put in for you?
-Would you like to start with some appetizers?
-Would you like to see the desert list?
-Can I bring you the check instead of making you wait here 30 minutes in these tiny wooden chairs while your buttcheeks cramp up?

The short rib I had was cooked well, but had little flavor and the jus just appeared to be basic beef broth.  Little Lady had the mushrooms (which were excellent) and the pops had the swordfish which he enjoyed.  I was amped about having Anchor Steam on tap...but alas, it was warm!

This is not a state-of-the-art stadium. It is hard to even imagine Major League teams scheduling an exhibition here; however, apparently they do every year. (I have never been.)(Bartman curse.) 

I come here for the AAA Las Vegas 51's, and there is a good reason to come: tickets are dirt cheap, parking is cheaper (although there is a bunch of free parking)(paid parking is unamerican), and the 51's have been winning. Moreover, it hardly ever rains. (Out of all the check-ins displayed above, only one game was a rain out.)

Box Office
I only deal with the Will Call window. The lady/gentleman there is always super-nice. Unfortunately, there are always imbeciles in this queue who hold up the window by trying to retrieve tickets not under their name but under the names of their father, uncle, great-grandfather (deceased), or dog. Bring a book. 

Food & Drink
It sucks. 'Beer Man' Bruce can be routinely heard -- louder than the PA even -- with his booming voice explaining how there is beer here! Beeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! 

If you are here for dollar beer, you have stand in specific queues for the cups of dollar beer. Don't drink and drive.

Miscellaneous 
Restrooms are actually pretty nice; must have gone through a remodel recently. Always clean, according to my experience. UNLV can learn something here.

Drink water. Wear sunscreen.

I think the studio has a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. But this one has this jetted tub by the window so you can enjoy the tub with a nice view. The shower is awesome and huge!  This room is huge! Just to give you an idea, there were 3 separate air conditioning controls. It was kind of difficult to keep the temperature perfect. Separate living room., pretty large stainless kitchen, two bathrooms, huge closets, washer and dryer, fireplace and it even had a little vanity table and chair to do your makeup! The bed was super comfy!

I did really like the room. The view was awesome. I had a corner so it's a wrap around balcony which make the view even nicer.  Just be aware that you can not  open the balcony door anymore. I heard it's due to people jumping , not necessarily there but Vegas in general. It's a shame because it would be really nice to go out there. I understand that perhaps Vegas is not the type of town to have a balcony, I am sure it could be depressing losing all your money and being drunk 24-7.

What I didn't care for was I had to call because there were no robes in the room. Then I needed ice and the ice machine in the room was not working so I had to call for that. Then there was only 1 shower gel and only 1 shampoo and conditioner. I have a lot of hair. Still they were nice and brought me up a lot and they were friendly so no real big deal. Another nice thing was the use of the gym and spa facilities for the night. You get a pass, I would have liked 2 because I like to go in the morning as well. Perhaps they will give you one if you ask, I didn't so I don't know.

Used OpenTable and was able to secure a late dinner for 9pm Saturday night- the hostess and waitress were nice and we were seated with drinks fairly quickly. The menu looked good and I ordered the smoked salmon toast, crab-stuffed chicken and we ordered one of each of the desserts which were blueberry cheesecake and a salted caramel mousse thing. 

Waited about 20 mins for the app, but it was fairly busy so no issue there- the salmon toast was not overly smoked, very tasty and the only part of the meal I liked. When the entree came I was kinda taken aback by what was an actual menu item- they serve two crusted and fried chicken breasts with a cold crab cake in the middle. There was a thick lemon caper sauce on the top breaded chicken breast but not enough to overcome the dry fried mess of a plate. The chicken was pounded thin and the breading was easily double the amount of chicken. The crab was decently seasoned but overpowered. I barely ate any of it. 

Desserts were both overly sweet and unbalanced. So disappointed. I'm glad we didn't pay menu prices for this because I can't imagine going back.",2017-09-25 17:52:49

Decor is still not much changed from the previous restaurants that have been in here but there has been some modest updating and some of the flat screen TV;s have been removed which opens up the space somewhat.

Our service was not all with it today.  He did a good job upselling the desert menu only to find that most of the items he promoted and we ordered were no longer available.

I waited for the pick up was and the young man making sandwiches didn't acknowledge me. So I waited until I realized that my food was probably just back there ready to be picked up. I had to get his attention and ask him if they had my sandwich ready at first he couldn't find it but finally figured out it was hanging on the hook behind him. 

Not a huge deal but the reason I order online so it's ready and I can pick it up quickly, I have an hour for lunch, and I tried to avoid extra wait time. 

So I will probably go back and try a different combination of things on my sandwich.",2015-05-02 14:04:24

Up at the front you can see lots of fish and lobsters in the tanks.
Tables are covered in sheets of white plastic. Haven't seen that for awhile.

We ordered the lunch special. As of Dec 2016, prices are $5.75 for rice dishes, $6.50 for noodle dishes. Apparently some menus are going to be updated tonight...

I've heard about the portion sizes and people are not exaggerating. It's a massive plate that you would normally get in a regular order. It being a lunch special didn't seem to make a difference.

Their chow mein is pretty satisfying. Nice and crispy and not completely drenched in sauce.

Unfortunately, the vermicelli I got was no good. It had a burnt flavor, and I wasn't sure if it was the oil they used or they just burnt the noodles while processing the lunch rush orders. But I'll let that slide since chow mein was good.",2016-12-06 22:53:15
VbJfLl1sipNR0fF4nMTFdw,ZyNaPQFOsaKOOLHTFVAdZw,KfuNW67ZM3jegHT4txnHbg,4,9,17,10,"So before I start my review, I'd like let Yelp know that I don't appreciate my Thai Lahna review disappearing. Where is it Yelp? I just went to the Thai Lahna business page and I know FOR A FACT I left them one review AND one review update and a CTRL+F for ""Georgeann"" isn't highlighting anything on either page of reviews. I needed that review as reference for this review, as I don't want to hold Touch of Thai and Thai Lahna to different standards. HOW FAIR AND BALANCED OF ME. But I digress.

So I originally was going to give Touch of Thai one less star than Thai Lahna. To me, the sauces just weren't as flavorful and the Thom Yom Gai wasn't as orgasmic. That's not to say it wasn't good. You know that saying ""Sex is like pizza, even when it's bad it's still pretty good"". Well, I've had some doughy, tasteless excuses for pizza and they were pretty damn awful, so I hereby propose to replace ""pizza"" with ""Tom Yum Gai"". I really feel like that could catch on.  

Anyway, so with that in mind I was going to give this place three stars because I was PRETTY sure I gave Thai Lahna four (however, I have no way of knowing for sure because Yelp is censoring my shit like a god damn fascist). Upon further thought, I remembered that the main reason I gave Thai Lahna a star detriment was because of their kinda crappy service. Food takes a pretty long time and, while not rude, I wouldn't really call them ""friendly"" either. Plus, they only serve coke in a can. I've been in to Touch of Thai  for both eat-in and take-out and both times the service was fast and friendly, definitely nothing that would warrant a star deduction. So they go up to four stars, because that's pretty much what I'd give their food and with no service adjustments either way, I'd say that's fair.  To recap

Thai Lahna - One Star for Food + One Star for lack of service/fountain soda problems = Touch of Thai

I'd definitely go back. The great (albeit hidden) location right in Old Town, cute interior, and friendly service makes up for the minor taste issues. Besides, you know what they say about sex and Tom Yum Gai...",2011-08-29 19:23:47

F4eWfWXXSv8jvnk18wJPsg,5uqdnq1Vwva4PM1xuBC65w,lVN1516THpVQ7NtU7f-eNw,1,4,2,2,"First, let me say that I do love Outback and think that it's one of the best places in Surprise to enjoy a good steak but....  I guess that even the good places can have a bad day; a very bad day especially if you get stuck with the worse waiter in restaurant history.

Yesterday, April 19th was a bad day for Outback.  Our party of 7 called ahead for seating (I have Outback listed in my contacts because I go there pretty often) and were seated in a reasonable amount of time and then we sat and sat and sat till finally our waiter finally showed up.  We ordered appetizers and drinks and after another LONG wait, our drinks and snacks arrived and then, he disappeared again!   Honestly, he seemed confused & not familiar with the menu (he took the menu from my wife to see if what she was ordering was actually on the menu).  Eventually he did come back, spilled some water on the table and took our order - as I said, he didn't seem to be the least bit familiar with the menu and later, my suspicions were confirmed when my cold overcooked tough steak showed up - it wasn't the cut that I ordered.  I mean, how hard is it to order a Filet Mignon? 

Anyway, after we ordered and eventually finished the appetizers and drinks we keep waiting and waiting and waiting for our food or at least maybe a refill of our drinks but that wasn't going to happen.  Some in our party got their dinner salads they ordered, some didn't but we couldn't ask about the undelivered food because again, there was NO followup service and when he disappeared, he really disappeared!  After another long wait, a really long wait with empty drink glasses all around, our food was delivered - cold.  Really, I guess the long wait was because someone forgot to bring the food to the table because it was obvious that the plates were just left sitting somewhere, God knows where.  Again, no followup service to see if anyone needed steak sauce or condiments which would have been nice to have had some horseradish and A-1.  Still no dinner salad for one person in our party and one didn't even get their order till we were able to grab the attention of a busboy to see if he could possibly find our disappearing waiter.  Poor Olivia (our guest of honor) finally got her food after most of us were about 1/2 way though with our cold steaks when her food arrived and John (Olivia's dad) finally asked about his dinner salad which finally came at the end of his meal. I guess it was a desert salad? 

Another long wait (we have now been at Outback for about 1 1/2 hours by now) and our waiter comes to start clearing dishes and to ask if our food was OK and would I like another beer!  Really? Now you ask?!!? From the time our food was delivered till the time he is taking dishes away, this is the first time he has asked about our food and if everything was OK.  Nothing like a meal with nothing to drink - no beer, not even water!

Another long wait - and now it's time for our checks to come - wait, wait, wait.  At this point I just want out of there and to go home.  Please bring me my check!  At last the check comes and my bill is $38 bucks.  I give him my credit card and when the receipt comes it's now $51 - WTF! He tells me that he made a mistake on my bill and had to add the additional charge - but didn't tell me what the mistake was so I don't know why all a sudden I was paying an additional $13.  I just sign the damn thing because by now, all I want to do is to get out of there and go home!

OK, here comes the finishing touch to this disastrous evening.  Ready for this?  As he is handing me the credit card receipt for me to sign (with the additional $13 added) he asked, ""would anyone care for desert""?  Really?  The tab has been paid, the table cleared and our party is preparing to say our goodbyes to each other and he wanted to take our desert orders.  Did he forget that we had already paid our bill?  

I did call the manager when I got home (Susan Thompson) and she asked that I come back so she can make this awful experience right.  I'll do a followup review when that happens.",2013-04-20 13:34:58

I was pleased to see the 'Everybody loves us on Yelp' sticker on their window when I walked in.  The restaurant was pretty crowded for a Monday lunch but we had no problem getting a table...

I like how they bring chips and several salsa choices to start off... It was hard not to eat too many as they were really tasty!  It was tough to decide what to order as everything sounded delicious!  I loved that they had a variety of salad options as I usually go with salads for lunch.  I finally decided on the hearts of palm salad + shrimp.  The half portion was just the right size for my hearty appetite!  One of my friends had the street tacos and the other had the Ticoz chop chop salad.  We were all pleased and went home feeling extremely satisfied.

I would like to go back one evening to try their sangria and sample some of the other things on the menu.  The guacamole sounds awesome!  I like Alicia B's idea of going with a group and sharing a bunch of different items.

Seafood Chowder was excellent; it was a hot and creamy chowder with clams, potatoes, celery, and some zip.

They are located in a strip mall. You may miss them unless you was looking. Very simple lay out. Has a home feeling. Nothing fancy. Clean. As you enter you pass a glass case with very good looking pastries. An extremely nice young man showed me to a table. It was about 4:30pm so I was the only person in the restaurant. He asked if I had eaten Filipino food before. I told him only twice before and I would need help. He suggested the beef steak. Prepared in a sauce with onion and potatoes. No processed taste, genuine home cooked meal.  Very taste. There was a salad of fine noodles. I did enjoy everything I had a dessert of Ube and a cup of coffee. When i left everyone invited me back. It was only about 5:15pm by now and they were setting up for a band that plays there on Fridays. I have been to a lot of places to eat. The people here made me feel at home and welcome.

The last course was my absolute favorite: caramel cookie and creme, crispy cookie with pecans set on top of salted caramel cream mousse. Heaven!

My family and I ordered the following: Two chirashi sets, one G set, and one H set. 
Despite the very different menu photos and presentation, we received the following (see photos). I'll let you be the judge as to the difference!

They literally all had the same things - the only sashimi they had was salmon, the roll and handroll had fried salmon, and there was a shrimp tempura and rice. The only thing different was the presentation; the chirashi had the salmon sashimi on the rice, Set G had it on the side, while Set H received everything separated in little compartments.

The rice was horrendous! I could take long-grain rice, heat it up, and it would still taste better than this. It was hard, tasteless, and there was even rice crisp from the rice cooker. They also added the same sickening sweet sauce to everything. The shrimp tempura was stale, and soggy (because of the sweet syrupy sauce).

That being said, they do provide a variety of appetizers. We received edamame, agedashi tofu (with the sauce), fried dumplings (also with the sauce), fried salmon (again with the sauce), congee, miso soup, and salad. The waitress was also very kind.",2017-03-19 18:48:02

I booked the appointment for 12 sharp and she arrived at 1:15. It was first requested to be rescheduled for 12:30 instead which I was fine with, and then about an hour before noon I received a call and a text message saying she could not make it from her current location in Toronto to my home in brampton in time, so then informed me that 1:15 is the time she would arrive. Prior to arriving she informed me of the hassle of using the public transit and carrying a vacuum around and asked if I have one available for use, which I agreed she could use ours, however she also did not have a mop/swifter available to clean our floors (she ended up using ours) and also did not have any swifter pads or another product to clean the floor with (which was also used from us), I believe this is very unprofessional. Otherwise, some highlights of the cleaning was that the downstairs bathroom and entertainment room were done very well, however as the hours passed it seemed to get more and more sloppy of a job. The carpet upstairs were good but the stairs were not vacuumed well, or possibly some of them not done at all. I was slightly mortified by the kitchen as it looked like it had barely been touched, and the recycling wasn't taken out, however the dishes were all cleared away. In the living room and in the bedrooms there was still dust everywhere, on bookshelves, tv stands, bed posts, and the fireplace, etc. The bathroom floor upstairs still had hair on the floor and in corners. The bathtub was done well on the inside but the top corners of the tub weren't done. The faucets were not cleaned or wiped, and all the light switches had water/cleaner spots of residue dried on them. The back of the sink was also left with a small pool of water behind it which eventually dried up and left water rings. She also missed emptying one of our garbage cans upstairs, and left our vacuum in the middle of the hallway, un-emptied and cords not wrapped but instead halfhazardly left all over the vacuum. Additionally, one major issue was that she completely missed one of our bedrooms. We have a three bedroom house, two bedrooms located on the upper floor and one downstairs, which I confirmed with her when she first came over that there was a bedroom downstairs that needed cleaning as well, in the end she said she didn't have time to do it. I specifically ensured I purchased your longest cleaning (4 hours) so that I wouldn't encounter an issue with things not being finished. Considering it took our cleaning professional 4 hours to only finish two bathrooms and two bedrooms and other common areas, this is extremely disappointing and frustrating. We previously had a 2 hour cleaning service weekly for many years therefore I'm well aware of what can and should be done in the amount of time giving during a cleaning service. I've also never previously been asked to provide supplies, and our past cleaning companies have always finished my home top to bottom (including basement bedroom) with no problems. I was recently in the market for a home cleaning service again which is why I decided to try Handy out, however after this experience I'm very doubtful in this company's ability to provide me with a good cleaning service, or even a mediocre one for that matter.

Walking in I was impressed with the place. Very nice looking with comfortable seating spread out indoors and outdoors.  A little warm today to eat outside IMO but can imagine at night it would be great.

Ordered some garlic knots and a meatball sandwich.

Garlic knots - I knew this was trouble the moment I looked at them.  You ever buy a sourdough roll at Albertson's or something like that?  The outside of the bread looks tough and really chewy?  Yup....that's what the garlic knots are like here.  The outside of the bread is just disgusting.  It was inedible.  They painted some butter and garlic on it but not really enough even if the bread was good.  I can't believe they served me that.
Meatball sub - Meatballs were lukewarm.  Not sure what that means but fear it's cause they reheated it.  Though honestly the meatball itself had good flavor and was juicy enough inside.  The sauce, however, was gross.  They put way too much on so it slobbered everywhere and it tasted way too sweet.  Not sure if it's homemade or from a can - I'd guess from a can.  

I have no idea why I'm not giving this one star since the service wasn't very good either - they did have more employees than customers when I went yet the staff was kind of sitting around chatting while some people needed service.  Not really a very well run place either food or service wise.

I did like my waitress.  She was nice even though not very attentive.  She made a pretty awful Arnold Palmer but was nice and asked if I liked the garlic knots.  Feel bad lying to her that they were good.

The salad was mostly mixed greens with just a few little olives in it and not much dressing and the pizza didn't have huge flavours like I would have expected.  They were kind of lean on the fish (and cheese) but the fish was fresh.  Again, just OK.

To be honest, the pasta dishes looked a lot more appealing.  The couple at the next table had ordered the Seafood Linguine and the Meatball Spaghetti and both looked delicious; they finished every last bite.

However, the food was OK at best and for 8.99 + drink a person my expectations were a bit higher.  I got the biscuits & gravy that was on special.

When I started dating my boyfriend a little over three months ago, he was a heavy smoker. He was able to transition from smoking cigarettes to vaping, thanks to the personal help for Adam at TruVape. My boyfriend said to me, ""where can we go, where I can just tell the person exactly what I want, and it'll give me the big clouds I'm looking for?"" I knew instantly to take us to TruVape. All my friends who vape rave on about the place, so I had to trust them. 

Adam was extremely helpful, very personable and knowledgable about all the million juices they have available and all the different modes, boxes, and all the extra gadgets to make your vape just how you want it. My boyfriend was looking for something new, tank, something you don't have to dip constantly, but will provide some thick clouds. Adam was able to get us a really good package deal for a Snow Wolf 200W Box Mod, a 120ml thing of juice at 3% nicotine, and some other stuff for the vape (I don't know the exact name but it's the heads where the coils are?) all for a little under $200. 

The juice flavor was awesome, and even better than it comes in such a large bottle and not the little ones. Adam set the whole thing up for my boyfriend and we were able to walk out of there, cigarettes free. 

The atmosphere of the place is very chill and laid back, they have hip hop music playing, occasionally a movie will be playing in the background on the large screen tvs. They have big comfy couches for people to chill and hang on, or for people like to who have no idea whats going on and are just waiting lol to just sit, relax, and wait. Very clean establishment, which is really good cause they are in Chinatown and we all know how Chinatown can get. They even have a mod building station so people can buy their stuff and build the things themselves. Presentation of all the stock is always well kept and organized, which makes everything even more presentable. And what I did notice, is that every associate working there really takes their time with each customer. Every time we've been there, I've never felt rushed, even if there were other people waiting to be assisted. Each associate really listens to the customers wants and provides as many sample tries of the juices until the right one is found. I can always appreciate an establishment that takes their time with the customer. It provides for more loyal customers and a great customer relationship with each person that walks in their door.

I made sure to hold off on writing this review so it would be my 600th. Obviously, that doesn't mean anything, but it just made writing this review that much more special for me. I love dining out not only in Pittsburgh but all over the country and world, and after much thought, I have named this restaurant my ""favorite restaurant of all time.""

The hubby and I dined here with two fellow foodies and good friends in mid-February. The experience was exceptional from beginning to end. The restaurant is intimate, but the tables are still well spaced, not too crowded. Our waitress was attentive and made great recommendations. And the food - the food!! Our check was around $400, and considering the quality of our food and our overall experience, we happily paid the tab.

We ordered (and devoured):
Bacalao en Aceite
Surryano Ham
Queso en Aceite
Oxtail
Queso de Cabra
Basque Butter Lettuce Salad
Pulpo
Cochinillo (recommended for 2)

My personal favorites were the Oxtail, Pulpo, and Cochnillo. The bite of Oxtail - though petite - packed so much flavor that it was quite memorable. The Pulpo (aka octopus) was simple but very well cooked. Finally, trying the Cochnillo was just purely a lot of fun. The ""recommended for 2"" serving was on the menu when we dined - I see the ""recommended for 4"" listed a lot now - but it was plenty for the four of us to share along with everything else we ordered. The pig was just delicious, and I had never consumed anything quite like it.

In addition to the food, we enjoyed a bottle (or was it two?) of wine, and I also had the Park Guell. With ""sparkling rosado"" in the title, I was concerned that the cocktail would be too sweet, but in my opinion, it was a great balance of sweet and sour.

We finished off the evening with two servings of Churros, because apparently we just still weren't full enough. 

I cannot wait to return here again! I have actually made reservations a couple times with a friend already, but unfortunately, life's timing just hasn't worked out yet.

I liked all of the exhibits, but of course some more than others. In particular I liked the paintings on canvas.

The area where the canvas paintings were put was arranged nicely and spaced well enough so that a lot of people could look at a large amount of paintings while still having some personal space.

The AGO is a good size; its not difficult to see everything in a couple of hours. There's a good range of exhibits and range of types of different art, so there is definitely something for everyone here.

I'm a bit perturbed that they have ceased to price in-house.  They have the items sent to the  Independence Blvd location for pricing and sent back to sell.  I just find this to be completely ridiculous and inefficient.  For instance they were selling some off brand men jeans for 12.50 that's a straight rip off.

You order at the whichever counter(s) you choose (pizza, pasta, salad), watch your food being prepared in front of you, and pay on your way out.

The problem occurs when you want multiple items, or when you are with a friend. You must wait at separate stations, and the waits are usually long. It took me and a friend 45 minutes one Friday evening to get our food (when they would NOT even be considered busy). I would rather they switched to a concept where you order all of your food at once, then sit down and have them bring it to you (similar to Figo in Atlanta). It's much more customer service friendly, in my opinion. 

Being a pasta lover, I usually get the pasta. You choose your pasta and sauce separately. And there are quite a few options, although no angel hair pasta. I tried the pappardelle with funghi (creamy mushroom) sauce on one occasion. I was surprised at the generous portions. What a great value for $7.95! And, most importantly, it was delicious! My favorite so far, though, is the pesto e spinachi - a cream based vegetarian dish with pesto and fresh spinach. It's $8.95, and also a good value.

The food can be somewhat inconsistent and is sometimes bland, however. It really depends on the ""chef"" at your station. On my most recent visit, my pesto needed the basics, like salt and pepper. My friend's pomodoro was so bland that she didn't even get close to finishing it.

But, I have to mention the BREAD. I'm picky about my bread, and theirs is AMAZING -- crispy crust, moist, chewy center. It's included, so don't miss out!

I have been here several times, and have downgraded my initial 4 star rating to a 3 star one for the reasons mentioned above. It's still a good place if you are dining alone, but it wouldn't be my first choice for dining with friends again.",2011-12-10 14:27:35

From what she shared with me, upon entering everything seemed great. It was a long wait for the car, but that is normal with a detail. She got the full interior and wash for her car. After about 3 hours later when they told her the car was done was where everything went wrong. 

Upon entering, she noticed that her whole car horn had been stripped of paint. Now, when she confronted them about the issue, there was no ""I'm sorry"" or ""we will fix that"" It was a verbal attack by 4 different employees saying it was her fault for buying her car from a ""cheap dealership"" and they could not be held accountable. My daughter-in-law has had her car for 6 years and had it detailed many times before (inlcuding one time by myself), so if this was the case we think we would have noticed by now.

After about 30 minutes of different employees coming up and telling her this was standard and our fault and they could not be held accountable, they informed her they would not give her money back, she finally got them to agree to repaint the car horn.

A week later, she brought her car back to get it fixed and low and behold when she was told it was finished the paint was the wrong color. They did not mention this prior to doing the paint job, but after they simply said ""This is the closest you'll get."" 

She was so digusted and tired of dealing with ths issue, at this point it was not even worth the fight. Now she is $100 short, drove 25 minutes out of her way two weekends in a row to go to this place, and she has a car horn that does not match the rest of the car interior paint.

Loved the pedicure, hated the nail job. The day i came in it just so happened to be the receptionist's first day. She was clearly flustered and and had no clue about pricing. this was understandable ... what wasn't understandable was the owner yelling at her almost every five minutes in front of everyone. Not only was the owner yelling at her ... she was yelling at almost the entire staff.  Yes it was busy when I went but still there has to be some level of professionalism.  Guess who ended up doing my nails ... the owner.  This was terrible because she was paying more attention to what was going on in the salon than to doing my nails (at one point she even yelled at someone mid nail file). Well, my nails turned out crappy (uneven and bumps in the gel) and I ended up going somewhere else the next day to fix them.  The Pedicure on the other hand was much better, despite the yelling in the background. The pedicure area is set up like the ""knights of the round table"". All the massage pedi chairs are set up in a circular fashion vice a straight line like most places. This was neat as you got to watch other people get their pedis and its a perfect setup if you plan to have a pedi party with your girl/boyfriends.

I never get chocolate flavored anything, I like chocolate but not in a hefty form like ice cream. But it just looked so rich and dark in the encasing that I had to ask for a sample. Needless I say I was blown away. My first time getting chocolate flavored ice cream - that says a lot! That made up the outside of my flower while vanilla made up the interior.

First off, the space is way too small for a Smashburger. I don't know why they thought they could cram one into this teeny tiny space. I would avoid coming here during popular meal times because there would be nowhere to sit. They are severely lacking in seating space and tables. Another problem is their huge windows mean more than half of the seating is made unusable when the sun is hitting them just right. You will be blinded or roasting from the solar rays. They have pull down shades but they do a poor job of blocking out the sun. The layout of the place is funky as well, with their fountain drink machine located in this weird corner, causing big bottlenecks when customers are trying to fill their drinks. (Bonus points for having Coke Zero, though). 

The girl taking our orders was very slow and confused but I'm guessing this is just because the place recently opened. As always, I'll go back in a few weeks to see if they've ironed out some of the kinks. The kitchen was FAST, much faster than any other Smashburger I've ever been to. This sort of worried me and I expected my burger to taste crappy or my order to be incorrect -- but it wasn't!

My burger was exactly how I ordered it and it was good! It didn't look that tasty but it tasted great. I was very happy. Most of you know I'm a low carb eater so I love when a place doesn't blink twice when I ask for ""no bread or bun."" Sometimes it's too difficult for people to understand and my burger comes out on a bun anyway. Here it was SUPER EASY. In fact, the kitchen even served my burger on two slices of lettuce so I could make them into a ""bun"" if I wished (see my photo). I LOVED THIS! THEY EARNED AN EXTRA STAR JUST FOR THIS!

Premium add-ons like bacon and avocado will cost you $1 each. I'm totally bummed that they have removed the chili from their menu. I loved adding chili to my burger. Now it's kind of boring without it.",2013-08-22 17:15:51

Some of our favorites are the dirty martini, pear martini, lychee martini and the morning after cocktail. They have a large outdoor seating area with an outdoor bar as well. Service is always inconsistent and there are times when it's easier to order a drink at the bar instead of waiting for someone to come to the table. Getting a table has never been an issue when I've gone with my friends which is usually between 4-730pm any day of the week.

After watching the show we added them to our 'running restaurant list' to patron in the future.  Last week we were due to be out and about running errands, so after surveying our 'list,' decided to grab lunch at Hob Nobs - OMG, am I soooooooooo glad we did!  We arrived during off hours (approximately 1:30pm) so the place was our own little private cafe, but as soon as we entered the door we were greeted with great service and food recommendations.  I selected the 1/2 sandwich and soup option with the 'Doc's Choice' on marble rye.....This choice turned out to be the BEST Turkey Sandwich I've ever had!  Doc's Choice is not your 'run-of-the-mill' Turkey sandwich, however.  This lovely lunch (or dinner dyno) is stacked high with mesquite smoked turkey breast, a chipotle aioli, roasted red peppers, pepperoncini, smoked gouda, aged white cheddar cheese, tomato & sweet onion served on a gourmet pretzel roll as a full sandwich or your choice of bread if doing a half-er (as I did).  In one word - OUTSTANDING!  

As we finished devouring our respective sandwiches, (my boyfriend had the Chicken Pesto; which was also tasty, but mine took the cake!) we made an agreement to return however many times necessary to try each sandwich available on the menu at least once!

A) for dinner- def recommend for their regular menu. Great scene 
Veggie pho- delicious for being all veggies
House oysters- during dinner- Super pricey and not very tasty- btw the 3 of us we ordered 12 and there was a HAIR in one of the oysters which threw our appetite out of the way for the oysters so we didnt even eat them
Shaken beef salad- delicious deep fried beef- very flavorful and DEF recommend 
Notifications stout- Deep and chocolately
Shrimp Bloody Mary- see attached pics- so much stuff inside but not very strong

LOBSTER PHO or lobster fried rice is supposedly the thing to try here: didnt try in- because it is 45$ per order for approximately a 1.5lb lobster


Happy hour: see attached pics- drinks and food (Friday Afternoon)
DEF NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HAPPY HOUR- the food was terrible and not I understand why this place wasnt more busy for happy hour especially with such a nice venue and space. But after eating, my hubby and I both said this place probably had the worst happy hour ever. We actually left feeling unhappy. 
- kronenboug blanc-witbeir: Great beer- Def recommended
- Dogfish Head - Seaquencg Ale- Sour sour sour beer, not for all
-Oysters 1.00 a piece- THEY LOOKED SUPER SUPER OLD and dried out. I returned my first order of 6, just to have them bring me a set of oysters (which looked like the ones i just sent back) that were old and dried out and stuck to the shell because they looked like they had been previously shucked and just sitting in the fridge- They also tasted old (not juicy, not salty with the brine from the inside of the shell)- Worst worst oysters I have ever ordered and I cant believe i didnt get sick after trying one 
- Serrano fried chicken wings: regular deep fried wings- no flavor at all. When they say serrano fried chicken, I was expecting a sauce that would make the wings more flavorful. But the serrano chiles looked like they were fried in oil with garlic and then just pour with oil over the wings- DEF NOT RECOMMENDED- order came with 6 and my husband and I couldnt even finish the order- and we love chicken wings
- deep fried and regular pork buns: DEF recommended and you can get one of each since the order comes with 2 buns

so we haven't even ordered yet, but he comes out with a plate of tofu with fresh grated ginger and green onions...""Jus' throw some shoyu on that, das da winnah!""( Local style meaning ""thats the bomb"", ""off the hook"" ""thats the shiizznit""...Catch my drift?)

So we finally get to ordering. Me and my bro order their popular Combo Plate while mom gets the Stone Pot Bibimbap, and Pop 
surprises Russell with his order of Fish Jun....""Ho, how you know dat???""Pops replies""you can only get this back home""

after talking story with Russell for a good 15 minutes more, Our orders arrive and we start chowing down. No complaints about any of the food or the service here. this is a prime example of good food done right. They buy the best ingredients possible, even if it has to come from Hawaii, and they never deviate from tradition or technique which has allowed them to continue for the past 18 years.

On top of our huge orders, a plate of fried mandoo comes out, as well as soup(Okuhara's Saimin Base, Russell confirmed). Boy were we stuffed, but seriously, if you're looking for good local style or Korean food, Island Siyle is DA WINNAH!!! ALOHA!!!!",2010-07-16 00:22:18

The actual food...please, if you want good food, don't come here. They have a big selection of overpriced food items you and your family and friends can choose from. I went last night with a $50 gift card and got shrimp scampi, buffalo blast, and a moscow mule.

Shrimp Scampi-$20- breaded shrimp that was all soggy when it came out. The shrimp itself was pretty big but all dried up and had no juicyness or bouncyness in them. I usually love shrimp, but I had two of these and couldn't handle anymore. The angel hair pasta was alright...

Buffalo Blast-$10- big portion for an appetizer! But way overcooked, and most of it is just breading anyways. 

Moscow Mule-$10-for a moscow mule?! It better be good. Well, it wasn't. It was so sweet and I did not taste a bit of alcohol. 

I've been here many times when I was young to celebrate many achievements in life, and I've had the food here many times. When I grew up and started paying for my own food, I ended up coming here for their 3 things I mentioned above.

I love the Hilton Garden Inn, but the regular Hilton always fails to perform. The room was okay, that wasn't too bad. The room did not have a hair dryer (bad for girls). Had to call for one. The rooms do have brand new 42"" LG LCD's. TV remote died during the stay. So I called the Housekeeping people (who fix things, etc.) and they didn't even know what TV I had. They were describing some old TV. Didn't seem to think that I had a different one. Oh well. There is a mini fridge. Ours was not plugged in when we got there. Water for the shower does not get that warm. The shampoo and conditioner are combined (need to be separated). The ice machine on our floor (6) did not have any ice. Looked like none was even being produced. 

I wanted to get a late checkout for my departure day, but could only get that starting at 7AM of your checkout day. That sucks. Also, if you look at the phone carefully, there's no extension for the front desk. In other words, you call someone else to get transferred.

I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disappointed and just got whatever cheese platter they had. I mean, it's cheese....I love cheese; how bad could it be.
Granted, it wasn't bad as there was goat cheese and baby bell cheese with lots and lots of fruits (grapes, berries, melons) but, it wasn't my baked brie that I love so well. Especially that BM made it drizzled with honey. ***I guess I'll just have to make my own***

Friends got the lemon chicken skewers, beef tenderloin, and the seared tuna.
Lemon chicken skewers had orzo, instead of rice as its side. The chicken was as remembered but, the rice was overcooked.
Beef tenderloin was cut thicker than previous so, it was ""different.""
Seared tuna was yum. Seaweed salad on the side was good but, a little slimy.

Duck Poutine Pizza - great for sharing with friends and seriously who's not a fan of delicious poutine on pizza. Expect to be in a carb coma after devouring this meal.

Chicken pot pie - warm, hearty, total comfort food, especially with the mashed potatoes on the side. It's a satisying meal on a cold winter day.

Cheeseburger - brisket burger, topped with a light-dressed slaw that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. I love the roots chips served on the side, but you can opt for another side if you prefer.

S'mores pie - Do I really need to say much? Check out one of the pictures and you'll know.

Staff are usually pretty friendly, but we had an absolutely awful staff member at our last visit who sneered and snickered at us and had an overall dreadful attitude. 

My favorite dish is the Kung Pao chicken. Try it with steamed chicken to cut calories and fat but not taste. You can substitute noodles for about $1 extra instead of white or brown rice.

I've already reviewed the horrible Burger King chicken-of any kind. Burger King chicken tastes like chicken pumped with air. I mean, odd. Really odd. And bad. McDonald's grilled chicken is better, but I went to Wendy's. 

I get very aggravated when any fast food joints, who runs over half their business through that drive-through, can't afford or doesn't desire to fix the damn speaker. In this particular Wendy's location always has a problem with the drive-through speakers!

I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, -- GRILLED!-- it came with a kind of a honey mustard sauce that wasn't good, like it was off.  The ""honey mustard"" sauce on the chicken sandwich was too strong, for no reason.  Odd. Not flavorful. I ate it anyway, begrudgingly, eating ""past"" the honey mustard crap. 

I also ordered a small fresh mozzarella salad. Now, I have just ordered a GRILLED chicken sandwich - why this bozo would give me a fresh mozzarella salad with BREADED FRIED chicken is beyond me. 

Further, why not give me the option of ordering the fresh mozzarella salad with no chicken at all?  I am in the drive-through we got time!  When you order spaghetti at a restaurant they don't give you meatballs automatically. You have to order them. Likewise, GIVE ME THE CHOICE

If there is a common theme in all the reviews I write, it's FLAVOR!  Spice is great, fresh is fabulous, fruits gotta be fruity, but it's gotta taste good!  

The salad dressing came ON the salad, OK, not in the side, some sort of fairly hideous spicy Baba ghanouj crossed with a weird blue cheese. It was just this side of awful; it was NOT GOOD.  NOT GOOD.  Wendy's website describes the dressing as some some sort of balsamic concoction; this is about as far away from anything ""balsamic"" as anything I've ever had. 

My question is, for the general population, I can't imagine that these two flavors are popular, exciting, or wanted. Too strong, again, for no reason. See photos.

Called 800 customer service, ABSOLUTELY NO FOLLOW-UP. NONE.  That's either sloppy or arrogant neither good. 

I'll go back to Wendy's one day but maybe a burger...",2017-05-04 02:23:30

Starving, after being sick for 4 days, I texted Tony A (@lightrailblog) to meet me for breakfast.  We toyed for a few momets, via text, on where to go.  I hadn't tried this place yet.  I used to live across the street from it and waited, with much anticipation, for it to open.  I waited for three months and finally got to go.
Same type of ordering structure as the Beach House and Mushroom Burger places.
I chose the bread pudding, fried pickles and of course a breakfast bowl.  You get 3 scrambled eggs and up to 6 toppings of your choice.  All is served over potatoes.  I chose sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, green onions, roasted garlic and monterey jack cheese.
Our drinks and bread pudding were ready right away, so we dug in.   The bread pudding was really good, moist, and came with a side of icing.  Perfect starter (or dessert) for breakfast!
Our bowls took about 15 minutes.  I knew there would be a wait, because everything was cooked to order.  The place was packed, but at least I had my bread pudding to munch on.  When the dill pickles and bowls were ready, we pigged the F out!  
The toast was butter and chewy.  You could tell it was grilled.  Asked for ranch for my pickles and you could tell it was homemade ranch.  This wasn't Hidden Valley Ranch, no siree bob!
I'm stuffed.  I have the leftovers in my fridge and can't wait to dig in later.
Minus one star for the potatoes.  Not the best; not the worst.  I will definitely be back again, especially since there were hot firemen to stare at during my meal.

First off the play area is the perfect size where the kids can play and have fun exploring without getting bored after 15 minutes. They have slides, ramps, things to swing and hang on, a spiderweb thing with several levels that kids can squeeze through and more. They recently added costumes for kids to use. My son thinks the Superman cape is the best. On Thursday's they have special character visits like princesses and superheroes which my kids absolutely love. 

Now all those things are great but as a parent, here are a few things that I really like. The place is clean and well kept. They have cameras and a tv so you can see your kids in the play area. There is a separate area for kids 3 and younger to play in with age appropriate toys. There are workers that monitor the play area. The massage chairs are wonderful. The free pot coffee is great for the caffeine boost. Healthy snack choices that range from $1-$5.  Little phone charging stations scattered around the parent area.

In fact, it had been so long that I didn't even know all that Westgate stuff was even there. Imagine my surprise! I have been to a few games at the stadium, but all of the shopping and restaurants were new to me. It's absolutely beautiful here. 

It was also nearly deserted when I went today - no games going on. There's not much else out here. Just this giant oasis of awesome in the middle of a corn field. 

I've glazed over the other reviews here and I almost didn't get it at first. I mean, such polarized opinions about a pizza place. Walking around Westgate and seeing Mama Gina's, I get it now. Mama Gina's is a nice medium sized restaurant/bar. It's really clean and decorated well. The seating is comfortable and everything is new. Also - it smells like pizza - as a pizza place should.

There's a lovely patio with a giant glass door that I imagine can be opened when weather permits to have an indoor/outdoor atmosphere. There are big flatscreens playing whatever sports is on. They appear to have a full bar as well. 

I ate a slice and took a pie home. Their pizza is pretty unique. It's very flavorful and good. I could tell that their dough was made fresh daily - it was soft and airy. They clearly use quality ingredients. It's a huge cut above a cheapie chain. While waiting, I saw some other food pass by on the way to their respective tables... everything looked pretty amazing and delicious. 

A group was leaving before me and an older man said ""thanks"" to the manager. Then he added that he hadn't had pizza like that since he was a kid and that it was the best pizza he had eaten in years. It was a sincere compliment.

A slice and a soda set me back less than 5 bucks, and the slice was huge enough to fill me up. The pie I took home was as good as the slice I had. This is the kind of pizza you re-heat in the oven rather than the microwave. 

Now the problems - well, there's really only one and all other perceived problems stem from it... it's the location. Because it's next to the stadium and little else, it's either going to be super busy or relatively empty. Because of this, service isn't going to be as consistent - you're just going to have to develop a little patience. Also - most customers coming to this sort of place when busy are the ""I'm drunk and happy my team won"" or ""I'm drunk and pissed my team lost"" types - neither of which are a treat to serve when most of the time you're used to things being fairly calm. 

I recommend eating here when there's not a game (or even when there is - just be patient - same with all the restaurants in Westgate) - the food is worth a bit of a drive, and Westgate is a beautiful commerce center.",2012-01-14 03:35:22

This bustling cafe offers a fine selection of meats in tube form, from your standard pork mixes to more exotic offerings like pheasant and kangaroo. My favorite is the wild boar, which is juicy and flavored with mushrooms; however, the traditional bratwurst (a mix of veal and pork, flavored with wine) is a close second. You can get your sausage served in a toasty roll, or do as the Germans do and enjoy it sliced and slathered in curry ketchup. 

For those who have partaken in the awesomeness that is Hot Doug's in Chicago, the food is similar (down to the french fries cooked in all-that-is-holy duck fat -- which I highly recommend), but at Wvrst the decor is strictly King Street classy. The main drawback is that it's ridiculously noisy during peak times. You have to shout just to be heard, and chances are you'll leave with a hoarse voice. And service is s-l-o-o-o-w when it's busy. But the people that work there so friendly you'll forget about the 30 minute wait for your wiener (beer works wonders in making time pass quickly). 

Despite the sore spots, Wvrst is still probably one of the best places to sample a sausage in the T-dot.

Miega is located on the second floor of a small shopping center where there is a nice market on the first floor with rare fruits and several unique Asian food products.  SEVERAL things/places to see and do before/after you visit Miega.  

The restaurant is a fairly small place to eat, less than 20 tables, but it does NOT take away from the scenery.  Big screen TV's  are located throughout the restaurant showing Korean TV shows.  
Whether you arrive at lunch time (11 am-3 pm) or dinnertime, the prices are fair especially for the portions you receive!  The side dishes you receive before your meal are a GREAT addition to any meal (The Kimchi is wonderful for anyone who likes spicy food).  If you order the dumplings they are the size of pierogies and have a lot of flavor.  

Our main dishes did not disappoint either.  I order the Noodle dish with the black bean paste and it was a LARGE portion for the lunch special!  My friend lover her dish as well.  She ordered the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob served in the hot stone pot and she let me try a small portion of it and for those who LOVE spicy the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob will not be a let down!  

The ONLY issue we have ever had at Miega in the dozen or so meals we have dined on is that there has always been only one server but WOW is she quick!  She has a three shelved cart on wheels and she moves but if it's busy your food will take a little longer.",2016-01-22 02:14:41

Cons: my salad was lacking flavor (dressing wasn't doing it too much justice); kind of pricey for burgers / fries (my salad was a steal for $13.99 though)

There are a few popular things in Gilbert that have mass followings and this place (and its sister restaurant Joe's Real BBQ) is one of them. If crowds bug you, DO NOT go at a typically busy time (Thurs - Sunday). 

We went on a Tuesday night and it was not busy at all and we experienced wonderful customer service (multiple managers asked us how we were doing, another employee overheard my sister say you have to go to the window to get ranch dressing and he was quick to offer to get it for her). 

I think I am in love with the idea of this place more than the place itself. I like that you can sit outside at picnic tables under huge old trees overlooking the massive Agritopia garden. There's always kids running around playing.The coffee shop next store is super cute too with a large assortment of cupcakes each day.

Mike Bullock, writer for The Phantom, helped create a line of stories called ""Invisible Children"" based on the civil wars happening in Uganda and what horrors the children there are facing.  They are being kidnapped by a warlord and forced to fight for his army.  How sick is that?

Last Saturday, the 11th, Mike made an appearance at Samurai Comics to make people aware of what was happening and sign books.  Proceeds of the books went toward helping these children.  Samurai also donated a percentage of their sales that day to the same cause.

A co-worker of mine is a close friend of Mike's and told me there may still be copies at the store.  If you like comics, there's nothing I can think of that's better than getting something you enjoy as well as helping others in the world.

Kudos to Samurai and Mike for donating some of their time and money to helping such a cause.

Check out the website on the Invisible Children, talking about the movement to save these children's lives.

Cons:

I ordered veal picatta, it was quite smaller than i expected, but was just enough food.  (If i was more hungry, I would have been disappointed).
The meal was a bit sour, otherwise good.  (3.5/5 stars)

Mac King is funny.  He's very funny.  He throws in some jokes that sail right over the kid's heads, but he's not a ""dirty"" comedian.  Oh, he has fun for sure, but it's non-offensive.

I don't want to review the show itself too much in terms of what to expect as, like the magic itself, it's fun to be surprised.  Just when you think some of the tricks were figured out and predictable, Mac King threw some curve ball into the equation that was normally just hilarious, and showed how talented this unassuming guy in a suit that looks like it was created from your parent's couch in the 1970's really is.

The most impressive part?  After the show, he stayed behind to pose with people for pictures, sign autographs, and just TALK to people.  Normally, once the entertainer leaves the stage, that's all you get.  Good-bye, and you are done.  I got an opportunity to talk to him after the show, and found him to be completely patient, humble, and genuinely appreciative.  That, my friends, is a sign of a true class act, and with that comes my recommendation to see this show.

I also really enjoy their vegetarian plate, which comes with: falafel, tzatziki, pita, tabooli, stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush (but I sub for hummus). $7.99 for two meals worth of food!!  Any and all dining cohorts have equally enjoyed their food selections, and usually go back for more:) In addition to all the veg options, they also have chicken/lamb/beef stuffs and they even have a tongue sandwich!

I really dig their beverage options: pomegranate juice, sodas, iced tea with a familiar flavor that I can't quite figure out, yogurt soda, lemonade flavored with rose water (my favorite!).  

In addition to having delicious food, great service and low prices, they also have a grocery store on the opposite side of the restaurant.  It's great!  Lots of great ingredients that are hard to find in a regular grocery store.  They even have all the fixings for your hookah enthusiasts.

Brunch: On Sundays. Best Greek Yogurt with honey I've ever had. Perfect and pretty sure its made in house? 

Soul Roll: The spicy mayo and jalepeño give it a nice kick and salmon is bangin. 

LAMB LOLLIPOPS: If you don't get these, you're a fool. (Unless you're a veg) Perfectly cooked, french cut (lollipop style) and served with amazing pecorino. Worth the cash you'll have to drop. Every time. 

Cheese Plate: Good for sharing. Nice assortment. Manchego is fantastic. 

FRIED CHEESE: Not sure if this is always on the menu, but if it is you'll be hard pressed to stop eating it hand over fist. Amazing. 

Paninis: Mini Burgers, Mushrooms on toast and the Cubanini are my favs. Definitely a good go-to if you're in a pinch. 

Dip Trio: tzatziki, hummus, babaganoush  are all great and interesting. 

The only cons I can think of is getting a seat. Put your name in, head down to 22 for a beer and chill if it's a nice night. You can always try and squeeze in at the bar. Definitely get the same experience and can sometimes be faster on a busy night.

After seeing the pictures of the potatoes and seeing the actual thing.. it doesn't look appetizing at all! Its all grey and soggy. The taste is definitely there and was really flavorful.. but the texture of the potatoes was just gross. It was very soggy and chewy. I like my roasted potatoes with a bit of crisp on the edges.

I have only had a few things off of the menu as I usually sit at the bar & have a glass of wine or two. I love the buzz about the place: watching the chef prepare meals, the ambience, the energy of the staff & customers, etc.  

A little pricey, but worth it.  Clean & classy.  Would recommend my boyfriend taking me here any time for dinner!  

Try the lounge in the back- drink & food specials and low key.

Update:

I stuggle greatly with this review, because I really do like this place and WANT to like it so much to keep going back; however, I have never had good service while dining.

One night, boyfriend and I went for dinner.  Our service started our poorly and ended just the same.  It took 20 minutes to get water!  We debated whether or not we should have stayed.  We did, but regretted it. 

As soon as our waitress came to our table, we ordered water & food- we weren't sure if we were going to get another chance.  As luck would have it, they were out of their chili rellano, which was a disappointment.

Dim sum is a style of chinese cuisine served in bite-sized portions in small steamer dishes or on small plates.  Each dish usually comes with 3 - 4 pieces, ideal for sharing.  

Dim Sum is located on Central Avenue.  When you first pull in the parking lot, you may have second thoughts. The lot is full of pot holes and the building is a non-descript concrete square.  But, if you continue looking around, you'll notice the parking lot is probably full and there may be a line out the door - this place is a treasure!

On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, they serve traditional dim sum service.  Once you are seated, be prepared for your meal to begin quickly.  Servers with carts will come around and offer you what is available.  They will lift the lid of each dish to show you the food, if you don't know what it is - just ask!  

Each cart has a loose theme:  

The steamer cart - full of steamed dumplings and buns.  From this cart, I really like to get the pork siu mai (shoo my) - open-topped dumpling with ground pork and spices; pork steamed bun - bready bun filled with savory pork and sauce; and the leek and shrimp dumplings - shrimp and leek in a fully enclosed dumpling.  You may also like the sticky rice - this is a bundle of rice with pork and chicken bits cooked in and wrapped in a lotus leaf.   From here you can also get steamed chicken feet and pork spare ribs. 

The paste cart - this cart has shrimp and other meats that are wrapped in white, gelatinous noodles -- that look like paste.  I don't care for the texture of these items, so I wave this cart on.

The open-plate cart - this is my favorite!  On here you have items that are not steamed - they may be fried, pan seared or sauteed.  Hands-down favorite item is the stuffed eggplant with a fried shrimp mixture in it; I also like the leek dumpling and the taro root dumpling filled with pork and shrimp mixture.  The chinese brocolli, squid and spare ribs are also very good. 

This is a delightful way to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon with family/friends.  Go, you won't be disappointed!",2016-04-16 19:29:56

I know that some have trouble with the meat dishes here, either being overcooked or just plain boring, but for the most part my experience here mainly revolves around pizza, pasta, salads and desserts.

It was just 1:00 and they were not all that busy at all. Service was very slow, but, there did not seem to be a reason for that. I ordered and a salad bar or soup comes with the lunch. I chose the soup that you get yourself, it was not that good.
But, before I did that ,I had gone in to the bathroom to wash my hands. It was not very clean.
Soup was plain, and the lunch was good. But, the staff all sat down to have their lunch  as well. Which meant they were not attentive to the customers. There was about 5 tables in there. But, why not wait until your luch service is over. THey close for lunch at 2:30.

We ordered a bunch of plates.  The burger, short ribs, watermelon with goat cheese, wings, dumplings, kimchi fried rice, and tuna deviled eggs, and finally the charred bok choy.  I have an eating disorder (the opposite of the usual disorder, my problem is I eat too much) so I inhaled the food and too much of it.  Even when were done Angelo Sosa was gracious enough to have us try his miso salmon.  That was the winner out of everything.  My advice to everyone is to have this dish, but before eating it, you should just take a moment and smell the dish.  The combination of the miso salmon and the shishito peppers is pretty phenomenal.  The dish tastes as good as its fragrance.

You can't really go wrong with anything you order.  Of course I have my personal favorites (salmon, the burger), but the rest of the food is great.

When did CPK become the boozing place, Anyway, she brought out the Ice tea and hot water, however, no lemon and she was holding the glass from the top. It is a glass coffee mug ,it has a handle. Why are you putting your fingers all over the tops of the cups.??? 
T had to go to get lemon and napkins. She never asked her if she wanted more Hot water,but she did refill my Ice Tea.
We ordered the Chicken Waldorf Salad. Which was great ,but she never asked us what type of dressing we wanted. It has 2 choices.  Plus she never brought us bread, we had to ask for it.

I got the Fish Tacos and they were quite good made with Mahi.
T got the Kung Pao Pasta, with Shrimp. I sampled that as well and it was awesome.
However, Sareena never picked up any dishes from our table or trash. The manager did a drive by and she cleaned up the table for us.
Even the table behind us,yelled out to her, hey can we get some bread!
I do not agree with that, but clearly she did not know the proceedure.
When T asked for more hot water,as she was not offered any.  Our server once again brought out the cup by the top and when she put it down she actually ran her fingers over the lip one more time for good measure. IT HAS A HANDLE,WHY ARE YOU FINGERING THE CUPS!

I honestly feel like I'm in someone's home. Or an upscale hipster bar in NY. There are two bars, one focusing on beer and wine downstairs and another with craft cocktails upstairs. 

There isn't much place to sit, but some seats by the window, enough for maybe 20 people. Definitely will be more pleasant in the nicer warm weather!! You should be prepared to just stand around and chat with your friends! 

We tried two different cocktails. I definitely liked Bee's knees - nice light and sweet drink. We also tried the angostura 7 year that came with a yoghurt sphere and soy salt. Very interesting! But sadly the sphere only lasted for the first sip/gulp. More spheres next time? The rest of it is just a straight shot of angostura?

We also tried sea urchin ice cream. It was interesting a sea foodie aftertaste but overall not overwhelmingly pungent. A good introduction to sea urchin for newbies but not satisfying for seasoned tasters.

I always try a little bit of everything when I'm at the Cuban restaurant, and when my pal and I went this week, our meal was no exception. We had more than 10 different menu items peppering our table, and we both left stuffed and happy. Like it is for me, Havana Cafe instantly became one of his favorite restaurants after one meal there.

One of the coolest things about Havana Cafe is that there are mojito making classes offered there periodically. I've attended one and loved it, and the mojitos at Havana Cafe are amazing. 

When we went to dinner this week, we got a pitcher of sangria instead of mojitos, because sangria is another one of my favorite drinks. The sangria at Havana Cafe is packed full of fruit flavor, and it's a really refreshing drink that goes well with the heat of the Cuban dishes.

Let's start first with my favorite dish at Havana Cafe, the Frituras de Frijoles Negros ($5.25). They're bite-sized black bean fritters served with a cool and creamy avocado dip that is to-die-for. I love, love, love this dish and could eat it all the time.

The Maduros Fritos ($5.95) are just as amazing. They're sweet chunks of bananas that make a perfect dessert or sweet appetizer accompaniment. If you don't like eating raw bananas, you'll probably still love these.

We also had vegetable empanaditas ($6.95), mini-pies chock full of veggies. For being such little appetizer treats, they're really filling and could make a great main course for vegetarians.

I also had the Potage de Frijoles Negros ($4.95 for a bowl), which is a vegetarian black bean soup that is also very hearty. It's so tasty!

My companion got the San Juan Combination ($16.95), a massive sampler plate that lets you taste seven different dishes-a Puerto Rican tamale, plantains and pork, a vegetable croquette, twice-fried plantains, peas cooked with rice and pork, fried pork and beans and rice. The dish could probably give you 2 days' worth of leftovers-and they're not gross leftovers, they're almost as good as if they'd just been served to you.

Besides the phenomenal food, I love Phoenix's Havana Cafe for its intimate setting. The restaurant is comprised of a little dining room with mirrored walls, and there's also a patio. It's not quite Cuba, but the aromas and warm, welcoming atmosphere are enough to make you feel as relaxed as you would on vacation.",2012-07-07 21:21:53

What I do worry about though is the quality of food whenever a new business pops up in that spot.

Royaltea is no different from its predecessors.  Put it this way: unlike the flashy theatre-esque sign inside the trendy room, there is nothing flashy nor bright about the drinks.  The creators behind the drinks tried to make them flashy and bright, with galaxy coloured drinks in light bulb flasks being the star items. However, what you receive isn't a Spectrum Passion Fruit Tea with purple and orange streaks, but instead a swampy green-brown ''water'' with seeds floating about - aka an average passion fruit tea! Where's the pizazz? The gimmick?  At least they still used a light bulb flasks as the cup...at a regrettably high, inexhangeable price (approx. $7 for a small size).

There is nothing royal about Royaltea, except for the exhorbent prices.  The drinks taste watered down, seeds are not strained out, sizes are inaccurate, and every sip leaves a bad aftertaste in the mouth.  With so many competing bubble tea shops in the neighbourhood, I advise you to avoid this one.  Even the free HK milk teas you get in a combo set at many western Chinese fusion cafes are better by a long shot. You will save your tastebuds and wallet by shuffling over to Co Co or Latea instead.",2017-07-10 22:22:19

My girlfriends found that this place was the most reasonable in price and location for a two bedroom suite. A two-bedroom suite accommodates 8 people easily (two king size beds and one pull-out queen). The location is right next to the Miracle Mile shops. 

I read a few things about this hotel after Hilton took it over and gathered some new information. Let's clear some things up. 

- They don't use wristbands regularly. They only used once during a busy weekend. 
- The staff is still the same staff from the PH towers. I asked.
- You don't get access to the Planet Hollywood pool or amenities anymore. 

Tips:
- get a taxi at Planet Hollywood. During non-peak hours, it's hard to get a taxi. 
- The pool is pretty small if you ask me
- Check in time is at 4:00pm and they mean 4:00pm
- Check out is 10am, but you may be able to get 11 if you are checking out on another other day then Sunday.
- Clean up after yourself and don't break anything if you don't want to be charged any additional fees. (We brought disposable stuff and didn't use their stuff a lot). 
- Make sure you always have your key with you because you always have to show it to get to the room.

My girlfriends had gotten there early (around 11am) and wanted to check in. Initially, the man was pretty rude and said we couldn't and to check back at 2pm. They understood because it was really early. We checked back in at 2om, and they rudely said the room was still not ready. The third time we tried to check in - it was 3:30pm - the guy told us again it was not ready. I was pissed. It was only 30 freakin minutes until check in. 

I went back in line around 3:50 and got checked in by the night manager. I was levid. I gave him a piece of my mind and even pointed out the rude workers who were still at the front. I told him the rude service we got and asked him if the staff had changed since it was the PH Towers and he said no. He apologized and said that he was giving us an ""upgraded"" view. I'm not sure if we really did get upgraded or if that room was what we were supposed to get anyways, but the view was better than what I expected.  

Since we had a two bedroom suite, the front desk assumed that there would be more than 4 people. We were able to put three names on the reservation, and they gave us four keys. Luckily they never gave us a hard time getting up to our room with such a big group. 

The room was clean, except for maybe the couch. It seemed a little dusty, but I was expecting worse from the reviews I saw. The customer service sucked a lot. I was in line twice and I saw a few guests come up and confront the front desk about extra fees and poor customer service.

1st visit: I was not in the mood for coffee, so I decided to try their Strawberry Pineapple Smoothie. I really liked it! It was sweet, but also had a sour kick to it. Who needs coffee? I think if I was tired and really needed to wake myself up, this would do the trick!

2nd visit: I stopped by on a random weekday around 1:30pm and both of the doors were locked! So I went inside and sat at a table in the food court. Decided to wait a few minutes to see if anyone would open the shop again. After 5 minutes, a girl came back and unlocked all the doors. Wow, that's cool if she was taking a break or whatever, but I think she should have at least left a sign on the doors saying ""Will return in 10 minutes."" Right? Well, she must have noticed me sitting outside because she said ""Sorry"" right when I walked in. At least I wasn't waiting for a long time. Anyway, I decided to try their Iced Caramel Macchiato. It was okay, but kind of bitter tasting in my opinion. Sorry, I prefer Starbucks or MadHouse Coffee. They had a few pastries and slices of cake on display, but selection was very limited. 

Not impressed with the coffee, but I will definitely come back for the smoothies and to try the shaved ice one day!",2011-02-23 23:45:13

When this is the case, South Park Mall is the best place in Charlotte to find what I need, because it is all there.

South Park has been greatly improved over the years, from overall structure to the quality of stores.

I've heard from many of my friends who migrated down here from the north that South Park has many of the stores they are used to up there.

That's great...I don't really care.
What matters to me is that they have a Cheesecake Factory, there are lots of attractive women walking around, and its easy to get in, get whatever you may need, and get out!

That's a guys point of view, I know, but it is true.
When I shop, I'm not there to soak in the atmosphere or be a part of the 'shopping experience'...although South Park probably offers a pretty good one for those who are out for it.

This occurred even after I went through the order item by item with the gentleman who bagged it up for me. What keeps me coming back, is the food is usually tasty fresh and well-made. We ended up ordering the children's chicken rice combo. The chicken was a little bit too large for my children about the size of a golf ball. We also ordered Asian chopped chicken salad. While tasty and fresh, the chicken was not shredded completely, and it and was essentially a few large chunks that were poorly torn apart. Finally, we had the cream cheese lobster rolls which were tasty as usual.The spice level I would consider mild to very mild. What keeps me coming back to this location?

In lieu of that, Ted's is a good quality hot dog place with unique, charbroiled-tasting hot dogs. They hail from Buffalo, New York and the line often wraps around the front area near the grill, where you shout out your order to the current grillmaster, similar to Chuckbox when it's busy.

The highlight is almost certainly their incredibly onion rings. They serve huge portions for decent prices and everything is always fresh and tasty. (Spent $8.15 for a large iced tea, all-beef hot dog, and onion rings.) The onion rings are more of a torn apart onion blossom than the traditional rings--an approach I much prefer. There are plenty of sides and toppings you can request as well, from cheese to chili to onions, 'kraut, ketchup, mustard, and all the other basics.

Overall a pleasant experience and a unique flavor. Worthwhile if you're looking for a damn good hot dog. (And they take credit cards now, after many years of holding out as cash only!)",2010-07-22 07:56:26

Wide range of affordable items on the menu.  I was impressed with extensive choices of Pho and Bun.  I thought the ""Snacks"" section on the menu was interesting, for example, Chicken Satay and Deep Fried Vietnamese Sausage.

I ordered a Large bowl of Pho with sliced raw beef and beef meatballs, vermicelli with grilled pork, and chicken satay.

- Pho with sliced raw beef and beef meatballs:   I found the broth very bland, something was missing.  I think it was the lack of spices.  Noodles were overcooked and mushy.  However, raw beef was tender and meatballs were very tasty.

+ Bun, vermicelli with grilled pork, was excellent.  The best part of this dish was grilled pork.  It was well seasoned with lemongrass, crispy and yummy.  Shredded lettuce, carrots and cucumber were fresh.

- Chicken satay was different from what I grew up with.  I like my satay seasoned with herbs and spices, this version was also tasty with red chili sauce.

Caliente really offers up nothing new or memorable, unfortunately. The service we had while sitting at the bar was poor. The bartender was nice, but she spent more time talking to her friend who wasn't even paying for anything than waiting on us and other customers who had empty beers at the other end of the bar. 

The mozzarella sticks weren't very hot when they came out, but were still the delicious kind that I love, so I wasn't going to let it bother me. The only downside is that you only get 4 sticks. The bummer in that portion was only magnified when the rest of the meal left a lot to be desired.

My chicken parmesan hoagie was clearly made with frozen patties, and there wasn't a lot of cheese or sauce on the hoagie. I definitely wouldn't order it again if I, for some strange reason, was eating there again.

The white pizza we ordered was okay, but it was more of a bland cheesy bread than a white pizza. Very little flavor, very little cheese, and none of that garlic/oil/seasoning flavor that you expect with a white pizza.

It's not a bad bar, though. Decent beer selection (although a beer list would be nice on the menu). We also liked the actual atmosphere, even though it was dead while we were there.

So when I heard of Torched Goodness, I drove from Gilbert all the way to the Scottsdale Airpark (63 miles round trip) just to get some. And while it isn't worth the drive, if I lived near their stops they'd have to garnish my paycheck to cover my tab. We bought a dozen just before Thanksgiving, and got vanilla, sea salt caramel, and pumpkin. I'm a purist, and preferred the vanilla, but all three were excellent. The sea salt was a hit with my wife. They are generous with the sugar on top, so you get a nice thick shell which gives a satisfying ""crack"". I have had crème brûlée that was better, but it also cost double the price for a similar or smaller portion.

Over the years, both as a tourist and as a local, the Crown had always been a favorite place to stop in and have a pint. Nothing's changed for many years, even some of the staff seem to hang around for years.

Not every visit to the Crown will give you reason to promote it to a 5 star joint, which is why it sits solidly at 4 stars. The food is good, since you weren't really expecting anything spectacular. The service can be good at times and not so much so at others, but overall you should have fun as long as you let yourself enjoy it.

Some of the convention folks had reservations for 12:00 and were promptly seated - totally fine. We (toward the front of the crowd) were told to wait until closer to our reservation, which was okay, since we were a few minutes early. 

As we sat off to the side, the host staff seated multiple large parties without reservations and the restaurant quickly became very full. Around 12:13, after the crowd died down, a member of our group asked if we could be seated yet. The hostess rudely told her we needed to continue waiting until closer to our reservation time, to ensure that we enjoyed good service. Right before 12:15, the same woman walked over to seat our party, acting completely unaware that we were confused and unhappy. Our table had obviously been sitting empty the entire time we waited in the entrance.

Maybe I don't understand how restaurant seating works, but from a customer's point of view, it is very annoying to see multiple large parties without reservations be seated before your reservation will be accepted (and you're less than 10 minutes early). To us, it felt like the host staff was purposefully making us wait, to spite us. If that was not the case, they could have kindly explained their protocol. 

These interactions definitely soured our experience. The food tasted fine, but we won't be back.",2016-11-26 01:18:52

My favourite drink to get is the Bubble Gaga, which consists of passion fruit green tea, coconut jelly, and tapioca. Yum! I also get it with 0% sugar since the passion fruit syrup itself is sweet (I'm also not much of a sweet person ;))!

The price and quality of the drink (to me) is much better than other bubble tea places that I've tried. The bubbles are cooked just right! I think this is the best tapioca place I've tried - they also have a coat of sugar.. which make them less plain! Hence, get less sugar in your drink. They usually have monthly specials - large for $3.80. 

The reason why I'm giving it a 4* instead of a 5* is because I had a bad incident with one of their drinks. They had a special, which was their black tea latte. Black tea latte is literally 3/4 fresh milk, and 1/4 black tea. Much like a milk tea but... mostly milk! I guess the day I got it... the milk was not fresh - it tasted very off. 

Also, much like other places, I do not think they pay attention to the sugar levels if you ask for 30%, 50% or 70%. It's more like 100% or 0%.

Service was very friendly and attentive, and a wide variety of wines, beers, sakes, and cocktails are on offer as well.

I'm glad that this new waitress was nicer. She refilled my drinks when she saw them empty, and nicely offered any options to try for appetizers or desserts. I love the fact that they have a second floor for socializing, and a nice brunch that they are famous for. 

I had the Balsamic Chicken and my guest had the Sloppy Joe which was both delicous. I was so glad and happy that my chicken was very tender, and finally got the chance to discover what cous cous was! Then, I got to try their Fried PB and J which is what their signature dessert is. The dessert is very filling, but delicous and addicting!

All in all, my experience there was a lot better than last time. Judging by the ratings on Yelp, I do believe this place has great potetial.

I took the fork and the whole piece of cheese came off in one stroke. I put the heart attack aside and ate from the tuna down, with a fork and knife, as the croissant was harder than I am use to. I was very disappointed. I am hoping this was just one bad experience and the next time I go there it will be better, or did Mimi's lose its quality?

It was a little awkward sitting at the same table as another family, who were using the lane next to us; they have separate couches, but one table to share in between, which takes up a lot of room. We ordered some wings, and macaroni and cheese for our 2 little ones; the wings were decent, but the mac and cheese was really awful, even my 1 year old wouldn't eat it and she eats everything. It was basically pasta with shredded white cheese, and a horrible aftertaste. The family at our table ordered a pizza and they said it wasn't the best.

To get here by public transpo can be super annoying, and your best way to get in is probably by cab, car, or even by bike.  We went early and didn't have to wait long to enter.  The decor is reminiscent of Hakkasan in Las Vegas, but way more spacious.  Sound and lights were also great in all the rooms.  The coat check situation was kinda messy at the end, so I would suggest getting your jackets early in the winter time.   The view of the Downtown core is absolutely phenomenal from here. 

We were allowed to bring empty water bottles in, however to refill you water bottle, you would have to trek to the washroom.  In a super congested club, I didn't find it ideal to push through sweaty teens to get water.  I opted to purchase it from the bar instead with a $$ pricetag. 

Towards the end of the night we wanted to see Shiba San in the Purple Room.  None of the staff in the 19+ area or main room area knew where it was.  We finally found it after walking a flight of stairs up.  

A pro of this place is that the floor was minorly slippery and it was easy to pretend to know how to moonwalk.  A major downside is the taxi situation at the end.  If you plan on leaving with a taxi, prepare to walk a bit further out or bribe them.  It's illegal for a cab driver to turn you down, but it is more likely to happen in this area.  A suggestion, maybe call Uber when you're about to leave, so it will be ready when you come out, and arrange to meet up a bit away from the club, so you don't get stuck in the traffic jam.",2017-01-19 23:05:35

Nous avons trouvé la place facilement et nous avons très vite remarqué que c'était un restaurant très ""trendy"". Il y a un DJ, la musique est plutôt forte et la lumière est très faible. Ce n'est pas mon genre de restaurant mais j'étais très attiré par le menu.  Niveau décors, tout match avec l'idée d'un restaurant populaire, un peu hipster, le mur en béton brisé-ish, etc... le seul truc qui ne fonctionnait pas c'était les trois télévisions au dessus du bar, ça fait plus pub à mon goût, mis on pouvait suivre les JO donc c'était cool.

Pour le menu, j'adore!!! C'est un menu centré poutine, burger et tartare, et il y a quelques salades. Nous avons pris une poutine chacun, la zombie et la végétarienne. La zombie était très bonne, mais il y avait tellement de topping qu'on  ne goûtait pas tout, et la végétarienne à base de patate douce était tout aussi délicieuse mais manquait un peu de croustillant à mon goût. Nous avons également pris une salade au poulet et noix, qui était à -50% pour les femmes. La salade était au top, le poulet était super bien assaisonné, le bol était rempli, il y avait des noisettes, pistaches et plein d'autres aliments extra bons et qui te remplissent la panse, mais j'ai surtout aimé leur vinaigrette aux agrumes.

They've got your major beer boys on tap - Budweiser and Kokanee on tap, as well as Big Rock Trad and Grasshopper if you'd prefer something a little more local. They've got a few big gun imports like Guiness, Innis & Gunn and Kronenburg on tap if you fancy something from overseas.

For all you musicians out there, they've got an open jam on Sundays and it seemed to keep the place decently busy the an unusually bitter cold november evening. I always love the community open jams bring out to the pub. It's a great way to get everyone involved and having fun together, but is usually a little easier on the ears than karaoke.

That said, if you want Karaoke, go on a Friday night!

 There was even some rad little dude, like 6 years old, maybe, singin ""All About the Bass"". On that... What's with kids in bars lately? Is that a thing that's ok now? There was a few of them running around at Fiddler's Green. I guess I'm totally cool with it as long as I'm not expected to watch my surly language when a game is on!

 The Sunday crowd might have taken them by surprise because they seemed pretty understaffed. As a result, the service was super slow and lacked any kind of personal touch. Looking at other reviews, this doesn't seem to always be the case, but it might be something to expect on a Sunday evening.

I'm sure the gloomy, slushy weather didn't help, but the restaurant seemed a bit too dim.  The decor was fine, the music was pretty good, and our server was very friendly.

The food was just a little mediocre.  We started with the mango & tomatillo salsa - very chunky and not bad at all, but the Kaya chips were a bit dry and some tasted a little burnt.  As my entree, I chose one of the todo en uno options - a smaller sandwich + 2 sides - with the pressed manchego and idiazabel sandwich, and the spicy slaw and the sweet potato fries as my sides.  The bread for the sandwich was a bit dry, the cheeses were a bit bland, there was a bit too much arugula and the plantain chips on the sandwich had no plantain-y flavor.  The slaw was also very dry and the only spice I tasted was pepper.  The sweet potato fries were very good though.  Boyfriend had the pressed serrano ham & manchego sandwich, which he also said was a bit bland.  We shared the creme brulee for dessert, which was not bad.  The bill came to about $36 before tip.

As we were eating dessert, we heard a couple at the next table rave about the Kaya burger, so I may have to try that next time.  I'm also curious about their vegetarian prix fixe dinners - an amuse bouche, 3 courses, and dessert for $39 with plenty of vegan options.

After being annoyed by the person going over the top with the verbal communications to verify that they had captured the order correctly, we waited for an easy 15 minutes before receiving our order. Not bashing the worker, because I am sure this is the way things are trained, but that does not make it any less annoying. Why would a new location not have one of those fancy screens in the drive-thru if they want to do order verification for every single item ordered.  So, we ordered a couple of burgers with fries, and my biggest gripe is the amount of lettuce put on the burger. Yes I will have some meat with my lettuce burger. Thanks!  To make this experience even more memorable, I could not find a single napkin in my bag to catch any of the lettuce that fell into every single nook and cranny in my vehicle. May stop again if I am in the neighborhood, but will definitely hold the lettuce and ask for napkins.",2017-02-26 19:58:58

I went back to this little bagel place after a two year absence. It had been so long mainly because if I had gone back any earlier, my husband would have killed me. His wheat & dairy allergies meant no more bagels for him, and for a die hard bagel fan, that's hard to swallow. In an act of solidarity I held out as long as possible.

On a day before Christmas, I was running some errands & thought I'd pop in. The first thing I noticed was that they had changed the interior slightly. The menu was stark and ugly. They had painted deals in the window reminiscent of a fast food restaurant. I suppose everyone has to attract business and maybe I'm a snob, but I found it tacky. 

I got an everything bagel toasted with lox cream cheese. It came out on one of those cardboard type red and white trays, you know, cafeteria school lunch style. They used to have little plastic trays with tissue paper. The presentation was definitely nicer before. 

The lox cream cheese didn't have as much lox in it as I remember. While the bagel tasted the same, they clearly didn't toast it enough because it came out virtually cold. It was doughy without an ounce of warmth. I was so disappointed. 

One of the workers informed me they had changed owners when I inquired but all the bagels were the same. I'd suggest if you go, to ask them to double toast your bagel. Maybe that would have made mine taste better.",2010-01-28 16:02:16

i ordered the crab rangoon, a shrimp springroll, and chicken fried rice. the rangoon was pretty good, the springroll was just a clump of grease, and the rice was good. my friends ordered beef and broccoli, an egg roll, and general tso's. they were not too impressed with their meals.

Yes I know it's light beer season but don't neglect us hop heads! We tried the veg-fest steel pan style. All the ingredients tasted super fresh but I was a bit put off by the cheddar cheese included in the crust. Just seemed a little odd given the flavor profile of the rest of the pizza.

They did a great job renovating this space for an industrial chic look. The main floor is dominated by a bar and communal tables. The walls and ceiling are brick / cement so it does start to get loud as the place fills up. The second floor has high exposed ceilings with large booths and tables surrounding a balcony that opens up to downstairs. The final touch is an additional bar area in the basement where they offer lounge seating in a neat space which used to be a bank safe, complete with the former vault door intact. 

The staff was spot on, who would know it was day #1. Our only beef was the beers were coming out with a bit too much foam so then you weren't really ending up with a full beer. Every drop counts, agh!  They were offering a limited menu of appetizers and pizzas during the soft opening, the full menu will be available likely next week. Hours are also limited to dinner this weekend but their regular expanded (including lunch) hours will likely start next week. All the food we tried was good. The garden goddess salad was tossed with dressing & available in a small ($6) or large ($11) size. The small size was perfect for one person. Cheese curds were tasty and served with marinara sauce. The pizzas we tried were tasty (baby spinach, olive, onion pizza has a spicy kick!), crispy thin and nicely topped.

My first visit here was with my husband and grandparents. We ordered refreshing beverages and scrumptious tacos which were served promptly and at an acceptable temperature. All present were overly content with their meals( carne tacos, pernil asado tacos, breaded shrimp, and vegetarian tostadas) not to mention our server was so bubbly and friendly, however, I don't think she was wearing a bra. No judgement, just an observation-more power to ya, girly!  

Overall, our first experience was worth 4 stars. 

Twas when we returned for a second visit that things got ugly. Dark side ugly. The woman  who served us was polite and talkative. That is, until we revealed that dreaded white piece of computer paper with a barcode on it. Yes, we were infact, dirty  couponers! 

The quality of the service did a complete 180. No lie, I observed this woman serve and mingle with two women in my line of sight with no qualms and seemingly absolute delight. When she returned to our table, she wiped that smile right off and replaced it with an indifferent smirk and uttered monotone fragments until the bill came.

What a shame. I really couldn't imagine returning to Fuego tacos, which is unfortunate, because it had such an appealing ambiance. Attitude trumps decor, however, and I don't want to try my hand at being a customer there again.",2013-07-20 01:18:51

First of all, the have an epic produce section. I'm tired of overpaying for the essentials at vons. No kidding, you can get 2lbs of jalapeños for $1 and 2 large avocados  for $1. Habaneros are only $1.99 a lb, compared to the 5.99 I'm used to paying everywhere else.

The meat market is amazing.. So many great selections of meats and various cuts you just can't find at other markets. There tends to be a long line for assistance from a butcher on the weekends though, so be prepared for a little wait.

Pro tip: they have reasonably priced beer so this is a great place to stock up. They have some craft beers available for a decent price, but this store is mostly ideal for adjunct lagers and other cheap beers. They always have a good special on 30 packs so keep an eye out!

They have a juice bar and a variety of Agua frescas available if you need a fresh, cold drink while you shop.

I absolutely recommend eating lunch or dinner here before you start. They have a surprisingly good taqueria in the store, serving up tacos, burritos, Tortas and more. I tried the food for the first time today and loved it. I got a chicharron verde burrito (meat, rice, beans). My wife tried a carnitas torta.

Decor: Hotels in the Fremont district are mostly old gems trying to keep up with the newer style of hotels. I commend them greatly for trying, seeing how the ""Fremont experience "" is very different from your normal visit. The Plaza hotel is really hurting. The rooms are ok at best, with no fridge, microwave, or coffee maker. Those are in the suites. So pay extra for it..

Casino: So the floor is small and not exciting. The nice part is they teach new players how to play  craps. The slots are meh.. it was rough.

Food: The hotel has a subway, McDonald's, and some other overly priced breakfast places. I wouldn't pay 25 bucks for breakfast there so I have no comment.

Rooms: We stayed for a concert that weekend. The walls are thin, so I heard my young neighbors drinking then breaking the bed.

The broth of the pho wasn't that great in my opinion, and it wasn't as hot as I'd have liked it. I thought it was just my own bowl, but it was the same for the other two people I was with. I remember when it used to be in the same plaza as the Wholesale on central parkway and confederation and it always seemed popular, but I honestly can't see why. I'm not planning on going back. Noodles were eeeeh, and the table and seats we had felt sticky and gross (and it wasn't a hot summer day).

What makes it even worse is that out of convenience and laziness I will come here and pay those steep prices quite often. I rationalize the process by telling myself that by walking I am saving money on gas and reducing my carbon foot print.

They happen to carry my favorite tea (China Mist),  icecream (Tofutti Cutie),  and fresh bread loaves.

However, of all the places I have tried, which is nearly 15 in just under 2 years, Papaya Thai on University Dr. in Mesa is the absolute WORST! 

I am a HUGE fan of all styles of Thai Food. I've traveled throughout Asia on more than one occassion, taught English in China and spent years seeking out authentic eateries in the Asian-based areas of this country's biggest Metropolitan cities. Thai food holds a special place in my heart, but never have I been as disappointed as I was with my experience at Papaya Thai!

If Papaya Thai was worth the words, I would gladly go into more detail about the atmosphere, the menu and the quality-to-value ratio, as I do with my other reviews... 

However, there's really not much to say about this dark and dirty hole-in-the-wall next to the Dollar Store. The service isn't worth the price of tipping, the food is as hit-and-miss as it gets and the owner couldn't care less if he loses a customer, which, judging by the fact that not a single person came in during the entire 45 minutes I was there on a Tuesday during prime mealtime, is something he must excel at! 

For the record, I haven't sent a food item back due to an issue in over 4 years. Unfortunately, Papaya Thai effectively ruined that streak for me...and on their signature ""Pad Thai"" noodle dish, nonetheless! 

The sad part is that what I got in return, besides a table-side confrontation from a rude, know-it-all cook (who told me I could not order the Pad Thai there anymore!), was even worse!!!

Simply put, I won't be back. If the food was even half-decent, I would have gladly chocked the experience up to an unfortunate coincidence and happily given it another shot. However, only 1 of the 3 entrees we tried (a chicken curry dish) was even edible and the prices they demand are among the highest of all such restaurants in the area! 

There are many, much better places in the area to spend your hard earned cash at if you crave the taste of Thai food! 

Avoid Papaya Thai!",2012-03-07 21:51:40

They claim to have authentic Southern BBQ and being from Alabama I am pretty skeptical of the places up here since most are a far cry from authentic.  This place hits the nail on the head and even has fresh brewed ice tea which is almost impossible to find outside of my own home around here.  You can smell the smoke when you walk in which is always a good sign.  I got the pulled pork dinner which comes with fries and 2 sides.  I substituted cornbread for the fries and got the baked beans and cole slaw.  The cornbread was a generous sized muffin and cooked perfectly with just the right touch of sweetness.  The beans were delicious and had a decent amount of pulled pork in them.  The cole slaw was creamy, tasty, and NOT neon green like most places up here.  The pulled pork was a huge serving and very good.  They had a large selection of BBQ sauces to choose from and I went with the Kansas City.  The only thing missing would be a honey BBQ sauce instead of honey garlic which is more of an Asian flavor to me.  

I would definitely go back even though I live all the way over in Pickering and this place is in Georgetown out west of Toronto.  It is worth a special trip even.  It looks like a hole in the wall, but then all the really good BBQ places look that way.    You order at the counter and pay there which is quite common in the South too so you get a real true Southern experience.  

If you go out to the new Premium Outlet in Halton Hills, just take the east exit from their parking lot and go straight on 8th Line and it is only about a 10 minute drive away.  Skip the food court and treat yourself here.",2013-08-09 23:14:34

After waiting, I was told that it would be another ten minutes. The slice of plain came out first, it was okay. Lacked a little flavor but fine for a cheap slice. 5 minutes later, out came the pepperoni slice and it was very cheesy and the toppings were sliding all over the place.

Know thyself, filibertos.  Here's what you aren't: Houston's.  I don't need an open kitchen and I certainly don't need to wait for thirty minutes to get my burrito.

Know thyself: you aren't so busy that you need to give out numbers and then call out the orders by their numbers only.  Hey, lady: no one wants the receipt.  We throw it away once you hand it to us.  We earnestly wish you never gave it to us in the first place.  So no, we don't remember the number.  We don't understand why you're so annoyed that no one is responding to you when you call out some number.  I ordered a sausage burrito, not a 1473, so I don't know why you're yelling out numbers and looking huffy.

Furthermore, give us some visual cue: for example, if you ask me if I want it for here or to go, and I choose ""for here,"" I won't think that a burrito in a paper bag is mine, no matter what number you're calling.

Know thyself: at every other Filibertos, the food *is* the entertainment.  We go there to drown in a bliss that can only be made up of butter/greasy butter substitute and delightfulness.  Not for the TVs.  And when you have two TVs next to each other, you don't need the volume on for both.  Because this creates, at best, an Echo Effect.  This effect makes whoever is talking sound like God in some deus ex machina stage presentation.  Which is terrifying when it's the voice of Bill Austin on Beth and Bill.  I can only assume I have kicked one too many innocent dogs (I never kick dogs) and I am roasting in hell.  I would now like to trade in the eternity of Beth and Bill for an eternity of sixth degree burns, please.

Here is the quintessential failure of this Filibertos: the food is shit.  The green sauce has the consistency of applesauce--a fact which makes me want to puke.  The burrito was filled with what can only be fake eggs, and tons of them.  Not much in the way of sausage and I'm pretty sure it was made of something that used to be someone's pet.  And the river of cheese on the side had coagulated.  Worst of all, the nefarious garlic monster has once again shat in my mouth and I now see plants wilting in my wake.

Don't ever go to this place.  Use your mighty dollar vote and go elsewhere.  Because all the good that Filibertos has done in this world is under threat by this fucking impostor.

My wife read the review, and by ""read"" I mean listened while I read it to her, and she fears I might be giving all Filibertos a bad name.  No.  Only this one sucks.  She says you should go to the one on McQueen and Pecos, and she is, as usual, right.",2009-11-05 17:49:07

I purchased a Denali from these guys about a year ago, and actually worked them over (after years of doing it wrong, and a brother in law that use to sell used cars I have learned how to do it right)  So the dealing with them to purchase a vehicle part is not bad if you know what you are doing and are not a sucker.  

On to the one star review -

It all started with an oil leak.  Took it in and it was covered by warranty - all good right?  Nope, wake up next morning and there is a 5 quart pool of oil in my garage - We call them, they come and tow it back and get it fixed right this time.  

In the process of all this they tell me that my brakes are bad and really dangerous to be driving on.  I am not an idiot, so I said thanks (knowing to never get that kind of work done at a dealership) I am only getting warranty work done at a dealership (that is my first tip to anyone) So we take our vehicle to Fletchers (review to come) and they inform me that my brakes are not bad, in fact they are still at 75% and good - no need to replace them at all.  WHAAAAT?  An honest mechanic shop?  Nice.

Henry Brown GMC - YOU SUCK.  I am glad I worked you over on my Denali - and this just proves you guys are cheats and criminals ... My suggestion to anyone ready to buy a car/truck or SUV ... DO NOT GO TO HENRY BROWN ... they will try and CHEAT YOU.  I didn't even begin to tell you how they TRIED to work me over on the Denali ...

To be honest, this salon in Cleveland is way better and way cheaper than one of the ""higher-end"" salons in NYC.  I had roughly the same haircut with a couple of changes over the past 2 years in NYC and when I came in here I was ready for a change, I told my awesome stylist (Simon) to ""do whatever he liked"", that he could even take it above the shoulders just no pixie cut.  My bf was really happy that Simon liked longer styles, b/c I'm sure if Rachelle had been cutting my hair it would have gone pretty short (I still would have loved it though!).  Now, even though Simon only took off a couple of inches, my hair looks completely different with all the funky layers and the bangs that he put in.

Now, I've never colored my hair b/c I've been told by other strawberry-blondes that when you dye your hair it basically doesn't come back to it's natural color again.  But Simon told me about some kind of new product they had that was basically a ""fading dye"", that went away after about 4-6 weeks, sounded like Henna for the Hair to me, lots of voodoo science!  lol  But something that I would probably consider in the future from them.

We placed a to go order and when we got home the fried lasagna appetizer was dried, semi burnt, and had no sauce. My husband called to speak with the manager and Jennifer placed him on hold for 10 minutes. He hung up and tried calling back. Each time, he would get hung up on. Ironically, when he used my phone to call for the 3rd time, he wasn't hung up on. Clearly being upset, when Jennifer answered the call again, my husband said he was on hold for 10 minutes before waiting to speak with the manager and that she had 1 minute to get the manager on the phone before...which she promptly interrupted him and said ""Before what?"" He then replied before escalating it to corporate. When the manager got on, he said he had no idea my husband was on hold for him the first time. Although the manager, Ron, was friendly and helpful, Jennifer left such a horrible impression with us that we will NEVER eat there again. 
Do NOT go there unless you want confrontational service. And if you do go there, against my warning, avoid the girl named Jennifer. She should find a job where she doesn't have to deal with people.",2017-07-22 03:50:53

For dinner, we ordered:

Steak and Enchiladas, $12.75
Sliders, $8.95
Coors

I had the Steak & Enchiladas and they were very good.  It exceeded my expectations.  Even though it wasn't a premium cut of Beef, it was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The Enchiladas were out of this world...wow!  All I can say is wow!

The Better Half had the Sliders and she was very happy with them.  The portion comes with 2 Sliders, which is perfect for her.

After dinner, the music started to play.  We then got our groove on and danced to country & classic rock songs.  The bar also filled up and there was a nice crowd there.  We all had a blast and worked off the calories we ate.

We heard they have country dance lessons on Wednesdays, so we'll be back.

I'm not a big fan of Cajun spice in general but I find it works well in this dish with the Alfredo sauce.  The chicken was really tender.

Gord ordered Shrimp Tacos with rice.  He said they were really good and he'd get them again.

They put everyone on the right side of the restaurant, and it was full.  Got the feeling they were   short on staff.  The hot food line around the corner from the ice cream/minnie mouse was actually closed, which was a surprise to me.  Typically dinners have more selections, so more $ and It seemed the opposite.  They did have prime rib, and I wanted to try a piece to see how it compares to Mandarin.   To be fair, there were only couple little bites that were chewable, as I got the end piece, so hard to comment.   

The stir fry station is the main thing I like coming here and it was good as usual.  The soft ice cream is a plus as well!   I don't usually like fruits at buffets, but the watermelon was very nice. Peach and mandarin orange are good choices to have too.  I don't really bother with the live cooking section, as I have had it in the past and found the meat hard to chew.  Looking at the table beside us, it seemed still is.  You can't expect an all you can eat place to offer the best meats.   But I might try some mussels next time.

Overall, it was still a good experience and value. But, I was a bit disappointed in what seemed like less food choices.  Stir fry # 1 reason, and #2 is the more choices they offer compared to other similar buffets I prefer this place.

Service was excellent and extremely friendly. 

My only issue was the food or at least what I ordered left a lot to be desired.  I ordered the Orchard Omelet. When it arrived it looked and smelled delicious.  My only issue is that once I cut into the omelet all the moisture/water from the veggies was still inside so it was soupy. It would have been helpful if prior to cooking the kitchen drained/dried the veggies properly. There was so much residual water it sucked out all the flavor of the omelet. I literally had to drain it off my plate.

Now, their beef dumplings in celery foam is more what this restaurant is about. The flavors were unique, on top of the preparation. Everything was just so well balanced, and I believe the bone marrow was in Au jus. Amazing. 

For the entree, I went wood fired lasagna with miso and burrata. It retrospect, I should've realized it was going to be kinda soupy. Still, the flavors were delicious.

The service at bar is great , filling up  glasses without even having to ask and nice banter with the bartenders, didn't seem like they were just there doing their job they were trying to make the experience enjoyable for everybody

Start off with a jumbo shrimp cocktail which was fresh and had a decent sauce

I ordered a bone in filet mignon which was delicious and the Boss had a bone in ribeye but his was actually kind of tiny in size (height) even to the point where the guy sitting next to him said that ribeye looks tiny. I don't know if it was just an anomaly but he still like the way it was prepared and tasted

For the sides, went with the garlic mashed potatoes which was very nice with a fresh roast garlic on top and a mushroom medley which was pretty tasty as well

Overall not the best steak of ever had but very nice quality good ambience is very hard for me to give a steakhouse like this  five stars when I've been to so many other great ones? however four stars is the truthful review and there's nothing wrong with a four star spot

1.  Menu - It can be difficult to figure out what you want, if you don't have a specific item that is your absolute must order. In this case, if you are with friends and family, order the All American Feast which is served on a garbage can lid.  Great selection.

2.  Garbage - Again, if you order the feast that comes on the garbage can lid, which I love as it is in the middle of the table and all share, they you can add on things like sausages and etc for a small fee.  IT is truly great stuff. 

3.  Price - Reasonable.

4.  Kids - They will love it, why?  See point 5.

5.  Sauces - You can put your own sauce and they have plenty of choices on your table. Chances are your kids will not want a sauce as tangy and hot as you want, so this is a great choice for all. 

6.  Large Groups - Great for this, but sometimes they can be a bit busy, so be careful and plan.

The black beans have a hint of bbq sauce and are sweeter than the pinto beans. However, I prefer the black beans. My wife ordered the Carne Asada plate, which was awesome at $17 bucks. I tasted the meat and it was a better value for the buck. The menu is quite limited, but we all loved the restaurant and want to try other dishes.

The last time I brought my handicapped senior citizen mother and they told her that she couldn't even have a seat to wait to tell the rest of our party.  She begged the older hostess lady as my mum can't stand the pain for too long and the waitress very rudely shoved her off with her forearm and said ""No!  No you cannot sit no where.  No!"".  

Aside from that my brother had serious 7 disk spinal surgery done and needs to use a mobility scooter to get around.  I believe this is the absolute reason why they keep turning us down.

Initially I had planned on paying a visit to Original Gangster Burgers, only to discover the O.G. face down and lights out, with a ""For Lease"" sign on the door. Alas poor O.G, we hardly knew ye *pours out a 40* 
Anyway, next stop was C & Dubbs Hamburgers.

Armed with only a very vague recollection of where it was located, and despite being wedged among about a million eateries in the Dundas/Dixie area, the place was extremely easy to spot while driving, and thankfully, it was still open. It should also be noted that while closed Monday, they're open until midnight Tuesday-Thursday, 1am Friday and Saturday, and 9pm Sunday.

The interior is very clean, presentable, and spacious.

As they use a few nicknames for their burgers (Sumo burger, banquet burger and a couple of others), I had to inquire as to what was what, and the kid behind the counter was more than helpful and courteous. If you're looking for just burgers, you have the choice of a standard hamburger/cheeseburger, the banquet (bacon cheeseburger), the half-pounder (I forget the name), and the Sumo (the big daddy full-pounder). While I was hungry (but not too hungry) I opted for the half-pounder along with a banquet for later on or the next day, and the total was under 10 dollars.

The burgers were prepared in a timely fashion, and they also have the standard selection of toppings. Another thing I noticed while getting my toppings was how much the employees seemed to get along, and it just gave off a real 'family-owned' type vibe, and I dig that.

Anyway, I took the burgers home and gave the half-Sumo a shot.
Mind-blowing loin-obliterating burgasm! By FAR the best burger I've had in a long time, and that's taking into consideration that I went to Five Guys only a couple of days ago. it was just so flavourful, melt in your mouth good. The bun tasted as though it just left a bakery, it was THAT fresh. My God! It was so delicious that I immediately afterward ate up the banquet burger as well, which was just as consistent.

This truly is as good as it gets, and I can't wait to return.",2011-10-06 04:44:28

They aren't too slow and the people seem to be very friendly. However, today I was disappointed with the information desk. The lady working it was friendly, but highly inefficient. First, she created a line because she was talking to a man who had walked out of the DMV with his name spelled incorrectly on his license at a prior visit - (Note, they tell you to review it for a reason) - and they were arguing if he would have to pay the $12 again - she is working the information desk and has NO CONTROL over the fees and they both should let go of the conversation well before I walked to the counter. But they kept rambling on, both arguing about it, creating a line. Finally they gave up after several minutes and we all starting making noises. Then, I filled out my paperwork and somehow my number was skipped. Hmmm...interesting! So - the information lady cost MVD a star.  

However, when I finally got called...it was desk number three. I did not get her name, but she was awesome! Not only was my license taken care of in quickly, she had no problem looking up my registration without any paperwork. She was so easy and pleasant! I have found the same with gentlemen at window number 1 in a previous visit. Plus, the lady that took my picture didn't like the first one - so she took it again - who does that? THEY DO and I loved it!

Yagyu is a true JAPANESE style yakiniku restaurant. Umm except that they serve some kimchi.  No lettuce cups though.  Just meat and simple dipping sauces.

The quality of the beef (especially the boneless short rib - kalbi) is excellent.  Definitely prime.  Upgrading to any kobe style cut is worth the added expense.  Incredible fat content that makes the thinly sliced beef cook in literally seconds for melt in the mouth tenderness.  Because of the fat what looks like a little food can quickly fill you up.  Don't over order and have the staff quietly snicker at you.

The beer really is super cold and makes for refreshing, palate cleansing goodness.

Yakiniku is supposed to be engaging and fun but if cooking your own food and getting saturated with a heady, smoky, beefy aroma is not your thing (I wonder if the ladies like this scent on a guy?) I would recommend you try another of Vegas' great dining adventures.

Be sure to check their face book page for groupon offers.  The food can get justifiably pricey so savings help.

Based on the yelp reviews, it sounded like a good place, but this is one of those times that yelp had done me wrong :(  Came here about a month ago for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night.  Probably will not be back.  Service wasn't bad, but the quality of the sushi and fish just isn't worth it.

It's located on the corner of Flamingo and Maryland, in the Target complex.  It was a little difficult to find, because there was no actual sign that read Sakana.  From what I remember, I think the restaurant used to be called ""Kabuki.""  I think that sign was still up.  

Anyway, there was 6 of us.  When we walked in, there were a bunch of empty tables that had yet to be cleaned up--maybe low on staff?  There's a sushi bar and a few TVs that played some Asian pop music videos.  Quite entertaining to watch lol!

We were seated shortly after one of the employees had a chance to clear up one of the tables.  She promptly brought us our beer and water as we requested (I remember them having beer specials--I think a 2 for 1 deal), but it felt like it took forever to order and get our food.  We ordered a variety of things from the menu--rolls, appetizers, nigiri.  The food was less than mediocre.  One of the things we had ordered (I can't quite remember, I think it was the albacore) was fishy--to the point where I had to spit it up into my napkin.  Mind you, I love sushi. I know my sushi. And I take pride in the fact that I know the difference in quality.  The appetizers weren't bad.  I liked the chicken and the mussels.  Other than that, I felt pretty let down.

I wasn't sure how it worked, because it seemed like the booth owners were not around, mostly customers on a saturday afternoon. MY FIL told me that the lady walking around the entire store, has the keys, and she shows you the items if the case is locked. The clerk then calls the booth owner, and then you work out a deal that way (you can haggle- those marked prices are open to negotiation). 

I liked looking at all the Vintage Jewelry (97% of the jewelry were in glass cases). A few pieces caught my eye, I noticed Sarah Coventry (one of my favorite Vintage jewelry designers). In particular, the green rhinestone pieces are of heavy interest to me. Some of the items were a little creepy to me, like the ancient baby clothes, old dolls (I don't like dolls, especially the ones with the long curly eyelashes), taxidermy (that always freaked me out), and some pieces that were common for the time (the racial representations- I know that there are collectors, but it's not for me, just saying). Some pieces were fun to handle, like the 1940s womens hats (hell yes!) and the metal lunch pails from the 1970s (nostalgia!). There were some Coke & Pepsi glassware. Also, saw glass housewares- bowls, decorative items- figurines (ie. dust collectors), furniture (some art deco! i love art deco!), books, period clothing, records- vinyl, etc. I bet you could find an outfit here if you were attending a theme party- like 1970s, 1980s. There were some cute dresses on display, on mannequins or hanging high on a wall- some of those styles like everything else, have been recycled (I have to laugh when teens today think that the style is new, it's not new, it's been done before, unless you're Lady Gaga). 

The bathroom (middle, right side, if you are facing the front of the store space) has a baby changing station- ok, I never really paid much attention to this. Now that I have a baby, it's the utmost importance. Other parents, you know what I mean.

Clean place- carpeted floor BTW, the bathroom is for customers only (noticed the sign in the window), lots of parking available, open daily. The clerk was nice, and directed us to the bathroom. This used to be a Pistol Pete's Pizza in the 1990s. It's a substantial place inside- if you like window-shopping, this is the place for you.

And the corn hole court is a great activity for group events as well. Anyhow, I digress - this review is about our experience on Sat for brunch/lunch. 

We were running errands and found ourselves near this Vig location and decided to stop in for a bite to eat. They were offering both a brunch and their regular lunch menu. And $3 mimosas!  WOOT!  

I ordered off the brunch menu - chicken enchiladas with over easy eggs. They were amazing. The eggs were cooked perfectly so the yolk ran out into the sauce when you cut into them. And the sauce - a green chili sauce - was to die for. Just the right amount of tang and heat. I asked for the cream and pico on the side and didn't use much of either but I managed to clean my plate otherwise. 

Hubby ordered off the lunch menu and got the standard Vig burger with fries. He loves his burgers medium rare and it's not always cooked perfectly but it was. Just the right amount of toppings and cheese  and their fries are amazing - thin and crispy on the outside but soft inside.

Service is as fast as it can be in a tiny place with a sizable line. Lots of hustle, and everything was clean. No stickiness anywhere. Prices are high, of course, but I enjoyed what I had, so I guess that's a wash. Free easily accessed ice water is nice, too. 

Wish they had a few more tables outside, but space is tight where they are located.

Unfortunately, like most reviews, the area is covered in cigarette butts. =\ not too appealing. I walk my dog around here and have discovered the off leash dog-park.

1) The People. The few times I have come when it's ""busy"" the people aren't paying any attention to their pets. I've come by driving with my dog (she's too small to walk from home) and people let their dogs off leash in the parking lot to run to the park. Very very dangerous. So keep an eye out for someone's pup. 

2) Again, cigarette butts. There should be a designated spot for smoking. Not the entire dog park. There's butts everywhere. I don't want my dog eating your gross trash. 

3) Size. I don't mind the area size, again, my dog is small so it's more than enough room for her to run. But I wish they had a smaller dog section. While the signs say ""35lb and under"" and ""over 35lb"" people don't really adhere to it.

He said he could make it but you could tell he wasn't happy about it.  The whole time he was dropping F bombs and it was really uncomfortable.  I cuss like a sailor but to have someone do it in such an angry way was different.  Our visit just kept going downhill from there.  We were looking at the regular menu for some apps and he took the menu out of my friends hand to give it to a guy asking what beer they had.

The lobby bar is laid out nicely with comfortable seating and board games; makes you feel like being at the best house party in town. Bar prices are  a little higher but not too terrible ($8-$10 average for a cocktail). Even on a Friday night when the place is jam packed, service is quick, friendly and accurate.

Dare I say perfection? The mini bar is stocked with local beers and alcohol and the treats range from Zagnut bars to ramen in a cup. Room service available too. Bath products are courtesy of Rudy's Barbershop and Pearl Luxury Soaps...totally to die for. The shower head is EVERYTHING! The room robes are hoodie-style and so soft and comfortable.

Having been impressed by the high standard for drinks here I thought it would be a nice start before painting the town red. 
My dinning companions are health conscious when it comes to food so they were looking for healthier option,  I had checked the menu before hand and saw some suitable options for them. I wanted to eat something light but at a loss for choices.
Anyway after a bit of deliberation my friends ordered Tofu with Quinoa and I ordered a short rib sandwich. The service is still immaculate and the drinks don't disappoint (though they didn't have maudite on tap anymore) 
Sandwiches were quite poor the tofu was deep friend and had crumbly texture (deep fried not mentioned on the menu) and the bread was quite poor and kinda settles in your stomach (not in a good way). Short Rib sandwich was a similar poor iteration. Meat though tender was slathered with sauce that was not balanced and had overly sweet finish. I became lethargic after this supposedly light sandwich option. 
The food needs to improve here as I didn't pay much attention to it on the last visit and only tried a snack or two.
2 Stars for the food here.
Now on to the drinks we decided to stick to cocktails this time and ordered a round of Autumn's Rest. A nice balanced light drink. For seconds a round of Fire & Ice did the trick. This is more of a  creative drink and the list of ingredients is baffling. Somehow it all comes together the top is caramelized and has a more marshmallow like finish.  Hmm more on the sweet side. 
This place is still top notch for drinks IMO though I would advise against dinning here.",2013-11-01 15:57:36

We got to meet the chef William, who was very friendly and made a point to chat with every customer that was in the restaurant. He told us that Monday's are he best days to come for the buffet since the selections often change every day. I got to try nearly every dish (except for the goat curry) and of course my favorite was the masala. Every dish was seasoned and cooked perfectly! You can really taste the spiciness without it overpowering the actual dish. When it came to dessert, I had the gulab jamun (which is essentially a milk-based fried ball in syrup) and the tamarind chutney. Both super delicious, although I do not recommend eating them together since both flavors are profoundly on opposite spectrums.

Looking for self parking? Nahh, they rather have you tip the valet guys. My company for the night was a wonderful friend of mine. The reservation was made at 730 so we got in earlier to try and get out quicker for the rest of the nights activities (good thing we did too). Our table was not ready and they said the next available one would be for us so we hung out at the bar by the entrance at 6:45. Wish I got the bartenders name but he is the founder of and did a wonderful job on my girl's extra sweet Raspberry Lemon Drop. I stuck with the Mule and a glass of Rodney Strong red wine.
My highlights here was the food itself. Shrimp Cocktail was very fresh and had a soft/crunch kind of like biting into a pear is the best way I can describe it haha. Didn't like the Salad, it was too dry and needed more flavor. They should offer more dressing or cheese as an addition. As all the other reviews state, the Prime Rib is fantastic. Our Diamond (16oz) and Lawry's (10oz) Cut came out very juicy and cooked perfectly to my medium rare expectations. The mushrooms and asparagus were great, but something new for me that night was the Yorkshire Pudding. You could make this stuff with a side of Au Jus an Appetizer itself!

I've heard that these guys have the same owner as Dakao, which offers $3.25 sandwiches. To me, that means that Ba Le should be a little better. I can't really distinguish the two shops' offerings, unfortunately. Maybe there's slightly more meat, but there's still a major dearth of veggies and an overabundance of bread (which, again, is why I don't typically like Subway). On top of that, some of the cilantro that did reach my sandwich was yellow. Spoiler alert: good cilantro is not yellow.

I've grown to appreciate the pho offerings of Las Vegas in recent weeks, but I'm still not sold on the banh mi thit at all. If you want to experience this type of sandwich, you would do better to wait until you're at a good place in California.",2013-12-14 19:20:19

Right off the bat, service was mediocre. Probably because they're understaffed? Our server came over after we were seated momentarily to take our order however, we were undecided and needed a few more minutes. Finally, when we have made up our minds, we had to constantly try to get her attention. 

I ordered the Lime Coronarita while my girl friend ordered the Mango Coronarita and Cajun Chicken Wings. The drinks were 9 bucks and the chicken wings were half price since it was a Tuesday. I don't normally drink cocktails but the Lime Coronarita was one of their go-tos so, I've decided to try it. It tastes like its name, not too sour or too sweet. A perfect balance between the two and it actually gave me a bit of a buzz going on, haha. The wings were mediocre, I've had better however, the fries were yummy! They're not your regular french fries, they are miniature waffle fries!

Once our bellies were full, we tried get our server's attention for our bill. Again, it took quite a long time for us to get her attention. Instead, we just asked another server for our bill and quickly got out of there.

C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER! Sorry, friends, but this place isn't 5/5 for me. It's close, but it's definitely not amazing. 

I'll keep this short and simple. Service is great - they'll fix or remake your drink if you're not happy with it. Prices are decent, and location is perfect for me (you mean I don't have to drive to Chinatown anymore?).

Very little seating, clean bathrooms.

Drinks are alright, to be honest. The first time I had their boba it was too hard (similar to KFT) but the second time it was pretty good. But the second time, I didn't even order boba so there was some miscommunication there too. Every time I order a drink it's WAAAY too sweet. The most recent time I visited I asked for half sweet and it was STILL to sweet. They had to add more black tea and then it was perfect. 

I think a boba place that has to keep fixing your drink doesn't qualify as ""as good as it gets"" regardless of how willing they are to do that. Who knows, they could very well rise to a 5/5 soon but as of now, I will continue to try out different drinks.

Heads up, taro milk tea tastes very natural and starchy (think of the actual taro root or potato). Some people might not like that.

They have huge bars with lots of different beers on tap or if beer isn't your thing they have a book of ALL the cocktails. On this visit I ordered a Bloody Mary. Which was yummy! It came with a pickle, olives and celery as garnish. I also had a drink called an Orange Crush. Both drinks were perfect and didn't break the bank either!

My relatives arrived from China in the United States for the first time and I decided to take them to Beijing Noodle #9 because they said they were craving Chinese food. 

Despite the high price tag attached to all the items on the menu, the food quality was not bad. I myself had the roast duck noodle soup ($18.99). There were four big prime pieces of duck in my soup, lots of flesh and little bone. I was very pleased with this and the soup broth was not very salty, thus drinkable. Only thing the noodle soup could have improved on was the choy sum. The chef staff could afford to put a few more pieces of choy sum into the soup, I know choy sum isn't that expensive. There were only three little pieces of greens that accompanied the duck and the noodles. The beef chow fun ($19.99) was very authentic and terrific too. The portion size was enough for 3-4 people to share. But paying $19.99 for a beef chow fun in Las Vegas definitely angers my wallet a little bit too! Even a pot of Jasmine tea costs $4.99.

The lighting was a bit dark, I had trouble making out what I was eating. They are a gin bar so I tried a spicy/sweet gin cocktail. It was more sweet than spicy, and pretty tasty. 

For dinner, I had the lamb lollipops and the jackfruit curry. The curry came with thin noodles that needed a bit more sauce, fortunately the waitress brought me some extra when I asked. It had actual chunks of coconut and a good flavor. The jackfruit tasted a lot like eggplant. The lamb lollipops were a cooked perfectly to medium rare and came with a great sauce on the side. My friend ordered the spicy fried paneer appetizer, that probably had the best flavor of everything I tried. It was sweet and spicy and the paneer had a pretty strong flavor.

Positives
- Friendly service advisors.  I mean, really friendly.  Great customer service training for sure.
- Waiting area is a palace.  Hungry?  They've got you covered cooking up made to order meals here!  Seriously!
- Convenient.  Just off the intersection from Scottsdale and 101.

Negatives
- Price.  I get it, I own a Lexus but does that mean an oil change needs to cost $100?  
- Price Part 2.  Oh boy, we've hit the 20k mile check up.  In addition to the oil change they inspect the brakes and test the battery.  Thanks, but $200+?

I think I know what I am talking about....and what I am talking about is the most healthy, organic, and delicious veggie dishes I have tasted. Rather than masking their foods with mock this and Seitan that, this place dishes out ridiculously tasty treats. Come veg out with me

~Fud/Drink~
The food here folks...so good. They hand prepare everything in store either the day before or the day of. I mean, literally the kitchen is open you can see them preparing the dishes in front of you. Because of the sheer size of the dishes they are doling out (usually at least 6+ handmade dishes) they are prepping all day long. Luckily I have tried both their breakfast and lunch (lunch twice). For breakfast I got a tofu scramble with potatoes...SO GOOD! I had some vegan dressing (from Whole Foods) that I dipped it in once back in the office, and it was heaven in my mouth. There were no byproducts, just straight up organic firepower.

For lunch please see my pics :-) I have gotten a couple wraps along with legume-filled sides. I absolutely adored the Baba Ganouche Salad as well, btw. The best side to date is the Quinoa & Israel Couscous....it is wickedly good. No complaints with my tummy either, which happily enjoyed the deposits of fresh veggies.

I want to point out I am not a vegetarian. I am more Pescatarian than anything else, but I eat a ton of veggies. I think I do veggies really well....but Desert Roots knocks it outta the park consistently. They do have random drinks to choose from, more natural and such...I just opt for water with it being so hot out. No liquor here, btw.

~Atmosphere/Service~
Top notch service here. They welcome me each time like family and are more than willing for me to try. I see how hard they are working and always give a bit of a tip because it is such a small operation (maybe 5 people working here about?). I have come during off hours, so the atmosphere is pretty quiet, but they have a great back patio and I can guarantee this is an easy escape from the craziness on Mill. Keep that in mind, this is nothing like anything else on Mill, very quiet and relaxing space for the person who is more to themselves.

Come here and eat some very healthy food...while not overtly realizing it :-D The staff here does an outstanding job and the quality...OH THE QUALITY.... top of the line. 5 stars goes for creativity in dishes, consistency in quality, top notch service, a quiet escape on Mill (who would've thunk it), and for proudly being vegan friendly through and through.

Tucked in the backside of Miracle Mile, in Planet Hollywood, the V Theater is a little awkward. The box office is smack dab in the middle of a mall, and for some reason, the Will Call line moves infinitely slower than  the normal line to buy tickets. The theater, itself, is on the top floor - wear your hiking boots. Once in the theater, things got real intimate. The seating is packed - like a flight on Spirit or Jet Blue. It was extremely uncomfortable and set off my anxiety as soon as the seats filled. 
Luckily, there was an empty seat on the end, next to my partner, so I was able to move over and give myself some room to enjoy the show. 
By the time the show started, I was already wanting it to be over so I could get out of the theater. 
But then something magical happened. The show started and it was good. Really good. The dancers were talented and really good looking, even as zombies (To the dancer with the shaved head, COME THROUGH!!!). The main stars of the show were the host and Mikey. Their chemistry was hilarious, and they each stole the show in their own ways. It was especially funny when they were making each other laugh on stage. Those candid moments are often the highlights of the show. 
In short, the cast made me forget about my claustrophobia. I salute you.

Earlier in the day, I had been at a Barnes & Noble and spent $60 on three books and a magazine.  If only I had waited, I would have saved myself about half that amount and gotten more books.  My son and his girl friend brought me here to browse and see what I could find.  Besides books, there are games, cds, musical instruments and more items for purchase.
The books titles are organized by subject (YA, bio, fiction, non-fiction, graphic novels, etc.) and by author on the shelves.  I am a sci-fi/ fantasy fan and I was surprised of the titles available.  They weren't the newest titles but if one is reading a series, it is better to pay a lower price on the older titles.  The condition of the five books I purchased was like they were brand new.

Yes, like most popular dining establishment on the block, Patria caters to the 25-40 year-old-hot-professional demographic who have high expectations for svelte service.  Well, Kudos to Khabouth for knowing his neighbourhood's demands, and how to deliver them well. The service at Patria is a true pleasure. Our server was energetic, professional, genuine and well versed in every little ingredient in every little dish.  Other service staff members were equally as helpful throughout our night.  For example, any time a manager, server or food runner would pass our table, they would refill our water glasses, inquire about our meals, engage in conversation and replenish plates and cutlery.  There wasn't a single food runner in our line up of tapa-deliveries who didn't come to our table prepared with a thorough dish description and a huge excited smile on their face. Everyone was also aware of our Passover restriction, and whenever substitutions or omissions were made in a dish, they reinforced how the dish was made suitable.

The alcohol menu is fairly substantial and holistically appealing.  With 10 cocktails on offer, the options are unique, yet still very approachable. I like that in addition to the ingredients, the Cocktail Director, Elan Marks, also lists the tasting notes of the drink. I mean doesn't reading something like: ""playful Spanish coffee with subtle hints of cherry- wonderfully rich in flavour"" get you too excited to dwell on the $14 price tag? Smart.  While there are a number of local and international wine offerings, the focus here is on Spanish wines- many of which can be purchased as 3 oz, 5 oz, 375 ml portions so one need not commit to an entire bottle. In addition to a nice Spanish Sauvignon Blanc, and later, a dessert wine (the variety of which I now can't recall), we sampled the Red Sangria (Red Wine, Port, Sweet Vermouth, Spiced Poached Pear Reduction, Cloves, Orange Juice, Pear Nectar, $13), Amor Joven (Tanquerey Gin, Fresh Lemon, Simple syrup, Black Currant Cassis Jam, $13) and The Elyxer (Absolute Elyx Vodka, Lime, Sugar, $14).  The Sangria was just okay, but a bit flat in overall flavour, particularly when tasted next to the other two drinks. The Amor was absolutely my style, deeply sweet with a perfect balance of bright citrus to balance it out.  In contrast, the Elyxer was incredibly tart, almost shockingly so coming right after the Gin based drink, but after a few sips I was able to comfortably settle in. If you like your cocktails sour like I do, then this is the drink for you.

Developed by Executive Chef, Stuart Cameron (Weslodge, Stories, Kultura), and Pastry Chef, Anatasia Mucho, Patria's menu is divided into Small Plates, Cheese, Share Plates, Meat, Rice, Desserts, and Daily Specials.  Although our Passover restrictions meant the paella and crusty sour dough bread were not in our cards, there were more than enough suitable selections to choose from the approximately 40 savoury items. Our server walked me through the best picks and substitutions, and recommended we start with approximately 3 savoury items per person. So with that in mind, between the two of us, we ended up trying:

Selecciones De EmButidos (Iberico Lomo, House Chorizo, Jamon Serrano, $14)

Okay so I know what you're thinking. How is THIS K4P? But, I eat pork every other day, and so Passover for me was no different. Not to mention, if we didn't eat pork OR shellfish OR chametz at Patria, well, I think we would leave pretty hungry. Spanish food is not Kosher food by any stretch of my bacon-loving imagination. Anyways, bread or no bread, this was a tasty first plate of the night. While I found myself searching for a bit more spice in the chorizo, any mild faults were made up for by the delicate texture and lusciously marbeled mouthfeel of the Iberico, and the firm and flavourful bite of the Serrano.

Datiles Con Tocino Iberico (Dates, Iberico Bacon, Manchego, Guindillas, $9)

These were essentially a Spanish version of Devils on Horseback- crispy bacon-wrapped sweet date stuffed with salty cheese, a bright tangy pickled pepper and bathed in a sweet reduction sauce. The flavours were so balanced, and so remarkably addictive, I could have just ordered a couple more platters for the night and left happy- by far, my favourite dish.

Pimientos Rellenos de Buey (Piquillo Peppers, Oxtail, Manchego, $12)

While certainly unable to top what came before, the oxtail meat was sweet and rich and was countered nicely by the delicate smokiness of the pepper and the salty hit of the manchego.

 
Viera Con Migas Y Espuma Manchego (Scallop, Chorizo Migas, Manchego, $15)

I asked my friend what they thought of the ribs and chicken. It was decent. 

Our waitress was still green but she was kind and nice and made sure to always bring water (without even asking) to our table. She also did the split bills at our table and even wrote Thanks :)

That didn't and still doesn't mean anything to me. However, at $3.99 for an incredibly delicious, piping hot sausage dog, this was a steal. 

They had three versions available that day: beer bratwurst, brick lane chicken, and ginger beef. I asked which one they recommended. I was told they don't like recommending things, but that their most popular was beer bratwurst and they didn't have the ginger beef. I was trying to decide between brick lane chicken and ginger beef, so that basically took care of my dilemma for me. I got the brick lane chicken. It came with a chicken sausage I'm guessing was tikka masala spiced, apricot chutney, and fried onions. The sausage was juicy, the bun was soft, and the fried onions added a delightful crunch. I love street meat, but this takes the cake. If sausage dogs cost over $4 on the street and only have basic toppings, why would I get those when I can get this? I was so happy after having this that I texted my brother to let him know about it. He told me to bring one home for him. I would have, but I had half a day of food adventuring to go before I got home, and that poor dog would have been a mess by the time I got home. Oh well. That just means I have an excuse to come back, not that I need one...

It was like you were watching the events live at times.  The action was seamless, and the sound was fantastic.  We saw a big action movie (The Hobbit:  Desolation of Smaug), so that probably added to the movie experience.  The seats were very comfortable, and reclined to the perfect angle.  I found the restrooms to be clean.  The prices for concessions are high, but that's how it is at the movies.

I got the Chicken parm. lunch with the pasta, salad and bread sticks. I could not believe how moist and tasty the chicken parm. was, even when I reheated it the next day.

I had some of my own on hand so it worked out but just a little tip for you. 
All my friends raved about how good the chicken was and everyone enjoyed the early dinner I served. I highly recommend this place for your catering; you won't regret it.

Drink. Singular. As in only one, because the bartender only checked on us a couple minutes after serving us then never again.

I had to stand up and put my coat on just to get his attention to bring us the check. We ended up going to eat elsewhere. 

At fist, it seemed like the service would be great. However, as the night went on, it became clear he was more interested in chatting with his coworkers than actually tending the bar. Another couple sat down across the bad from us later and ordered three drinks each...that's either an indication that the service is always like this, or the couple needs a 12 step program.

Reservation was for 9PM and once we arrived we were seated immediately which was great because I was starving! Things started off a bit rough for the experience but they made things right and THAT's the part that counts. I know what the quality of food should look and taste like because I dine at the one in Beverly Hills all the time. So for our order we went with the Tomhawk for 2 which was running for $115 and added on a lobster tail ($36) to go with it. The steak is obviously sharing size but the cool part is that they can cook it to the temperature of what each person would like. I am more of the medium and my partner is medium well. So when the steak came out it was incorrect and we asked to have blue cheese crust added which didn't get added and the mac n cheese came out sub par as well, very dry with just no taste!

The fact that I was able to pull the manager aside and address my concerns with the presentation of my meal left me satisfied because he actually cared and fixed it.

It's quite a large restaurant, as they have taken over two units. The washrooms are in the basement, and it's a long walk down a corridor to the other end. Can feel quite sketchy. 

Since it was late, the restaurant was mostly empty. The staff pushed some tables together so that everyone can sit together. We ended up staying past 10, and they didn't rush us out.

""Number 1 Ranked to be World's Most Delicious foods by CNN""
""One of the famous Thai dishes in United States""

The thai iced tea and thai iced coffee are quite a steal at $2.50 for a large cup. Would be nice if they didn't have so much ice though; perhaps that can be customized if you mentioned.

The scrapbook paper selection has shrunk, but it's still decent-sized and full of retro charm, with lots of available embellishments.

First, the posted hours are meaningless, and calling the day before to double-check hours will have you staring at a locked gate, too. Call right before you intend to go there, and then go immediately. It's not that I don't sympathize with small business owners' need to have time when they're not at work -- it's just that I'd prefer that time not be during the posted business hours. This part, I could work with, though.

Second, don't trust the stamping/scrapbook paint. I bought a pricey little tube there, got it home, and discovered after opening it that the paint was completely dried up. Fortunately, before making the trek to return it, I looked at the receipt and determined it announces ALL SALES FINAL. So that was a waste of money, and thank goodness I didn't indulge in more colors, as my budget really can't absorb multiple instances of the store's not keeping its stock fresh and refusing to take responsibilities for its own oversights.

Service:  We sat outside this visit as we were here for the drinks, live music and salsa dancing in the pavilion.  Our waitress was great.  She got our drinks to us timely and she was working a very busy patio section of 8+ tables.  Every time she brought out drinks, she'd check on all the tables while she was out there.  If there weren't any orders coming out, she'd come out to check on her section frequently.  Great stuff.

Drinky Drinks:  I went to my go-to of Tito's and Tonic water and each one was mixed well.  They're running at $11 a glass on Wednesday nights.

Ambiance:  Very very classy high end vibe with lots of dark wood and high quality furniture everywhere.   Dimly but smartly lit keeps it very intimate.  The Humidor was interesting to check out and was well stocked.  On Wednesday nights there is Salsa dancing outdoors in the pavilion and it can easily accommodate 25+ dancing couples.  This is weather dependent and we'll see how it goes into the the fall and summer months. The live music was fantastic and kept the crowd moving.  When the band took a break, the DJ kept the music playing and the crowd moving.

The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  

So finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.

The service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.

The husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  

Furthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...",2014-01-22 15:43:02

This was my first time visiting this establishment during my Shop Small Saturday food run. The staff were very welcoming. I was greeted with so many ""welcome to our store"" as I entered that I immediately felt like I was part of the family. The decor was very simple, and yet, its message was loud and clear. It's all about the LOVE. It's all about being happy. 
Let's break down the waffle love:
My 2 top picks are: 
-The Cinne Bliss: churro waffle, fried ice cream, and dulce de leche. This is da bomb!
-Nutella Love: waffle, Nutella cream, choice of fresh fruit
I went with a group of friends, so we were able to order quite a few different types of waffles. We loved everything we ordered. The grill cheese with tomato bisque was an unexpected delight. 
I highly recommend this place for gathering with friends, family day out with the little ones, and definitely a cool place to take a date for delicious desserts. I drove 55 minutes to get to this place, and I must say their waffles are worth every second of it. Stay awesome peeps",2016-11-27 22:37:28

I was a teenage girl with one of 'those' friends. She decided my unruly brows needed to go, and go they did. She did them for me the first time and I followed what she did every week after that. For the next five years, I had pencil straight stern eye-brows.

Over the last four years I've been trying to turn things around and slowly tweeze in an arch for myself. Things went okay, and they were looking a lot less botox-chick-with-one-emotion, but they weren't brilliant. A month ago I got sick of trying. I got bangs and let things run wild. Oh man, there be bears in them there woods!

I booked in an appointment with Mary via her website (which is super handy -- you can select when and what time you want to go and her handy-dandy system will tell you what's free) and I arrived this morning super excited. I had also booked myself in for a lash perm (because this is apparently a real thing and I absolutely needed to try it) so I was pretty psyched to see what I would look like leaving the place.

Mary spent a few minutes talking to me and complimenting my ability to grow DeNiro brows in the space of a month. She explained what she was going to do and then got to work, pausing to show me one finished brow before going on to the next. She then pointed out which parts still needed a bit more time to grow in and gave me some awesome, awesome, awesome pointers on filling in those spots in the mean time without making myself look like a clown (something I never managed to figure out on my own!). She even showed me what shade I needed to get. Turns out the one I had been using was about 11 shades too brown. No wonder I looked so angry all the time.

Next up was the lash perm. Oooh, boy! Mary put these little jelly flaps onto my eyelids and proceeded to wrap my eyelashes around a little bump on the bottom of each flap. Then she put on the perming solution, some relaxing, cool cotton pads and left me to nap for a little while. When she came back and put on the second half of the solution she sat and talked with me a while. She is so friendly and easy going, you don't ever get that awkward feeling that she asks all of her customers the same questions without ever really caring about the answer. I think she and my dental hygienist must have gone to the same classes for that skill!

After about 15 minutes she washed everything off and showed me the result. MOTHER OF PEARL. It looked awesome. I was absolutely stunned. I still can't get over how great it looks. And it's going to last two months! Hurray!

In total, my 90 minute appointment was two hours (though I think that had a lot to do with my jungle-brows) and I felt 100% awesome the entire time. The fact that I was all alone and I was the focal point the whole time really made me feel like I was getting something special. Friendly service is one thing, but Mary clearly has a knack for making people feel like VIP.

Pricewise, it's $30 for your first visit for brows and then $25 for maintenance after that. Sure, there are cheaper places, but I'd compare this to a man getting a hot towel shave. You can shave at home with a $1 Bic disposable but the pampering is nice and you know you're getting an excellent job. If you're looking for a quick clean up, and to be in and out in 15 minutes, this probably isn't for you. However, if you're looking for a pro to tell you what your brows should look like and how to get them back to the way nature intended (albeit a little tidier, sharper and cleaner looking) Mary is worth the money. 

The only downside of the entire experience: I high-tailed it to Dufflet Pastries immediately after my appointment (hey, it was lunchtime by that point!) and was helping myself to a sample of their carrot cake when Mary walked in. And by helping myself I mean eating cake (complete with frosting!) with my fingers out of a cup the size of a shot glass. I looked like a total neanderthal and was totally mortified that she had seen me. If my hairy, hairy forehead didn't have her convinced I was unrefined, my cake slurping skills likely did the trick!",2012-05-08 19:27:57

It reinforced my belief when i walked in and saw they had a sushi bar, a sushi bar at a Chinese hot pot place?  The decor was also Japanese which made me think it was a shabu shabu spot (which i do not like) but they had a Japanese BBQ grill which i wasn't mad at.

I ordered the spciy beef hotpot and she ordered the lamb, the lamb was not full of flavor but what it did have was richness, if you love lamb you don't usually want it overbearingly spicy in a soup. well, we don't at least (we had the cumin lamb as an appetizer for that) My hotpot on the other hand, was bursting with flavor, so much i ordered an extra side of enoki mushrooms to go with it, the spice level was perfect for a date (they told me i could get more spicy if i want next time)

The breakfast was delicious with ample portions and for relatively affordable price about 7 bucks then 2 for the hotcake.

It's self seating and the bar was full so we chose to sit in a small table for four. It took a little while to get our drink order. I ordered an apricot cider which was a bit sour but good. My glass had some lipstick stain on it and I was not wearing any lipstick so I had to send it back unfortunately. The waitress was very apologetic and was happy to get me a new glass. 

The food was good. We got fried chicken skins and dynamite crab dip for appetizers. The crab dip was pretty good and had a kick to it. The chicken skins were good and reminded me of calamari but everyone on yelp raved about it so far so we had to give it a try. 

I ordered the signature banh mi. It was okay. Not the banh mi I'm used to but the bread was soft which I liked. My husband got a pork belly burger and he ate that all up.

Well, we had to try it for ourselves, and we were satisfied!

Showing up on a Thursday afternoon, you would expect it to be fairly empty-ish. When we arrived, it was nearly packed, with only a few tables left for us. We started off with a Caesar and mimosa, which surprisingly came out a lot later than we expected. Drinks were okay overall, but we were turned off by how long it took for us to get them. We looked towards the bar multiple times, and swore the bartender was just chatting with patrons. Wish there was another shot of champagne in my orange to make up for lost time I could've gotten buzzed quicker.

As for the food, I ordered a basic breakfast plate with Canadian bacon, beans, potatoes, two eggs, and a garlic muffin. The bread was probably my favorite item on the plate! When hot and steamy, it was nearly perfection. My scrambled eggs were also very nice, but everything on the plate felt mediocre for the price that we were paying. For my friend, her pancakes looked and tasted great, and was probably the better option of the two.

I thought that Old School did a decent job at giving us a brunch experience. If they can tune up the service a bit and eliminate the wait time just a tad (especially for drinks), then this can turn into a really good spot for Toronto natives and visitors alike.",2016-04-18 19:03:03

The pizza had no taste whatsoever, it was just mainly texture.

The service was lackluster as well, I ordered a Manhattan and shouldn't have because I felt like I had taken three straight shots, so when I politely asked the bartender for something sweeter and even pushed the drink to the edge of the bar, he walked past me for me than five minutes ignoring me and when we had asked for suggestions on the menu before ordering food, he instead offered only his opinion on drinks, as if we weren't looking at the food menu.

Overall, the service was less impressive than expected and the food and its dull and dry tasting components left alot to be desired, just as the tip I left!

After he painted on the gel he took his sand paper roller and went right over my gel with it. I pulled my hand back asking why he was doing that he told me don't worry and continued to scrape up my manicure. Then decided to shape my nails AFTERWARDS????!!!!!! Who does that??????? Now my nails look crunchy. The sides of my nails are rubbed off and it looks tacky!! Im not happy with the finish. But im sick with an illness and tired so im going home. All a girl wants is a nice manicure. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO FLIPPIN ASK???! SMH. This is hands down my favorite spot. So of course I will be returning.

We found the exact vehicle we wanted on their website, priced to move (below other area dealership prices). We pulled in a few minutes before the dealership opened and were greeted immediately. As soon as we mentioned the vehicle we liked online, we were taken straight to it (on a golf cart!), and test-drove it. 

When we went in to talk numbers, it all went smoothly. The vehicle had about $900 of extra dealer add-ons on it, but, to be honest, we didn't even pay attention to what they were because we were so glad to find the exact model and feature combo we wanted, plus it still cost less than when we shopped around. Taxes, tags and $399 doc fee later, we had our total. 

The salesman, Roy, was super friendly and laid back and didn't try to upsell anything. Admittedly, we came in ready to buy, but there was no shadiness whatsoever.  We were in a hurry so he expedited everything. The finance guy, Evan, was particularly nice and didn't insist we add anything we didn't want (especially refreshing considering that all 3 times I've made car purchases, this was always the pushiest and least pleasant role).

The meatballs were large and a delicious blend of beef, veal and pork. 

The dessert options sounded good too. Next time I want the tiramisu. This time though I tried the creme brulee. I get this dessert a lot and they all pretty much taste the same. Not sure how they did it, but Lago's creme brulee somehow stood out among the crowd. 

Aubrey was a great waitress full of passion for Lago and possessive of a true love for the food. I was impressed with her attention to detail too. The meatball appetizer comes with just three meatballs, but since there were four of us she asked if we wanted an extra one.

I keep hearing about the Meat Jun and its something always always been fan of when it comes too korean food. Toss up between Meat Jun and Kali bi. Only winnahs either or both. The Meat Jun was Amazing!! I love the fact that the egg batter outside not too thick but just right amount of coating not see the meat until dig in, outside nice golden brown, the meat inside has nice seasonings, and meat was moist. Tradition local style white rice and mac salad. I liked the mac salad. The portion size is great! All of it under ten dollars. Is there better deal for lunch?? Think not! Hawaiian food always get your money worth and more....

One of the highlights was the sides that your meal came with at Island Style. Moist Korean restaurants been too can be hit or miss the amount they give plus the different types you get. Here you get five different ones. Although it was only me they were very generous with everything. Korean kim chee fan for life. The kim chee here not hot hot but still good. The roasted peanut action. Now if that doesn't speak too keeping it local style not sure what else can say.  It comes with anything you order almost like bread no charge. They even put it in a to go container so can take it home. Sweet! 

The service was great! U can tell local owners and care about putting out good local grinds. They just expanded couple weeks ago so restaurant is lot bigger.

This year they showcased nearly 50 local restaurants and 30-some wineries.  There were several live music acts and people watching to last all day.  This event is held the perfect time of year - its a nice warm outside, not too hot.  Yes, it can get a bit toasty when standing in the direct sun while consuming alcohol, but that's nothing an ice cold Mai Tai from Hula's won't fix.

Being a vegetarian at this event is not an issue.  There are plenty of vegetarian options and many chefs will make you a special little plate of their dish meat-free. I sometimes feel a little left out when some of the big-name, popular restaurants don't offer an option but I can go stuff my belly with something else! 

I do wish they would cap the number of tickets sold to maybe 2,000 a day. I feel like every year this event gets more and more crowded.  My poor dad who recently had surgery on his feet did not enjoy this event at all because the sheer number of people bumping into him made him uneasy.

FOOD
They have a massive menu. Mostly skewers, but they also have rice bowls, noodles and variety of hot and cold dishes. I do like having a large selection but it was kind of overwhelming. Things I ordered (only managed to get a pic of tuna tataki due to the bad lighting) :

Tuna Tataki: You have the option of beef or tuna. It came with 8-10 slices of tuna drenched in a ponzu sauce with a little bit of garlic and jalapenos. Ponzu was overpowering but still one of my favorite dish. 4/5

Chicken Nan Ban Bowl: I am fairy picky with my chicken nan ban. This was not the chicken nan ban I am used to eating. It was basically a fried chicken, or karaage drizzled with tar tar sauce. I like the traditional nan ban, which is fried chicken with sweet/sour sauce. Tar tar sauce was ok with chicken, but did not go well with rice. 3/5

Thunderbird: This was from their signature skewer menu. It is a chicken thigh with radish, garlic and ponzu. Chicken was extremely dry and cold. 2/5

Beware: they are not kidding on the spices. For Thai restaurants, I usually order about halfway up the scale. However, I once ordered a ""2"", and it painful.

Have been here a few times and overall I like what I had so far.  Braise beef noodle soup has flavour but obvious lack the depth of what I had had in Taiwan.

Grilled fried tofu on the other hand is yummy with slight crisp skin while preserving the silky, soft texture inside.  Also tried one of their signature beef pancake, it tastes ok but I personally don't like this, as I find it too dry to eat it in the summer.  They also make decent bubble tea and I really like Hokkaido milk tea, it tastes smooth, creamy and quite refreshing. But I find bubble tea overpriced in comparison to their food.

rF3N6wUX4HqFyXxg_YWbLg,fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,bsrj9_hFAql3dlSf244zpg,4,3,3,3,"We just had a very nice stay at Trump, thanks to Priceline.  I confess we got this hotel due to an error in bidding on my part.  I accidentally added in the North Condo zone, and had an absolute hissy fit when I realized what I had done.   That being said there are some real pluses to staying here, and the price for a 5-star was pretty darn good, especially since it included a Saturday night. 

   Plus 1:  Much easier for a cab driver to get there and drop you off than a strip hotel.  We arrived on a very busy Saturday and the cab line looked like a popular Disney World ride queue.  Traffic was busy, yet we arrived quickly.
   Plus 2:  Fast fast fast check-in.  NO wait at a prime afternoon check-in time. Friendly too, with no snooty attitude that one can sometimes encounter when checking in prepaid via Priceline.
   Plus 3:  EASY, SHORT walk to your room.  A rarity in Vegas.  Save the miles for strip-walking.  (we sure did plenty of that, so being able to quickly get to our room when we got back each day was nice!)
   Plus 4:  Rooms are two per suite area, so you have the added security of an extra door.
  Plus  5:  JACUZZI.  Not just a boring big tub.  (let bubble bath search commence...but remember to only use a TEENY bit). 
  Plus 6:   Fridge (and other kitchen things that would only be a plus imho if we were staying longer than 3 nights).  
  Plus7:  Buttons by door that you can use to indicate privacy or housekeeping.  Very classy and worked like a charm.
  Plus 8:  Room service.  Top-notch.  Friendly.  Quick.  And surprisingly less expensive than I've seen in hotels in Vegas and other cities. We ordered a burger one night and it was good, with waffle fries, came with cute little bottles of mustard, ketchup and a teeny tiny Tabasco!  We had them bring up a corkscrew also, which we were surprised wasn't already in the room. 
  Plus 9:  Courtesy Shuttle.  We NEVER had to wait more than 2 minutes for it.  Drivers were very friendly.  Took us to either the Encore or a very convenient location at the Forum Shoppes.  (underground, with an escalator that comes out right in front of Spago). Never ever had such quick, friendly shuttle service at a hotel anywhere before!
  Plus 10:  Location isn't bad anyway.  Cross the street (be careful) and you are in the Fashion Mall  and on your way to wherever you want to go.  Note that there is an ABC store in the mall that has wine, munchies, sparkling water...pretty much anything you might need. Also note that when you come out of the mall on Las Vegas Blvd, that is where the Tix 4 Tonite booth is so you can see if you want any discount tix or meal discounts.  We bought Absinthe tix there, saved money on it, and the show was very entertaining!
   Plus 11:  Housekeeping...excellent!  Bless their hearts (see minuses 2-10 below)
  
  Minus 1:  No robes in room.  (easily rectified by a call to the front desk, also had extra towels brought up in anticipation of jacuzzi usage).
  Minus 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:  The TOILET.  We HATED this toilet.  You can't tell me that Donald Trump or anyone in his family have ever used this toilet or one like it.  Heck our old ones here at home are considerably better.  It was the WORST toilet we have EVER had to deal with.  Now even though it was supposed to be Trump opulence, we didn't expect a golden throne or anything, but this porcelain puny had a plastic lid (no big deal, but unexpected in a 5-star).... the PROBLEM was that it would barely flush.  I realize the idea is to save energy, water, etc., but how much of a savings is it when you have to flush 3 times (waiting in between each time for the tank to fill up)?  Not only was the suckage power non-existent, but there was no water that would go around the basin, making flushing fairly useless, beyond frustrating and flat-out embarrassing at times.  God help Housekeeping here!  (Hope everyone believes in tipping Housekeeping like we do). 
  Minus 11:  The view. If you get ""city view"" like we did, it means a view of the Erotic Heritage Museum (which doesn't seem to get any traffic), and other such lovely landmarks.  Not a biggie to us as we didn't spend much time in the room, but if it's important to you ask for a different view.  
  Minus 12:  The train.  I'm only putting this as a minus because I know it would bother a lot of folks.  To us having spent a year and a half dealing with downtown DC noises, it was no big deal.  But yes it would wake us up several times each night.

   Overall impressions...this hotel feels more like 4 stars than 5. Whereas service was definitely 5-star in all regards (front desk, housekeeping, shuttle drivers, room service, security guard in lobby)... furniture, bedding, etc. was more 4-star than 5.  Toilet alone makes it impossible to rate it a 5.  It feels like a 4-star hotel that could be in any city anywhere.  There's nothing that cries out VEGAS RESORT.  And THAT is a plus or minus depending on how you look at it.",2011-11-10 01:49:16

I found the best chicken wings on the planet-- and they are at the Greenhouse Tavern.  (Not at the Anchor Bar, God forgive me.)  

The chicken itself is of exceptional quality.  Obviously organic and free range.  It was the most flavorful underlying chicken in a wing I have ever tasted.  The outside is supremely crispy and delicate.  They are subtlely flavored with garlic and a bit of something else-- je ne sais quoi.

Our other app was eye opening as well-- bread and butter.  OK, what could anyone possibly do with grilled bread and butter.  Hmmm-- goat's milk butter-- whiter, creamier and tangier than any cow could produce? 

Our entrees were equally spectacular. Nothing was overly complicated, just simple, elegant and perfectly prepared.  My flounder with shaved fennel melded a delicious fish that was not overpowered by the delicate taste of fennel and citrus.  The accompanying mussles were mindblowing-- they were completely delicate and tender without a hint of chewiness or gaminess.  I didn't realize that mussles could be like that.  Mon cher chou's chicken was as flavorful as the wings, although it would have benefited by a few of the gnocci that accompanied my dish.

Dessert was a delight.  I had ginger mango clafouti.  I just love saying that .  Clafouti. Clafouti.  Clafouti.  Yum.    Mon cher chou's  cookies and ice cream were even better.  Three hommade cookies, bursting with complex flavor and creamy, delicate homemade coconut ice cream.  

The service is very, very cool, casual and friendly.  The servers are obviously foodies!

Really a hit and miss with most dishes.  You really cant go wrong with the beef noodle soup, beef pancake, or steamed dumplings (xiao long bao). But I found the hot and sour soup had a bit of a strange after taste, the potstickers soggy, and the shanghai friend noodles far too salty. 

I may be a bit of a critic because I've had the pleasure of eating at a lot of Northern Chinese restaurants, but the irony is if you go to an Asian Legend in Markham/Richmond Hill, it will taste a lot better.  Still, not a bad place to go if you don't want to make the trek.",2014-01-02 22:24:58

InHGsvuFmIENm7WrGyqWKA,eAJ3Ip0vh-zuk_BmcmchYA,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,4,6,2,2,"On September 30th, my group of 10 ventured over to Beauty and Essex for a nice dinner before seeing a show. Due to our large group size, we made certain we had reservations a few weeks in advance. I'll admit. I was intrigued by the idea that we had to go through a pawn shop, which they assured everything was all purchasable, to gain entry to the restaurant. 

To no surprise, the restaurant and bar had a speak easy vibe. There was a long bar with low lighting. If you turned right, there was a round room for enjoying cocktails dressed in long velvet fabrics and chandeliers. If you continued on down the long bar, it opened to the dining area with antiques mirrors, more chandeliers and close knit seating. The acoustics of the room made it extremely hard to hear and our kind waiter, who seemed to be losing his voice, had some difficulty trying to explain the menu so he was patient enough to repeat himself around our table to make sure we understood everything. 

All menu items are served tapas style. There were certain menu items that seemed very shareable but some of what seemed like main entrées such as steak and fish, which typically would be enough for an individual, was also presented as tapas. My group was confused and looked to me to suggest what to do because we don't have all the same taste and perhaps didn't want to share in everyone else's meal necessarily. I told them just to order how they usually would and if they wanted others to try the dish, just cut them a few bites... problem solved! 

With the inability to hear each other when talking due to the loudness of the room and the ordering situation, my group was having doubt in my choice of restaurant... that was UNTIL the food came out. The food silenced their doubt and they were immediately consumed in eating and all smiles. Two of my friends ordered the steak, and it was probably one of the best we've enjoyed ever. Had they not shared some of it, I never would've expected I would find such amazing steak there!

My husband and I enjoyed the following:
Chile Relleno Empanadas - poblano peppers, manchego cheese, jalapeño lime cream. Spicy but delicious!
Spanish chorizo arancini - a lovely Spanish twist to an Italian family classic.  It had piquillo peppers, tomato, and saffron aioli. 
Grilled cheese, Smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - familiar comfort food served on spoons. Tasty and a home run since it's always been a childhood fav! 
Woodsman Cocktail - I didn't want an Old Fashioned since that's what I always order so I ordered this. It was Makers 46 Bourbon, allspice dram, maple syrup, lemon, and muddled pears. I really loved this.

Would we return? Definitely but maybe with a smaller group or even just my husband and I. This place is fits an intimate setting and even though they accommodate large groups, you can only truly enjoy the company of those immediately next to you. I love the atmosphere, and they even offered free champagne to the ladies before entering the pawn shop entrance. The staff was wonderful. Our waiter whose last name is Heimer (at least that's what the receipt listed) was so accommodating and patient. The guy who opened the door for us at the entrance of the pawn shop was so fun and even after took our group picture! What an awesome place overall!",2017-10-15 20:39:18

Unfortunately the interior is slightly dingy, although nearly every seat was full. The inside could be pretty cute it seems, but the wood was worn and cushions faded. I've not tried the food, but just from an appearance, bakery and cappuccino perspective, this place could use an update to keep up with the competition.

Guacamole - delicious, fresh, big portion, about half the price of guac elsewhere.

Queso - we had the chorizo version once and it was very good but we have had the plain cheese the last three times and it is really delicious.

Quesadilla - tried it without the chicken, portion is huge and stuffed with cheese, not too greasy...just enough to make it indulgent.

Nachos - we have had them a few times (minus chicken) and they really do a nice job here.  The chips are freshly made and they load them up with cheese, pico, sour cream, black beans, corn, and an avocado cream topping.  I feel like driving back for more nachos after typing this they're so good.

Salsa - if you like salsa, do yourself a favor and get the 3 for $5.  Tomatillo salsa is better than you think it's going to be, it's thick and rich and tangy...not the pale green watery stuff you get at other places.  Pineapple - get it.  Habanero - to get such a great smoky flavor with that amount of heat is not easy, this place gets it right.  Chili de Arbol - I was bold on our first trip and said ""no place really serves very hot salsa"" (as it is listed on their menu), I was wrong.

Tacos - Beef Barbacoa taco is the best of the bunch as far as I'm concerned. Carne Asada was good.  Pollo Mole - my husband still talks about this one, he loved it.

Short Rib Barbacoa - we got this for the first time a few nights ago as take out...when I opened the container it was like some wonderful grandma was in the kitchen all day making a delicious Sunday dinner for us to enjoy.

(The) Small theatre where all the magic happens. 

Quick Review™
+   Greats arts at absurdly low ticket prices. It feels like one is robbing them when it comes to the live entertainment per dollar ratio. 

+   Possible to watch a live stageplay -- with props* -- for less than the cost of a movie. (*Blood spurting everywhere.)   

------------------------------------------

I can't believe it took me so long to patronise the Onyx. I lived in Vegas for entirely too long before making it over here. Forgive me, Onyx (and whichever god/patron saint is supposed to be for the arts). 

Seats are old, but it's an old, lil' theatre (so it'll be that way). 

Parking is free, but it's Vegas (so it'll be that way). 

Concessions are cheap. 

Tourists
No tourists here* -- naturally -- since it is so far from the strip. (*Except the ones at The Green Door.)

Kids
Not good for kids. They can't handle the campy blood splatter. They also might not be permitted, I think.

Dogs
Not good for dogs. They don't like stageplays.

The best way to describe Garde Manger is going to your most awesome friend's place and hanging out, having fun and eating great!

If I owned a restaurant I would make it exactly like this one.

To start off with, it is true, you do have to reserve early before your visit. I booked 3 weeks before for a late Sunday seating. I was pretty stressed out because my group of friends decided to add 2 people to make the reservation for a total of 6. From what I understood, 6 is the biggest group they accept and I figured it would have been a pain to change at the last minute and that we wouldn't get a seat or be really squished. I called ahead and left a message that I would be needed 2 extra people (after 6 no one picks up the phone so you have to call before). I was amazed that when we arrived, they have received my message but misunderstood and thought I was letting them know that there would be 2 less people. Immediately I thought this was going to be a disaster but they were so accommodating and it happened that a large group left and we were seated right away! No waiting! 

Our waitress was one of the most pretty ladies in Montreal. She was also so friendly and helpful. Couldn't of asked for a better server. I also seemed from around that all the servers and staff were picked as the best of the best in the city. Starting from the host to the guy that takes away the empty plates and wow, so much eye candy! (For those that like that sort of stuff ;))

Like mentioned in other reviews, this place is loud! Do not expect quiet classical. More like classic rock for the patrons of this place.

But I digress, all this writing and no mention of food or drink! Like already mention, this is mostly a seafood/meat place. I ordered a caesar with some crab legs (best caesar I have had). I also ordered some oysters (I suggest asking if they have certain things you like because they may not be specifically on the menu or mentioned by the waitress). I also ordered a flank steak with these amazing deep fried mashed potato balls. Delicious. Most of the people at my table ordered a scallop dish and it looked and tasted great. They had a big variety of delicious sounding food and I did have trouble picking just one thing. I guess I am going to have to keep going back. :)

We also ordered some desserts to finish with and they were all wonderful. The ginger molasses cookie was particularly liked by everyone.

Wine list was extensive and a good range of prices.

If you are visiting Montreal like me, or live there, you should definitely go and visit my new friends at Garde Manger. (or at least I think they are my friends).",2011-12-07 21:40:33

I am also glad that they have a great selection of mags on the rare occasions when I need to wait--they always have the newest ESPN: The Magazine, which sure beats  reading the months-old Newsweeks and U.S. News and World Reports that other salons have.

Best of all, they don't end every haircut with a high-pressure sales pitch to purchase an overpriced hair product! I hate that, and I always feel like a bum when I roll out my ""I don't have much time in the morning to put in a product, I just wash and go"" line that I use when I feel the sales pitch coming on at other salons.

Both of us are familiar with Korean food, having eaten in restaurants in Seoul (Sinchon), Tennessee, Mesa, and the Las Vegas Strip, as far as Korean style food.  Bottom line we know how Korean food tastes.

My wife ordered Thick Noodle Soup (Kimchi).  She did not have a problem with the level of spice or the kimchi.  Probably the fact that the taste being strong then what we had in Seoul, South Korea is a regional difference of the chef.  The thing that really did get to her was the fact that the noodles were severely undercooked.  My wife is Asian, and knows how noodles are supposed to be in soup.  They were not al dente.  They were severely undercooked.

I ate Soon Tofu Seafood (Soondubu).  Compared to what I have eaten elsewhere in the East Valley for Korean food, and what I have eaten in Seoul, South Korea for similar, the soup's taste was totally off.  They need to learn to cook it.  

We also ate one order of Maki Sushi, Spicy Tuna Roll.  Based upon what we got we barely found the sushi edible.  It was not even up to par to what we have eaten in places here in Arizona, yet alone elsewhere.  

As far as the service it is slow.  It took me nearly three times over the course of 0.5 hour to get my check delivered to me at the end of the meal, and just as long for them to acknowledge that it was ready for processing.  There is absolutely no organization or division of the duties as far as who is running the place.  Also, the way they do housekeeping sucks.  They need to go study how things are done in Seoul (South Korea) at some restaurant, and they can see how to be efficient, and be clean.  

As a result, my wife and I will most likely not return to Gogi for Korean food.  We will go elsewhere in The Valley for Korean food, unless we are in Seoul (and we travel often enough to South Korea).  

We definitely advise this place to improve.  You can not compete with doing the status quo.",2015-02-06 18:32:29

I've been needing some snowshoes for a while and thought that I would probably just wait until the end of the season to take advantage of an inventory clearance sale or maybe some used rental shoes. Seeing Atmosphere's Boxing Day flyer a few days prior, they seemed to have some good deals and I went to check them out.

My fiancee and decided that our best bet was to head downtown thinking that this location would be easier to get into and less busy than the one in Deerfoot Meadows. We were right. There wasn't any street parking out front but a camera store behind them was closed for the day and had parking available. Once in the store we found it to be pretty manageable as it was busy but not crammed full of people.

While browsing the snowshoe wall a couple of employees asked if we needed help. One employee gave us the rundown of the different types of shoes and asked us what type of trekking we would be doing, gave us some suggestions, then left us to shop. I didn't end up purchasing any of the shoes that had the 50%+ discounts advertised in the flyer but all of the snowshoes were on sale and I got something that was going to suit me properly for what I was doing, which is the most important thing. What's the point in getting a great deal if its on something that isn't the right product?

I hadn't planned on buying poles, but taking a quick look around they had a set that was regular $135 for 60% off. They seemed like they would do the trick and were much nicer than the ones near the sales price so I nabbed that deal.

The only thing I didn't find was a bag for the snowshoes. They only seemed to have one option. I guess a trip to MEC on another day will fix that problem.",2014-01-02 15:03:36

It's located in the same plaza as Cathay house and noticeable when you turn in. Although we completely drove past it. Haha.

OFFERS: Make sure to check in on the yelp mobile app to get 25% off their yuzu soda (reg. price: $5). And to like them on facebook for 10% off your bill! 

You also get a stamp card IF you spend at least $10. You get a stamp every $10. Once you hit ten stamps, you get 10% off your bill. So if you hit $40 in one check, it's 4 stamps! Adds up quick even on one visit. This is the new stamp program as of my last visit 10/1/2013. Whew. So a lot of deals at Cafe de Japon! But trust me, you'll want the price reductions.

ATMOSPHERE: Intimate, feels a bit upscale, very quiet even with the low-volume j-pop in the background. Very clean. Low-lighting at night. Even the utensil-holders are cute. 

MAIN COURSE: I got the Hamburg Steak with demi-glace sauce with the full-size order at $12. Half-size is $6. Boyfriend got the curry with spice, karaage, hamburg steak, and corn. Also ordered the yuzu soda. Picture sliced citron (a type of lemon) with carbonation. Tastes fresh, came as a huge mug, but it's a little expensive. 

My hamburg steak was searing hot, flavorful, and served on a piping hot pan. Tasted home-cooked. Presentation very well-done arranged with baby carrots and potato slices. Came with a plate of rice. I couldn't get enough of the caramelized sauce melding with the steak. However, the portion was TINY. Came with two small patties of the hamburg steaks (to give you a visual idea, think $1 menu-size burger patties at mcdonalds, or maybe the size of 2 of the iphone 3GS) (sidenote: yes I still have an iphone 3GS SHUSH). Even my date laughed, ""good thing you got the full-size."" And even offered me some of his curry when he saw me scraping every bit of my plate. Gotta love the boyfriend. According to him, the curry was decent, although a bit small-portioned. Tasted homemade, but not out-of-the-ballpark great. 

DESSERT: The owner/chef was very accommodating. Very attentive, funny. Upon ordering dessert, we ordered just one cheesecake, when I remembered my tiny entree and I said, ""wait! make that two."" The chef teased, ""OK! Two! That way no fighting!"" Haha. They do have special daily dessert items not available everyday so be sure to ask for that! There's also a separate dessert menu.  

Strawberry Cheesecake was an explosion of flavor without being too sweet. Light, perfect contrast to our palate after entrees. The plate was a canvas of art with sliced strawberries and splashes of sauce. I almost didn't want to eat it. Very caring in the attention to plating. My boyfriend griped that it wasn't real cheesecake because they used feathery mascarpone cheese so he expected it to be more solid and cake-y. His opinion doesn't matter though :D (just kidding)

VERDICT: Delicious food with my only complaint being portion size. This place is definitely meant for you to order an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The real star was the dessert. I believe on his website stated that there were no freezers in his kitchen. Everything made fresh with incredible attention and precision. Although you might break the bank since it's pricey for portion, it's incredibly great quality food. We swear that we don't eat more than the average person, but we'd like to feel full from the main meal. It's a great place to treat someone out to for date night.

It was only the chef serving us the whole night between three tables! Call that multi-tasking. He held open the door for us when we went for the exit! Service very quick. Next time we'll drop in for the desserts and the coffee!

We came for an early lunch on a weekday so unfortunately my appetite wasn't quite ready to take on their famous fried chicken so early in the day. But i vow to return for dinner when I get the chance!

For lunch I was debating between the blueberry hotcakes and the sloppy joe. Since my friend ordered the hotcakes I ordered the sloppy joe and stole a few bites of hers. I must say, both of those were fantastic! I was super happy to visit a tv recommended restaurant and have them actually live up to the hype!

First, the sloppy joe. Had to use a knife and fork for this cause they were super generous with the sloppy part of the sloppy joe and it was physically impossible to eat this with my hands in sandwich format. I recommend getting this with the salad (what I did) rather than the home fries. Since the sloppy joe is so rich and flavourful, the added carbs would have been a bit too much. The light salad with a tangy vinaigrette was the perfect complement to the rich and savoury sloppy joe.

The hotcakes was also perfection. They were super generous with the blueberries used in the blueberry sauce and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Hotcakes were perfectly fluffy and the fresh whipped cream was the perfect way to top it all off. I may even suggest leaving the syrup off. In my opinion the blueberry sauce and whip cream alone were perfect. Syrup may make it too sweet.

Definitely will return to try dinner menu!",2015-06-12 16:00:48

My review:

Lady Diana's Cakes is fabulous!

We ordered a smaller, two tiered cake for our wedding and Juan and Lady Diana still gave us the attention and care as if we had ordered a huge cake with all the bells and whistles.

Juan was fantastic, I sent him a few ideas of the kinds of cake that we liked and he gave great feedback and completely embraced the elegant style that we were going for. A few days before the wedding Juan called me to ask about the ribbon color and without fail he produced the perfect match, at Lady Diana's Cakes they care about every detail!

We noticed something wonderfully peculiar about the cake when Juan delivered it to the venue....it was taller than we had ordered! Lady Diana took extra time and supplies to create a cake that was especially beautiful for us, a very sweet gesture that did not go unnoticed.

The cake was delicious red velvet with amazing icing, we were going to save the top tier for our anniversary...but it we couldn't help but eat it as soon as we got home from our mini honeymoon. Needless to say we'll be ordering a new small red velvet cake for our 1st anniversary :)

If you want something beautiful and delicious from someone who geniunely cares, Lady Diana's Cakes is the place to go.",2012-05-07 20:02:09

The patio wasn't open yet, so we sat inside in a very large, but comfortable booth. The outside patio is very spacious with clear lights wrapping around trees and iron posts and with its own bar tucked nicely into the corner.The inside bar area look sophisticated, but casual, and the lighting throughout the restaurant bar was dim and for some reason I couldn't help but be reminded slightly of Mabel's on Main.

The food was pretty tasty and while the prices aren't ridiculously high, I think they are a little overpriced. My friend ordered the calamari ($9) that came with a delicious spicy aioli dipping sauce. I wasn't a fan of the tempura fried calamari itself. I  felt like there was too much tempura that you couldn't taste the calamari. I ordered the poached pear bruschetta ($9) that was layered thick with soft bleu cheese and topped with garlic shreds. It was okay, I don't think I would order it again. My other friend ordered the Shaft Bleu burger ($14) that came with fries. The burger was a normal size, I didn't taste that, but the fries were deliciously crisp and fresh tasting that some other friends, due to the sampling, order a side all by themselves.

 Onto the drinks! Everyone was happy with their weapon of choice and we did not have any problems with drink preparation like some of the other Yelpers. Since Kelly's does not stock Hendrick's, I went for something different and chose their Strawberry Shamrock drink ($10). I quickly became addicted and highly recommend this beverage consisting of strawberry rum, cucumber vodka, muddled mint, sweet n sour, and soda water. My one friend tried the Moscow Mule (after handing over her ID for the server to keep so that she doesn't steal the copper mug that they serve it in - weird) and she also tried the Arizona Mule, which differs to the Moscow Mule due to the addition of grapefruit bitters and that it is served in a silver mug (but she didn't have to give her ID back to the server for that one). She recommends staying with the Moscow Mule.

The service was great, even with our large party. The bathrooms were clean, but small for the size of the restaurant. All in all, we would come back for drinks, but undecided about the food.",2013-01-10 17:18:19

During my previous stay, I had no issue with noise, and per my previous review, I probably contributed to the noise level during a singing game. However, on this stay, I was quiet as a mouse, and it was the weekend. It was loud, and on the first night I got perhaps 3 hours of sleep thanks to the non-stop street party, an arguing couple to my left and horse hoofs clomping around above me. On the second night, I discovered that cranking the A/C created white noise that blocked the raucous. 

There are also little things that make it a little less posh. For example, the lighting situation is minimal. If you want to read in bed, the bedside lighting is not ideal.

I told I her I wanted to sit at the bar so I could play. Shortly after, Molly came by and asked the same thing and I asked her to ""Please let me know when a machine was available"". Many people at the bar were not playing and any gaming bartender would have ""made room"" for someone who was trying to play. Molly came by again and asked if I wanted something while I was waiting, I finally ordered a beer. As I noticed a machine became available (not because someone told me) I moved to the bar. 

I started playing and finished my beer. I literally waited 8 minutes to get another beer but only because I finally flagged Rian down to ask for another. There were 3 bartenders and not once in 8 minutes did someone ask me if I wanted another drink. It was busy but not THAT busy. 

I asked for a menu, placed my order (to go) and it was brought out. I paid my tab and went home. In my bag was literally only my food, in a box. No napkins, utensils or anything!

We were warmly greeted at the front door when we came in by a staff member handing out menus and when we mentioned it was our first visit, she was happy to explain how the menu worked. It was pretty straight forward -- biscuits are the star but they have other breakfast items like omelets, grit bowls, etc. 

While ordering, there was some confusion about my coffee order. (Sugar free vanilla latte with almond milk. I suppose I'm asking for it with such a high maintenance order.) They weren't sure if they had a SF syrup, non-dairy option, etc. etc. Hubby and I asked for the lattes to go but they were brought out in ceramic mugs. They also only have 1 machine so it took a while to get the coffees in the first place. Once we figured everything out, our lattes cost us $12. Next time, I'll stick with water. 

We split two biscuits, the Chicken Holler (medium) and Pork Rambler. I was most looking forward to the chicken biscuit but ended up totally falling in love with the pork one. It comes with blackberry butter and fried onion straws. Such a lovely balance of sweet and savory! I had the fruit as my side but should have gotten the grits. I had total order envy watching Ted enjoy his cup of cheesy goodness. 

The friend that we were with asked for sliced avocado with her grit bowl and they charged her for it... But, after receiving guacamole instead, and working our way through a few VERY confused staff members, she was told they don't actually have sliced avocado. Makes me wonder where the guac comes from, but I digress. 

Again, overall this is a solid spot with really good food! Now that I know to just avoid ordering coffee to save on both time and money annnnnnd once the staff live through a few more weeks of service and learn the product, I think it'll become a go-to spot for us.

So we had business to attend to in the area, and I had heard they replaced the Eggsmart with a pretty decent dinner place.  I also knew they served brunch (from 9-4!), and it was 12:30, so I figured we'd walk by and see how crazy it is.  Because we all know that brunch places on a Sunday in Toronto can have line-ups out the door, even the not-so-good places.

All the pros:
- no line-up.  Lots of seats.
- had a Starbucks coffee in my hand. Asked if I should throw it out; server said of course not, keep it.  Big points.
- Quick, efficient, friendly, amazing service from our Ryan Philippe-look-alike server.  
- I ordered two dishes because I'm a glutton.  I had the grilled cheese - perfect bread, toasted perfect, three cheeses, perfect size.  I also had the chocolate banana bread french toast - with caramel sauce all over the place.  Served piping hot.  This was like the best thing ever, and I'm really not a sweet-brunch person.  I usually prefer savoury dishes.
- grapefruit mimosas or orange. Grapefruit went well for brunch.
- nice bathrooms
- great pricing - each dish $10-14.

- not next door to where I live

I've never eaten at a Wingstop before, but I'm all about some good wings with beer! 

The sign said open for business, so I stopped in to check it out. The aroma of the wings hits you as you enter in and because the place is so new [5 days old], the place has am immaculate look to it with the tables almost full of patrons who are eating or waiting for their order.

The cashier immediately says, ""Hi, welcome to Wingstop"" with enthusiasm. With a smile to match her energy, I did feel welcomed.

I let her know that I was just checking things out and without pushing products on me, she let me know that she was there to answer any questions if I had any.

The menu board was simple, not to complicated, and had quite a few flavor selections all menu items bundled with drinks and fries of different varieties.

I perused the menu and found something I would enjoy.

I ordered the 10 piece wings and had 2 choices of flavors. I chose garlic parmesan and BBQ wings.

I did not know that they came with a drink and side of fries. WOW! All for 11.99! Good deal! 

I placed my order and began walking around observing the dinging area. Lot's of seating, clean tables, and the patrons seem to be enjoying their meals.

I chatted it up with the cashiers and then eventually the manager asking if it was okay to take pictures for Yelp. He smiled and let me know that it was totally fine.

After receiving my order, which wasn't a very long wait at all, I headed home.

I couldn't wait to take a bite of the food and here's my assessment:

The wings, they were cooked just right, juicy and not drowning in butter garlic sauce or BBQ, plus I was given ranch dressing [You do get to choose your dipping sauces], The fries were soft, I prefer mine extra crispy but, that's my fault, I should've said something.

They Coke products but I did find a green tea that I enjoyed as it wasn't too sweet and so refreshing on such a hot day here in Las Vegas.

The customer service, the wait time for my food, and to biting into my wings seemed flawless and worth the wait.

I'm happy this place is now just down the street and is  another offering in the downtown Las Vegas area adding to the diversity of food to choose from if you're like me who resides in the area.

I'll be coming back again when I have them wing cravings! If you're in the Charleston/Maryland are, come stop in for a some good wings to enjoy!

As I couldn't really choose what I wanted, I kind of forced my friend to share his dishes with me. (LOL definitely the best way to taste more than one dish at a time!)

For the appetizer, I got the Kale Caesar Salad with Harissa-Spiced East Coast Shrimp, Dulse, Bannock Croutons. The dish wasn't too bad except that the dressing was a tad bit much. The shrimps were spiced nicely and had a great flavor to them. I also had a taste of the Black Barley & Piccalilli Salad with Sugar Beet Hummus, Rutabaga, and Dukkah Spice. The dish was very pretty and colourful, however the piccalilli was pretty overpowering. It had a great texture and it was definitely an interesting salad to have. 

For the main dish, I had the Gnocchi ""Fauxlognese"" - Meatless Mushroom Bolognese, Spinach and Thunder Oak Gouda. It was surprising really good. The flavor combination within this dish was absolutely beautiful. The gnocchi was nice and fluffy and the meatless mushroom Bolognese sauce was everything I wanted. I enjoyed this dish very much. I also had a taste of the Pressed Ontario Pork Shoulder with Simmered Cabbage, Northern Woods Mushrooms, Allspice Tomato Sugo. It wasn't exactly the greatest dish. The pork shoulder was nicely done however the cabbage seemed to overpower the taste of the pork shoulder. 
 
For the best part of the meal, dessert, I had the Cheesy Chocolate Cannoli. The chocolate peanut sauce was to die for. I could have honestly licked my plate if no one was watching (lol). When combined with the brittle and cream cheese I think I could have had this every day for dessert and not get sick of it. I also tried the Sticky Bannoffee Cake. The caramel was delicious but it wasn't anything special.

He always walks around the bar a few times and passes you by...once I get his attention I ask him for what I need, he then tells me he has 4 ppl before me...(so why listen to what I was asking for) he then continues to go back to help the ppl that tip him continuously that he already assisted.

I work in Hughes Center and have been pretty stoked to dine at this super posh off strip Latin inspired restaurant!

FOOD:
The Queso Bandito $8 arrived piping hot and amazingly delicious! Highly recommended starter.

Habanero Shrimp $22 When I read Habanero from the menu I was honestly expecting to exhale fire like a dragon but with some reassurance from our very informative server Natalie the Habanero was actually more savory and not spicy at all. (I was totally pleased) The shrimps are big and plentiful, the veggies were perfect and the tamale was flavorful. Moment of silence for the upscale presentation!!
 
Great wine selection (Cabernet) $11.00
La Pinata $11.00 perfectly crafted cocktail!! 

Serrano Brownie $8.00 was lick the plate clean worthy!

FREE GUAC W/ YELP C/I: Most of it slid right off the ""plate"" and overall wasn't worth the painful wait! 

The Fried Fish Tacos $21 Unsatisfactory dish! For such a bold restaurant I was expecting more flavor and regrettably, it was bland. I was uber excited to try the Mexican street corn and it was a total let-down!! Dry, equally bland and gross! The yelp pictures are deceiving or I wasn't lucky enough last night to get a good batch!

SERVICE: The service started sooo slow & literally took 25 minutes for guacamole. I had to remind my server and so did the nearby table before a gentleman finally delivered it. Another gentleman attempted to clear my queso off the table without even asking! Can you believe that? I gave him the evil eye instead of a piece of my mind. As a result he put it back down quickly!! There was plenty left (uncertain how he missed that). Natalie definitely recovered in the service area on behalf of her co-workers; which made my outdoor dining experience decent. Great restaurant concept but some employees lack confidence like it's their first day. Walking in circles and continually asking what we ordered became annoying after a long work day! 

$88+ tip 
Unsure if I'll return anytime soon and that feeling sucks because they are nearby my office.",2017-10-06 22:44:09

As the much beloved, highly anticipated QC restaurant week is off the starting gates, Sullivans is the first stop in this possible gout inducing road trip of gluttony that would make Henry the VIII envious. 

First impressions aren't much to gloat about. While calling for a reservation, I was told 8:45 was the next available spot. After having to confirm with my dinner mates, I had to wait on hold for ohhhh only a measly 7 or 8 minutes. Hmrph, lets try this again. Hung up and redialed, new person and now it's 8:30; uh okay that works, lets roll on out! 

Upon arrival, complimentary valet - not too shabby. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated so, ""please enjoy yourselves at the bar and listen to the live jazz band."" I can dig it, dirty martini time! At only $10 for house vodka, oh Sullivans you sly dog, I like you already. 

Bingo! Our names were called to be seated and after you wait for the hostesses to finish gossiping amongst themselves and finally seat you, the adventure begins. The dining room is lined with booths and a nifty library looking room adds to the Chicago, Dick Tracy-esque decor. The booths though, don't really sit 4 people comfortably. 

Since it's restaurant week, the $30 meal is offered along with a ""Summer of '69"" for two which has slightly different options and two sides. Apparently its offered all summer and cost $69, heh go figure. 

Summer of 69 it is, with asparagus and crab fried rice as sides. While the crab fried rice is pretty tasty, the asparagus was itsy bitsy, teeny tiny. Salmon is pretty tasty and very buttery - meaning good salmon. 

Now, on to my carnivorous inner caveman. The filet; I loved it, but am upset at the chef. The steak itself was way too heavily over salted. Once you cut through the Bonneville Salt Flat crust though, what a mighty fine, tender, flavorful piece of meat. The key lime pie for dessert wasn't key to the meal, but was limey.

Service was great, the waiter was on top of his game and while the overall meal wasn't top notch, Sullivans is pretty smooth. Since it's a slightly cheaper date, I hope to visit more often. I just hope next time the chef doesn't take out his pent up frustration on the salt shaker.",2010-07-23 21:06:51

SALADS: I love their salad! Good presentation. Lots of everything. Last time, I had the grilled chicken caesar salad and this time I had the buffalo chicken salad. It was great both times. It filled me up and they make their ranch in house from what they told me.

JALAPENO POPPERS: I would not recommend their jalapeno poppers! They were filled with cheese whiz, YUCK. The jalapeno itself had no flavor but I can say I enjoyed the breading even though it was a little burnt.

CANNOLIS: Thumbs up their cannolis! Maybe it's just I've always had a bad experience with cannolis. They were super fresh and not a bad price for 3.

I stood in line for 20 minutes.  And then 30.  At this point I decided I couldn't leave because I had invested this much time.  The total wait time was nearly an hour and a half.  Who cares about losing a toe to frostbite?  The place was crawling with hipsters, suburbanites, children and dogs.  I was late for work.  Would I do it again?  Probably.  But I'd probably try to get there earlier....or wake up on a weekday when there probably isn't a line.  

But the tacos ranged from good to amazing for me.  My favorite was definitely the Beer Braised Pork with Pineapple Salsa.  I also enjoyed the Jerk Chicken with Avocado Cream.  The basic taco, called the Americano, with beef, cheddar and homemade salsa was also not bad.  I can't wait to try more.

It's worth following PGH Taco Truck on Facebook or Twitter because the menu is always changing and daily options are always posted (as well as current locations).

First things first, we went on a Monday night, at 7 o'clock and the electronic/techno music was so very loud that we sat at the table closest to the door in hopes it would be somewhat muted. Not so much. They even turned it up at one point and we were literally two out of, oh, five customers in the joint. There was no dance party goin' on. Seemed to me like they were trying to take a page out of Nikko's book, but there is a reason (actually, several) that I avoid that place at all costs. I like to be able to hear my husband talk and not watch him wince as he tries to eat sushi while his head throbs with pulsing bass. Our service was average, and since business was slow, we got lots and lots of walk-bys from the rest of the waitstaff and managers. Hovering is the best way I can describe it. I am a server myself, so I get the sometimes uncontrollable desire to harass your tables with attention when it's slow, but this kinda felt more like they were watching to see if we were going to steal the chopsticks.

On to the food. We shared two sushi rolls, the standard Dragon and Caterpillar. He likes eel, I like soft shell crab, so it's the usual for us. Both were decent and nicely presented, no complaints. We also had shrimp, pineapple, and cashew fried rice and the portion size was huge. Definitely enough to share, although hubby would have gladly put it down by himself I think. This was, of course, after we both added a generous amount of Siracha, as the dish was pretty much bland without it. It was listed as a ""Thai"" dish on the menu, so I think we both expected some heat, but it was missing. The rice and shrimp, however, were both perfectly cooked. A little bit of regional cuisine confusion on the giant menu was the downfall here, I think.

We both had bellinis that were on special and they were pretty lackluster. The drink specials catered more to the party crowd (like the music) with stuff like sake bombs and red bull and vodka being featured instead of more dinner-friendly options like wine or beer.

For the record, my review is 2.5 stars. I want to like this place and will go back to try some other things....just probably from the take-out menu this time.",2011-05-03 19:39:11

I love Caprese Salad and they do it well here.  It's a hearty serving, so be sure to share otherwise you could be blowing your appetite with this appetizer alone.  The Pasta dishes were very good, but I thought there was too much Sauce and it overwhelmed the dish.  As you can see in the photos, it was pretty Sauce-y.  Good flavor though.  The Meatballs were excellent.

Average price for a glass of Wine @ $10 per for Chianti.

Beckett's Table has been buzzing away since opening in the old That's Italiano space late last year. I've tried so many times to get in but for whatever reason or another didn't make it. Well finally made it in and I have to say, I wish I hadn't been so damn fashionably late. 

A couple of notable thing, the space is killer, rustic-industrial and second, the waiters are hot, especially our beefy ginger waiter Scott, Sam, hmm, maybe Bill? Anyway I can't remember his name but what I do remember was his attention to detail and service. Looking around you can see that all the servers were attentive and helpful to all their guests. I'm just a sucker for a beard, I mean great service. 

In case you're wondering who Beckett is, the name refers to local Chef Justin Beckett. The man has got some chops and has nothing to hide in his open kitchen. I love open kitchens, I think its an honest way of sharing how clean and organized a well lubed kitchen works, in other words the orders slid in and out with total ease. The menu is made up mainly of meat + starch with a few flare items that while are mostly comforting, shows the levels of sophistication, especially for a neighborhood kind of restaurant. 

At first glance the Country Paté ($12) seemed to be overwhelmed with way to many accompaniments. I'm a mustard and bread only kind of guy, but after trying each delicate bite with a different topping it all made sense. Each component is representative of a different tasting experience. Vinegary whole grain mustard is completely different than sun dried tomato making for an interesting and interactive experience. 

Another surprise appetizer was the Creamy Grits & Schreiner's Sausage Trio ($9). I generally avoid grits simply because I've never really had them made well, though Beckett's version is as advertised, creamy and delicious. You can never go wrong with Schreiner's sausages, simply the best as far as I'm concerned. The only real let down was the Grilled Cheese ($9) served with bacon, four cheeses and roasted red pepper tomato soup. Every component was good except that main one, the bread, which was dry and not very tasty which made the entire dish unravel. 

Entrees were meat-centric starting with the oh-so-tender Osso Buco ($18). A pork shank braised in its own fat was melting tender, served atop butternut spaetzle and pepper reduction. The braising continues with fork tender Short Ribs ($19) that were big and beefier in flavor thanks to a red wine and herb reduction.

What's a great way to round of such a rich meal? How about a slab of Fig and Pecan Pie ($6)? The sweetness really cuts through the richness from so many savory items. If you're still in the mood for unique, try the hands on Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'mores ($6). Yes, you read it right, slices of thick cut bacon that have been enrobed in chocolate. Once over the novelty, you realize that it's far too messy to finish.

I think the party at Beckett's is only getting started.",2011-05-01 19:32:28

frB7z3XfWF502UI7I1-yeQ,hoCTR-aiEcRJT8asMVKu0w,1E1je_htFWU-CCcCRqGcHQ,3,0,0,0,"Alrighty, I live on an Orbit route and I've taken this bus a good 5 or 6 times now, so I think I'm ready for an objective review here.

The pros:
- It's free (well, if you forget about those pesky taxes)
- The bus goes from right in front of my house to ASU and Mill Ave.
- The buses come frequently enough that no schedule is needed (they say every 15 minutes, but maybe even more frequent)
- The buses seem to be thoroughly cleaned every night

In fact, there seems to be only one problem with the Orbit bus, the same problem that all public transportation suffers from: riff raff. Between the panhandler, the loud douchebag on the cell phone, the stinky 10:00AM drunk in the next seat over, the town square preacher that decided a bus would be an even better place to practice his craft, and the scary crazy guy who was having a fevered argument with nobody, I haven't really been on a ride that I would describe as 'pleasant' yet.

Oh, and one more thing, since these buses all seem to lead through downtown Tempe, it would be nice if they ran later than 10PM. I know it doesn't draw as much revenue as a DUI arrest, but if the city of Tempe was really serious about getting people off the road when they drink, this would be an easy win.",2008-01-24 05:06:26

Service was on point and friendly (word on the street is they hijacked 80% of Houlihan's staff). Their beers were solid, too. I couldn't get the Yelp App to check me in so I could upload my pic of the tastiest stout I've ever had, so you are just going to have to trust me on its delicousity. I tried a taster (4oz for $1.50) of their berry weiss beer and it was a little too much berry for me, but if you like that kind of thing, you will love Destihl's take on it: the flavors of sweet and tart bounce back and forth dynamically as you sip. A companion loved their IPA, lauding the freshness and the spicyness of the hops.

The food is as good as anywhere else downtown. My table ordered the portabello sandwich which was really hearty and came with kettle chips with a touch of seasoning and Destihl's Kobe burger, which is served on a fancy bun I did non recognize and stacked with thick jalepeno bacon, bleu and white chedar cheeses, pickles, and comes with the best steak fries I've ever tasted. That burger is about the same price as Farren's and the verdict was it was just as good, if not better, owing to the extra special toppings. Destihl's fries are thick badasses with the skin on and huge flecks of kosher or sea salt and were both perfectly crispy and cooked the whole way thru. Those are served with their balsamic vinegar (and expresso bean?) barbecue sauce that is unlike any I've ever had. As good as the kettle chips are, I highly recommend you sub in for the steak fries (though I saw some gorgeous piles of sexy shoestring fries served with other dishes, giving me one more reason for a quick return).

Another reason for a quick return is the very impressive menu. Vegetarian will have no problem here, nor will the health-concious. They have a wide and deep menu spanning from American classic pub fare to trendy fusion dishes usually found only in more expensive restaurants. Prices were not exceedingly low, however value is good. I did not see their spirits or wine menus, but the lineup behind the bar bodes well for those not in the mood for beer.

Service started out ok but that went downhill as time went on.
I had ordered a pasta veggie dish with Salmon.  No sauce whatsoever, very dry, the pasta was not even close to being done, and the very small piece of salmon was cooked WELL DONE!   Another person at the table sent his food back because it arrived COLD!  

Here is the best part.....when our 2 dishes were returned the server brought my dish and another lady brought the gentlemen's plate.  She apologized to him about the cold food and offered to buy him another drink.  Very nice.  Then she walked away and didn't even make eye contact with me....like I didn't have a problem too!  We were all dumbfounded.  I guess he was pretty cute and his cold food was more important than my dry, tasteless dish.

The filet that was ordered at the table was fabulous.  Well seasoned and cooked to perfection, but the steak, broccollini and potatoes all fit in 1/3 of the plate....all for $32.

My wife is a recent graduate of their Skin Therapy school, so, as a supportive spouse, I've spent a little time here having treatments done. Having never been to a skin therapist in the past, I can't really compare the prices here versus at a spa out in the real world. However, according to my wife (and every woman I've ever talked to about this), the value you get by having treatments done at the Academy is nothing short of phenomenal.

Just before my wife graduated, I told her I was going to get a haircut at my usual place. She reminded me (oh so subtly), ""Hey, dummy! My school also cuts hair."" The thought had never really occurred to me to have my hair cut at a beauty school. I always knew these students needed practice, it just never occurred to me to have them practice on MY hair.

Now, I'm somewhat particular about my hair and overall appearance. Nothing on a ""Narcissus"" level, but, still. So, when I agreed to come in to let a rookie hack away at my head, it was definitely a pride swallowing, fear facing decision. Compounding my fear was the fact that the student I drew from the pool openly admitted that she was not 100% comfortable with performing men's haircuts yet.

Well, it was time for me to change proverbial hats for a few minutes. I was faced with the decision to either be my usual proud self, and completely destroy this young lady's nerves with added pressure, or I could take a deep breath, remember that hair grows back, and put the young stylist at ease.

That decision turned out to be a great one. Once I sat down, I was sure to keep the conversation light, and make sure that the stylist was as comfortable as she could be. After all, one of the many mantra's by which I try to live is ""Time, Patience, Practice"". I know this young lady wasn't likely to have nerves of steel out of the gate. But, the more she does it, the better she will ultimately become.

Ultimately, she did a pretty good job. After she settled down a little bit, everything went quite smoothly. The only true downside to the whole process was, of course, the duration of the process. Being students, the stylists have to consult with their educators before they make ANY decision. So, if  you're in the salon on a busy day, your cut could take quite some time. I ended up in the chair for about an hour.

Like I said, this is practice for these young students. So, if you're SUPER particular about your hair, then this is not the place for you. If you're adventurous and you have a little bit of time to spare, then you would enjoy the overall experience you get from throwing caution to the wind and allowing a young up-and-comer the opportunity to show you what they've got!",2013-04-22 16:29:15

LOVE the look of the dining room. LOVE how the ""warehouse"" ceilings are very high.  This place just looks so cool inside.  The bar is to the left and had people staged there and there are couches to just hang out with your drink.  The kitchen is open so you can see the cooks back there.  If your looking for an aesthetically eye-pleasing spot- go here.
Service was great, our server was knowledgeable on the menu and ingredients, waters kept being refilled, and our table was checked on throughout the meal.  We started with the shrimp and grits app. (very good 5 decent shrimps), I ordered the mahi, and Mal ordered the chicken.  We both ordered a cocktail as well and those were VERY strong! My fish was a pretty large piece and had some horseradish sauce on top (meh- coulda done without it or at least on the side.)  The fish was cooked very well and I enjoyed it.  Mallory's chicken was a huge piece of like a breast, thigh, and mini-wing attached.  It looked so juicy!  She said it was very good and I got to try a piece and it was great.  The sides are a la carte so we chose mashed potatoes, and the cauliflower.  The cauliflower was really good and seasoned with lemon and other spices.  The mashed potatoes was blended so much it was almost soup.  I've had better potatoes. bill was 107.00 for the two of us. The meal was good and the place was very trendy.

We opted for cocktails in the lounge upon arrival and enjoyed very delicious concoctions ( mine made with cognac.. Yum!) and we were also treated very well be the front door host team.

Dinner was a cut above. Exceptional. We were even given the opportunity to meet the new Chef de Cuisine, who came out to check on us and see if we were having a good Anniversary! What a special treat! Highlights from our three course meal included:

-Oysters: simple, clean, effective with great sauces to employ.

-Lobster Spoons!!!! Great buttery taste, super soft (not chewy) texture.

-CDN Prime Ribeye!! Succulent, perfectly grilled to MR, even the fat was delicious because we ate the whole thing. Cheers to the cook who executed this delicious steak.

The server and Maitre 'd were very pleasant and the Maitre 'd helped us select a killer bottle of Sonoma Cabernet to compliment our meal. Prices are on the higher side, but for a special occasion, this place was definitely worth every penny. Highly recommended for romantic dinners, business/client evenings, or family suppers.

I also really enjoyed Ciao, the restaurant sharing the same owners as Cibo that previously operated in the same space. This particular evening, I dined with 3 girlfriends.

I ordered the gnocchi, which I have previously had at both other locations. The tomato sauce had absolutely no taste. Another one of my friends also ordered a dish with the tomato sauce and agreed. We immediately notified the waitress. She offered to bring us chili oil. Never did she offer to let us order a new dish or to remake our meals. Instead she said ""I've been hearing complaints from other tables too."" The waitress also told my friend that her food might not taste good because of alterations (she had not even made any to the menu-item but not professional to argue with the customer). She also never offered to let us speak to a manager. Her attempted resolution was highly unprofessional and inadequate (especially if other tables had voiced a similar concern).

At the end of the meal, we asked to speak to the manager (we were hopeful that the waitress would have been told the manager to visit our table after 2/4 of us complained but clearly this was wishful thinking). We shared our experience with her and she said she would ""take care of it"". We assumed we all got a free meal as is generally the outcome when more than one person is unhappy with their meal. She didn't charge my friend and I for our meals. I thought it was so tacky that they charged the other two guests. Even though they were satisfied with their meals, our dissatisfaction and complaining impacted their dining experience. The manager was hardly apologetic. Before we were able to get 2/4 meals comped, she offered us dessert ... not really enough considering how awful the food was.

We showed up on time for a 7:00pm reservation and were told they overbooked and we would have to wait. We headed to the bar where I had to flag someone down for a wine list. When our table was ready (not a huge wait thankfully) we were escorted to our small table packed in the middle of two rows of booths. Being able to hear conversations quite clearly all around us did not provide the atmosphere of ""nice steak dinner"". 

The Caesar salad that we both got was large, and had too much dressing for my taste, and the croutons were chewy like they weren't cooked long enough. My filet medallions were cooked as ordered but the steak lacked anything to recommend it. The horseradish potatoes had a very strong flavor that overpowered the steak. The end of the meal was the best part - my chocolate mousse was delicious but the boyfriend said his cheesecake was lackluster.  

Even with the special restaurant week pricing the meal wasn't well priced enough for the quality of food we ordered. The restaurant was dimly lit and felt completely packed.

Well when they actually have bud light it is either stale or it tastes like absolute crap. If you run a bar this should never happen.

In January we had to take the iMac back to replace the hard drive they had put in last April, it took several days to get a diagnosis and then they wanted me to pay for a new hard drive. Finally I was able to talk with a manager who took care of it and replaced it under the warranty and had it back to me within a few days. Total time was ridiculous though, and I shouldn't have had to fight to get it done when they replaced it less than a year before. 

Initially at my January visit they thought it my be my video card, I was told because it's a 2011 iMac that would be replaced under an Apple Recall exchange at no charge. It wasn't my video card then and now 3 months later (with a lot of the same issues) it seems it is the video card and suddenly that recall doesn't extend to me and I need to pay to have it replaced. Dropped off Sunday was told I'd have an answer by Monday afternoon, didn't hear back until Tuesday afternoon when someone called me while the tech was allegedly on the phone with Apple, and then suddenly told no.  

Now I'm waiting back on a call from the manager to explain to me why 3 months means I no longer am eligible for the recall replacement of my video card.

Sadly I would no longer recommend these guys and won't buy my new machine with them. It's sad. I really prefer to support local businesses when I can, and this was such a great experience to start but it seems the last year or two has changed a lot within the company because it's no longer the same place I first purchased from in 2013.

Picked up my machine and brought it back to my office, chatted with Apple Care for about 10 minutes and exception was made and they're covering it 100%.

Looking to up the ante in Chinatown with a spotless dining space plus a tea collection set to leave even The Strip's formal fine dining spaces in the dust, Niu Gu from Chef Jimmy Li has been quietly making noise amongst Las Vegas most in-the-know diners, a Saturday evening visit showing signs of something special happening even though there remains some room to grow.

Actually open since the late 3rd quarter of 2015, but undergoing upgrades since the start of March through consultation with local beer and wine aficionado Joe Muscaglione, Niu Gu has recently dropped ""Noodle House"" from its name in favor of becoming a full-fledged Asian Kitchen, the menu not one of those hundred-item hodgepodges intended to please universally but instead focused on freshly made plates comprised of only the finest components, even the wok-fried items taking the time to individually cook ingredients one-by-one.

Taking service far more seriously than the rest of the restaurants on Jones, an important thing to note considering the fact that the same plaza contains China Mama, Chada Thai and Hachi Japanese Yakatori plus several more, those arriving at Niu Gu are greeted professionally at the podium before being led to seats, the space itself literally gleaming from the recently decorated walls right down to the bathroom floor.

Admitting a friendship with Mr. Muscaglione that includes several meals across The Valley, it was with menu deferred to he and the chef that the evening soon got started, an impassioned discussion of the teas followed by Organic Housemade Tofu topped tableside with Scallion Oil plus Crab and Tofu Soup that ate something like Egg-Drop with far more flavor, each bite smooth yet complex and compelling enough to want just another spoonful...and then ""just"" one more.

Presenting plates slowly, partially due to the presence of other tables but also so that our four-top could focus on flavors individually as well as when paired with tea, course two offered thinly sliced Beef Tongue marinated in soy, onions and peppers, the texture like velvet beneath poignant heat while ""Fresh Seafood Salad"" was unfortunately a bit sweeter than necessary, the plethora of berries unfortunately overwhelming the cream-coated Lobster meat.

Shocking me with the quality of a plump Oyster, the lightly steamed Bivalve bursting with brine atop a bed of shredded Daikon as Garlicky broth stewed beneath, a plate of spicy Asian Cucumber proved a refreshing bridge to bolder flavors, the Double Chili Shrimp deveined and delegged with shell split for peeling, though the better choice was eating them crispy with the carapace still in place.

Taking a Sichuan Spin on Lamb, the meaty Rack divided tableside by Joe with just enough time on the fire to render fat clear without turning the meat from pink, Niu Gu's namesake Slow Roasted Short Rib was served up simultaneously, those opting for only one left to a tough choice as to which is better since each would undoubtedly top my list of ""Must Haves.""

Seeing it unfit to leave without trying Li's Noodles, in this case a classic Beef broth served chock-full of tender meat and baby Bok Choy with just enough spice to tingle without burning up the mouth, Chinese Yam Stir-Fry with Black Fungus was an elegant vegetarian dish for those opting for milder flavors, the deep fried Bao served as a side dish apparently common in some parts of China and delicious with a sidecar of lightly sweetened mayo.

Still; a work in progress as relates to dessert, the Taro Milk and Fruit certainly pleasant but actually less sweet than the Seafood Salad or the Bao, dinner ended with long discussion as ambient Asian music mixed with 80's Pop-Standards, ""More Than Words"" by Extreme playing its third spin of the evening but mostly ignorable in the face of ""Monkey Picked"" Oolong with dramatic floral notes an almost buttery feel on the tongue.

****  Still a work in progress, the lack of liquor license notable while the dessert menu is perhaps a larger concern for me than others in town, Niu Gu represents a wholesale shift in culture for the restaurants on South Jones and Spring Mountain, Li's cooking and Muscaglione's guidance seemingly ready to go 'all-in' with an Strip-rivaling yet accessible Chinese Fine Dining approach.",2016-03-22 19:53:26

Greek is one of my favorite cuisines since I grew up with gyros, tzatziki, baklava, etc and it can be tough to please (though I don't consider myself an authority on the matter). Either way, I really enjoyed The Great Greek and I just wish it weren't so far away!

I started with Avgolemono ($3.50), a traditional Greek soup made with simple ingredients - chicken broth, egg, lemon, and rice. I had to try The Great Greek Gyros ($7.95): beef & lamb (the other choice is chicken), lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta cheese, and tzatziki all stuffed into a folded fluffy pita. I also ordered a side of Feta Fries ($3).

Side note: You can add Feta Fries and a fountain drink to your sandwich for $3.45. All other combinations (regular fries, rice pilaf, Avgolemono, or Greek salad) plus the fountain drink is just $2.95. I'm not sure how much a drink costs separately, but this is still a great deal!

Gyro is actually the traditional preparation of meat on the iconic vertical spit, but we associate the name with sandwiches since it is typically served as that. Although not the traditional choice of meat in Greece (it's pork), there is a 50-50 combination of beef and lamb that we have come to love in America (also dubbed gyro meat). At least I love it. It's so good. I don't even care that it doesn't resemble either animal or that it falls apart easily. It's delicious. Good Beef & Lamb: Roasted appropriately with a bit of juice, some crust doesn't hurt (yum), and cut about a centimeter thick. 

Although their gyro meat didn't have a crust, it was still delicious. I loved the fresh tomato, onion, lettuce, feta, and refreshing tzatziki. The pita was nice as well. The soup was tasty and they generously served a whole pita with it (cut into four slices). The Feta Fries were good, but not amazing. Either way, fabulous meal and good prices! I will definitely try some of their other Greek specialties next time.",2014-04-05 00:06:30

The TSO is also making admirable efforts to keep classical music alive for ""youngsters"" like me; they have a ""tsoundcheck"" program that allows access to cheap seats for the under-thirty crowd. Even the regular prices for tickets are comparable to the stadium-rock-style stuff that comes to the ACC, only the music (and the audiophile atmosphere) is infinitely better.",2008-09-13 18:08:26

I decided to try the pulled chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese. The chicken had great flavor (a little dry) but was perfect with BBQ sauce. They have self serve options of sweet or spicy BBQ sauce. The Mac n cheese was also good! It could've used a touch more flavor but other than that, good. The staff was very friendly...one of them even came around to ask how everything was and thanked me for coming in.",2018-08-28 21:30:50

From what I gather, the menu changes often and erratically so my review may not actually help you pick what to order. That being said, I've already started writing so here goes.

They did a squid ink dish with fish that really blew me out of the water. Also, the fish and chips is very, very good. The fall spice pork belly lettuce wraps didn't really impress me, but the other items more than made up for it.

Instead of dessert, I supplemented my meal by ordering a ""raw bar"" dish. It consisted of a few different creative takes on sushi (a fish salad, a few basic nigiris, and a ""deconstructed"" maki roll). This was pricey but extremely clever.

Avenue B seems oddly out of place, stationed in some random road in the 'burbs of Friendship. I applaud restaurant owners for striking out like this, bringing creative food to quiet areas that otherwise might be restricted to chain sandwich restaurants.",2014-01-06 12:37:21

We made a reservation and were seated right away when we arrived even though they were very busy. Our server greeted us promptly and walked us through the menu. Appetizers we enjoyed the Goat Cheese, although the ratio of toast points to dipping sauce was way off. The seared ahi tuna was amazing and the Wasabi sauce provided the right vibrant kick to help with the fall sinuses. For dinner, Lamb Chops with Creamy mashed potatoes and 
Halibut on a bed of  sautéed spinach and potato cake. Both were truly exceptional. The Lamb Chops has the right amount of char to activate the wonderful marrow flavor into the meat and of course the red wine reduction was a perfect compliment. The Halibut was perfectly cooked and flaky, and all components were plated with a nice ratio to provide a balanced bite every time.  The one fail of our Dressler culinary journey would have to be the Key Lime pie, or rather tart. The crust lacked flavor and the whipped cream lacked any really body. Although the filling was bright and crisp it was way to thin in comparison to the crust. The overall pie had a refrigerated stale taste that could not be overlooked. 

Overall a fantastic experience with both food and service and we were not made to feel rushed, rather we felt like invited guests... I will look forward to this on my next trip home.",2017-11-23 22:44:58

We ordered: 
Fried rice $4
Vegetable dumplings $3 (weird texture with the edamame in there)
Spicy yellow tail roll $3 
Eel and avocado roll $3.50 
Shrimp tempura roll $4

2 Sake with 2 Saporro. $8 
1 shot of strawberry infused sake. $4

What I like most about this particular spot is their outstanding selection and the fact that they seem to keep everything well stocked, but also the fact that they seem to get in some oddball plants that you just don't find elsewhere (including other SummerWinds!)

For instance, I've picked up some great agave here, including some large specimens of A. americana striata, A. xylonacanantha 'Frost Bite', A. 'Red Margin', A. ""Neptune's Spear"", all of which you'd be be hard pressed to find in cultivation elsewhere. They've also had some beautiful A. ovatifolia 'Frosty Blue', and a few varieties of A. attenuata, including some of the harder to find variegated forms, again, not commonly seen.

I've also found a really nice variety of dyckia plants, well priced for their size and not something I've seen anywhere else. These do quite well out here in the desert, provided some modest amount of water, so it's surprising more places don't carry them. 

Additionally, they are well stocked on soil and amendments, and I've been able to grab my much needed bags of pumice stone every time I came looking for it. Other locations seem to run out and take forever to restock, but not this one. 

Last but not least, I must say the people at this location are some of the friendliest of any SummerWinds I've been to. Always courteous, always asking if they can help, but never pushy or bothersome. My only gripe is the drive, but I can hardly fault them for that. If you're in the area, this place is definitely worth a stop.",2016-09-11 18:53:21

""I am the only one here,"" says the E-Z Rent dude. 

Ah, fuck I think. This won't be good.

The gentleman left because I am sure he did not find it conducive to his Vegas vacay to spend a night in lockup. 

This is where there E-Z Rent dude informs me that there are no cars. It is 1AM. No cars? 1AM Thursday night, Friday morning. Zero cars? 

At least neighbouring Payless had the decency to offer me a mini-van the week prior when they did not have my car (and that reservation was not even pre-paid). At least they feigned the effort to lube me up. No cars? I have a pre-paid reservation, asshole. I paid for a car. You took money out of my account.
