The place was almost empty, it was getting late. Service was acceptable, not sure if management has changed or not over the years. 

Pros - Cajun calamari - Seemed like it was re-heated in an oven as the tops were burned. Calamari should be fried and served immediately. 
           Proscuitto arugula - Tasted great. They didn't pre-slice the pizza, I was expecting the pizza to be pre-sliced.  
          Cannaloni - Came with 3 rolls, tasted great. 

Cons - Management has not responded to the bad reviews on Yelp. 
           They seem to be busy with their takeout service. 
           We asked for water and didn't give us any water glasses, we just drank the water from the wine glasses lol! When a customer asks for water, the server should offer the proper glassware.  
           An owner or manager or someone should really address these concerns, they have closed their Thornhill and the  Boutique location already. 

Protip - The entrance is on Blue Jays Way, the address on Yelp is incorrect. Will try and update this.  

Damage - $51 before tip.",2016-09-16 19:30:33

This is not a restaurant you go to for new flavor combinations or innovative meals.  This is where you go to get something familiar and leave with a full belly.    The service was ok, pretty much what you'd expect. I was a bit perturbed that our bread basket had an empty butter thing in it.  It's just those little things that make you wonder if you will return in the near future.

My scrambled eggs and French toast were exactly what I expected. I did appreciate that the French toast was not burnt at all.  My husband ordered fried chicken and he ate it all so I guess it was good.  

Again, food and service were fine if you want standard American fare. But I'd probably return to another similar restaurant simply due to some service and atmospheric issues.",2015-07-26 18:06:48

Chicken shawerma...

Sorry, I may have gotten a little distracted there.

Every time I think of Haji Baba I think of three things: their chicken shawerma plate (which is to die for, as in, I would throw myself in the path of a bullet if it meant I could get some), their delicious lemonade, and the store that's attached to the restaurant which always has new discoveries.

I don't get to go here that often since it's a little far away, and until recently the light rail construction traffic made getting there a pain. But when I do I get that chicken shawerma and I tell myself I can eat all of it. Then I eat half of it and box the rest of it up and have a delicious lunch the next day.

This is one of the least expensive places to get your buzz on in Scottsdale. The crowd seemed to be mainly locals - though a few outsiders (like me) have figured it out. The lights are low and the decor is very dated (perfect).

It isn't as crowded as the location on Spring Mountain, which is fine by me because I hate crowds and fighting for parking. The shop itself it quaint and clean. Thank goodness they don't blast loud music because I can't stand when places do that. The employees are friendly and don't try to rush you out the door. Their drinks are pretty solid too. They do use powders to flavor their drinks, but it doesn't taste fake like other boba joints I've been to. Their boba is just the right amount of chewiness and doesn't get hard in the cold drink. You are able to customize your sweetness and ice levels. My faves are the taro slush and any of the milk teas. And I'm super stoked that they finally have Thai tea available now!!

_-v28pxVBzAVFkuhB1tngg,mIysRk_cJ5K_BMZ-r06TFw,j25iicjhCYo3aH7VobV39A,5,13,9,9,"I don't write a lot of Yelp reviews these days. But without wanting to point any fingers, I just saw a review of the Preserve that complains about not seeing any animals, that both cracked me up and kind of made me mad, prompting this review. Who goes on a hike to ""see animals,"" and then complains that none were seen on that ONE hike? That's... kind of weird. 

For what it's worth, I saw a pack of 6 mule deer (including several fawns) in the Preserve just a few days ago. I've seen deer on multiple occasions in fact. I saw a rare desert tortoise too, sitting right on the Windgate Pass Trail one day. I spotted a coachwhip snake earlier this summer. After a lifetime of Arizona hiking, I didn't even know what that was until I photographed and ID'd it later! The deeper you go in to the Preserve, the more delicious the views of the McDowell Mountains are, wildlife or not. And the more often you go on any hike in general, the more likely you are to see wildlife. During my extensive jaunts into the wilderness, though, it hasn't occurred to me to actually expect to see wildlife. And then complain about a trail or a park if I don't. That's kind of what zoos are for. 

The McDowells, for those who haven't really explored this mountain range, are nothing short of delicious. The Gateway Loop Trail is a good but fairly popular (and therefore crowded) trail that's an introduction to this beautiful mountain range. But you have to dig deeper to savor it, especially if you're trying to get away from views of the city and residential areas (not possible at Camelback or Piestewa, of course). If you hike all the way up to Windgate Pass, you will be rewarded with spectacular views of the Superstition Mountains, and Four Peaks specifically, to your east, overlooking the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation and the Tonto National Forest. The hike up to Tom's Thumb is an intense calorie-burner, which is great by itself. But I've hiked well beyond the Thumb and down into the ""back country"" (for lack of a better term), and it's hard to describe the isolated awesomeness of that area. 

If you hike this area expecting a zoo/gym combo experience, I guess you'd be disappointed. But then, I guess you'd be disappointed with 100% of the American outdoors. Why are you looking for hiking trails again? If it's to actually hike, you won't complain. Happy trails.",2014-10-08 23:50:48

Bonnie Springs came about long ago when a well-to-do New Yorker fell in love with a western belle named Bonnie who just loved the ol' cowboy times.  He loved her so much that he bought her a huge ranch and bought up any and all old ghost towns and antiques he could find and built her, her own wild west town.

It has been a treasured place for all of Las Vegas for years.  You can enjoy it if your young or decrepit.  It's not so far out into the RedRock canyon and the mountain view is majestic as all Hell.  You will find an entrance to what looks like an old miner town.  Buy your tickets here and see the live cowboy shows.  Explore the long lost era in a semi-cheesy retro amusement park way.  A wax museum, shoot'n gallery, old mill, little white chapel, saloon, school house, ""old mine"" and a small pastime museum can all be experienced in this town.  The entrance to the petting zoo is accessed through one of the trading posts.

The petting zoo is uber neat!  Here you will encounter a Canadian lynx, wallabies, llama, wolf, porcupine, reindeer, donkeys, miniature horses and such along with the usual chickens, goats pot bellies, etc. roaming petting zoo assortment.  The zoo is a swarm of activity that's both fun & quirky even if you've been to a billion petting zoo's.  I used to board my black Percheron draft horse at the stables in the back.  Greatest experience ever.  Exit through the town and you can take a ride on Bonnies train.  What a complete package so far, huh?

After the train ride you can head to the south and see an old pond with turtles and ducks.  behind is the pony rides and a few steer pens.  *Walk into the bar and have a few MEGA STRONG Long Island Iced Tea's* or just have a beer.  Hang out by the fire pit (in the winter) and get a bite of some cowboy grub.  Food is rather good and not pricey for being out of town.  Buffalo Bison burgers, corn fritters (so bomb!) steaks, bbq ribs and the like.  What would you expect if you were at an old west town?  4 star?  Come on, this isn't the strip and it isn't a resort casino.  Sometimes you see ol' miss Bonnie come to the restaurant and visit still.  

I am a fan of Bonnie Springs and have been way before I had my kids.  Now I'm happy that this place is still around for my little clones to enjoy too!  Even If you aren't a fan of cowboy movies, I bet you would still have a gay olde time.  hehe",2014-07-10 18:00:53

I had the tandoori chicken wings as my app - didn't enjoy it all too much - it wasn't the traditional red, BBQ charred colour or taste I expected. Instead it was yellowish and looked to be semi broiled. Wasn't a fan. 

My main dish of shrimp masala was good - really enjoyed the gravy - perfect level of spice and it was really aromatic. The naan was nice and fluffy. 

For dessert I had the gulab jamun. The meal came with one, I could have easily had another 2 - these were rich, sweet and warm (I like them served warm, not cold like some restaurants do).

I was referred to him through a friend of ours who is a physician at the Clinic.  I originally thought I had a disc problem in my neck with confirmed tendonosis in my elbow but he discovered the root of my problem is in my shoulder.  What I appreciated about him:

*Great bedside manner.  He practically sat knee-to-knee with me and he smiled.  He maintained eye contact.

*Very thorough.  He had me explain the onset of my symptoms and bring him up to speed to current day.  He performed many simple tests on me.

*Prescriptive.  He laid out a comprehensive treatment plan after he uncovered a diagnosis.  

*He treats many Browns players and other athletes so he understood my impatience and desire to heal as quickly as possible to get back to the gym.  He has past training in sports medicine so he is compassionate in this regard.

He spent an hour with us.  I was so appreciative of him.  He truly is a spectacular doctor and I highly recommend him.  In a world of egotistical, rushed doctors who want to get on to the next case, he is a breath of fresh air.",2017-01-26 14:39:00

Americanized and with a Tex-Mex sort of vibe to it, the burrito was filled with ground beef and beans, then topped with white queso and crumbled bacon.

It's a small cramped restaurant and waiting at the front can get quite awkward. 

For the meal, there are only several appetizers that are brought to the table. (Not as much as Nak Won)  I love the kim chi that they make though.  I usually stick with the famous pork bone soup. It comes steaming hot and the broth is so flavourful, it's hard not to finish the bowl. There is plenty of meat and cabbage for you to eat and devour. Best pork bone soup in town!

We came here on Christmas because we were staying at the resort for the night. The Studio B buffet's wait time for the night was at 3 hours when we called at 5:15pm. So we decided to see if we would be able to get a table at one of the restaurants on property. 

Called down and made reservations at Anthony's Prime Steak & Seafood for 6:15pm. This is somewhat of an accomplishment seeing at ANYTHING on the strip would have been fully commited for the evening already. (see my other review on the M Resort Hotel)

We came down and waited maybe 5 minutes for a table. We were seated in a quiet corner by the back window. Edward was our server and his assistant (didn't catch her name) brought us bread and butter while we looked at the menus.

We ended up ordering the Prime Filet Carpaccio as our appetizer (sorry no picture, was too hungry and ate before I could remember, oops). Mache Salad, with shaved Parmesan and mustard dressing. We had a little bit of salt and pepper added as well. And, let me just say it was wonderful. There wasn't an overpowering flavor from the mustard dressing and the salt and pepper helped bring out the flavors. 

For our entrees my boyfriend order the Porterhouse $52 (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=j1hCLhSsUTtA0KlZc0-SoA&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw) and I had the New York Sirloin $38 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anthonys-prime-steak-and-seafood-henderson?select=nUAkbmot4qS5bbvKnheLrQ#AjsCFXsZhJfvEj8BOx742A). We had them cooked to medium. These were some of the BEST steaks I've ever had. They melt in your mouth... (I'm drooling just thinking about it) They were perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend had asked about the sauces out of curiousity and Edward told us that we really don't them - and, he was right. 

Both steaks came with a little grilled onion, stuffed tomato and a tiny salad. We ordered two sides the Asparagus and the Mashed Potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anthonys-prime-steak-and-seafood-henderson?select=nUAkbmot4qS5bbvKnheLrQ#MN4Viu96g2YAhywjbGhF-A) and both were great!

Wednesdays are 50% wine bottles....and if you are local, you get 20% your entire bottom line...INCLUDING your already 50% discounted wine!!

Ex : Veuve Cliquot ($85). My favorite champagne under $50 (in stores)....On Wednesdays, bottles are half price, and with local's discount, it's an extra 20% off the bottom line, so it only costs around $35!! GREAT deal...since you can't even go to Total Wine for that price most days!

Started off with the Complimentary bread...we had to request it for some reason. It is sweet and slightly sticky...good stuff!

I shared the 24oz Tomahawk Ribeye ($51) and Maine Lobster Tail stuffed with Ritz Crackers ($25). This is THE best non-aged Ribeye I've had so far, and the price was CHEAP! After the 20% off for locals, it's a $40 steak!! 

The lobster was very TENDER and flavorful, and the Ritz Cracker stuffing in the tail was delicious!  One of the most enjoyable tails I've had in town, and for a $20 bill after the discounts :P

For sides, the Cream Spinach ($9) with Boursin Cheese. I love Boursin Cheese, so this was an easy win for me!!  The Mashed Potatoes ($9) with Roasted Garlic as well...good amount of garlic flavor...tasty!  They didn't blow me away, but they are solid choices.

So even at face value, this is a great steakhouse on the strip.  Are there better ones in town?  Absolutely, but considering their very fair prices, AND THEN the Wine Wednesday and Locals discounts, it's a STEAL of a deal!

The sausages are also really fantastic - my favourite is the Chorizo but they have a broad selection including a decent vegetarian option.  Like a beer hall, no one comes to serve your table.

I have tried the Pastrami sandwich and the Reuben. Both had generous portions of meat & cheese on grilled marble rye. 
Several have recommend their veggie sandwich which is next on my list to try here.
 These sandwiches are quite large (relative, I know) perfect for a hearty appetite. $ 6 for the sandwich or $ 8 to make it a meal, with a drink and a side.
The menu may seem small until you see all the individuals items you can combine to build your own sandwich.

Decor: five stars. Smart modern chic that gives the vibe of casual and fun yet effortless sophistication. Aka you can bring your hot date to this restaurant or just stop by in your casual attire and not feel out of place because this place is just so cool. 

Service: five stars. We sat at the bar and the staff was very attentive; both the bar staff and the general crew. When they brought us our food, they explained the dishes in details. I really liked that because it built up the anticipations! 

Food: five stars. Half a dozen fresh oysters with three different toppings: lemon jelly, pineapple flavored something and a mint something. They were all good but my personal favorite was the mint.  Artichoke salad: so delicious with the hearts of artichoke as the bed with flowers and deep fried leaves and fresh vegetables on top.  Pork shoulder - stuffed in some sort of casing and garnished with the yellow dikon pickle and black garlic paste. It was a good dish but I thought the shoulder meat could be more tender and flavorful.  Last but most definitely not least and my absolute personal favorite: the duck. Slices of perfectly seared, medium rare duck topped with a generous piece of foie gras. The perfect combination of the duck and the foie gras in each bite was orgasmic.  I purposefully chose a glass of the Troublemaker from Paso Robles just for this dish and it was heaven. 

I am so in love with every aspect of S&W. The people that work there are super friendly and good at their jobs. We even met the manager, John, and he was so much fun and kind. He made us felt so welcome and like we were frequent patrons, which we will now become.

They carry a very wide range of used books, mostly in good condition, and generally at decent prices. The store looks like what I would expect of a used bookstore, 3 floors of mostly older books, well-sorted onto lots of old wooden shelves, with a few ladders/stools around, but it does not have the piles of book or boxes on the floor that some places have. I would agree with those that say the service is not great, but that is not an issue for me, as I generally know where to find what I am looking for. I do not recall ever having bad or slow service, it's just that the one person working usually seems to stay behind the counter.

As for the inventory, there is a large section of science fiction and mystery on the 1st floor, including a lot of old sci-fi paperbacks. There are also some general academic subjects (old science books, philosophy and religion), as well as special sections near the front for things like old Modern Library hard-covers and Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew books. The 2nd floor is mainly literature, including separate sections for Canada and French-language books. I have often found lesser-known titles from famous authors or older translations from foreign literature. The 3rd floor holds a lot of history and politics, including a large section of older hard-cover Canadian and local history books.

Much of the literature that I have bought recently has been priced around $4-7, and the history or science books are often around $10 or less. I have also been there twice recently to sell some books, and was satisfied with the results; I was able to trade-in probably 2 dozen books that I could not sell at BMV, and received better value than if I had accepted cash.",2017-01-09 04:46:57

Calling slightly ahead it was ready when we arrived and the lady at the counter was very sweet and wished us a happy holiday.  

The experience when we got home was okay, but nothing like what we expected based on others opinion and the fact that there were quite a few people eating in when we walked in.  

The sesame chicken was very salty and the lo mein slightly more watery and sweet than I like.  The soup was also very salty and so hot that it suffers from the same symptoms of other Chinese take-out soups:  limp soft vegetables and won ton noodles disassembling.  It still puzzles me.  You'd think they'd have tried planning out how much they cook everything before it goes into the take-out container.  I liked the shrimp and the won ton filling was good but I wouldn't order it again.  On the plus side, the prices here are some of the lowest I've seen for Americanized Chinese dive food.

It was close to work and open late and since I've needed to see a dentist for a few months, I figured, eh, why not. For the love all things, please don't go here. Heed your fellow yelpers warnings, unlike me. It was horrible. The only thing good about the place was that the front desk ladies were nice. 

Honestly, I don't really know where to start, but I can say that I dislike dentists on the west coast in general, for they remind me of mechanics, but for your teeth instead of cars. The X-ray technician seemed to know what she was doing, and I'm thankful for that, but that's where it ends. One of the people that was helping the X-Ray technician mark what I had already had done to my teeth in the past and problems in the present had to ask questions about the program she was using. Yep. The dentist herself came in for a whole 5 minutes, poked around at my teeth, told me a bunch of stuff I needed done with little to no explanation and left. I didn't see my X-Rays or anything. She also told me I needed a bunch of work that I know is not, by any means ""urgent"" as she was the only dentist that has said I needed it. A bunch of the stuff she listed off was just cosmetic work. Of course, like everybody, they said I needed a deep cleaning on two quadrants of my teeth, so I was like what the heck, why not. I did it and regret it.

The lady cleaning my teeth didn't have the proper equipment to set the device that shoots water into your mouth on, so she made me hold it. First time for everything, I guess. Not only that, but I can honestly say I was a wee bit nervous while being worked on. I'm fairly glad I don't work on that side of town anymore and now know to research dentists before going to them.

As soon as you step in, you will feel lost if it's your first time since there are two entrance to the restaurant; one from inside of the mall and one on Yonge St.  There are no host(ess) so you will have to hunt them down from my experience.  Then you will need to decide if you want to have a table on the second floor with a better view and fancier decor BUT a gauranteed wait even though most tables are empty.

After you are seated, expect to wait for waiter/waitress to take your order.  Then you will need to wait even longer for your food.  By the time you're done waiting, all your appetite will be gone and the last thing you would want to do is wait for the bill.

I cannot compliment or bash the food.  They're typical bar food and are not very hard to screw up yet it's not particularly good.

If you're looking for a bar to meet up, I guess the bar on the first floor isn't too bad; it's quiet and there's plenty of seating (some booths).  Just don't expect too much from the chef but do expect to wait and allocate a minimum of 90min for lunch and 2hrs for dinner.

I know it was a 'deal' but $30 for dinner for one person is not cheap. And given the very, very limited choices for the deal I did expect normal sized portions. They were small and I left hungry. 

I had some potato soup that tasted ok. Nothing amazing or anything. It was luke-warm in a boiling lava hot, very shallow bowl, so half the time was spent trying to figure out how to tilt the bowl to get a spoonful without blistering my fingers. I think they were hoping the super hot dish would heat up the soup. It did... kinda. Some bites were barely warm and some bites burnt my tongue. 

For my entree I had the salmon. It was overcooked, dry and crunchy around the edges with zero seasoning. It was one of the most bland things I've ever eaten. It was sitting on some weird avocado puree which also had no flavor. The tiny side salad was good.... quinoa and a lemon vinaigrette dressing with arugula. 

The dessert was an apple bread pudding which was dry and tiny. About 4 bites. It did taste good though, I just wish I wasn't still hungry after $30 worth of food. 

The service was good, and almost over the top. The water glasses, like the potion sizes, are tiny, so every time I would take a sip the bus boy would be right there topping it off. Every time.

My boyfriend had the baby clams linguine and it was just OK, not a lot of flavor and just not exciting; we had the fried calamari for our appetizer and again OK, but nothing to write home about, very very plain. 
The wine selection was good and for just a wine drinker and by no means an expert i appreciated the server (sorry can't remember his name) listening to my likes and dislikes and then choosing the perfect wine for me, that was impressive. 
The restaurant itself is nice but it just doesn't seem to fit the food, it seems very western and I would expect to see a menu for rustic American food as opposed to the Italian fare they serve. Also I didn't feel completely welcome, when we walked in, both of our first times here, we were unsure if it was seat yourself or wait to be seated and we had that super uncomfortable stand in the doorway while other diners stare at you moment which seem to last much longer then necessary, a server even walked by and said nothing to us. 
So Great great fettuccine, but next time I think I may just get an order to-go.",2010-10-29 20:25:08

Everything we had on the shared plates menu was stellar, easy to share, and perfectly portioned for our group of 4 ladies. The fried chicken and maple syrup buns were a favorite, as well as the ramen and other noodle dishes. Between the four of us we shared about 5 plates and ended up leaving some food behind as we were too stuffed to go on.

Cocktails were also fabulous! I was so glad to see sipping vinegars (aka shrubs) on the menu. Opting out of cocktails for one round, I just asked if I could have a shrub and soda. One of the absolute best shrubs I've ever had was their cucumber shrub. Wowza! A little of it topped off with soda water and a cucumber slice and I was in heaven. I could drink this every single day for the rest of my life! It was sweet, refreshing, and had just a kick of that sour vinegar flavor that's oh so yummy. A follow up drink was a ginger shrub and soda and it was lovely as well. Definitely something everyone visiting this restaurant should try.

So with great food, great drinks, and great company - our trip was just what I needed after a long flight to Phoenix. Topping off the experience there was fantastic service and an incredible hip, sexy, welcoming atmosphere. 

The restaurant has a bit of a fishbowl feel as the walls are all windows, but it makes for an extremely trendy, extremely beautiful evening. Great spot for ladies night, date night, or to impress coworkers. This was so unexpected for me and not what I envisioned as a place that would exist in Phoenix.

But really, that's okay.  It's more a part of the overall environment of Lake Las Vegas instead of being the main attraction.

It's very to the point: A few slot machines, some blackjack, the usual casino fare.  A few restaurants, and a nice player's club make up the area.

But it's very clean, the staff has been nothing but nice the times that I have gone in there, signing up for their card gives a lot of free perks, and it's got a good vibe to it.  They even have a free soda machine for club members.  And the best part is, on Wednesday, they do free wine tastings.

Like I said, I don't see the casino being the biggest draw to the tranquil environment of Lake Las Vegas (well, for me, anyway), but it doesn't hurt being there by any means.  It's a nice compliment to the area, and its laid-back attitude only adds to the overall environment.

The chicken was crispy and tender; I would definitely recommend this dish. The macaroni salad was delicious and one of our favorites as well.

Let me start off with the positives: The bread on this monstrosity of a sandwich was excellent. Fresh, crusty, flavorful (I got the everything) and the different types of peppers and fresh veggies on the sandwich were also good. 

However, I made the mistake of ordering the ""Dagwood"" which was turkey, ham and corned beef. In retrospect it was a dumb choice and in retroretrospect I made an even dumber choice by ordering it ""hot."" Apparently ""hot"" means they take deli cold cuts douse it with oil, chop it up and fry it on a greasy grill. As I type this the thought of turkey cold cuts bathed in oil and fried on that greasy grill makes me cringe. When I had ordered ""hot"" I THOUGHT it meant that they toast it in the oven. Never again....never never again. 

It's going to be awhile before I can consider trying this place again. If I could do it all over again I would order a one meat COLD sandwich. I feel bad giving this place 2 stars, but this monstrosity of a sandwich (I've uploaded a picture)was really disappointing and honestly, gross.

We waited. And waited. And waited. Had our drinks refilled, then FINALLY the chef showed up. He complained that one of my colleagues was in the way of his food cart. He was sarcastic and condescending during the entire preparation.  The ""theatrics"" of it all were sub-par.  My memories of a joyous dining experience here were squashed. 

Don't be fooled--just because it's cooked in front of you doesn't qualify it as ""healthy"". EVERYTHING is cooked in oil, heaps of butter, soy sauce and salt. The chicken was tough, but the sauce was deliciously spicy.

Recently visited on a Saturday for lunch and the crowd wasn't too bad.  They had streamlined there menu some and had a nice lunch menu to choose from.  I ended up having the Ancho Chicken Scaloppini & Cheese (Ancho chicken, caramelized poblano peppers and onions, melted Mexican cheeses) with a side chopped salad.  Dressing on the side, I only used about half of what they gave me but the salad was like crack and I could not get enough.  There were fresh avacados, chickpeas, jicama, greens, corn, black beans, and a whole lot of goodness packed into a small plate of salad.  The chicken on the sandwich was packed full of flavor.  My one comment was that some of the liquid from the chicken made the bread a bit soggy, but I powered through anyway.  The cheeses all melted in your mouth and I was stuffed in a good way for lunch that day.

I know this place is pretty popular in the evenings, but the one thing that I do get annoyed with is the parking situation.  It's great if you live down the street and can walk, but unfortunately the parking lot - they have done the best with what they have, but I do feel awkward parking in front of employees cars (double parking) but I think they do valet too so they can put your car wherever.

My PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I always try to patronize local eateries as opposed to the big corporate chains so while we driving around today, looking for a place to brunch, I saw Kristopher's (and luckily an open parking spot).

When we first stepped in, the place kind of smelled like dirty water and we stood there for a good minute or two without being acknowledged by any of the 4-5 staff that was working.  We finally asked one of the servers if we could just sit anywhere, to which she replied, ""yeah"" and left us to sit.  

When the server came over, she wasn't particularly friendly, but she took our order quickly.  I sort of felt like we were putting her out by wanting to order food from her restaurant.  As we were waiting for our food to come out, a few older and very loud mouth ""regulars"" popped in.  Their greetings with the other locals seemed to be heading in an anti-Semitic direction (yelling loudly, ""Who let the Jew-boy in?"" to another patron). This made PIC and I initially uncomfortable, thinking we had stumbled onto a Jewish / Greek feud.  Luckily, the conversation dissipated and they continued to talk loudly about other topics.  Unfortunately, they were still pretty obnoxious.

We got our food and I can't tell if the server conveniently forgot the juice that was supposed to come with my meal, but when I inquired about it, I once again felt like I was inconveniencing her.  Every ""thank you"" from PIC and I was met with complete silence.  I got one coffee refill and PIC never got a water refill.  

The food itself wasn't bad, but nothing really stuck out about it either.  It's kind of hard to mess up bacon, eggs, and pancakes though.

Perhaps the staff at Kristopher's was having a bad day or perhaps they just don't like ""new"" people coming into their restaurant.  I'd give it one more go another day just to see if it was a one-time thing or if it's the policy of the staff to be unfriendly to new patrons.

It offers a comfortable, relaxed space with a friendly vibe -- the ceiling is a little low for the dough tossing though. A variety of pizzas are on display on the counter.  You buy by the slices and they will quickly re-bake your order. Their slices are very large (approx. two ""normal"" slices), but each slice costs ~$4 on average. I would have preferred smaller pieces at a lower price so that I can sample multiple flavors when I'm hungry or eat less when I'm not.

Pizza Sola makes NY-style pizzas; people who don't like doughy crusts will probably appreciate the thin crust. I like my crust more crispy so that it would hold its shape better, so I find Sola's a bit too floppy.  I like their sauce and cheese, and the topping proportion is reasonable. I find the vegetarian ones a bit on the bland side (they do offer a bunch of condiments like pepper flakes and garlic powder so you can doctor it up to your taste), but the meat pizza is satisfying.  

Good soda selection -- black cherry, orange cream, root beer, etc.

Overall, 3.5 stars for the entire venture, but an extra half star for opening in Oakland.",2009-11-22 14:19:26

Cafe Sanuki more closely mirrors the style of restaurant in Japan where you aren't sitting down for an hour to grab a meal that takes moments to prepare and execute and requires almost no service beyond getting your food.

Walking in, you are greeted by the open style kitchen, a display of their dishes, as well as someone making and cooking udon noodles. You walk up with a tray and order, receive your udon unless it is one that takes longer to prepare, grab tempura with plastic tongs, and choose side dishes if you like. Then you pay for your food. 

Then you grab any of the open tables and enjoy your food. When done, you simply leave your tray in a bussing area (not sure if we are supposed to clear our tray but employees seem to be cleaning up the area).

Quick, convenient, great value. And the udon is quite tasty too. I have had a chance to sample the niku, onsen tamago and the mentaiko cream udon. The beef was very tasty and tender. The tamago is imported from Japan and is organic and vegetarian, and the mentaiko cream had great flavor.

I had a chance to try the miso pork belly rice bowl as well - the pork belly was okay, but I'd definitely focus on the udon here. 

A special note about their lemonade - it's a little creamy and light in flavor which is actually pleasant because it is not overwhelmingly sweet.

One thing to watch out for might be noodle texture. The first time we went our noodles were a little overcooked and too soft. They were intensely busy with a line out the door and it was soft opening so I won't hold it against them, as the second time was better.",2017-11-28 04:18:05

I have walked by the cart and store many times before without really stopping to check it out.  That day we decided to though since I was hungry and did not want a full meal and boy am I glad that we did.  Originally I was just going to get one of the loaves of bread to have a bit then and save for later but then I noticed some true french bread pizza (aka pizza toppings on top of a slice of french bread) which I ended up getting.  While I was ordering that my fiance noticed some Sfogliatelle and she ended up ordering one of those as well.  I think the total cost was $3 and Jimmy told us the story of how the sfogliatelle was created while chomping on his cigar.  Both of our items were good and both my fiance and I were espcially impressed with the sfogliatelle.  It had a lot more filling than we are used to getting as well as a more orangy flavor which made it extra good.  Honeslty she was just happy to find a good Sfogliatelle in Pittsburgh.  She is Italian and is used to getting them with some family members at some Italian bakeries in NYC.  The second time that we came here was once again at the cart on a Sunday when Jimmy enticed us with sfogliatelle that was fresh out of the oven and still warm.  Finally the last time that we came was on a Saturday and so the whole store was open, not just the cart.  It was interesting to look around inside and see everything that I had been missing by walking past it all of these years. There were a number of display cases with a ton of baked goods in each of them and it also looked like they served a bunch of different lunch type items like sandwiches to go.  Jimmy once again waited on us and as always was super friendly and told us some stories that we enjoyed.

Definitely like that they are made to order. The food was delicious, but I thought that the sauce, which was drenched on my plate, was a bit too salty for my liking. Perhaps next time I'll get the sauce on the side. 

This particular location was a bit difficult to find! It is inside a big plaza, and I drove around twice before finding it. Maybe I'm just bad with directions.",2014-08-06 15:38:09

My husband and I got some complimentary house drinks with a voucher and we watched a duo band. We had a good time watching the show, and we were excited for the main act, Michael Grimm. 

The waiter we had a large nice man who was eager to serve us at first. He came to our tables and gave us the complimentary drinks within a few minutes of us sitting down. After receiving our drinks, the waiter asked suggested a few items on the menu. After telling him of my husband's seafood allergy, he at two points suggested items with shellfish. He seemed to get fed up raving about items that we could not eat, and said ""well then you decide."" I think he did not understand that some people have allergies or he did not know the menu well enough to suggest items that weren't shellfish. 

Anyways, we ended up taking a moment to discover the menu and ordered the basic jambalaya and gumbo. Surprising, he still asked if we wanted to add shrimp. I said the allergy comment again and he seemed to get annoyed. Anyways, we received our delicious shellfish free food and had a pleasant dinner.

I got a portion of my food to go. But for some reason, it took approximately 30 minutes from when we got our to go box to get our check. Maybe the waiter didn't want to pressure us to leave, but he could have asked us if that was the case.

I am giving the place 3 stars simply because of the awkward service. Waiters need to be trained on the menu and common allergies. He was a nice enough guy, but I seem room for improvement. 

The food tasted as it should, nothing spectacular but definitely on point.",2016-02-11 02:27:01

It is also the only bubble tea shoppe in the area..and I live in this area. Which means I'm bound to see someone I went to school with every time I visit here. Many..many awkward moments.

First, the name of this place has changed from 'The Sugar' to 'Kitchen 31'...or 35..thirty something. The owner remains unchanged, staff are the same, décor untouched.

This place is capable of producing the same variety of drinks and food as Destiny's tea shoppe, and that's rather impressive for such a humble space which used to be a cracked out Coffee Time. It is clean, good lighting, and always packed on weekends with unintimidating patrons. The service is fast, which is again impressive considering they make all the fancy drink orders for the Congee Wong just a few doors down as well.
Food that is cooked here basically come in generic portions, and is mediocre at best. But the milk..butter...something something...which look like tofu cubes are down right delicious. It's so rich and luxuriously flavoured. And that basically sums up this place. So you'd think I'd be here all the time. But I'm not, because it's so scary coming here!

I run into everyone I don't want to ever run into here. People in high school who I never talked to and felt guilty about ignoring, people from my old Chinese church that I boycotted, girls I kinda hit on back in grade 12 but never really dated. There was this one time where I was here with two of my girlfriends and I was telling them about this girl named Melinda whom I has a crush on during Chinese school, and then I sat up straight only to see Melinda looking at me with her huge eyeballs in the booth next to mine. I ducked my head so fast I karate chopped the table, and remained submerged with my bubble tea until she left. It's like the twilight zone here!
I don't care much for bubble tea, but my Asian genetics kicks in every once in awhile, and it is required that I get myself a taro whatever whatever to go. When I come here, it's like I'm a celebrity avoiding the paparazzi. Face scarves, big shades, hipster clothing.

The pizza was rather tasty. Love their crust, it was nice and crispy and their sauce was not too spicy, so I was a fan of that. Their large and medium pizzas are enormous so you definetely get your moneys worth. 

In terms of ambiance, the place is a bit old, there are booths on the back and you bus your own table when you are done.

I ordered the pressed coffee. I'm no coffee expert, probably far from it, but I know there's a lot of coffees I don't like, and this was not one of them. Everyone has a different preference on coffee so it's hard to say exactly whether it's good or bad, but for my tastes in particular, I liked it. It wasn't overly bitter, it didn't have a sour after taste, it had a strong flavor even after adding cream and sugar. Not to mention solid lids, I can't begin to express how important small subtle features like this make a difference.

Service was great. Very friendly, informative and also attentive. My car kinda stands out, being bright yellow, and as a result, I was informed about weekly car meets on Sunday evenings. You'll notice from other reviews here that they have different activities on certain nights as well. 

There are a few baked goods you can choose from, but unfortunately, if you're hungry, you may want to grab a bite before coming by to hang out. I think this is something that can bring Funky Munky to the next level. Even if there isn't a full kitchen, maybe have a small little deli station. That way people can get sandwiches, even if not for a meal, for a snack.

Original Pork
Spicy Pork
Black Pepper Pork
Beef
Chicken

Overall, all the jerkys are ok in flavour. My favourite one was the spicy pork and beef. The beef one was a bit stiffer in texture. I would prefer jerkys to be a stiffer consistency. Most of them were like slices of grilled deli meats than jerkys.

I also bought 1 of their imported items from Taiwan. It was an authentic pineapple pastry. Quite good, full impact of flavour, and the pastry was nice and buttery, would get more, but it was quite pricy. $1.99 for a 1 piece.",2016-08-20 22:01:08

The first obvious advantage is that they are 24 hours. So if you run out of eggs or milk at 2 in the morning or if you're craving weird things like pickles and ice cream, this is your place. Yes I know there are plenty of 24 hour Smith's around every corner, but this place has 100 more times what they carry so what your are looking for should be here.

Another is various selections of nuts, candy, beans, etc that they have in big canisters not to mention all the different coffee beans you can grind on your own. You cant get that at Costco or Smith's. 

Now the disadvantages are that they take debit or cash only. Sometimes they only have 1 or 2 registers open. Only when there is a long line is that they call for reinforcements. 

Also, the last time I was here at 1 in the morning, I don't remember seeing a security guard. I mean, those were odd hours and any number of weird things can happen. So a security guard would be nice to see right?

From the folks that bought us Spanish Fly in Old Town, this takes the concept upscale in an area of town the could only attract an older crowd.

Beyond that, there's a bar with a stage and dance floor for bands, along with  a bunch of TVs and a pool table. From the bar, you can see outside to the pool and patio. It's a big pool with a lot of seating and several private cabanas. There's even a DJ stage outside and the music is bumpin'.

Since our server, Leonard, kindly allowed me to split a martini with my friend, I actually remember my second visit to Mastro's in its entirety: from the amazingly addictive pretzel rolls, to the heirloom tomato and Campagna burrata salad, to the filet mignon (served with Bearnaise sauce, upon request), to the lobster mashed potatoes--and, finally, the famed warm butter cake.

This cake, alone, is worth 5 stars! The warm butter cake portion was more than enough for the three of us, served with a drizzle of berry coulis, sliced strawberries, a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting on top, and, in a separate bowl, enough whipped cream to frost a double-layer cake.

My first spoonful filled my mouth with warm brown sugar-sweet goodness, with the cake texture somewhere between a Genoise and a pound cake. The cake was wonderful on its own but we couldn't help but top our tastes with the whipped cream.

I think Tres Potrillos compares favorably with my gold standard.  The building is much larger and fancier, but the prices and menu offerings are comparable.  Si Senor is probably a little cheaper because they always have coupons in the local circular.  I'm not sure if Tres Potrillos does that.  We had good service, and the food was good too.  I recommend the camarones al ajillo - tons of huge shrimp.  I'd say Tres Potrillos definitely has a leg up on the competition in the atmosphere category, but their salsa isn't as good as Si Senor.  

All that being said, I know most people aren't choosing between the two places since they're not really near each other.

m-hH0Ai636fPrdjNxoGGvw,q8JGJMevslMGLRJYUa74KQ,lEtpTFWetCf6xnzeImLiHg,1,0,0,0,"First off, something that really upsets me is when the server tells my party that the service is slow tonight because they are short handed.  I want to be told that when I walk in the door so I can choose to leave before I order, not after I have ordered and the food is taking too long to come out.  Unacceptable.  My Gen. Tso's chicken was made from all white meat chicken fingers, not the usual chicken pieces.  The flavor was okay, but it did not taste like any Gen. Tso's I have ever had.  The crab puffs were the worst I have ever had - not crispy and bland.  The pricing is quite high, usually about $2-3  more than comparable restaurants per item.  They only serve dinner to my knowledge, so maybe that's why they charge so much.  The beer is cold, but not as cold as it should be.  The cocktails have almost no flavor of alcohol in them.  The rice is fine.  Once we convinced the waitress that we actually needed menus from which to order, the service, although slow, was okay.  You'll get a better meal from Pei We for a lot less money,  just no booze.  I shan't be returning.  I seem to know what Mr. Chao's does not, that there is competition out there.",2018-03-12 03:47:53
xzmODV1RwAU9pzzQQ2sxig,X86vXWcxSzuCfMJyOnx1UQ,iJpmIt-i9-VeChouLcPXbA,4,1,1,0,"We came into Arrabiata's last night after heading back to our side of town from Patterson's Fruit Farm. Some family members we were with stated that this was some of their favorite Italian food in the Cleveland area, so we decided to give it a try. 

Arrabiata's is located in one of the little strip malls on Mayfield and inside you will find it to be your classic family-run Italian environment. The tables are nicely set, complete with your cloth napkin folded into a flower. Very cute touch. Other than that, it is pretty classic with no major decor frills and a standard look that seems to have been there since the restaurant opened 18 years ago. 

We were greeted immediately and seated. We managed to beat the Saturday dinner rush which seemed to occur as we were leaving, around 6pm. (The restaurant was completely full when we left). 

Let me just get this out of the way right now: our server was phenomenal. She had a great personality, did not mess up a single thing, remained attentive throughout the meal and she made sure to suggest every option available to us from dipping oils for the (wonderful) Italian bread, to what hidden menu items there are. She was wonderful and I wish I could remember her name! 

Now to the food. I can boldly say you will not leave hungry. You start with the Italian bread (which was my favorite part about the evening) and a paprika butter. *Hidden menu item tip: they have a roasted red pepper dipping oil to go with bread, but only by request. You should request it-yes you!*

After the bread, which our waitress was attentive enough to give us time to consume before we moved on, out came our salads. Each speciality dinner entree comes with a salad, adding to my promise that you will not leave hungry. The house Italian dressing is delicious and there is even cold pasta salad mixed in with your greens. I enjoyed this salad! After completion of the salads our waitress ensured we were ready and then she brought the entrees out. 

All four of us ordered something different, but I had my go-to Italian dish: eggplant parm. All speciality dishes also come with a side of pasta (which you can choose from linguini, rigatoni, cavatelli, penne, etc.) I stayed traditional with the linguini and the amount of food I received was enormous! **I did not ask if there are GF pasta options but I did not see any notations on the menu. Since last night I was going full-on cheat, I ate normal pasta. It would be a plus if they had GF options but unfortunately I cannot advise.**

Unfortunately, I have to get a little picky on the gravy (sauce, marina, whatever you identify with it as). Though I know all family recipes differ, the gravy was a little bitter to me and chunkier than I like. The pasta was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of al dente. The eggplant was decent but could have used a little more of a crunch to it and the breading had a slight grit to it. The distaste was minor, though, and I completed the meal. I just cannot rank it on the top of my eggplant parm experiences. The other dishes ordered: lasagna with meatballs, chicken marsala, and chicken cacciatore and all of these individuals also enjoyed their meals. Two felt was 5 star worthy and one felt 3.5-4 star worthy.

In closing, I was torn between a 3 or 4 stars on this review but honestly felt that with the service we received and the fact that there are definite high notes to the menu and food items, three just seemed too low. Come here and expect to find a low key environment with traditional Italian food. Just because my Italian food preference is one way does not mean you will find yours to be the same. Arrabiata's seems to have a solid following, with many diners seeming to be regulars. There is a bit of everything on the menu so hopefully there is something for everyone. If you come here knowing this is not a 5 star establishment, but a chill family Italian spot, you will enjoy it more.  As always, if I believe there is enough good to a restaurant I will leave you with this in my review: it is worth a try for you to form your own opinion! Happy dining!",2016-10-09 13:49:57

Of course, I recourse to the Yelp resource for the best drink source....
Sidebar was trending on Yelp, it was hot. I tend to stay away from the hype but I wanted to impress the Gibertarians on the visit to phx down.  This was a good decision. I was not let down

Such a great location, such a great environment for the meeting of new people and old friends to fall under the spirit of cool and debonair, it is a great easy space for the meandering stories of yester years. 
I would recommend this foodless bar for its zeal and its laidback feeling. It is a ""hey lets go out for a quick drink."" None of the fanfare or grand standing of sports or modern tact, its straight forward authentic to the spirits and liquor. An after-work drinks to let the day marinate because no matter what, you never feel late.  If Sidebar called and asked me back...I would crawl back happy for a second chance.

OK.  It is a stay thirsty my friend's upstairs man cave for when men use to be men sentiment. Go nuts, show up and pretend to act grown up. And when the night comes to an end you will be happy you visited...so stop checking your email, and your Facebook notifications...sit back and taste the side bar air.

I ordered the Little Cheeseburger ($5.89), a drink ($2.19) and a side of fries ($3.99).  

Food came quickly but about two bites in, I started to notice how cold it was in the restaurant.  It was freezing...the fries cooled quickly.  Half way through our meal, we were shivering and our nose was running.  Not sure if the AC was still on or if there was no heat.  It was just super cold.  I noticed other patrons eating with their jackets on.  I should have done the same.

Not sure what the gripes about the service were - the guy serving us was practically a Maritimer in terms of friendly - we shared some debate on Diet Coke vs Coke Zero.  He didn't like either - he went for Diet Pepsi.  That's just gross, dude. #lostrespect

We got the small jerk chicken and goat curry.  Though they looked small, unless you're a big eater, it is plenty of food.  Both were tasty, moist, and fricking good.  The rice was.. ricey - well done.  

I also tried a spicy patty - normally when an ethnic restaurant with typically spicy diets says it's spicy, it's damn spicy.  Like in an Indian restaurant, it lights my mouth (and, later, nether regions) ablaze.  Likewise, suicide hot wings from a mainstream pub sometimes could use some habanero enhancement.  So I expected some flames, but surprisingly it wasn't actually that spicy.  Tasted great though, so no complaints (someone should really create an easy way to characterize the spiciness of a dish that all restaurants could use.  Hmm.. restaurant-grade Scoville meter?  Business idea forming here..).

Oh and they threw in some coleslaw gratis as well - surprisingly, it was quite good!  If you've ever read my other reviews, I tend to whine about coleslaw quality - this one was small but actually quite nice.  On the KFC scale (where 0 is raw cabbage and 11 is KFC coleslaw, this one was about an 8).

The location is small and cozy, and I've learned not to eat anywhere with a smell, because I then leave the place smelling like that establishment.  I made that mistake a few weeks ago with an Indian takeout place, and took 4 days for my coat to stop reeking of curry.  Curry taste? Awesome.  Curry smell on clothes? Vile.

VPQP38nwo-I0i2PnZGSKig,vASaF47nWvCHEEDA8nfCVw,XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q,5,7,4,5,"My dining experience at Joël Robuchon started with a ride in a gaudy-ass gold-colored limo with leather top.  No joke.  The limo was right on time (as opposed to being five minutes late like us), picked the four of us up in front of our hotel and whisked us to The Mansion, a part of MGM that perhaps 98% of Vegas visitors have never seen, heard, or set foot on (present company included). 

So we were taken to this gated entrance, cobblestoned driveway (which was not exactly fun to navigate in 5"" red soles) and lush indoor garden surrounded by balconies from the 29 plush suites (which apparently requires a line of credit of $300,000 to qualify to stay).  Then we were ushered by our hostess through the corridors flanked by high roller tables and $25 slot machines, directly to the heavy doors of Joël Robuchon.

Behind the heavy doors was a small yet whimsical space dominated by purple and black velvet - opulent almost to the point of gaudy (but not quite!) - and  filled with hushed conversations of other dinner patrons.  

Then it turned into a French lesson.  The hub, fortunately, is fluent in French (or should I say Canadian French), having born and raised in ON so it was somewhat interesting hearing him converse in French with the server and maitre'd.  Thankfully, the menu contains English translation and the server does speak English with a lilting French accent, so it didn't end up being too embarrassing for the rest of the group.

We unfortunately did not have enough time for the $350 / 16-course menu so we settled for the five-course a la carte menu of l'amuse bouche - a serving of delicious, delicate black caviar which I could've had three of; appetizer (the French, just like the rest of the world outside of America, calls this part of the meal entrée.  For the Americans who do not believe me - I kindly refer you to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrée); soup; main course; dessert; and finally moka and thé (coffee and tea) with petit fours. 

As soon as we ordered, we were approached by a smiling server pushing a bread cart filled with what could've been twenty different kinds of petite carbohydrate goodness.  Between the four of us, we had saffron focaccia, basil focaccia, bacon-filled bread (which we verified is not French, but rather a genius creation of the chef), and lots and lots of traditional French petit pain.  

The rest of the meal was a revelation that we were oohing and aahing throughout.  My appetizer consists of king crab with cauliflower cream and seasonal vegetable - an unlikely combination that turned out to be delicious and refreshing.  For soup, I had the light, frothy and fluffy chestnut cream with foie gras, bacon bits, and lardons foam.  Then I had the braised veal cheek with galangal-and-ginger-infused Thai broth, vegetable couscous and brocolli as the main meal and finally a banana creme caramel with yuzu ice-cream, whose tanginess went really well with the crunchy sweet honeycomb candy.  

We sat back, sated and content while waiting for our server to bring out the coffee and tea.  Ordinarily I would've chosen a pot of green tea to cap off the meal, however the experience was anything but ordinary so I settled for a strong, black French press coffee, hold the cream and sugar.  

The bitterness of the coffee complemented the petit fours that we had a lot of trouble selecting from the 45 available on the cart.  My absolute favorite was the blueberry opera cake and eclair, although the strawberry cheesecake dipped in white chocolate was pretty darn good as well.  

As we were paying, the same hostess who greeted us at The Mansion came right by, advised us that the limo is ready, and off we went to our next stop: XS.",2010-11-06 20:11:35

I arrived just after 1:00pm - no reservation - and the lunch crowd was starting to thin out. I was seated immediately in a booth where I could see today's Rugby World Cup conciliation game was played. For as many people that were there, the TV on, and maybe even music on the other side of the restaurant, it was remarkably quiet... easy to have a conversation with my lunch date.

The server was attentive through out the entire lunch - really nice guy. He quickly brought water and some sort of bread/biscuit with butter on the side - rather tasty to take the edge off.

And if I need a rental, they can arrange that for me. Perfect.. I picked up my rental from Nissan which is down the street from CarMax., 
I anticipated my car won't be done til Friday so I booked myself heavily at work on Thursday. They called Thursday afternoon to say it's done. I said I'm sorry but you told the car won't be done til Friday so I won't get off work til 7pm and won't be there til 7:30, plus I still have to return the rental. They said no worries, Carmax closes at 9pm and I can drop my rental off at Carmax instead of Nissan. And someone will transport the rental back the next day. And my Sasha have been washed! Which wasn't that great since there's still bird poos everywhere. 
I'm grateful for the setup. The customer service was very tentative thru out the whole process. Except a few ladies I run across with.. Yet still overall happy with the few that handle of my car and the communicators in between!",2016-05-02 01:23:19

One of my rear tires had a slow leak. Instead of just taking it into these guys, I kept filling the sucker up every couple days. In all honesty,  I was being a bit cheap and just didn't want to spend the hundred bucks. 

Wouldn't ya know, as I was filling the tire yesterday I noticed that a shiny nail had punctured the tire. So, I finally gave in and went back to Discount Tire this morning.

This was my second time here in the past couple months and the service was just as great as the last time. I was worried I might have to buy a new tire, but they were able to fix both nail punctures. Yep! There were two nails in the tire that were causing the slow leak.

Here' s the best part. The total cost for the repair was only $15 flat.

If you have any tire issues, just go here. You will not be disappointed.",2015-05-08 12:58:16

Using technology like this makes the ordering more efficient and accurate!! Completely impressed with this!! 

My wife ordered their French Toast!! She loved it (so did I... I tried it).... It was made from Raisin Bread and crusted in Corn Flakes.. Delish!! She also had a side of Corned Beef Hash which was awesome too!!

I had the Ribeye with eggs over easy... Comes with toast OR biscuit with gravy... Of course I went with Blthe biscuit with gravy (almost as good as moms... Almost).... My Steak was delicious and cooked just as ordered it!! 

Our servers name was Katie and she was completely awesome!! 

Additionally impressive was seeing an actual ""working manager"".... Coming from the restaurant business, it frustrates me when I do not see a manager working on the floor... At this joint we saw Mark hustling around and delivering food, seating people, and talking with the staff when he had a minute to catch his breath... Completely impressive!!

The main reason for this update is to try and refute some of the hateration from Lauren B. from Phily on Liz.  I don't recall reading a review that was so malicious towards one individual in a restaurant.  I've had Liz as a bartender for a long time now and used to go to Dish a couple times a month.  Michele and Andres are great (owners and chef) and the rest of the staff is superb, especially Liz.  I don't really understand the venom of Lauren B..  I mean she never really gives much in the way of specifics of why she hates Liz.  I've seen Liz wait on hundreds of folks through the years of all different types and she has always treated them with respect if not outright wit and charm.  It's not just the regulars like me.  Sure, the place gets busy and often it can take a few minutes to get a drink.  But, what worthwhile place doesn't occassionally get busy.  Anyways, just needed to voice a different viewpoint.  Lauren, I  can't imagine that Liz did something to justify such a mean spirited review.  In fact, I'm pretty sure this review is much more  a reflection of you than her or the restaurant.

I came here for a Father's Day dinner with my family. We ordered a dozen oysters at the recommendation of the server, who was able to describe all of them very well. We had Colville Bay, which were very very tasty, and Fat Bastard, which were big, meaty and very seawater tasting. Not unpleasant, but I liked the Colville Bays better. The oysters will run you a couple of bucks apiece, give or take. They came with a variety of sauces and fresh horseradish and lemon. Tasty!

For an appetizer, we shared some crab cakes which were dairy-free and very very good. They were huge, which makes the $12 price tag a little less painful.

For the main meal, I had the sea bream, which was tasty, but riddled with a zillion tiny little bones. Usually not a problem for me, but these bones were tiny and short, which became kind of annoying because it slowed me down. My brother had the sea bass, which was meaty and buttery all at once. Very good (but not as eco-friendly, mind you). The older family members split the sea bass, the grouper (on special) and the large seafood platter, which was gigantic. The grouper was very tasty, as was everything on the seafood platter (which I got to sample). The scallops were huge and very flavourful, and the calamari was grilled just right. Just a tiny hint of chewiness and great grill flavour. I could see myself ordering the big platter on a date and just going to town with my partner. Too bad the Hubster isn't a big fan of lobster (wait, maybe that's not so bad at all...)

My only complaint is the lack of variety of sides. Everyone got the same cold (chilled?) lentil salad pilaf thingie and grilled veggies. I wasn't a big fan of it.

Service was friendly and patient, more so than I ever could be with my family.

The place was super busy when we got there, and a mix of casual and trendy. Not really a place for a quiet, intimate, romantic dinner.

It's both cool and cozy, and I think they will be sticking around for quite some time, they've already made it past their year mark. 

I ordered a Palmaire, which was a tasty cocktail, and my bf had the Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter, cheers to BT for having that on draft!

There were a handful of things on the menu that I wanted to try, so that's a good way to keep me coming back. 

The one thing I would say is that they need to figure out their layout. The chairs are close enough together that their servers are constantly turning sideways to squeeze through and I kept thinking I needed to scoot in or I got bumped a few times. So they need to move some things around and have the space work a little better. Oh, and their crowd...well it's quite a few people over 50 in there.

Recently, I had a small football party at my house.  I purchased all my plates, cups, silverware, napkins, and decorations at Party City. Most of the cuttlery and such was buy one get one free, so it was an awesome deal.  It's nice to shop at a store that has so much to offer at a great savings.

Great prices, products, and customer service. I will continue to use Party City for all my future parties.",2015-12-12 01:12:33

I had  the cue combo which had pulled pork, brisket and Memphis, Texas and Kansas City Style ribs. The waiter made a big deal of telling us that the ribs were all St. Louis cut ribs regardless of style. SL cut ribs are larger and meatier. What we got were  short puny ribs with little meat on them, the size of baby backs. They tasted ok but nothing special. When we pointed out they were not the size he had stated, he had no explanation for it. The pulled pork was decent, the brisket was very tough. We had 3 sides-fries, collard greens and creamy grits which were good. 
 
The waiter was apologetic, offered us some kind of card to come back to get a free sandwich, but I honestly don't see myself returning there anytime soon. Midwood Smokehouse does BBQ much better, IMHO",2014-01-26 19:04:57

I normally done use this particular location because they always screw things up but I was close and needed this quick so I was hopeful maybe they improved; I was wrong.

The girl helping me was nice however she did not do her job.  She did find the frames I needed and took them in back to replace the lenses.  You think she would trim the excess material off the nose guards???  What about completely cleaning the lenses before putting them in the new frame?

I guess that is asking too much of them or my expectations were too high.  She just took the old one out and slapped them in the new frame.

So needless to say when I got home I had to take the lenses out and clean them myself which is something a Professional eye center should have done.

If I don't really feel like driving all the way to Phoenix to go wait 45 minutes for a table at Great Wall, I usually resort here. It's not bad, but it's certainly not the best I've had. From what AZ has to offer it's decent. Large seating area and open space create routes for cart pushers to maneuver around. My go-tos are pretty standard here; siu mai, har gow, shrimp rice noodle, bbq pork bun, and sometimes taro cake and an egg custard bun. Though, commonly in dim sum  restaurants there's going to be what I call ""equally curving"". Usually they'll come up to you offering what they currently have in their cart, so if you don't want any, curve em. But then again they can also curve yo ass by not even looking at you and walking past your table. Pretty common. Sometimes they'll speak Cantonese to me like I know what they're saying, pretty normal. So expect to be skipped at times. I remember the water here was absolutely delicious. But that was long ago. What I can say is that if you're looking for a place to eat dim sum on the east valley, I can say this is a good choice. Keep in mind this place can get busy.

Let's start with when I called to reserve the table. First she couldn't find the book and wanted me to call back the day before the game. Not cool. I asked to leave a name and party number, and had to repeat myself 3 times before she got Hensel, party of 6. Not impressed. I call the day before the game to confirm the reservation and it's there, I was feeling better.

Until we showed up. And our ""table"" was a pool table with a table cloth and 4 chairs. It took 20 minutes to find 2 more chairs. And a lot of attitude from the bartender in the process. Game starts and the sound quality was awful. If you wanted to actually hear what was going on you would have needed a radio.

Food was surprisingly good and came out timely. Waitress was pretty solid at keeping our beers full.

The end was the kicker. The 20 minute wait for the first check, which was horrendously wrong, and then the 30 minute wait for them to fix it. Now, I understand being busy but if your a packer bar shouldn't you plan to have more than 1 POS system during games? This happens every time we go but this wait was ridiculous.

We didn't have a wait and got to sit on their nicely heated porch. I definitely think it helped that we were there on a Wednesday even though it was 7:15 because every review I've read is that you have to expect to wait at least an hour. 

My one friend and i decided to split three dishes off of the Tapas menu. I love tapas menus because i always want to try at least 3 things and am hard pressed to pick just one thing. We split the Dirty South Nachos, Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos, and Shells & Cheese. The best part about the tapas is that they didn't all come at once. They gradually brought the dishes out so we had a natural progression throughout the meal. 

After eating their Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos I made sure to tell everyone that these would be served at every major life event that I have. They will be served at my wedding, the birth of my children, and every birthday in between. I was so skeptical of these because the watermelon on top, but boy have i never been so happy to be proven wrong. If you take one thing away from my review it needs to be: GET THE ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS. Your tastebuds will surely thank you. 

Do you like fried chicken? Do you think the best part of fried chicken is the crispy skin? Then the Dirty South Nachos are for you. They are delicious and perfectly seasoned and crispy. The pimento cheese that they are on top of is a nice compliment to the ""chips"". You get about 5 large ""chips"" and that's more than enough. 

The Shells & Cheese were great. It was essentially perfect mac and cheese elevated to the next level with their fantastic pork belly again. Between the three things we got we had left overs and it was A LOT of food. I felt like i was going to have to be rolled out of the restaurant. 

My other friend who came with us got the Guacamole stack. It looked delicious and so pretty. It is definitely on my list of things to try next time i'm there. My last friend got a sushi roll but i can't remember which one. She said it was great as well.

It is the only reason why I was able to finish my lunch. I ordered a white pizza for myself and a side order of chicken tenders and fries for my daughter. We were starving so the second the food was placed on our table, my 3.5 year old daughter grabbed a fry and spit it out because it was so salty. On the other end of the spectrum, the chicken tenders weren't seasoned enough. Hence, the need for honey mustard. And ketchup. And ranch. 

Since it's a pizzeria, I was hoping that the pizza would be better, but the slice I was given was lacking in toppings and the crust was dry and hard. Again, ranch to the rescue.

The ladies at the table next to me looked like they were enjoying there salads, so maybe I will give them another try and hopefully update this review.

The space feels airy and open with a few tables and chairs, or on the church pew placed along one of the walls. If you prefer to sit outside to soak up the sun, you can do that too. It's a low-key, relaxed space that invites those who want to read their book or work.

I'm always on the lookout for a good Americano and the owner John makes a great one. He also sells a few treats if you're feeling hungry. 

So far, I've been here for events that a few friends have organized. One of them was a clothing swap and the other was jewelry making. El Cafecito is the type of the place where these low-key events can happen and everyone is welcome to participate.

In short, it's bad.

The building is placed so that the drive through is awkward. The trash can at the end of the drive through lane is too far away for a normal human arm to reach. The U-shaped parking lot to the north isn't the easiest to maneuver either, mostly when it is busy.  It is safer to park to the northeast in shared complex parking. The exterior seating is usually not very clean. The interior of the restaurant is normally pretty clean though. The interior setup is just like other Dunkins. Nothing special, just average.

The chai that I get is pretty hard to mess up, since I think it is steamed milk and a powder base. I've been pretty lucky there. But the food and doughnuts have been awful. It is usually stale, hard, overcooked or ill-prepared (messy).

Today, I ordered at the drive through, and had to repeat ""large hot chai and a bacon wakeup wrap"" three times. Dude sounded like he was sleeping and I woke him up. I pull to the window, and wait. Mind you, I am the only one in line. A gal takes my payment with no fanfare, and hands me a receipt. The window closes, and I wait. My drink appears. I hear the man yell ""Oh, I need a wrap."" Since I'm solo in line, I'm guessing they already forgot about me. The window closes. The window opens and I am told to pull around front so they can make my wrap. I eke into a spot in the dreaded parking lot. And I wait. I get through the long version of Ram Jam's Black Betty before my wrap comes out. The gal was nice and apologized for the wait.

So, let's talk about the bacon wakeup wrap. A baby flour tortilla with a pre-made egg patty, a slice of cheese and a piece of bacon torn in half. Simple, right? It is a mess visually. I take a bite. I check to make sure all teeth are intact and accounted for. This thing is so hard! I tap it and it makes a sound like tapping a pencil on a counter. Probably shouldn't do that. I'm hungry and not a fan of wasting food, so I eat the inside and wash it down with the chai.

I keep stopping here for convenience, but am disappointed every time. Why do I do this to myself? Why is the sky blue? How is a rainbow made? It just is. In 2018, I need to resolve to stop settling for junk, and drive a block to Bosa, for fresh stuff from a local joint.",2018-01-04 15:51:25

We got the cheesy rib platter, which came with two half racks. We got one to be mild, and the other lightly spicy. I preferred the mild flavour, though the spicy rack ended up leaner and therefore tastier. They give you a plastic glove to eat the ribs with, to avoid dirtying your hand.

The platter had a mashed potato side (slightly too dry), buttered corn kernels (very dry and chewy), four small sausages (two tasted cheesier and were very bouncy to the touch), sweet potato mash (heavenly), and egg. Overall, my comment would be that the platter ended up too hard and dry. They turned the heat off, and the cheese and all the sides began hardening. In fact, the cheese formed such a crust that it was impossible to scrape off in the end. 

Still an experience, and again, the service is impeccable!",2018-01-20 14:47:22

Park in the real lot, not the gravel lot below the deck. The parking in their paved lot is free. The menu comes from the upstairs Firehouse Lounge, which is delicious.

This is a Persian restaurant serving halal meat and I could see why the prices are a little higher compared to the neighboring Greek restaurants.  I understand there is a slight difference, also in flavor but it's Mediterranean food that I can compare it with.

First thing we noticed were the meat in these large skewers and finally understood the portion sizes are larger.  This is a casual restaurant and the average plate runs about $16. The gyro plate came with fries and a bit of mixed leafy greens was only $7.  Prices are slightly higher, as you get what you pay for here.  

Here's my take on it all.  Large portions, the gyro too salty for it's own good as it's my favorite dish to order and the skewers had underwhelming flavor.  So, the big difference between Greek and Persian in terms of bread is freshly made, lighly charred tandoori bread versus packaged pita bread.  Here's my 3 star merit, the meat has to be awesome even if the bread is outstanding.

To begin, as my friends and I arrived, we got seated pretty quick because there were only about two other tables that were occupied. The waiter gave us a table right beside the bar. You would think the service would be really good considering the restaurant was no where close to being packed but boy, were we wrong. The service was not good! It's like he kept forgetting we were there or something (even though he was in the bar and we were right beside it), I actually started getting frustrated because I haven't dealt with such bad service in so long. On top of that, I do realize waiters make mistakes and that's totally cool if you're not being rude about it. Two of my friends decided to share two appetizers, the four cheese spinach dip and vegetable quesadilla. I wanted to try a new item on the menu (only available during chicken fest). I got the szechuan chicken bites. The waiter was taking our order and I guess he didn't hear me, he goes like ""WHAT?"" so rudely and in our face, I'm like okay then (he was talking really unprofessional). About 15 minutes later my friends received their appetizer but I didn't get my dish. We waited about 10 minutes (I munched on their four cheese spinach dip), and my dish still didn't come out. We called him over and he responded with ""I'm sorry but I forgot to punch it in."" I literally waited an overall 40 minutes for one small dish that didn't even end up being something to die for. However, he did give us 3 a soft drink for free for waiting that long and for making the mistake. I did feel bad after he offered us a free drink, but the way he was talking and not checking up on us was just horrible.

The szechuan chicken bites were good, however they weren't amazing. It's a good dish to get if you aren't starving but want something to munch on. I personally thought it could've had more flavour but I still enjoyed it. The four cheese spinach dip was AMAZING! It was literally to die for. I didn't try the vegetable quesadilla, however my friends said it tasted good.

All in all, I wouldn't ever return to this location. Two stars only because the restaurant is clean, and the food was really good! I personally recommend the four cheese spinach dip! The service definitely needs to improve.",2018-03-14 21:09:08

Location & Aesthetics -- Located just off E. Camelback Road just opposite The Container Store that's off N. 20th St.  It could be a little difficult to miss from the main streets but with a handy GPS you should be fine.  Once in the parking lot, and there's plenty of available parking, you can't miss the restaurant with it's large signage.
There's available seating on the outside and inside, but this time of the year, most folks were seated inside.  I can't remember if I saw misters for the patrons dining outside.  
Restaurant is clean (outside and inside) and well lit indoors.  Noise level was acceptable with music playing at a comfortable decibel level.
There is a central bar area with bar stools and, of course on the periphery of the restaurant, seating all around.  Seating was booth-like and very comfortable with spacious tables.

Service -- Staff are very friendly.  The concept of being seated and ordering is quite unfamiliar to me so I was a bit lost on the customs of the restaurant.  Thankfully staff instructed me what I had to do.  
When you enter, you immediately join the queue to order your food.  Once you're at the front of the queue, staff will either call you up to take your order providing there's an available table.  You give them your order and they'll show you your table.
If there aren't any available tables, then they will let you know and basically, everyone who's waiting for a table (versus folks there for takeaway), has to stand and wait in line (no orders are taken) until a table opens up then the line moves again.  Very interesting concept which I've never experienced before and do like.

Menu -- Lots of available menus at the door when you enter.  The menu was one sheet, both sides, and very easy to understand with lots of descriptions.  We had questions on portion sizes on some items on the menu and staff was exception at helping us decide.

Food -- I had the classic burger with the bacon and cheese (Angus Beef, green leaf lettuce, white onion, tomato, and something called Sassy Sauce).  Sides are extra so we shared a large Kennebec fries, with a sea-salt caramel shake.
Working backwards, the shake was rich, creamy and semi-thick (not too thick that you'll need a vacuum to suck it through the straw) though they will provide you with a plastic spoon in addition to the straw.
The Kennebec fries (in case you don't know is from the medium-to-late-maturing white potato) was fresh, hot, and slightly salted which made it perfectly delicious!
The burger itself was fresh, non-greasy, non-drippy, well seasoned, juicy, tasty, and very flavorful!
With the wide variety of burgers they have on the menu, I will most likely be back to try some of the other options on the menu and do definitely recommend!  I've also heard they serve a mean watermelon mojito so that will be accompanying my next burger order on my return!",2017-06-04 05:48:37

The teppenyaki works like this:

1) There's two menus; Teppenyaki and regular AYCE. The Teppenyaki menu, you order limited AYCE selection, meaning you can order such things as Fried Scallop, Fried Salmon Head, etc.

2) Teppenyaki chef will come to your cook table approximately 30 - 45 mins. depending on how busy the place is. They will cook tofu, shrimps, vegetables and mushrooms, salmon, turbot, short ribs, steak, duck, and fried rice. When the chef finish cooking, if your like me, you can opt for round 2. I would say the duck is the best!  Moist, succulent, and tasty, the soya sauce on the duck is wonderful!  I had 4 orders of those ducks.  It is that good!

Sashimi was fresh, the cut was thick and tastes delicious!  No disappointment there. Most AYCE lacks consistency when you order the same thing the second time but not this place. Surprisingly their Salmon Rose is to die for. Really really nice!  The mayo compliments the salmon really well. 

All of their Sushi Maki is fantastic. I don't order too much of those because the star of the dinner is Teppenyaki - that's just my advice. 

Another advice is tip the chef. They will remember you when you come again and they'll throw in extra stuff (wink). Also be nice to the manager, he'll get you exactly what you need.

All I'm going to say is that these older hotel casinos need to step up their game, but then again, I can see why they don't have to as someone needs to accommodate a lower price point compared to the Bellagio, Aria, Encore and the likes.

When we checked in, the line was super long but I noticed that there was a self-service check in kiosk.  I thought, ""Cool, gotta try it out.""  I literally checked myself into a room within a matter of five minutes and it was was so easy, I love technology!  The bro-in-law checked in earlier that morning and sent pics of his ""Go-Room"" which looked pretty snazzy!  I didn't opt for a Go-Room and I kind of regretted it but then again, I had more money for shopping!

There were three different elevator banks to get to your specific room.  You need to know which exact elevator you need to get on otherwise it'll be a long walk.  When we get to the room, it was totally basic, no frills and borderline dirty, i.e. gum on the carpet.  But we made the best of it and after awhile, didn't pay much attention.  The room definitely is in dire need of renovated with new furnishings, along with the old school tube TV that hums when it turns on.  The bed surprisingly was fairly comfy though.  The bathroom was quite dull, but spacious, then again, we were in an accessible room.  The shower was a tub but it had rails and a hand held shower head which couldn't stay put, so I had to hold it or literally stand near the wall to be under the stream.  Not to mention, the tub area had no lighting and it didn't help that the shower curtain was made of thick, industrial strength plastic which just let a mild glow of light through.

I honestly don't like eating on the Strip as there is so much foodie goings on beyond the Strip so, I can't comment on any of the restos.  I do remember eating at their cafe a few years ago and it was just standard diner type of food and service.

The gaming was decent and they had all the newer slots with LED screens and whatnot.  I guess they'd rather invest in new slot machines than put an LED TV in the rooms, which I guess makes better business sense.

Their parking garage can be tough to maneuver and easily gets full, same goes with their Valet, unless you happen to be a Diamond or Seven Stars player.

Overall, the Flamingo's location is so ideal as it's located in the heart of the Strip.  If you want to be in the middle of all the action and simply just want a bed to lay your head on in the wee hours of the morning, go for it!

When I ordered the BLT the tomato jam on the bread was too sweet. When I ordered the turkey sloppy joe it was again slightly too sweet and the side Cobb salad it came with was drenched in too much dressing. Also, if you go there for lunch, except to spend at least 1.5 hours there (even if you make a reservation ahead of time).  Service is not very fast at all.

There were 11 of us in the group.  Before dinner, we gathered at the bar to have a pre-dinner drink.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He took several pictures of the group at our request and was patient as we gave him 5 different cameras to take pictures with.  The whole time he cracked jokes and told us he would take as many pictures as we wanted....+1 in my book for the service.

Originally, we had a reservation for 15 people but 4 didn't make it, so the hostess had to rearrange the table.  The hostess came to get us 10 minutes after our original reservation time....not bad for a last minute change like that.

We were seated and our server immediately asked me if we wanted the wine list and who were the wine drinkers in the group.  I gave her the headcount and instructed her to keep our wine glasses full until I said stop.  She obliged and went to get the wine.  I ordered a Malbec from Argentina, it was nice and earthy with hints of blackberry & pepper....perfect! +1 for the wine.

The server made several recommendations for the group and we placed our order.  As a complimentary appetizer, they brought out a tray of 3 different flavors of French Fries.  From what I could tell the flavors were BBQ, Plain, and Garlic & Herbs....served with 3 dipping sauces....BBQ, Horseradish, Ketchup.  They were good, the Garlic & Herbs was the best of the 3.

When the food came out, it was presented beautifully on the plates and cooked exactly how we all ordered it.....that's rare for a group this large.  Normally there is one or two that has to send it back because it wasn't cooked right, but not tonight!  I had the 10 oz Filet and ordered it Medium Well.....it was tender and the knife sliced through it like butter.  It had a nice juicy flavor with a smokey & peppery finish.....a great pairing for the Malbec...nom nom nom!  +1 on the Steaks.  I took a few pics of the Steaks for foodie viewing pleasure.

For a side dish, I ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese....again, great pairing for the entree....I highly recommend it.  The Asparagus was good too.

Nobody had any room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the dinner was a big hit with everyone.

Will I return?  You bet your Steaks I will!!",2010-06-21 18:25:34

I was really hoping Casa Reyna would turn out to be a go-to spot for Mexican dining-out.  We had a pleasant meal here, and overall felt that we got a decent portion for our value. However, our overall experienced was just OK.

We got the salsa sampler with housemade corn chips.  The chips were great! They are house-made and very similar to the chips sold in bags upstairs in the grocery store. Some of the salsas were excellent - my favorite was the mango. Others, like the chipotle salsa, were somewhat disappointing.

We then split an order of the four traditional moles, upon a previous reviewer's suggestion that the portions were enough for two.  And, true to the reviewer's word, the portion was quite generous.  If you're looking for a good quantity of food, this dish is good value.  I enjoyed the adobo mole and the guisado de pollo, but I thought the others were just so-so. 

The ambiance felt strange the night we were there, because it seems made for a lively and rambunctious crowd but the restaurant was very empty when we were there. Also, our service was slow and not very friendly. I would have given the food 4 stars, but the overall ambiance and service left much to be desired.

I suppose it is Arizona Summer and the crowd is generally dead due to the heat.  The place is so pretty though and the vibe is good.  I would probably give it a 5-stars if I visited after the summer.  But I can't do that until I do.

I've had great experiences, but I've also had some pretty terrible ones.  Sometimes the service is great....other times, not so much.  It doesn't seem to matter how busy it is, either.  I've had great service on nights when it's packed, and terrible service when there were only three other people in the place.  

I will say the food has always been good.  The steak/bleu cheese quesadilla is delicious, and the pizza wasn't bad either.  They have a pretty good beer selection too, and if you order a standard drink from the bar (gin and tonic, whiskey on the rocks, etc) the prices are very reasonable, as are the generous portions.  

But here's where I run into trouble.  Last time I was in here I ordered a whiskey and St. Germain on the rocks.  I understand that maybe people don't order this combo very often, but after getting stared at cross eyed by both the server and the bartender I basically had to do everything short of pour it myself.  I ended up having two of them, but when I got the bill the bartender charged me for four separate drinks: two whiskeys and two St. Germains.  Really?  Is that how it works?  Maybe I don't go to bars enough, but that doesn't seem right to me.  So if I ordered two White Russians, would I be charged for six drinks?  Two vodkas, two khaluas, and two glasses of milk?  No thanks.  

I really wish this place could get it's act together because I very much want to like it.  I love the location, it's got a great patio, and it would be a nice place to just sit back and relax.  The problem is that you never know what you're going to get when you walk in.  If you're curious, I'd say yeah, check it out.

tried their green tea matcha creme brulee.. I tried it one time late at night as opposed to around 4 pm.. what a difference .. tasted great in the evening :) 

We order the much anticipated souffle..  though we were told the wait time was 35 minutes at least, it didn't deter us as we were entertained by other desserts. I highly recommend the chocolate souffle with the chocolate sauce

Their macarons are big and delicious but they do not make enough.. meaning it is get what you can get.. depending on what time you get there..

La Maison Kam Fung est plus petite mais le le roulement des chariots est plus rapide. Le service est presque toujours au moins de «relativement occupé» à très occupé. La qualité, je trouve, est très semblable à celle de Rubie Rouge. Maintenant je crois qu'où La Maison Kam Fung l'emporte en revanche est clairement sur la netteté des nappes et du décor qui est un peu moins passé date que l'autre et sur le choix. Il y a un choix plus important en Dim sums à la Maison Kam Fung. Je n'ai pas eut une digestion superbe pour ce lunch mais en revanche pour Rubie Rouge, je n'ai jamais jamais eut un problème à ce niveau. Les toilettes au Rubie Rouge sont plus propres qu'au Kam Fung (et beaucoup plus grande aussi) et cela me porte à croire que la cuisine l'est surement aussi au moins un peu plus. En comparant les deux j'arrive à un Ex-Equo basé sur la propreté, les heures d'ouvertures (plus flexible du Rubies rouge) et sa grandeur absolue VS le choix supérieur et le roulement rapide du Kam Fung. Exemple le toffu chaud avec sirop de gingembre est dispo tous les jours au Kam Fung et seulement les Week-ends au Rubie rouge. 

Chacun son baptême et à mon avis, c'est vraiment le premier où vous aller, des deux ,qui va faire une grosse différence sur votre opinion sur le sujet. 

English: 

I cannot do aything else but compare Kam Fung to Ruby Rouge (on 1003 Clark). Both have stronger points that are completly different to other. I'll compare both with simple things we look at in Dim Sums

Choice. Kam Fung wins with a larger amount of Choice.

Cleaniness: I personnaly feel that on the Decor side, Kam Fung win, but bathroom which is usually an example of how clean the kitchen is, is way bigger and cleaner at Ruby Rouge. I personnally didn't feel that well after my lunch at Kam Fung which never happened at Ruby Rouge.

Opening Hours: I feel there is a clear win from Ruby rouge there. I've been at lot of akward hours and it was always opened. Kam Fung has a more traditionnal opening hours for Dim sums (12 to 3PM and 5PM to 8Pm) . 

Quality: There's a lot of disagreement there, I'm sure, but I personnaly felt it was too similar to have a very strong opinion on the subject. 

Overall, there's pros and cons for both that brings me to the conclusion that it's pretty similar. I'll go there some other time to see if 1) I feel better after or still felt a bit sick. 2) If the quality is different on week-ends.",2012-03-22 00:33:05

But this used to be my go-to place to eat Sushi.  Every time I came, I would sit in a booth, regardless of the amount of people I had in my group. (Two to four people)

However, the one time I came, it wasn't really busy, but I requested a booth, as usual, however the host/waiter said that the booth is designated for groups of 4 and more.  

The reason why this bothers me:  I am not skinny, nor do I pretend I am.  I feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable sitting on the small table, especially if I'm eating AYCE. (Yeah, my fault for being fat and eating AYCE, but a customer should be comfortable regardless of their size.)  

Sitting in a booth with two people has never been an issue for me until that night.  I was really sad because I was super excited to eat some sushi.  I just feel more comfortable eating in a booth than a table.  

Needless to say, I left and went to Oodolee Sushi & Grill down the street.  They sat me in a booth without an issue.  I just don't understand why it was so difficult to sit in a booth when it wasn't immensely busy.

Ok...So, maybe I came at the wrong time, it was Monday, and it was 1:45pm...so maybe that is what happened, but I gotta tell you, this is perhaps the worst dim sum I've ever had. Ouch, right? it's true! I am normally the fat kid in a candy shop when I'm at a dim sum joint, even if it isn't great, I'll eat every little bit. I left nearly two and a half full (of the 5 I ordered) plates on the table.

Here are some specifics for those of you that want to know...

1) The Shrimp Rice noodle...was OK...the shrimps were at least shrimpy and large, and the sauce was passable.
2) The Fried shrimp dumplings. ICK! These are some of my faves, because they are so easy to do, and so hard to screw up...Kam Fung...you screwed them up. It tasted as if someone had deep fried them, let them sit out for a couple hours, microwaved and then soaked them in Oil. They were the greasiest, unappetizing, foul little things ever...yick!
3) The pan fried shrimp and chive patty things...god...if I thought nothing could be worse than the fried shrimp dumplings...i was severely mistaken. These were literally falling apart...in a bad way...they had no flavor other than disgusting.
4) The Xiu Mai (pork dumpling) was tough, hot at least, but you ate it in full chunks, cause you had no choice
5) The char sui bao (bbq pork dumpling) was alright...but pretty flavorless and the pastry was yicky...

Here's the worst of it...The soy sauce...was AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In a Kikoman bottle and was either 19 months past its due date, or was some knock off that was baked in the sun with sonny's secret sauce (lard). The soy sauce was greasy and coated everything with this OIL (think car oil) like quality. Seriously though...it was like the Exxon-Valdez all over again!  Thank god there were no penguins!

Food Rating: 1 Star
Atmosphere: 3.5 Stars
Beer: 4 Stars

I like the concept of 3030 and appreciate their focus on craft beers. When I ordered a beer at the bar, they encouraged me to try a few samples to see what I liked best. The place has a comfortable environment with games  and pinball machines. Unfortunately, the food was a real disappointment. I was here with a party of four and I think everyone was disappointed. 

Here's the good:

- Great local beer menu. I enjoyed a Hop's and Robbers and a Great Lakes Audrey Hopburn.

- Service was good and efficient. Although there was a busboy who was incredibly eager to clear our table (rather annoying).

- Cool, comfortable atmosphere. This is a cool local neighborhood pub. Even free games to play. Mixed crowd - everyone fits in!

And the bad:

- The Tapas menu was a huge disappointment. I tried 3 items: 1) The wings - although there was a modest spice and butter sauce, overall flavour was bland, 2) The sweat bread - One word, Salty and 3) Mushroom Tart - I absolutely love mushrooms but this dish just lacked any real flavour again.  

All in all, this nets to a 2.5 - 3 star experience. 

Note: There is live independent music in the evening. I personally didn't enjoy the music but will exclude from the overall rating as music is just too subjective. Live music could be a plus or minus depending on your personal tastes. If you want a quiet place, you may want to select a pub without live music. Compared to other live music pubs, I didn't find the music incredibly loud or overly distracting.

Mounds of crunchy fresh iceberg lettuce, slices of tomato and cucumber, tossed with just enough creamy white dressing the way salad should be eaten. The basmanti rice drenched in cumin is nice too as well as the naan which is more of a flatbread style rather than the fluffy white Indian naan. Then there are the kabobs, with many different styles that it will take a few visits to try them all unless you go with a large group (recommended!). They are charbroiled to perfection with the chicken spiced delicately and cooked so that it is still juicy and tender inside and dry on the outside. The most impressive thing was the sauce that came with the Beef Qorma, outrageously good! With a depth of flavour rivaling the best curries, yet spiced Afghan style, and different than any other sauce I've tried, it is something to behold. Their menu is extravagant with fish, potatoes, and tandoori, all looking incredibly attractive in the pictures and I'm so sure that they will delight you that five stars is the only choice.

With space at a premium in restaurants, the layout is exemplary. There is no table service, so you have to go up and get your order served in plates on plastic trays.

It is still not my favorite airport, especially if I have a lot of time to kill, but it definitely has improved itself beyond the 2 star rating I previously gave it. 

DEPARTURE
As before, I would still say the airport functions efficiently in terms of major processes. I've never had a bag lost leaving CLE. While for some airlines you do have to take your checked bag to the TSA screening station after going through the check bag process at the airline counter, the process usually moves quickly. 

The AirSpace lounge is a big plus for CLE. It is located just at the start of the B Concourse behind the shops to the right. It is small and has no bathrooms, but has okay food ($), views, and generally friendly staff. Though the 5am opening time is not the strictest rule in the books. AMEX Plat and above card members get in free plus a guest and everyone gets a credit towards food or drinks which is a great perk especially if paired with free access. 

Cleveland has done a nice job with its dead space in the halls by putting up photo galleries and making the walkways generally more aesthetically pleasing. They also took up some space with a nice sized Starbucks leading into A Concourse (there is also one towards the end of C). 

Plugs are still really scare and inconveniently located at the gate areas in some concourses. There are some window seat benches with outlets in the halls that have plugs. 

TSA 
TSA Pre-Check is still nice as you can leave things in your bag, but the Pre lines at CLE seem at times to be longer than the regular or priority lanes. This is partly due to people joining the queue who actually are not eligible, but the traffic still seems heavier at times. Having all airline's Pre passengers go through TSA B I think is the problem. 

ARRIVAL
Signage is improved in baggage claim. There is now a digital board right across from the elevators to tell you which direction to turn. And on my most recent trip, my bag arrived faster than expected. If arriving even at around 9pm though, most all of the shops (e.g., Hudson News etc.) will be shuttered for the night.",2016-08-30 16:46:54

My friend and I came around 10pm on a Saturday night and ordered their Meet Fresh Signature (cold), which had herbal jelly, taro & sweet potato balls, and cream on top of shaved ice. The shaved ice is Taiwanese-styled so it's slushier & icier than a bingsu, and is flavored w/ brown sugar syrup & cream. It was a nice contrast to the grass jelly, which was very smooth & delicate. And I liked that the latter wasn't overly bitter or sweet. The cream also added another layer of depth to the bowl, both texture & flavor-wise, and bonded well w/ the rest of the ingredients. In terms of the taro & sweet potato balls, both were fresh & suitably chewy, but the flavor of the sweet potato balls was not nearly as condensed as the taro one. I actually wasn't sure if it was sweet potatoes or squash, and that was deduced from the orange color. Nonetheless, it was a good bowl of dessert and I would come back for it.

The line-up to order wasn't too bad, but after placing our order, we had to wait 20 mins for that one bowl-- which they just needed to scoop the ingredients in. Two lines of customers ordered and left with their food before we got ours. Maybe they forgot our order but it was ridiculous; I'll just be getting take-out next time.",2018-04-22 20:17:11

Anyway, that's just kind of setting the scene for this place and its surroundings.

Burger Mania is just sort of depressing.  It has weird decorations, like this Uncanny Valley hot dog statue that is covering itself in mustard and ketchup and looking right into your eyes, begging to be eaten so that it can end its miserable life.  It wants the sweet, sweet release of death so badly.  For some reason, below the neon sign reading ""Burger Mania"" with burnt out letters, there's these weird, I don't know, mascots, one of which is a dinosaur.

So, we were meeting with my in-laws here for dinner, and so my husband grabs the teeny, I grab the booster chair and diaper bag and we head in towards their table. All of a sudden, my foot flies out from behind me, and as I try to catch my balance, I end up smashing into a table full of hot food. (if you've had Korean food, you know that the majority of food is served scorching hot in burning hot stone bowls/dishes).

Seriously?! I'm not clumsy, and I felt so bewildered at what just happened....

Yeah, so what happened was one of the waiters had spilled something prior to our arrival and decided NOT TO CLEAN IT UP, and forgot about it. And not like a tiny little splash of water or something, it looked like a good sized dish of some dark black sauce had been upended in their entry way on their dark floor. 

After the poor party whose table I had crashed into was ok, and I was ok - and felt terrible about almost falling into their food, as well as rolling my ankle while trying to catch my balance and having a minor burn/scratch on my finger (probably from contact with aforementioned stone bowl), I hurried to our table. At this point, I was pretty upset because WHO LEAVES A TON OF FOOD ON THE FLOOR at a restaurant?!?!? I usually am the one who holds our baby, too - and can you imagine what would have happened if I had been holding the baby when I slipped? Or what if it was my husband who had slipped instead of me?

I was expecting the waitstaff to be extremely apologetic for what happened. Uh, yeah no. The waiter who had spilled the sauce came up and basically said ""Oh, I'm so sorry, it was my fault. I didn't clean up the spill. You're ok?""
And that was IT. 

Our actual waitress said NOTHING, didn't even check to see if I was ok. The manager? I don't know if they even have one, but no manager made an appearance. There was literally nothing done to remedy the situation, aside from the measly apology by the one waiter. If the restaurant staff had handled this situation differently, I would probably not feel so strongly as I do!

So yes, while the food was ok, my whole experience was completely ruined. On top of that, on a 50* night, all of the female waitstaff had on the shortest shorts. Seriously? Just poor taste and non-existant professionalism.",2014-11-25 05:16:44

They have noticeably gone downhill. On my recent visit, none of the employees were in the front. I waited over 10mins by the register to see if anyone would show up but nope. I left to a different boba shop and was warmly greeted/assisted in picking out a drink by a friendly server. Just like how it's supposed to be. Please note this happened during their business hours (around 6PM on week night). Employees are not as friendly/personable as they used to be. I still like how the drinks comes out quick. Usually less than 3 mins. 

As far as the drinks goes, I only get Jasmine milk tea with boba. I always make sure to get it light sugar because their drinks are a bit too sweet for me. I have tried those dessert drinks and I'm not a fan. It's unique but it depends on personal preference. Their green tea smoothie was really good. I must say it was better than Starbuck's green tea frappucino. 

Their boba used to be cooked just right. It's super inconsistent now and most of the time just a clump of mush. I noticed they run out of boba A LOT.

lunch was $16.50, and the food was all fresh and delicious. there was Asian food, sushi, pasta, cold cuts, pizza, Mexican food, south/southwest bbq, and a lot of desserts.

custom mini-donuts - YEAH.
chicken-fried steak - YEAH.
flank steak - YEAH.
make your own tacos - YEAH.
tortilla soup - YEAH.
sweet mashed potatoes - YEAH.

I won't give it 5 stars because the staff was initially very rude to us. we had some friends who were supposed to come join us later, bringing our crew from 6 to 9 or 10, and they UTTERLY REFUSED to clear aside an adjacent table for our additional comrades, saying something about ""stations"" not being open. by ""stations"" I think they meant tables.

there were maybe ten tables occupied in the whole restaurant, so that is about 20% occupancy. WHAT THE CRAP, Mirror Universe employees? in the end it turned out that those additional people flaked out on us, so minus 50 points to them as well (ah, if only Yelp let you rate friends), but still, there was no reason for this behavior.

the guy who got us drinks was nice though.

so, in closing: food is worth 4 stars, staff is a 3; I'm rounding down to a 3.

The experience just seems more personal. There was 6 in our group and we tried a variety of items off the menu. I got the Island dog with tater tots. There was an order of the Spam sliders we shared. 
The place is decorated island style. I have been to the Hawaii many times and when you go to the outer islands this is just what you might find. We were there on Saturday and after the lunch hour so the place only had a few people eating. This gave me the opportunity to talk to the owner. He is really a super nice person. He shared how he got the idea from some time spent in Hawaii. 
The food. I have eaten at a several places around Phoenix that specialize in hot dogs. I am not going to mention names but they are all well reviewed places. Everything from a hot dog on a bun with fixings to a place that advertised Chicago style hot dogs. Maui Dog was by far better than the rest. It is not just a hot dog or a brat with some fixings. It is a combinations of tastes that make the experience. Who would of thought coconut, mango, pineapple would be good on a hot dog? Yes they are sweet. If you don't like sweet they can make your hot dog to order just ask. When you eat their hot dog or brat you don't just taste the hot dog or brat. The mixture of flavors when you bite into one of their hot dogs is what makes this place so unique. 
I live in Peoria and it is a 45 min drive to eat at Maui Dog. I will be back to see if they taste as good the second time as the first. 

The place was clean. The food was good. The service was good. The price for what you  got was good. The location? Need one closer to Peoria. I will be back.  If you just want a hot dog. Fix it at home. Yuck! If you like something different see them.",2011-06-19 22:47:49

I read all the glowing reviews of Pop Up, and I thought, thank you jesus, a great pizza place in Las Vegas to go along with the very very very few other great pizza places. But alas, THIS IS NOT IT! 
Not even close.

The sauce tastes like the spaghetti sauce you'd get at Vons. The crust is nice and soft, but not fully-evolved: too much floury flavors. And a touch too thick.

The mozzarella is so not there, it may as well not be there.

The pepperoni is so large it looks more like salami, and doesn't have that spicy kick that puts the damn ""pepper"" in pepperoni!

It doesn't end there. 
Their business model is as retarded as the Secret Pizza place at the Cosmo.
They don't have a menu.
They have only one size pizza: 18 inch.
They clearly missed the memo from high school business class that says: give the consumer choices and make him feel like he's getting what he wants. 

Oh, and I almost forgot, it's expensive....almost 20 bucks for an 18 inch (we don't have any other size) pie.
No deals.No pick-up specials.

In the end, I'm depressed.

The basement has a cool old bank vault but is deafeningly loud.

Second time. Popped in on a Friday night. 30 min wait for a table unless I wanted communal seating. Since I don't play well with others, we went across the street to tipsy.

The third time we went for lunch and got right in. They have a few lunch specials where you can choose between cheese or fancy pizzas.  We ordered the chips with vinegar. They were light and crispy but needed a dipping sauce. Good thing we ordered buffalo wings with blue cheese for dipping. The wings were crispy and flavorful. Finally we ordered a pizza with basil and mozzarella. I was pretty disappointed in the pizza. Parts of the crust were burnt.  There was minimal basil. It was just okay. Our 11 inch pizza was $13.

For instance, it seems that their is no other choices of raw milk camembert  than their own and this is a cheese that benefit so much from the raw milk.

This place is swank as hell but casual enough that you don't feel out of place if you're slumming it in jeans and a t-shirt.  Let the rich yuppies look all dolled up and sexy, I'm here to EAT.

The second you get in there's a whirlwind of chaos as it was quite packed and people are standing near the bar waiting for their tables.  As we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, we were offered champagne and apps at the bar.  Sure it took 15 minutes for the bartender to notice us but it was so busy that I guess that was to be expected.  What arrived were deep fried pig ears (nice and fatty), some garlic pastry balls (kinda bland and boring) and some really nice beef stuffed olives.

When we where finally seated, our waitress was super friendly and you could tell she was genuinely excited about the food.   We had heard that Buca had the best pasta in town so we were equally excited to try everything, or at least die trying.

We started with an assortment of chacuterie which was pretty fun to pick at and was all pretty damn tasty all around, but did not prepare me for what was coming next.  

Not often am I completely BLOWN AWAY by a dish, but my god my life has not been the same since.  For a measly $58 you can get a pizza so incredible you will never enjoy another slice of anything in your life.  The Bianca Truffle was absolutely delicious with a beautifully light but crispy crust, earthy goodness truffle flavorings accompanied by raw egg yolk brushed across the surface of tellegio cheese.  My lower half is tingling just thinking about it. 

Anyways, our mains came and between the Carbonara, the Polenta, award winning Duck egg pasta and some sweet dish I don't remember, I would have to say that Buca is serious about their food and it freaking shows.

After that, we ordered a cheese plate along with some dessert and my stomach was about ready to explode.  Alas I regret nothing and would do it again given the opportunity. 

My only gripe with the place is they charged us for the apps at the bar while we were waiting, but never really asked us if we wanted any.   The way they spoke, it seemed as though the offered it to everyone while they waited, but I guess you don't  accumulate a $700 bill on giving out free food.

The ambiance of this place is definitely hip and cool with a side of night club. The strange thing is that the back area has long tables that are separated so you are basically sitting with another group of diners.

The ""rules"" here are a bit bull and I knocked off a star for poor management decisions. We were sitting with 3 people who only wanted to drink because they had eaten an early dinner and the waiter/manager flatly refused to allow half of us to do the AYCE if everyone didn't. We ended up needing to move 5 feet away from the rest of our party just to get AYCE. Needless to say I was a bit upset from the start. 

On top of the early issues our waiter was a bit odd because I told him to bring us random items from the menu so we could try anything. Within 3 or 4 dishes we had 2 orders of fish tacos which I figured was a mistake. Not 3 more dishes passed until we had ANOTHER order of fish tacos! I mean they were really tasty but come on! The standouts of the menu were the lobster taquitos, and the mac and cheese daddy sliders. The Jack and Coke skeweres were also delicious but a few dishes were forgettable. At $19.99 AYCE it is certainly a tasty deal considering the choices but I'm hoping if I ever go back the service/management will make a better impression.",2011-02-05 09:21:36

I had already pored over the menu online and knew I wanted a smattering of oysters, foie gras, cheese, terrine, etc. and I didn't know how I was going to choose. 

Logistically, the restaurant is incredibly hidden away, and all the signs on the main casino floor take you to Bouchon Bistro which is a casual cafe. We had to ask the concierge where to go and he told us to take the elevator upstairs to the guest floor and then walk down a long hallway? Yikes. After a short wait we were taken to a table by the service station... not ok. Asked to move to a nicer booth (the restaurant was not packed, and it was my birthday after all ;) ) and we were surrounded by couples and other birthday celebrations. 

I started with an excellent glass of sparkling wine and 1/2 dozen oysters, 2 of differing varieties. My mom and I shared the 2.5 oz. foie gras terrine which was soo smooth and delicious it was basically like eating meat flavored butter (which someone should invent). We all ordered a salad, I had the Salade Maraîchère au Chèvre Chaud, and my dad had the Salade de Cresson et d'Endives au Roquefort et Noix, watercress with roquefort and walnuts, except it didn't come with any roquefort so we had to flag our waitress down to ask for it on the side. He had a ribeye special for his entree, my mom had a HUGE bowl of the most delicious moules frites I've ever had, and I had an appetizer portion of the duck confit because I was stuffed to the gills at that point already! We wanted the bone marrow as well but sadly they were out of it that evening. We also ordered a 1/2 carafe of a California Pinot, they have a great wine list in all sizes btw, and they brought out a complimentary lemon tart for my birthday. 

The food was great, rustic but refined French cuisine, but the service could have been better. I would still jump at the chance to go back again, and for a nice restaurant on the Strip, it doesn't break the bank compared to some other options.",2014-11-25 01:19:32

The decor was nice and they seemed friendly initially.  My girlfriend and I came for pedicures, we were told it would be a couple minutes. Well, 45 minutes later and soaking my feet for 15 minutes, still had not started my pedicure. It was not busy, just seemed like they did not have enough staff, so I decided to be patient. The pedicure was not great, they did not even spend that much time on my feet, it felt very rushed. 
They gave me a bottle of water while I got my pedi,which I was grateful for! It was a hot day and much needed. The bottle did have a rounded bottom and kept falling, so I tucked it into the side of my pedi chair. No big deal.
Here's where things went to hell. My pedi is done, my experience is that you can usually sit until your polish dries (plus NO ONE WAS WAITING AND THEY HAD EMPTY CHAIRS) !!! One of the girls comes up to us, literally as I had just finished my pedi and asks us to leave. Um okay? WOW. We were not talking or being brats, we were just sitting... really took me off guard. Then we go to pay. I put the bottle of water on the counter, forgetting about the rounded bottom b/c I am pulling out my wallet from my purse. The water bottle falls, and there is water on my, my dress and on the floor, apparently I did not tighten the lid. Of course I grabbed the bottle, so maybe 1/3 of it fell. It was not a ton. I'm like oh my gosh I am so sorry, the male technician (never had any interaction with him prior to this), gives me the DIRTIEST look. I mean I was already so embarrassed. He wipes up the water, never offers me a towel or anything. The whole time hes being really nasty to me about it. It was an accident and I immediately apologized. It was so embarrassing and the way it was handled by the staff was some of the worst customer service I have received. It was pretty degrading. All of this over water.. really?

The food is delicious and you can tell they took a long time smoking and cooking their various meat options. The prices are comparable to eating at a restaurant in central downtown, with a sandwich floating around the $11 mark. The ribs are on the more expensive side ($21 for half rack, $42 for full), but they are generous with their portions and worth a try.

Yes they are a bit expensive but I have come to realize almost everywhere that sells a more gourmet burger you are going to spend 10+ on it and, it certainly was a much better option/value than the two stinky tacos I got the first time.

We opted for the Bruschetta and it was amazing. Four pieces came topped with big chunks of mozzarella cheese and then covered high with chopped tomatoes, bits of basil, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar. There were so many tomatoes that we ended up saving them to put on our pizza. It is definitely something I would order again. I opted for the Spinach, Artichoke, and Feta thin crust pizza. It came piping hot and tasted soooo good. The leftover bruschetta topping paired well with the outer edges (where the toppings were a little more sparse).  Hubby ordered the individual sized Italian Beef deep dish pizza. It came with his choice of a side item and he opted for the garlic Parmesan french fries. His pizza was really good and had a perfect balance between the sweet peppers and the hot peppers. It came with a side of au jus to dip in. His french fries were perfectly crispy and did not skimp on the garlic and Parmesan. They were served with a side of ranch dressing.

The menu has a picture for each dish, which helps you in deciding what to order. The prices are also very reasonable. Less than $10 for a noodle dish.

For my first visit, I tried their chengdu style zhajiang noodle with a side order of chicken gizzard. The noodle was cooked perfectly; not too soft, not too chewy. I asked for regular spicy level and found that it had a slight amount of heat, which kept building as I ate more. However, it wasn't too spicy, where it would make it hard for you to eat. I've had sichuan style food that's way spicier where it literally numbed your tongue and made you sweat like crazy. The noodle dish from this place didn't do that to me, so if you like super spicy food, the regular heat level might not satisfy you, so ask for extra spicy. The chicken gizzard was tasty (though it was not a chicken gizzard only, but is rather a chicken giblet) and was actually spicier than the noodle.

They gave you plenty of food and I was struggling to finish my bowl, but if you do need more food, you can ask for extra noodle for free. For drinks, they gave us sweet mung bean soup, which helped cool off the heat and which they would refill.

The only downside is this restaurant is located in the same small plaza, where tea station and ichiza are, so parking can be a challenge during busy time. However, you can always park at the bigger chinatown plaza next door and walk over.",2017-11-27 20:46:17

The table next to us ordered the soup with muscles and shrimp. It looked so good. So if I ever go to this place again that is what I will order.

That's fine, it's just that kind of place.  The sidewalk patio seating looked GREAT but, it was full so, I couldn't enjoy the people watching.

I ordered the special, based on recommendation from the bar tender, the Tuna Wrap.  It was basically a tuna sandwich in a tortilla....sounds lame

but, it wasn't.  the Tuna salad was very nicely spiced and the wrap was quite good.  Very generous portion but, I was hungry!!! what could I do?  I ate the whole darn thing (oink oink)

The beer selection was nice, with a variety of local brews, as well as commercial taps and specialty beers.

Service at the bar was good.  The bartender was VERY experienced and knew what he was doing.  Friendly, good at small talk but, not annoying and bothering too much.

The ambiance....meh.  Take it or leave it.  Too ""themed"" for my own tastes but, that's just the kind of place it is.  I would definitely come here again, especially with friends for dinner before night on the town

The food quality here is definitely higher than the standard Greek fare, although it also comes with a higher price. The ambiance is nice and it's usually busy, which gives it a very lively feel.

On our latest visit though, I had some issues. First, the place was clearly understaffed. After waiting 15 minutes for a table, we were seated but had to wait about 20 minutes before we go any service. It was a weekday, and the place was surprisingly packed, but the lack of service that night was a bit disappointing.

More importantly though, and the reason why I'd seriously reconsider visiting here again, was that the food was INCREDIBLY salty. Sure, everything was tasty, but they cook with more salt than a Chinese restaurant. I felt it in my mouth the rest of the night and even the next morning. My mother, who suffers from high blood pressure, felt it almost immediately, and actually had to stop eating because she was getting a headache. This place must be salt-crazy, because they even have salt shakers on the table!! It's incredible. If they're trying to give their patrons heart-attacks, then they're well on their way to succeeding.

After a pleasant surprise of a Sno Ono treat at  church, we decided to try Custom Built after seeing it highlighted on Yelp.  It's located within the ""maze"" of shops at Flamingo and Grand Canyon - i gotta admit, i don't care for the location especially since i hit the nearby LVAC 2-3 times the week and thus a temptation post-gym.

The basic concept is like Subway/Quizno's - they press out the dough and then you choose one of 4 sauces ( red/spicy red, pesto , alfredo ) then one or all 5 cheeses;  then about 20 toppings to choose from, again, have as any as you want - they pop it into the wood(?) oven - a couple minutes and presto !  MY PIZZA

we went with red sauce, mozzarella, asiago, sausage, meatball and pepperoni

2nd - pesto, Gorgonzola, Parmesan and sausage ( i wish they had shrimp for this one ) 

GF also had a custom salad

We were pleasantly surprised - decent stuff !  We both preferred the crust edges compared to the crust in the middle portion ( we like the blistering on the edges ) 
the sauce, especially the pesto, very good !  The combo of pesto and Gorgonzola was a hit.

$9 for each pizza but we did get 1/2 off my pizza for fathers day ...cool !

A little petty - they should cut the pizza into 1/8's not 1/4's but i'm sure they will do that for us next visit.

We will return

It's been probably over 10 years since I ate here once as a tourist.  As I was driving by, heading to a familiar place, I decided to give it a go and try something different.  I was glad I did.  It's standard Tex/Mex.  The food could use a little more spice, but I assume they are directing their seasoning toward the people who want the Tex/Mex flavor without any zing.

Chips and salsa were completely average.  The salsa tasted like it came from a bottle of Pace salsa - nothing special there.  For the entree, I had the Pork Rostistado with ""spicy verde sauce"" or so the menu says.  The meal came with rice, black beans with some cheese sprinkled on the beans, and some great sauteed vegetables - zucchini and carrots - and the standard container of tortillas. As for the ""spicy verde sauce,"" well it wasn't spicy.  The plain black beans had more zing than the verde sauce.  I asked my server for some Cholula and the dish took on a spicier flavor, more the way I like it.  The pork was very tasty, and in all, it was a good meal.

Of course, going to a different place means you have to try dessert just to see if the place is on the up and up.  I got their Banana Napoleon that was highly recommended by my server.  It was layers of banana pudding, sweetened, fried tortilla squares, and fresh bananas and whipped cream. She was right.  It was superb, but way too big!  OK, I made the sacrifice and finished it so there was no waste of food from me.

Service was excellent.  My server was a delightful young woman, very attentive, and she brought me refills of my iced tea promptly and without me having to request it.

I was weary ordering at first (still getting over food poisoning from a different pizza restaurant) but I decided to since the other half wanted it. 

The pizza was good, the crust was not to thick, not to thin, and yummy. The sauce was just enough and not to sweet or over powering. However the pizza arrived almost cold, the cheese seemed to of coagulated so needless to say it was almost falling off the pizza when you grabbed a slice, and it wasnt cut that great. BUT it was really good tasting, I ordered it with mushrooms and it tasted great. They could of put a bit more on there however it was good overall, and the other half liked it alot.

The chicken fingers were okay, a little overcooked but still pretty decent. Although some (about 3-4)  were super small closer to chicken nugget size but they were okay overall. The ranch was super yummy though which is a plus because I am picky with my ranch haha, and there was a good amount to which is another plus. I would recommend they poke a home in the Styrofoam container the fingers came in to let some heat out (my container literally was almost melted)

The fries.. were soggy. But they were cheap so not a big deal. They also didnt seem to be salted which was sad. They didnt put any air holes in the container so the fries got soggy. They looked good I just wish they hadnt been soggy and that they came salted.

For exactly $8 you can get a burrito with your choice of meat and all the toppings your heart desires, and they're all fresh and high quality. Even when the line is fairly long, they're very quick to move everyone through. The ""normal"" size burrito is still pretty huge (coming from a guy who eats quite a lot usually), but no matter how stuffed full it is, they always seem to wrap it up nicely, and it never seems to fall apart either. They also do a great job at distributing the toppings throughout the burrito so each bite is similar to the last..way too many times I've had burritos from other places where you get one bite of all meat then one of just guacamole, etc.
You start with your choice of tortilla (white, wheat, or spinach) and meat (chicken, beef, steak, veggie or the special of the week), and then you load it up with what toppings you want including cheese, guacamole, salsas, pico de gallo, rice, black beans, refried beans, mushrooms, zucchini/squash, lettuce, jalapenos, banana peppers, tomatoes, onions, and probably more I'm forgetting. I usually order the chicken, and for toppings I love the mushrooms, which have a great meaty flavor, and I bet would make even a veggie burrito really good- although I've never ordered one.

Intro. My amour, the ever spontaneous and great-researcher, found out about this restaurant (on Yelp!!!!) and we decided to go there as we were actually 2 blocks away. He called and was informed there were tables for 2 but no reservations would be taken. We quickly walked. My amour said that there was a nose outside the restaurant and I noticed it first. As you walk in, you think it's going to be a dingy, small place, but as you turn a quick corner into the restaurant, it's expansive and tall and BUSY! We did got a lovely, secluded spot and I immediately loved it.

Food. My amour said the food was nothing special, but for me, it was so very, very, good. It could have been the let-down I experienced at Fare Bistro and so I was willing to think any other restaurant was better. Or, it could have been simple Italian food done well. Either way, I was not disappointed. For appetizers, we had the Fritto Misto (which was sort of a disappointment because it was one fried shrimp and one fried calamari. I believe Fritto Misto is supposed to be a medley of vegetables and none other than the Zucchini Flower). We also had Scotty's Meatballs which is just one large meatball in tomato sauce and bruschetta which was very good.

For the main, I had the duck leg which was soooo very tasty and tender. I am a big duck fan so despite the ordinary appetizers, I was in love with my duck. My amour had the cod in papillote which was also very tasty. The fish is not fishy, but tender. My amour also had the risotto as a primi piatti which was divine. The risotto was not al dente which is how I normally like mine cooked, but it was delicious nonetheless. And for dessert, we shared the Tiramisu which was a fitting end to a lovely night.

Service. AMAZING! We were served by (I think his name was Zack), and he just made the whole evening. 

Ambiance. Busy. Noisy. Walls are kind of dingy, but you're here for that homey kind of place. 

All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anybody in the area. I do not think this restaurant is expensive, so you are going to get your value for your money.

There is always a risk when you infrequently visit a spot that is regularly frequented by so many others. You might not understand the rhythm of the establishment. I know up front Alexi's won't give me all the breakfast syrup I need and I'll have to beg for more. A pet peeve of mine, but no big deal. On this day, however, I felt totally neglected. Odd, because friendly service is key for the survival of an independent restaurant like this. No coffee refills until I was ready to leave. The water I requested upon ordering never arrived. Just an empty coffee cup with breakfast for me, I guess. My pancakes were cold by the time I received the extra syrup I needed. I noted some other patrons receiving much better treatment. At one point I felt like a kindergartener repeatedly waiving for the attention of my teacher, only to be ignored in favor of more popular classmates. 

You shouldn't have to work so hard to be served breakfast. I just wanted to relax and sip some coffee and do some reading.

The food was fine. Be warned. Some of the Yelp photos of breakfast specials are quite old. The going rate is now $4.99 (weekdays before 11:00 a.m.) for most specials. Still a good deal.

It would be like docking points from a pizza joint for having a dried up hamburger. Check the sign, buddy. If it says ""Buffalo Wild Wings"", then chances are that's the only safe food to eat.

The atmosphere is dull and lifeless. Unless there's a game going on. And then there's too much atmosphere. If you're lucky the screams and cheers of the other diners will drown out the fact that your food is like a half an hour late and your sprite needs a refill.

The price is appalling. Unless it's a Wing Tuesday or Boneless Thursday. In which case it's only semi-appalling, if you have no bones with paying extra for a cup of ranch or bleu cheese. Look, not to be a pain in the ass, but you have vats of them in the back. Maybe if you had a little man sitting there in the back heaving and hoeing to pump that artery-clogging goodness in its tiny plastic cups, then I wouldn't mind so much. But I shouldn't have to pay an extra 50 cents because you can't afford to offer 40 cent wings or 50 cent legs three times a week. Take a fucking economics class, you bum.",2008-07-16 04:34:48

I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in.  It's colorful, packed with all kinds of treats, and the girls working there were friendly.  I saw the list of today's flavors and I sampled both the Tart 'n Tasti frozen yogurt and the Papaya .  I am more of a fro-yo girl than an ice cream girl, but I liked the mild flavor of the Papaya... However, I do see why there are some negative reviews depicting Tasti as bland and lacking flavor... I think if you don't compare it to the taste of full sugar ice-cream and you keep in mind that this is a lower calorie treat, you will like it.  At least I did! 

Anyways, I ended up ordering a medium cup of half Tart 'n Tasti and half Papaya with pomegranate and coconut toppings.  Both toppings were fresh and tasted great... and there was just the right amount to enjoy a bit of everything in each bite.  I didn't calculate how many calories my order had, but I can tell you that it tasted great and that it was the perfect late afternoon snack.  It filled me up for a few hours before dinner and I didn't feel guilty eating it either!

I noticed Tasti's topping bar after I ordered which was probably a good thing.  It was cool to see that though; i felt like a kid in a candy store with easy access to so many treats!  

I also spoke to Jonathan, the owner, during my visit.  He informed me that Tasti is working with several non-profits in the Valley, that they do birthday parties, and that they've got a ton more fun stuff in the works.  I brought home some tasti cannolis for Jared, I have a feeling he may not be as ""crazy for Tasti"" as I am, but to each their own...",2010-02-28 04:45:34

I said her, could you please give me back my paperwork it took her 5 minutes or so to find it. 
While I was there, there was a baby about 2 weeks old that had to get some blood work done and they were there 1/2 hour before I got there. When I was leaving I held the door open for a family with a small child and a baby weeks old. I called my husband to chat and he said to go to the Sonora Quest on 7st and Bell Rd so I did. While I was waiting, the family that I held the door open at 27 Ave Sonora Quest came walking in. We said hi to each other. The man said to me we left and came here because the tall phlebotomist man at the 27 Ave Sonora Quest was hurting that 2-week old baby and she was screaming and the mother of the baby told the man to stop squeezing her leg you are hurting her.

The restaurant was remodeled and hardly recognizable once inside. The decor was great considering it is a Red Lobster. The compliments cease here.

When my family arrived, the greeter said nothing to us. She simply stood behind her station and looked at us. I took advantage of the delay so that my son could use the restroom. However, once we arrived out of the restroom, my fiance was still standing there waiting to be helped. I asked what was taking so long and the greeter said that she was waiting for someone to seat us. First impression was off to a great start, but I let it slide thinking that the restaurant was not prepared for the afternoon rush.

Once seated, the waitress took forever to get to us. Roughly fifteen (15) minutes passed before she returned to ask what we wanted to drink. By this time, we knew exactly what we wanted for the rest of our visit. About ten (10) minutes later, the waitress returned with our drinks, but somehow my fiance's drink was left at the bar. I am not even sure how this was the case considering it was a variety of iced tea. She said she would be right back with it...

My son, in the mean time, had to use the bathroom again. It took roughly ten (10) to fifteen (15) minutes for him to do his business. When we returned, the waitress was still M.I.A. About five (5) minutes later, she returned with our salads, but no drink for my fiance. To add insult to injury, the salad was warm. Furthermore, the waitress, upon being told that she left my fiance's drink at the bar, laughed and said, ""I'll get it in a minute."" 

Following this, and noting that the other waitresses/waiters were tending to their guests, we promptly got up and walked out. This was a complete waste of our time (nearly an hour of waiting for food and over an hour total). This is only the second time I have walked out on a restaurant having eaten nothing.

I came in to buy a new case for my iPhone, which turned into buying two new cases (one for my new ""let's run a marathon for a charity venture""). I was exhausted from a stressful morning, so I wasn't quite with it....so I am putting the onus on ""Silvia"", the Apple ""Specialist"" who was ""helping"" me. Help is putting it mildly. I had to deal with her typical condescending attitude (yes, I know...it's an Apple store).

In any case, she proceeded to sell me two iPod touch cases without correcting me. If I had a normal day, I would've picked up on it, but I was put through the ringer in earlier in the day. ""Silvia"" should've known better than to sell me two different iPod touch cases for my iPhone4. 

There was one positive though. She did help get my phone out of it's current case, which was a bit challenging, but then she undid her kind deed by complaining about how she chipped her nail to other customers and blamed me for it while I walked away. 

This morning, I came back, to return my cases. I saw ""Silvia"", but I chose to go with another ""Specialist"", who was happy to take care of me. This ""Specialist"" then informed all the other ""Specialists"" that they need to keep an eye on what they are selling, and make sure it's for the right item.

To the new ""Specialist"": Thank you. To ""Silvia"": I hope you took a lesson from this.

I was shocked and the experience was unforgettable. I felt like Cinderella. I never imagined we'd return so soon, but he planned another dinner for us, this time, another couple joined us. I slipped on my glass slippers and eagerly awaited the night to unfold. Anticipation was high leading up to our 6:30 dinner reservation. It felt like Christmas. Santa didn't appear, but his elves were whipping up special treats in the kitchen. There was no question, we returned for the 15-course degustation menu ($435), complete with bread and mignardises carts. Our friend also chose the $295 wine pairing. It is the bottom tier, but the wines were outstanding and perfectly paired. The husband and I opted for two half bottles, Chardonnay and a very special Red from France.

The bread cart immediately seduced us and we quickly tumbled down the rabbit hole. The four of us were giddy as can be, we were blown away again and again by the refinement of the experience.  It is glorious. It is euphoric. It is even obscene. However, this is no ordinary meal. It is art. Delectable, delicious art.

Cream of kale cabbage over delicate vegetable gelee. Kale has never tasted so good. The textures of this dish are extraordinary. It was a wonderful way to excite the palate.

Violet artichoke and foie gras salad with parmesan shavings. This was a fine dish, but not one to cause me to swoon.

Symphony of osetra caviar with salmon tartare, chilled sweet corn soup, and king crab on crustacean gelee. This was served as one breathtaking presentation, however, it counted as three-courses. The caviar and sweet corn will forever fill my dreams. It was sweet and salty and utterly perfect. I was blown away. I consumed more caviar with these dishes than I had in my existence prior to this meal.

Semi-soft boiled egg florentine with Comte cheese sauce. This was loved by everyone in the group, but me. It's funny, too, because the soft boiled egg was a favorite during our last dinner. That version seemed to have enough to offset the richness of the egg. This one felt like I had consumed a dozen farm fresh eggs. 

Seared scallop with lemongrass, broccolini and soybean sprouts cooked as risotto. This dish was well executed. Apparently, I've been eating overcooked scallops my whole life. These were scrumptiously medium rare.

Thin veloute of porcini mushrooms with jasmine rice cream, crispy matsutake and foie gras ravioli, veal raviolis cooked in broth with white truffle. This was my favorite course(s). I found the white truffle that perfumed the air completely intoxicating. Each preparation was stellar, but the ravioli with the matsytake (japanese mushroom) and foie gras was the most tasty morsel of the night. Possibly the most tasty bite ever; definitely, in recent memory.

Roasted spiny lobster with green curry and fresh coriander. Collectively, we agreed this was the weakest dish of the evening. The lobster was tough and stringy. It looked beautiful, but it was far less satisfying upon digging in.

Caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy. This dish delivered big flavors in the best way. It was another favorite of the night. It had a delightfully unexpected  umami thing going on. Plus, it was sugar and spice and everything nice.

Duo of duck breast and foie gras, five spice sweet and sour grapes with ginger. On paper this course sounds the most to my liking, and don't get me wrong, it was outstanding, but the flavors were similar to those I've had before. I really appreciate when my tastebuds are tempted by something unexpected. That said, this was extremely comforting, especially paired with Joel Robuchon's famous mashed potatoes which we insist is actually potato infused butter.

Coconut lime parfait topped with elderflower liquer gelee and compressed pineapple. The pineapple was incredibly intense. It was so refreshing. It went beautifully with the dollop of cilantro syrup in the center of the plate.

Caramelized vanilla apples tarte tatin with calvados ice cream. The apples in this dessert must have been the same variety that Eve tempted Adam with, I've never had a juicier or more crisp bite of apple. If it is possible to taste a season in a bite, this accomplishes it - no doubt.

You would think we would be unable to consume another bite, but there was still the dessert cart. Calling it a cart, hardly does it justice. It's truly magical. It's hard to believe we showed restraint when choosing about two dozen selections, plus, tiramisu, rum balls and creme brulee.

Perhaps the coolest thing about Cashman Field is that it was featured in the popular video game 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'.

Okay, enough with the history lessons. Let's get down to business.

Cashman Field is all around a pretty mediocre ballpark. You can find better built ones across the country and even in the AA League or Single A League. A lot of people like to complain about the parking situation at Cashman, but compared to major league parks, it's a breeze. Yes, walking down and up that large hill can be a bit of a chore especially after a few pre-game cervezas but hey, you're there to watch an athletic competition anyway.

Beers are appropriately ball park priced at around $7 each. The food available is not of the best quality and is overpriced. At one 51s game I attended I was absolutely famished, so I snagged myself a philly cheesesteak for the sum of $8 and disappointingly wolfed down the sub-par ingredients with vigor. I also saw that Papa John's was present at the park and selling tiny personal pizzas for the sum of $11 each.

If you're sitting in the cheap seats prepare to be uncomfortable as they can pretty much be described as metal bleachers. Another downside to the ballpark is that there is no outfield seating, however they do allow kids to run around and play in the grassy areas by each foul post. I thought this was a bit odd as it can tend to be dangerous at times when foul balls come flying in.",2014-03-28 18:58:40

I had the Bone-in Filet and the Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese....these are my favorite Mastro dishes.  I sampled the Carpaccio, which was phenomenal....it's soo tender and full of flavor.  For Dessert, we all shared 1,000,000 calories worth of dishes (Buttercake, Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Cake, Whipped Cream)....but it's all good when you're dining in a top notch restaurant with great people.

I forgot to mention that we put away 2 bottles of Wine during dinner and a nice glass of Port at the end of dinner.  A perfect way to end an evening.

Tip - Don't forget that Mastro's is not cheap.  It's a fine dining joint....expect to pay for it.

always very friendly staff, we had great prompt service on a Sunday after church. had a party of 9 and we were sat right away without calling ahead. 

ordered appitzers:
boneless wings - normal breaded chicken bites, nothing special, but delicious( i recomend getting the honey pepper sauce! yum!
pretzel pub sticks - they ususally are aweosme, but this time around they were gross! not cooked enough or something, was off the mark that day.

4-cheese mac with honey pepper chicken tenders - 3 people ordered this on at our table and everyone loved it. it's usually what i get here but wanted to try something else. i recomend this dish! its delicious mac and crispy tenders definitely satisfy and leave you wanting more chicken strips!

i had a crispy chicken breast on mashed potatoes and gravy topped with onion strings. it was fantastic, flavors all over the place delicious and savory. i w2ould get again.

wife had a steak - was way over cooked and tasted of burnt grill flavor - i don't think she would recomend getting it again.

In the past when I've been helped by other associates, I'd receive the same quality of service. Today they happened to just get in some new printers, so it took a while to setup the prints.

I instead had to wait at my table for another three minutes so my waiter could bring it to be. Stupid protocol.

So, I had a sweet tooth and desired a CAB Mud Pie. Of course they were out of them.  So, I deferred to the Homemade Apple Cobbler. The description was awesome. The product not so much.

The water area makes me nervous because it's not difficult for my dog to walk along the edge, under the fence, and out into the insecure area leading to the parking lot. He's done it enough that we don't go to that side anymore. 

Anyway, we still love coming here and going to just the grass fenced in areas. There's usually a good amount of dogs here to socialize with. Each of the large dog areas have a different ""agility"" type structure. One is a triangle wall and the other is a zig zag raised platform. 

There are areas with hoses to wash your dog off afterwards if needed - for water and non-water areas. There is one dog fountain/bowl you can use but it's not within the main fenced area of the park.",2018-03-15 17:04:53

I've been to Tommy's for dinner before which I thought was good, but pricey. Anyhow, back to the bar. My fiancé was really excited to take me to Tommy's for HH, because he had went with his friends and he raved about their excellent martinis. I LOVE martinis, so I was excited too. We decided to stop by for HH, the bar was packed. We decided to come back after walking around. We were just in luck, there were 2 seats open at the bar. The bar was clearing out as HH had just ended, but we didn't mind, because I JUST had to try this martini. We sat there for about 10 minutes and finally a bartender came up to us and we asked for their drink menu. As I had stated before the bar was emptying out and by that time the bar was only half full. There were seats next to us that were now empty. One guy came and sat in the seat next to us. The bartender gave him a drink menu right away. Another 10 minutes passed and no one has come by and asked if we liked to order anything. (It didn't seem like they were too busy as the bartenders were chatting with people and to each other). The guy next to us had already gotten his drink like 5 minutes ago. We left shortly after that. There was no reason why were ignored at the bar for 20  something minutes, we were sitting right in front and it was just ridiculous how we were being ignored. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in their lack of service and I won't be coming here anytime soon. I definitely don't recommend this place to anyone.",2011-06-16 15:27:09

This place is still excellent, but the prices have crept up and the service has declined.  Even with this gentle slide it is by far my favorite place to get sushi in the queen city.

The pros are they have one of the more imaginative all you can eat buffets.  They have my favorite dish which includes fried crispy spinach and vinegar.  I got my wife into sushi at this very restaurant.

Cons: loud, loud, loud.  Busy, busy, busy.  It is hard to find a parking spot, it is hard to find a seat, it is hard to hear anything not being shouted at you.

I've pingponged all over the place with the idea of whether or not I should be a vegetarian, but at the end of the day, I just could never wake up and know that I'd never be able to eat another burger at B Spot, the delicious chicken wings at The Greenhouse Tavern, or one of Sheila F's juicy roasts. I Maybe I'm just selfish and weak-willed, but in any case, that's my take on the matter. 

That said, if my doctor ever came up to me and told me I'd die within a month unless I quit eating meat cold turkey, the Flaming Ice Cube would be a place that would make the transition light years easier. I've had all sorts of vegetarian food, and this was by far the best. The quality of food at the Flaming Ice Cube was amazing and I was totally impressed by everything I ate. If I were a vegetarian, I'd happily eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...and if they were open later, for Fourth Meal too.

My SIL is an ardent vegetarian, and after her and the rest of my in-laws sacrificed a lot of time and money to come up and watch me graduate from law school, I wanted to do something that she'd enjoy doing and something that would make her happy. Many times, she winds up eating something not so great while the rest of us feast, and I always feel bad and wish that wasn't the case. Earlier in the year, my law school had a Wellness Fair at which they brought therapy dogs and other organizations to the school; one of these organizations was The Flaming Ice Cube. I forget what exact sample they distributed, but I remember that it was delicious, and I also remember thinking to myself that this would be a great place to take my SIL. 

We had a variety of different things to eat. There were several great options on the menu and I had a hard time narrowing my choice down to just one item! I had an Italian Panini, Sheila F. and my SIL had chick'n salad sandwiches, my FIL had a Buffalo Panini, and my MIL had a bowl of soup. The Buffalo Panini was hands down my favorite menu item--it was spicy, creamy, and yummy. My Italian Panini was good, I definitely could tell the difference between the veggie meat and the real meat that's used at Subway, but it wasn't enough to make me not want to order it again. We also had Summer Rolls as an appetizer. I've had these at other restaurants, but the Flaming Ice Cube's summer rolls were much, much better. The peanut sauce that accompanied them was really, really good too.

They had a variety of veggie bars for sale in the store, as well as other items as well.

If you like to people watch, try to get the front table with a spectacular view of Public Square and downtown Cleveland. We had a great view of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument.

Also, another reviewer said there's no bathroom here. There is a bathroom here--just ask, and they'll take you to it. They probably don't want people coming in off the street, using the bathroom, and leaving without enjoying their great food. 

All in all, whenever I need to take vegetarians, vegans, or simply anyone who wants a break from the norm out to eat, I'll make a beeline to the Flaming Ice Cube. I was blown away by the quality and taste of the food, and it's yet another fantastic addition to the diverse restaurant scene here in Cleveland.",2011-05-17 04:42:27

I noticed The Crepe the other day when I was in the mall.  I couldn't go then, but knew I had to give it a shot soon.  What really caught my eye was all of the things that The Crepe is involved in and promoting.  Who doesn't love a fun neighborhood joint that has Argentine Tango night, Live Jazz night, and even Story Time for the kids.  Yay for trying to get a community going!  

I noticed they have a great Mommy/Daddy & Me deal going on Monday-Friday 10-11am.  The deal is for every full sized crepe purchased, you get a free kid's sized crepe for your kiddo.  I love a good deal, especially a BOGO deal.  So I had to go and check this place out.

On our visit, we got there at 10am and were the only ones there, except for our friends we were meeting.  We were greeted right away by our server and he took good care of us the entire time.  He wasn't familiar with the BOGO deal, but we go that straightened out pretty quickly.   We had good service the entire meal and felt truly appreciated the whole time.  Our server even told us about all of the other fun stuff they do for kids there like the story time and puppet shows they do throughout the week.  He did a great job.  I wish I remembered his name so I could give him a shout out.

Now to the good stuff, the crepes!  There are so many options to choose from!  Everyone in any group is bound to find at least 1, if not a dozen they want to try.  On this visit I tried the breakfast France crepe.  It had eggs, ham, farm cheese, tomatoes, and béchamel sauce.  It was super duper yummy!  My daughter had the sweet USA crepe.  Her crepe was filled with pb&j with some sliced bananas thrown in the mix.  She hardly eats anything at all and she took down half of this in a few minutes.  That is crazy impressive for her!  There were about 15 other ones that caught my eye as well, so I see us going back often, especially for the BOGO deal!

I was also very impressed with the quality of the ingredients that are being used at The Crepe.  They try to use as much locally sourced items as possible for their menu.  The freshness of the food really comes through in the flavors you find in the crepes.   I love fresh food and helping to support our local farmers, as well as just having better quality food!

Speaking of going often, The Crepe offers as frequent visitor punch card.  I love punch cards and wish more places did this for their regulars.  The Crepe does it so every 9th crepe is free.  Not too shabby, if I do say so.
 
They also have a little play area for kids.  This is a fabulous idea because when you have toddlers, they just really aren't into eating.  I know my daughter usually takes 2 bites and is ready to go play.  With the kid's area being right by some tables, all of us adults can sit and enjoy our crepes and watch our kids play.  This way everyone is happy!  Thanks for thinking of us parents who really want to eat something beside drive thru all of the time when we are with our munchkins.

The only critique I would have for The Crepe is the drink selection.  I am a weirdo who doesn't like coffee, hot tea, or smoothies.

From the moment we walked in, we were treated extremely well. We were seated by the entrance and when we asked to move to another table because of the cold draft, they were so accomodating. 

Our waiter was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions about the interesting dishes on the menu. He was also very helpful in pairing wines with our meal. We started with a bruschetta with warm fresh ricotta and figs. We knew right away when we tasted it that we were in for a superb meal.

As we waited for our selections to arrive, we felt very relaxed in the casual open dining area. Our waiter checked on us from time to time which was nice.

Our food arrived within a reasonable time. I had the sea bass with lentils with a beautiful glass of floral Pino Nero from Abbazia Di Novacella. My daughter had ravioli stuffed with goose. The guys both had a polenta dish with fall off the bone brisket served on a wooden board. All dishes were amazing. The flavours were intense and worked together perfectly. This is when food is art not just nourishment. This is fine dining not just a quick bite. This is food you savour and remember long after the evening is over. 

But wait. It wasn't over yet. This was a birthday celebration. We were going for the dessert menu! Just a few items but they all looked interesting. My husband couldn't decide so asked our waiter from heaven, Steven, to choose one for him. He brought Sanguinaccio. It certainly wasn't one I would have have chosen given one of the main ingredients was pig's blood but when I had a taste, it was delicious. I'm serious! Just shows you should try to keep an open mind about food. This happens to be a very traditional Italian specialty.

Short Review:
Mountain View Bistro is located in the Target shopping center on Cheyenne and Tenaya. The restaurant opened about 4 months ago and based on the reviews, it's a local favorite. Their menu consists of mainly breakfast and burgers. The establishment is clean and the customer service is fantastic. I recommend the Sunrise Burger. It's simply awesome. 

Longer Review:
I'm so glad that I dined at Mountain View Bistro for lunch. I was craving breakfast and a burger. My decision was down to a favorite fast food joint that rhymes with Sin & Shout and one of the other local breakfast joints in the area. I was parked in front of Mountain View Bistro and out of convenience, decided to check them out. 

There wasn't a single customer here. I had the whole place to myself. One of the employees greeted me, handed me a menu, and gave her recommendations. I told her what I was fiening for, which was either breakfast or a burger. Her response ""how bout both, howbow dah?"" Naw, I'm joking about the ""howbow dah"" part, but she did recommend the Sunrise Burger, which is both breakfast and a burger. The Sunrise Burger is no joke. This is a 1/2 lb. Black Angus burger with eggs, hash browns, two thick slices of bacon, and cheese in a Brioche bun. Keep in mind that everything I just listed is all between the bun. The burger was also complimented with a side seasoned crinkle fries. The burger was work of art and I confess, I was a little intimidated to eat this beast. The burger patty itself is one of the juiciest I've had in a long time. The BAE, cheese, and hash browns made it even better. Craving a burger? Craving breakfast? The Sunrise Burger is a no brainer.  The rest of their menu consists of more burgers and a lot more breakfast eats. And by the way, this restaurant also serves Vegetarian and Vegan burgers. 

Overall, I left Mountain View Bistro very satisfied and extremely full. The service is top notch and their Angus burger is too legit to quit. If there's one concern, it's the fact that this place was completely empty when I dined here. I finally found a delicious local burger close to my office. I hope the traffic increases and business improves. I would hate to lose a good thing. Sunrise Burger!!!",2017-06-03 01:25:04

-----------------

**** (4 stars)

I'm not convinced all of the other reviews here are reviewing the same location; I'm posting this for the location near Scottsdale Rd and Shea Blvd. This is NOT a dump. It's a very nice, clean facility. I have no earthly idea why anyone would call this place a dump; I mean if these people really were reviewing the same place, assuming they didn't overhaul the place before I joined, I can't imagine what these people would think of an actually dumpy gym, because I've been in some real rat hole gyms before.

This is a great place, I'm a very satisfied customer. Yes, as they are a business they WILL give you the long-winded tour, they WILL weigh you and, using condescending tones, convince you that you need a trainer, and they WILL try to shove protein up your nose (so to speak). This wasn't the first time I had experienced this; I had a similar experience at a 24-Hour Fitness in California. And to be quite honest, I almost wanted it .. I was able to just turn my brain off and wait for the hour or two to go by while they finished their sales pitch, I knew what they were doing, I knew I couldn't get around it, and at the same time I LOVED the idea that once this was all over with I could get access to a nice gym at only $20 a month.  Since I was in a financially uncertain future but knew I needed to get in shape no matter what, I pre-paid for one full year. They told me that because of this I get another six months free. Nice! That's 18 months for only like $240. The caveat is that after 12 months I'll get charged for another 12 months and I have to voluntarily ask them for a refund. They're a business, trying to take advantage of people's forgetfulness .. I can live with that, it's not like they were double-charging me. (Then again, what is this ""maintenance fee"" people speak of?)

While membership is cheap, they make up for it in training and supplements sales. I tried Mountainside a couple years prior, they were flabbergasted by my questions about getting a trainer. I was shocked that they were shocked and took my business elsewhere. I took advantage of a trainer at Pure Fitness for four sessions (beyond the first two free training sessions). Four sessions cost me nearly $300, which is more than my 12 mo prepaid membership. Do I feel ripped off?  A tiny bit, but then again I know they are a business and I came willing.

Their equipment is in decent (not great) condition; the cardio machines are hit-and-miss when it comes to successful heart rate detection. They have a lot of focused weight machines in the main area and a nice big area in back for free weights and pulleys. They do have classes but I don't take advantage of them. There are TVs in the main area, but they're old CRTs (not, say, plasmas) and they're all tuned to football, baseball, or golf, and not, say, Family Guy or some other non-sports channel, which I found disappointing as really don't get into sports.

Stay out of this place during ""rush hour"" fitness periods (around 6:00 PM). It is disgustingly stinky and humid, with the air filled with body sweat. I nearly choked on it one day. If there's one big thing to complain about regarding their facilities it's that they don't ventilate the place as much as I wish they would.

But overall I am quite satisfied with Pure Fitness.",2011-01-02 13:01:08

Russell is half Japanese and half English/Irish and his wife, Gina, is Korean. She worked with the original cook, and when that gentleman passed away, she continued on with his beloved cuisine and also decided to include Korean offerings. Russell said that there was a period of time where she was just using the cheapest canned ingredients from Sam's Club or Costco, but since he entered the business, they have been making everything fresh.

My second meal was Carnitas and they sucked.  The pork was tough and lacked any real flavor and came topped with literally a teaspoon of pico de gallo leaving the plate 90% plain pork and 100% boring.

""Old Oaks"" gives you both: you can watch your mallard on the wall and eat it too.   A little overpriced and over-fried but who cares, if what you are eating away is your Trust fund money. If not, you might have couple of concerns: why is service so slow? Why is salad so generic? Where is variety? Your dad killed the duck, the deer, the cow, and that's what's for dinner, kids. Looks like he hunted them right here, in the creek restaurant is overlooking. I felt like I was visiting with rich American grandparents I never had. Soothing geriatric satiety, see you back in 40 years.  
Very cozy atmosphere, the fireplace, the wooden interior, excellent malbec.. 
But kids in  faded jeans and colored scarves want more for the money they earned.

Someone got me a gift card for HB. I checked on their website to learn about the place... looked at the menu... checked the hours... checked the events page... and invited friends to join us there.

When we got there the hostess told us it was only a buffet because it was Sunday. On the website is listed the buffet as ending at 6. Online it said full menu also available. It was both after 6... and the hostess most certainly said they only had the buffet. I asked what was on the buffet. The hostess said there was a list of foods on the website. I had not seen such a list on their website. Also,  I'm standing in the restaurant - why tell me to go on the internet? They never offered for us to look at the buffet which I thought would have been an obvious thing to do. Since my friend was a vegetarian and we could not discover what was on the buffet... we thought we would see what was available outside, which has a limited menu. 

stupidly... outside you cannot use a gift card.

we left. Inexplicably there was some sort of puppy adoption going on with puppys running underfoot and happy people watching the puppys and not looking where they were going. :D :D Hah! I liked the puppies. I would like to rate the puppies -  6 stars.

 i sent an email to the restaurant asking if the food could be paid for inside with the gc and just obtained outside... no response. 

It looks really nice in there and i hope you enjoy it but we were perplexed. The management should have better info on the website about what is going on. and a gift card should be accepted at the whole establishment. A business should also respond to questions. 

I've been to the Hofbraukeller in Munich and didn't expect this to be similar, but I do like things to make sense. Still it is a nice addition to CLE and playhouse square.

As for drinks, I had the Foundry Golden Cider beer. To me, it's a great drink to cleanse the palette and gives a nice refreshing finish after a chow.

This is one of my favorite pizza flavors as it has a strong taste of the meat (not overpowering) and well seasoned which reminds me the taste I had in the Philippines. The added pistachios gave a new layer of flavor and texture to this bad boy.

I highly recommend the ribs if you are seriously hungry or a meat lover. The meat flavor of the meat was bold, the wood fire definitely helped bring out the natural flavor of this morsel and the fat that came with it is worth the bite. 

I honestly never expected the blood sausage after it was served. Afterward, I looked it up what morcilla was and there it was. I've never tried blood sausage, but it has a unique taste to it and I actually liked it. It was soft, rich, creamy, and all of the ingredients in it really outdone themselves.

Later they switched around 2pm to spaetzle, pirogies, schnitzel, dumpling, and many of the previous items. It was crowded when we arrived around 12:30pm and then it slowed and then regrouped soon after. Our waiter was good but service is not very fast but it is okay nonetheless.

So I drove another 25 minutes to Baierl Toyota in Wexford -- wonderful! Not only did they sell me the correct blade & arm, they installed it at no cost. And they also explained that the mistake both techs at NHToyota made was that they simply were misreading the chart that matches the model year of the vehicle with the appropriate part. What a joke. NHToyota cost me time and patience, in addition to an additional $48 for replacing the wiper arm. Now I must return the blade and will be shocked if they don't charge me a re-stocking fee, even if they made the mistake.

This was way back when it might not have been bad, before it was a big bad chain that had watered and fajitaed everything down to the lowest common gringo denominator--and yes, El Torito is Mexican food for gringos.  When's the last time you saw a Mexican family enjoying their dinner at El Torito, hm?

Garcia's reminds me of Mexican food in the '80s.  No, it's not El Torito; it's actually much better and more authentic than El Torito, even early El Torito.  Everything here reminds me of childhood:  the food, the fresh chips, the darkness, the decor, the servers' outfits, my mother's insistence on ordering fajitas.

I get the sense that there are various locations in Phoenix and that back in the day Garcia's might have been on the verge of expanding beyond Arizona and becoming the next El Torito.  Thankfully, it didn't.  Thankfully, nothing changed, ever.

I was thirty-seven-years-old sitting across the tiled tabletop from my parents, but I might as well have been seven, and maybe my brother and sister were just in the bathroom or sitting with our cousins at another table.  No one sang ""Happy Birthday to You,"" but people--my parents?--did order margaritas, and there were Latino-looking families enjoying themselves here.

How have I not been here before? This place is wonderful and provided a fantastic dining experience! It was clean, well spaced, light and bright for a steakhouse, and the service was absolutely flawless beginning to end.

The Chef's amuse was a warm chicken liver pate and fresh country bread. Possibly the best pate I've ever had.
The popovers (served with fresh butter and sea salt) are amazing. I think they know this - as there was the added super-cool touch of including a recipe card for the popovers on the plate. (And yes - any bread recipe that calls for gruyere is going to be amazing!)
We all opted for the carpaccio appetizer. Melt in my mouth perfection! Dishes like this are exactly why I have carpaccio cravings!
We also all opted for the flat iron steak - we were at a steakhouse after all. I enjoyed the fresno chile butter - it was a pleasant change from plain or gorgonzola butter that I've had elsewhere. As expected, the steaks were cooked perfectly.
Happily, we each wanted a different side - grilled white asparagus, tater tots, and broccoli mac and cheese. They were served in iron dishes at the center of the table, and there was plenty for each of us to enjoy all three. Not a bad choice in the bunch! (But the tater tots need to be issued a new name. With how incredible they are, if I call them tots, I will never be able to look at another tot without feeling sadness that they just don't measure up to what BLT was serving. Need to ask for that recipe!)
We also went across the menu with dessert, so we were able to share all three. As each of us felt the one we ordered was the best, it was once again, winners all the way around. Bonus dessert - chocolate chip petite fours straight from the oven. Absolute perfection!

Mix this all in with a fantastic Manhattan (or two),  and a great view of Camelback Mountain at sunset - and it was a recipe for an absolutely perfect meal! Can't wait to go back!",2014-05-21 21:42:34
mIzzIV9AaMokRe8k8S-S1A,yZS81ytT4TnAzaQ9Qs73oA,u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,3,1,1,0,"This hotel is a good value for the price you pay. The newly remodeled rooms are nice and clean. 

There are a few small quirks. For example, the first thing you typically do when you get to your hotel room is turn on a light. Unfortunately, the light switch next to the door isn't connected to one. An employee in the hall told us that there used to be a light connected to that switch but when the hotel remodeled they put a mirror where the light used to be. Mirrors are nice...but light is important. So I had to feel my way to the bathroom so I could turn on that light before finding my way into the room. 

The rooms are decorated with modern, updated furniture. The mattress is very firm, so whether or not you like that will depend on personal preference. However, the bathroom was not included in the makeover. 

The daily resort fee ($18) is charged regardless of whether or not the services are used. We did use the wifi everyday. We did not use the gym at all. Limited hours. It would be nice if it was open later or if the hot tub was included in the high daily fee. If you want to use the hot tub it is an additional $10/person/day. 

Housekeeping was great for the most part. I wish the hotel had a process in place if you want to re-use your towel. We received fresh towels daily which seemed like a little bit of a waste. Most hotels have a sign that says if you want fresh towels to leave them on the floor and if you want to re-use keep them hanging. It could save a lot of cost and resources if guests are given the option.

My biggest complaint was that on our day of check-out we received a knock on our door asking if we wanted the room cleaned. We had the do not disturb sign on the door. After talking with the person knocking on doors it was pretty clear they just want to make sure we are checking out that day. I could understand the knock if it was check-out day and after check out time, however this was at about 9am. Luckily, we were up and getting ready to be out of the room, but I was offended that the do not disturb was just ignored and would have been upset if I had been sleeping.

I didn't really want to leave empty handed so I got a half dozen macarons in all different flavours. Unfortunately, not only have I had better for the price ($2.50 per macaron or $15 for 6), I've experienced better handling of delicate overpriced confectionery at every other place I've ever been to. In hindsight I really should have just not bought any or walked away while the guy was putting them in the box.

The macarons were cute, but they were not that special. The only memorable one was the vanilla chocolate hazelnut one, which the guy said tasted like a Ferrero Rocher and it did.

This is not why they are getting a one star though.

The dude was on his laptop and touching his face before he got my macarons. He did not wash his hands or put on gloves before opening the fridge, (where they were not covered) to take out/pick the macaron flavours I was asking for--- with his bare hands. I thought they would get them with tongs from the front where they were displayed. Nope. I should have just walked away without getting them or at least asked him to put on gloves and get me new ones, but I couldn't get the words out. After seeing this, I obviously did not give them to my friend.

I'm pretty sure the only reason why they passed health inspections is because very few people actually go there so they never have to provide service for anyone while they are being inspected.

The dude didn't seem like he knew what he was doing either. I didn't get a receipt or anything. It felt like a really shady transaction.

I didn't want to throw $15 away, so I ate them anyway. It obviously didn't kill me but I will definitely not be coming back here. If you're going to pretend to be a boutique, at least know how to properly handle food. Gross.",2016-03-04 06:21:50

The fresh food and great atmosphere of this salad-and-sandwich shop made up for the frustration I felt when ordering. My salad was really good and my boyfriend liked his Chicken Caesar salad.

There are about a dozen salads you can try or you can make your own. They cook the meat to order for each salad, something I was impressed with.

Food: Was mediocre, I mean they have a very large selection of food.. ridiculously large. Sushi was fine. Dim sum was strangely greasy. Noodles were greasy too. Rice was quite dry. Some of the other items were alright.

Atmosphere, it was in the summer I went, it was too cold. Place looked old, sort of worn out. They didn't really bother to try to keep the place relatively organised. 

However, it wasn't the food or atmosphere that really turned my family and I off... It was the service. Normally, my family and I ALWAYS tip. But we did not tip. This is why: 
- when we sat down at the table, from the beginning on the dinner to the end we were not greeted by a server at all.
- we were not offered any water or tea, when we did ask, the server just rolled his eyes and came back with ONE glass of water, when my father clearly asked for 5 and held of 5 fingers indicating 5 glasses of water. When we asked him for another 4, he said, ""K"" and walked off but never came back. 
- when we were done with the first plate of food, he cleared the plates. However our plates just began to pile up. Server didn't even bother to clear the plates anymore.
- my younger siblings and I went to get dessert first (while our parents were still working on hot food). As soon as we sat down with the desserts, the server just casually walks by and TOSSES our bill onto our table and continues walking.

So yes, if I'm going to give TIP it's going to be for service. Which was not what we received.

It is definitely still just as awesome as I remembered - actually if anything, even better. We got in a little after noon on Sunday, and I was expecting a big line, but we walked right in, sat down, and started getting sushi pretty much immediately. Everything we ordered was fantastically fresh and delicious - I especially want to call out the salmon, which was not only some of the best salmon I'd had, they were also enormous pieces of perfectly-cut fishmeat, on top of the perfect amount of rice (i.e. enough to taste the rice, but really not very much). The rest of the nigiri was also excellent, I just wanted to call out how totally perfect the salmon was. 

I also have to call out one crazy appetizer: I forgot what it was called, but they suggested we try it, and it was amazing. Lightly cooked fish (tuna, I think) on top of mini pieces of garlic bread. I wouldn't get too much of it, as it was also clearly drenched in butter or something, so it was super filling (unlike nigiri, which is the best part about all you can eat high quality nigiri!), but also, mega delicious. 

Service was flawless from start to finish, and the couple rolls we tried were also great (though really, with this much selection of fish this fresh, you totally want to focus more on the fresh fish).

I totally loved their version of an affrogato for dessert, too (with Vietnamese sweet creamy coffee).

The bun was the same...and they really skimp on the meat and the noodles.  Without meat and noodles, what are you really paying for?  A bowl of lettuce?  A bit expensive for just lettuce...

The barbecue pork is a good addition. Not the best barbecue pork but it will do. Egg rolls were standard and they were hot and fried to order. The broth was really good, not too overpowering but just right. Very well balanced. Soup broths don't have a standard taste. It depends on the house recipe. It's tough to mess up Vietnamese food.

The winner of the night was the salmon with sweet potato hash.  I am not usually a big fan of hash or mash potato type items, but the complement of this item with the entire dish was amazing.  The salmon was so tender and perfectly cooked.  On the bottom of the plate, you had artichoke heart type of sauce that really kicked in a whole new flavor.

I live in a 2 bedroom 2 bath. It's in great shape and the floor plan makes it feel really homey. I wish the living space was bigger, but the bedrooms make up for it. I also have lots of closet space (plus built ins). In addition, all two bedrooms come with a free 5x5 storage room. Score. 

Like I said, over time I'll update this review but here are the basics: 

PROS
- location! 
- big apartment size
- comparable pricing in area 
- decent size pool
- quiet 
- modern updates to apts 
- free gas with fireplace apts
- large closets with built ins 
- dining room area 
- FAST maintenance 
- gym isn't crazy busy
- free gym classes 
- mix of young professionals and families (some college students- boo)
- did I mention location?!?!!

CONS
-little noisy on weekend, but nothing to complain about 
-extra storage isn't in your building (at least ours isn't) 
- parking sometimes sucks 
- limited guest parking
-some front desk people aren't every helpful. Others are great.

I lived in Columbus and Cap City was one of my favorite spots to date. I even had my wedding rehearsal dinner at The Fish Market (before he sold it to Ruth Chris). I love Cameroon Mitchell restaurants and when I heard that one was coming to the valley my husband and I were thrilled! We went a week after opening and since it was a while ago I can't give you specific details but I remember that that calamari was made exactly the way it was made at Cap city which was fantastic! We did have issues with our server taking over a half our to bring our soup. The carrot cake was also very similar to Cap City and since it was always my favorite, I was in heaven. I wasn't thrilled with that visit due to the long looooong wait for our soup then meals but I chalked it up to being a new restaurant. 

We hadn't been back in a while (due to distance) so we tried to make reservations for New Years Eve. They were booked so no biggie we decided to go on Sunday instead. I've never been more disappointed in my food expectations! The calamari had changed completely. It was not terrible but not what I wanted (candied cashews?) and our entrees were sub par. My Sea bass tasted like it was seasoned with Lowery's season salt and was undercooked. My husbands swordfish was OK but again.... not what we were expecting after eating at The Fish Market for years. I love sweet potato fries and ours were soggy. I have had better ones ones at Outback, Le Chatlet, and at Arrowhead Grill. Maybe it was crappy because all the chiefs were hung over from new years day? I couldn't really say but for $130 bill for an app, a side, and 2 entrees that were very blan I would go elsewhere!

Tonite, every table outside was almost comedic!  We were all complaining, then laughing about how could a restaurant stay in business putting out plates like a taco salad without the Taco, shrimp tacos with one shrimp in each taco along with lettuce, and the stuffed quesadilla used to be stuffed with grilled chicken.  This time it was more unfilled than filled.  We waited one hour for them to serve us our dinner.  All the manager would say is I'm sorry.  We asked the server what was going on with this restaurant, and she said they had let three servers go and they only had one chef working on a nite of an event across the street.  Convenient?  Yes!  Do we have to find another restaurant?  YES!  Too bad that they don't know how to run a restaurant.  They forgot to charge for drinks....Not so good for the profit, but I guess it worked out with the 3 shrimps in 3 tacos and 1/4 the chicken in the quesadilla.

Not having grown up in the Valley, I wasn't exposed to tamales until recently, and I must say my initial impressions were not too favorable.

Then one day, upon a suggestion from a friend,  I tried a Tamale from the Tamale Store at their kiosk at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market.  Now I'm a believer!  

Unlike the tamales sold at most other places in the Valley, the Tamale Store's version consist of the perfectly cooked masa that is fluffy AND flavorful, overflowing with scrumptious fillings. They carry a full range of tamales, from the traditional (beef, green chile, pork, etc) to unique vegetarian combos ( green corn and cream cheese, spinach and mushroom) to delicious dessert choices (blueberry, pumpkin...)

From recommendations on Yelp, we shared a cucumber salad and an order of the Wiener Schnitzel. I really really wanted to try the stuffed cabbage and the homemade potato pancakes, but I knew this place serve huge portions and the extra appetizers would have been too much. 

The Cucumber salad was good. Somewhat sour and tangy, but has a good crunch and complemented our main dish really well. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing. It really does have a feel of a home cooked meal. The dish is a generous veal-cutlet in traditional batter, then fried perfectly, and served with a side of applesauce, and speatzels.

Lastly,  the meat tasted like it had a propane type of flavor.  Not sure how to explain it other than it tasted like it was cooked over some type of gas.  Overall it was a disappointment.   $70 dinner for 2 on our anniversary and it was no where near the quality it used to be.

Maybe it's the yeast, I'm not quite sure, but I lived off eating fresh bagels from the St. Viateur and Fairmount bakeries when I spent 24 hours in Montreal recently (please read my reviews of both of them)

I was introduced to Gryfe's by my mother a few years ago, who came home after shopping and announced to have found authentic Montreal-style bagels. My exposure to bagels were from chains found in food courts at the mall, bagels the size of my head and so heavy that it felt you swallowed a brick. When she showed me these slim and small bagels, I immediately scrunched up my face and said ""These aren't REAL bagels."" This was an odd thing to say as I grew up in a Jewish neighbourhood. I'm not Jewish but you would think that I would have been more cultured in this ring-shaped wonder. 

The Gryfe bagels tasted excellent: fresh and light. I could eat two of them and not feel like I wanted to cradle my stomach afterward, crying for mercy. 

Having now sampled bagels from Gryfe's and in Montreal, my only dilemma is: are there other great bagel places in Toronto?

The Jewish neighbourhood lies in North York and north of Toronto so I would have to travel the distance to get some, but ask you, can they deliver? Can they air lift a package to my house? I am jonesing for these babies and I'm not sure if I can quit cold turkey. Or perhaps this might inspire me to locate other bakeries that claim their authenticity in my search for a great bagel.",2009-07-03 22:14:30

""People either love Andy Warhol, or they hate him"" quipped Warhol Out West exhibit tour guide, Gina, ""And I think he loved that people felt that way about him.""

It's easy to see why people feel so strongly. In today's world of Instagram filters and Photoshop, people may look at his work and say, ""I can do that!"" or ""that's not art!"" But don't let the simple or mundane of Warhol's style fool you. He spoke about society through his work in a very tongue-in-cheek way.

The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art's showing of Warhol Out West, is currently displaying 59 pieces of his work on loan from The Warhol museum in Pittsburgh, the birthplace of Andy Warhol. 

From the famous soup cans, to screen tests, balloons to ballroom dancing instructions, the exhibit has a little bit of everything from Warhol's work. Also included in the collection are less famous works, such as his Polaroid pictures of celebrities, which have influenced the likes of celebrity photographer Terry Richardson, or Warhol's rendition of American Master Charles Schreyvogel's ""Breaking through the Line.""

Portraits of Geronimo, Annie Oakley and General Custer, along with others from the ""Cowboys and Indians"" collection, are on display. It is in this collection that Warhol's critique of society shines through. 

When the docent turned to the small crowd gathered around her, she asked ""So what do you think of Warhol's work?""  Two people on the tour had competing ideas about it. ""I just love how he could see beauty and form in the everyday piece and elevate it to high art"" and another observer, ""We're standing in a five-star resort, and paid money to look at balloons and soup cans. This was clearly one big joke to him and one big eff you to pretentious people in the art world. He turned his joke into a money-making deal for himself. Good for him.""

For those unfamiliar with Warhol's work, this exhibit is the perfect chance for you to pick a side - was Warhol serious about his art, or was he making a buck while simultaneously saying through his work, ""don't hate the artist; hate the art game?"" You decide.

Audio tours are available all day and docent led tours, which are highly suggested, are offered every day at 2 p.m. Tours are free with admission. $16 general admission, $13 for Nevada residents, $11 for students with ID.",2013-09-03 16:24:18

I wasn't thrilled with the seating arrangements against the wall, as the tables were lined up so close to each other you could hear your neighbors conversation so no intimate talk. Our waiter didn't really interact with us or make us feel welcome and seemed more into wanting to turn the table quickly which greatly turned me off.
You have to ask for bread as they don't offer it which the couple next to us commented on, also telling us they were still hungry after their full meal.
Neither us of left hungry, so I can't complain about that. 
I was more impressed with my meal then hubby was with his own.
I went with the French onion soup which was very good, shepherds pie which I found to be excellent and a good size and would highly recommend. Fudge for dessert which was also very good, though a strange dessert to have on the menu.
Hubby had the grits and sausage which he felt was on the watery side, pulled pork as his entrée which also fell short of his expectations, and the cheese plate for dessert. He was clearly unimpressed and the parking situation outside is very difficult.

I'm a night owl to begin with, so this is perfect for me.

I had heard grumbles before that the clientele was snobby and looked down on certain others, I can definitely imagine this is the kind of place that gentlemen were asked to wear a suit and tie to dine here in the olden days.

The cheap menu is going to bring a different clientele i can kind of blend into, so it works on so many levels.

Their regular steaks are in the $40-50 range, chicken and fish is slightly below, the sides are an extra $5.

First nice touch: complementary pickles and coleslaw, normally not a fan of slaw, but this one was the best I've ever had. The baguette was also quite good. 

I had the chopped liver, tiny scoop with fried onions, very delicious but small in size.

Onto the rib steak, the fat is so succulent you will eat it up, do not leave it on the plate, that would be a tragedy. The piece was about10oz in size, so decent, it comes with a decadent Monte Carlo Potato.

My friend got the Kobe Burger, it was good, but M:Brgr does it better, 
Our meal comes with coffee or tea, but no dessert.

Dessert was the main drawback, No Millefeuille, no Cheesecake, No Tarte Tatin,

The price is just too high and the desserts were just ok, but i guess they need to make their money back somehow.

Where else can you be entertained, check out unique art and stuff your face with oh so bad but oh so good fair food?!  At the Three Rivers Arts Festival my friend!  Nothing kicks off the start of summer in Pittsburgh quite like a trip down.

It's been so interesting watching the fest evolve with the times as well  as the change in venue.  For ages the fest was completely down at Point State Park.  The park then was closed in 2006 for remodeling.  Those were some sad times in terms of placement.  

I remember the one year they had the stage right in the middle of the intersection of Liberty and Stanwix.  It had rained (which some say is an Arts Fest curse) and the whole thing was a mud pit.  Throw in that it was a tiny space with a lot of people jammed in and you've got some issues.  I didn't mind them switching the booths to Gateway Center, although it can definitely get more crowded than when it was completely in the park.  

When the park finally reopened in 2008 they kept most of the art booths in Gateway Center and the concessions at the park along with the stage  The one change was that they were all located at the beginning of the park.  I'm not really a fan of where the stage is placed.  I miss it being on the inside of the park instead of being on the outside edge.  From what I understand, and this could be a total rumor, they didn't want too many people walking and trampling the grass inside.  That's lame if that is the truth....it's a park!

And although sadly I can't afford a lot of the various pieces of art on display, it is really interesting to see what people come up with.  I'm a total Pittsburgh nerd in the fact that I love seeing all the Pittsburgh themed artwork.  It's a fun way to see an artists interpretation of the city.  I also love watching the different themes that come in over the years.  This year it seemed as if glass Mosaic artwork was popular.

My all time favorite booth is the Illustrations done by Greg Stones.  He's been here for the past couple years and I'm proud to say it was my first piece of artwork I bought from the fest!  Yay!  He does goofy little illustrations with penguins, sheep and zombies just to name a few.  You MUST check out his site.

The music varies from year to year but they've brought in some great artists.  Some even before they broke out into the ""big time,"" like Norah Jones and The Black Keys.  I've also enjoyed seeing Aimee Mann and an incredible 3 hour set by Wilco.

The location is awesome, the decor is beautiful, but I wasn't impressed either time I came here. They don't have a happy hour menu, just a small discount on beers. The first time I stopped by was for drinks only and the second time, I decided to grab something to eat. I ordered the chicken fingers with the house special coconut. I assumed that the house special coconut was a dipping sauce, but it was actually how the chicken fingers were breaded. They were very good with bbq sauce. Several people at our table (party of 8) ordered the chicken fingers- all in different ways. I understand how as a server it may be confusing when that occurs, but coming from someone who served in a restaurant for many years, I think it's your job to know where the food goes. Write it down with their names and there would be a problem. Our server didn't do that, meaning food was going to the wrong people and it caused a lot of unnecessary confusion and disturbed our experience. I then ordered the sriracha chicken wrap and sweet potato fries to go and grabbed my boyfriend the jalapeno steak wrap. We both thought they were good, but definitely not something to write home about or even return for. Nothing was bad, but it wasn't amazing either. That just about sums up my entire experience here.",2016-10-25 17:40:30

Just attitude.  I refused to pay it as I was already charged the full amount on my mobile account.  They said fine.  We will make it   The other store should have refunded you.

For $22.99 (before taxes), you get to basically do all you can eat from 4-5 shrimp dishes. You pick 2 dishes to start and then you can order more of any of the options (one order at a time). The first 2 dishes, though, come with 2 sides, so be careful and don't order all the carbs. Our waiter was quite nice and started ordering additional skewers for us without us even asking. 

I wouldn't say it's anywhere close to being ""amazing seafood"", but if you like shrimp, it's a pretty good bang for your buck! To be honest, I think that by the 4th or 5th dish, I was so sick of shrimp I just wanted to go grab some ice cream from across the street.

We had a get together at this restaurant on a late Monday afternoon. We made reservation so they had a table ready for us. 

The interior is a bit dated as you walk in but they have a patio area at the side. We were seated inside at the back of the restaurant and because of the time of the reservation, we were pretty much by ourselves. Parking is available on the side streets or nearby P lots. 

The Good: The Tiropita was very good with the different kind of spreads and pitas. There's a free complementary bread that's provided on the table. 
The Greek Paella has a good amount of shrimp, mussels, sausages and chicken. 

Service was great. Our waiter was very attentive to our group and we were well taken care of. 

The Average: I wasn't crazy with the tomato based sauce on the paella. I'm used to the paella having the saffron flavour which this dish did not. Prices seems on the high side. 

I will come back to try their other dishes.

1P7jsVgSUdw02hidmVIhMA,EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,3,7,2,5,"First off, this cafe does have two things that set it apart from others. That would be the Raindrop Dessert/Cake and the Frozen Cotton Candy.

The Raindrop Cake reminds me of the lychee jelly cups you can get from most Asian supermarkets. My mom used to buy them for me and my siblings when we were kids. They taste very similar and both have the same exact texture. These Raindrop Cakes are no different and are just a bigger version of them.. served on a plate. If it wasn't for the strawberries and lychee in the one that we ordered, we would have just been eating a glob of flavorless gelatin. Definitely not the dessert to make a drive for.

Their Frozen Cotton Candy is another treat that I thought was pretty original. Plus, it's the first that I know of in Vegas. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, and the small cup that it comes in makes the portion just right. Some of the flavors you can choose for this dessert are Milk, Matcha, Coffee, and Earl Grey.

Now for the unpleasant part of our visit.. I'm a pretty patient person when it comes to customer service and I like to give businesses a second chance to redeem themselves, even if my first impression was not a good one. So with that being said... Here's our experience.

Around the time that my siblings and I arrived, which was shortly after 11:30 PM, there was one girl working behind the counter. She came to greet us as soon as we walked in, but already seemed to be irritated. She didn't ask us any questions and just stood there. No biggie. While looking at the menu, my bro asked me about their Matcha and what I would recommend, since I've tried this place before. Right when I was going to say something back, this girl had to blurt out what Matcha was, like we didn't know, and gave us a look of irritation. Umm.. Ok? Strike two. Before answering my bro, I thought I'd ask about the frozen cotton candy's Milk flavor. There was no description for it on the menu, so I asked if it was a ""Milk Tea"". The girl didn't answer my question and tried to educate me on something else. I asked again, but she started talking about other menu items they offer. So my sis jumped in and asked to clarify the flavor. Again, girl tries to inform us about something else, but in the middle of our question! Why do you have to talk over our voice? How do you know what we're asking if you're not listening? Sis asked again, but in a different tone, and finally we got an actual answer. For a second there, it looked like an argument was about to go down! She gave us a lil attitude so my sis gave it back. She needed a taste of her own medicine. Right before we left, she came by to ask us what we thought. Ignoring what had happened earlier, we complimented on the uniqueness of the desserts. Her demeanor did a 360 because she acted way different from before. Guess she got the memo.
 
So, in short, I won't be coming back for awhile. As much as I enjoyed the frozen cotton candy, it will just have to wait until next time.",2017-01-23 03:10:29

And they do shine indeed!

This may be the most flavorful array of proteins I've ever had. The pulled pork and brisket are a must. And the beef rib is certainly something to behold! Even the sides (we had potato salad, mac and cheese, garlic broccoli, beans, and cornbread) were mild and pure in their taste.

However, I feel responsible for informing anyone who happens to glance this business that this is location has the one of the absolute worst customer services I've ever experienced. We ordered take-out here a couple weeks ago only to come pick up and the food and be told that the associate ""forgot to place the order. OOPS!""

I was at an event over at the Parkdale Community Centre for work, and really needed to get out of there. I walked over to Lazy Loaf and much to my surprise it was pretty quiet. I guess it might have been because it was Remembrance Day and maybe not a lot of people were around. 
I ordered my favourite veggie sandwich, a side salad, and a cup of yoga tea. The salad portion was a lot larger and greener than I expected, which I was very happy about. This much food had me absolutely stuffed, which as awesome. A very nice quiet place to read some Leonard Cohen and hide from the world for half an hour, although I am aware it isn't always like this. This particular review update simply reflects my Lazy Loaf experience. The Lazy Loaf seems to be part hipster coffeehouse, part diner, and part truckstop vibe. 
Also, the quality, and $5 price tag on Lazy Loaf's gigantic loaves of bread means no one in Calgary ever has any excuse to buy bread at a regular grocery store again. I took home a loaf of sour dough with slices longer than my torso (figuratively) and was the happiest Sarah Louise in all the land!

I had heard so much about their prime rib, so as a prime rib lover I couldn't wait to check it out! We made reservations in advance but I'm not sure if it is necessary because the restaurant didn't appear full, even on a Saturday night. 

Once you are seated you are presented with a dinner menu and wine list. Once we selected our bottle of wine - Lawry's private selection Chardonnay, our waiter explained the menu and ordering process to us since it was our 1st time at Lawry's. After this, for some strange reason our menus were taken away. If you would like to add a lobster tail to your meal or any sides besides creamed corn and creamed spinach, this is when you have to place those orders.

The prime rib is brought around on carts and sliced at your table. You are asked for the cut size you'd like, along with how cooked you like it. In my opinion, for prime rib you definitely have to go medium rare. I went with the Lawry Cut which is around 10 oz. All prime rib dinners include mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, which is a puffed bread and not an actual pudding as I had thought lol. 

You have the option of adding a scoop of creamed corn or creamed spinach, which were good but definitely not worth the ridiculous 7 bucks per scoop price! Now we know. Other sides come on small plates and we opted for some mushrooms which were $9. The meat was perfectly seasoned and very juicy. Usually when you have prime rib, some areas are more seasoned or dry than others...that was certainly not the case here and even the parts without fat were juicy and flavorful.

At the end of the meal, our plates were taken away and a buser came by to de-crumb our table - fancy!. This is when we were handed dessert menus. Too full to order anything and about to depart for my UYE party, I was about to decline dessert when they brought out a small cupcake sized shortcake with a single candle on top. This was a nice surprise to close out our wonderful meal.

I've never been and never really interested in going simply because ready made sushi doesn't appeal to me when there is a abundance of AYCE here.  I was surprised to find the place was packed to the gills. There didn't seem to be a extreme wait, but my family was already seated when I arrived late.

I was surprised the hot food was rather decent.  The steamed seabass and the grilled up swordfish was cooked well and tasted fresh. Teriyaki steak, pork katsu, grilled octopus was alright as well. Make your own udon bowl was not bad as well.  I was not fond of their soggy tempura, spicy sausage or stuck together gyoza. I didn't try the beef sukiyaki or chicken teriyaki and that really is just it for entrees. I was surprised that the selection wasn't more though. I got seaweed salad and hijiki salad from the cold area. The salad area is mostly prepped salads than a DIY toppings and greens salad bar.

Sushi was overall alright and you really can fare better at a all you can eat, made to order place. Mackerel, pepper tuna with hot sauce were good. Spicy crab and masago nigiri was acceptable .Clam, squid, tuna was okay..not horrible but not great and depended on which tray you got from.The inari was also  something I liked. Rolls were mostly California roll variations and sauced... Some with raw fish rolls sat out for a bit and was horrible texture so I spat it out. The one plus is that I can skim it off some of he rice and not eat it all or not eat the gross ones.  The problem is some stuff sat for a little bit like the squid which makes it not as appealing when the fish gets warmer and the rice touching the plate gets too cold, reminiscent of refrigerated grocery sushi. Come when it is busy, this is not a place to come during a slow time as that means low turn over on the food! 

Dessert wise, their green tea and red bean ice cream is good - not too sweet and smooth. There was sesame crisps that I crushed up and strawberries I sliced to top it off and make it better. They have a chocolate fondue which is rather kitsch to dip your own fruits and marshmallows in. To me, its just a glorified chocolate syrup fountain that looks cool though and wasn't that tasty. I took bites of random cakes and all were just meh so I didn't eat it.

Service was okay. My water was filled once I told them I was new and didn't have a drink. Our plates were stacking up towards the end though.  

For Sunday lunch at $18.95 its probably a more affordable than Todai that is similar of a concept, but compared to a AYCE sushi joint it doesn't do the job for me. I wouldn't be eating here if it wasn't for family being Filipino that love a buffet and it being convenient to our day at the outlet. I don't really see any other time I would come back either.

Been to Southwest bikes quite a few times and they have been great! Offering a nice range of bikes, parts, accessories and nutrition, SW is a one stop shop.

Mainly being a bianchi bicycle dealer, the range of road to mountain bikes is awesome. Even though they are not the size of Mcghies or Las Vegas cyclery, I will say they are fantastic for tune ups or that odd question you may have.

If your getting into cycling or been riding for a while, they do have group shop rides weekly that start at the shop.

If you live in North Las Vegas I highly recommend stoping in checking them out. They will set you right",2014-07-13 02:28:22

A family sits next to us and still waiting for a 4th person. the server walks up to them and gives them the run down walks to get them coffee and waters. walks back and helps the 4th person get into their seat. he explains the menu and says he will be back shortly. He walks to the other table on our other side, helps them and asks of they need anything else. We are ready to order and he keeps walking and helping everyone else around us. The man next to us leans over and says "" want me to order for you guys? i can clearly see whats going on"" I say no thank you. I wait another 10 minutes and still nothing. my son is asking for pancakes and juice. The man and family next to us receives their meals and are looking at us ashamed considering they arrived around 10 minutes after us and to this point the server has yet to say 1 single word to us. I finally have had enough and wave down the ""server"" he shockingly walks over and i ask for the manager he doesn't say a word and walks away. Him and another man walk towards me the ""server"" sarcastically says ""did i forget to serve you"" i told the manager the story and that i was leaving. he said ""OK have a nice day""  everyone looked as us as we got up put our coats on and heard my son saying he wanted pancakes. As a purple heart recipient from the war in Iraq this is not what i think about when i think of America.

The waitress patiently explained the menu and gave us a heads up about how long each item would take to make. For dine-in, my friend and I ordered the Baked Alaska and Chocolate Soufflé. I also ordered an Earl Grey milk bottle and macarons to go.

-Baked Alaska:  had mango ice cream filling, covered with meringue on the outside and it tasted great!! 

-Chocolate Soufflé: made fresh when you order so beware, it will take at least 20 minutes. The inside of the Soufflé is warm and soft, not wet or soggy. The chocolate flavor really came through and not sweet at all. I was surprised soufflé didn't collapse right away, if I remember correctly it took around 90 seconds for the soufflé  to collapse. The owner explained to me that she wanted to try and give the soufflé more texture, allowing it to rise longer as a lot of people like to take pictures of their dessert, so by the time they finished, the soufflé would have collapsed already. *Note* I do not recommend ordering or pouring the sauce as it kills the flavor and texture of the soufflé, making it become more soggy.

-Earl Grey Milk Bottle: a bit pricey ($4.95/each). The texture was like a mousse or pudding and the one I got was not too sweet at all. At the bottom of the milk bottle there was bits of jelly? Nonetheless it tasted really good. 

-French Macarons: they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, but the flavors were a hit and miss. The Green Tea were my favourite, even better than Butter Avenue as the filling was a bit bitter, and not sweet at all. I also liked the Japanese Lime (Yuzu) and Pistachio as well. Be careful with the Lavender Macaron, it tasted like perfumed soap for me.. The lavender was so strong, it reminded me of those Bounty sheet you put in the dryer so your clothes would smell good...

Overall, I recommend the baked goods and milk bottle, skip the macarons.",2015-02-15 21:24:41

Not saying that's a bad thing, in fact, their burger was pretty good. Just the options were pretty limited. We ordered 2 burgers and the deconstructed empanada pizza special and lastly the snow crab sharing platter to share. Pizza was pretty doughy, burgers were good and snow crab salad was ""meh!"". Drinks were good, Spanish Estrella beer and their cranberry chamomile soda special. Overall the decor on the main level was pretty good, it was a pretty happening place with the bakery and Phil and Sebastians. We were seated on the second floor and there was a presentation happening on one side. It was pretty annoying that their speakers had a lot of feedback when they were switching between audio sources. Not anything specific to the food, but was just a minor annoyance. Other than that, the second floor is not super special, but I'd like to try the patio eventually. Rainy weather and clouds prevented us from doing so this time. Also, I imagine their dinner menu would be a little more elaborate.

I tried a pastrami topped single burger with fries. The burger is unique. It's a fresh made squashed thin on the grill kind of burger. The pastrami accented the beef well and gave it more flavor. I liked that this isn't a really big burger. It's fast food sized and priced and MUCH BETTER than a fast food burger. The fries were very fresh and crisp and seemed to be lightly battered.

My husband had the Ortega burger that had a roasted green chili and sautéed onions with onion rings. They have a sign stating the onion rings are home made. The onions were very similar to burger king onions rings but better.

Except service suffers when you ask for it.

I've heard staff making fun of me for ordering it during previous visits but I ignored it because the burgers are delicious.

This time I was extremely disappointed. I asked for a bunless burger and the young man cashing me out didn't make note of it on the receipt. So I received a regular burger. Not really a big deal, im assumjng he was new or there was a mix up. I politely told the other young man who makes the burgers that it was meant to be bunless. He took it back and made a new one. Unfortunately the quality suffered. A lot.

The cheese wasn't melted at all, in fact it was still cold.

The lettuce was in small pieces that weren't sufficiently sized for holding the burger.

I'm honestly not entirely convinced it wasn't a case of pulling the patty off the old one and just throwing on some new cheese. Which isn't a big deal for *me* aside from the lack of melted cheese making the burger taste like disappointment. But for some with a gluten allergy? 

I don't know if I'll be back but it was definitely a waste of money coming tonight. I could have had a more satisfying burger at MacDonald or Wendy's.

They have cute menu's and a large white board with the ""today's specials"" along with other items that they're serving that day as some go out of stock and they change it up a little.

The first time, I had karaage (which is fried chicken) and for the price I honestly expected a little more than just 6 pieces of chicken, rice, and a small cabbage salad. It tasted like regular karaage that you could get a fast food restaurant for only $5. There was no flavoring on it and I felt like I needed a sauce to eat it. The dessert I had was the yaki-imo which wasn't exactly fried, it was steamed, but it was still good.

The second time I went I had omurice, which is an omelette on top of rice, usually rice either cooked in ketchup or fried. In this case it was cooked in a tomato sauce which they make themselves. This was actually pretty good compared to what I had the first time. This omurice is different from what I have had in the past, the chef made a fried rice with ketchup and chicken, which made it taste better than regular omurice. The sauce is what made it pretty good for me, it's a homemade sauce that uses a tomato base. Some omurice use ketchup but others make homemade sauce. 

Based off the price of the food, I expected a little more taste from some of the foods. I don't recall what my friends had but I got to try some of it. I will definitely try it a few more times before making a final decision about the place.

That would have been ok, except as I looked in the restaurant there were many many empty tables and an island with place settings and chairs set up, but no one sitting. I find that really annoying. The only thing I could think of is that they did not have enough waiting staff, or their kitchen staff aren't able to keep up when they need to service a full house. Regardless, it doesn't make for a great impression or mood when at least I see this type of situation. When we got seated we were greeted very warmly.I really like the decor, which is clean and modern.  I ordered a Sangria which was about the best tasting Sangria I've ever had. However, there was more ice than Sangria. A couple of draws on the straw and it was gone. When the server came and asked how everything was I told her I really liked the taste of the Sangria, but felt like I was spending $10 for a class of ice with very little actual Sangria in it. She looked very embarrassed, apologized, and left. The good news is she came back with another Sangria which was more Sangria than ice. You really can't ask for more than that. Now for the food. I had Paella  and my wife had lamb ribs. Both were delicious. So I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 due to what I've told you about. But those things will not stop me from coming back. To many other things I want to try. Oh, and there is this really nice looking patio I want to sit at to enjoy our great AZ weather.",2017-02-05 03:39:46

The lovely Kat F and I walked in on Thursday night without a reservation.They were quite packed, but were able to find a table for us. It was located right next to the restroom, which is a bonus for any pregnant woman!

We started with their bread, which should probably be complimentary because no one should miss out on this garlicy dough goodness! 

As for my entree I went with their homemade pesto gnocchi, which literally melted in my mouth. Kat ordered a very generous sized pizza, which she was nice enough to share with me...very tasty as well! The table of men next to us had food envy just watching us eat it and ordered a pizza of their very own. 

I was full enough to stop here, but had a feeling dessert would be as fantastic as the rest of the meal. And I was right! I felt a bit guilty enjoying the best tiramisu ever, mostly because it's my hubby's favorite dessert.  Kat went the healthier route with mango sorbet, which was refreshing (and tasty)!

They also have a duck-fries plate that looks divine, if totally rich. My lamb burger was excellent, and I would recommend ordering a side of salad and fries (these were really fresh and delicious). The bun is made with corn flour, which makes it thin and crispy. The downside was that the lamb meat was ground versus a steak, but what was I expecting?! 
The desserts tend to be on the heavier side with pudding and little chocolate muffins, the pot of cream is lovely though and made with rice and tapioca if I remember well..

Things we ordered:

Turnip (XO style)- cube shape turnip with bean sprouts and xo sauce. This is not bad, but it kept reminding me of how good Congee Queen one was back then with their Chili turnip. 

Clams w/black bean chilli sauce- The sauce mixture for this is quite nice, and the clams are the usual. The price is $10 which is good. 

Lemon Chicken (Dark meat)- We were anticipating that it was like chicken ball with lemon sauce, but it was cutlet style. The skin is nice and crispy and its not totally drowned in sauce, so it was quite alright. For $12.99, its quite good deal.

Bamboo Shrimp Fried Rice- $13.99! Its steam for 20 mins with generous amounts of half shrimps with white eggs on rice. This seems to be a growing trend in the chinese restaurant now. I still prefer it at Joy Fortune on VP!

I don't even know where to start because I have so many good thoughts about this place. 
I love their story - the family immigrated here from Mexico to open a restaurant. This is a small, family owned business and the pride they take in their business shows. 
The ambiance is nice. It's not over done, and has modern, sleek lines. It's a little more upscale than a traditional Mexican restaurant, but it is still casual. 
We started with margaritas which were fine. Nothing special. Everything else that came out was amazing though! I went with 3 other people, so we ordered quite a few items on the menu and everything was to die for. Even their rice was good, and I never eat Spanish rice. 
Our faves were the cheese dip, pollo Santa Fe, and chimichangas. 
The servers were all very attentive and helpful. The menu is huge so we had a hard time selecting what we wanted. Our server went through it with us and shared his favorite items. We talked to one of the women at the bar (I wish I could remember her name) and she gave us details about her family and how their grand opening went. It really felt they were giving us this personalized experience, and like they will remember us when we go back (which we will, very soon!).

We had to meet some family for dinner at Mandalay and told them about Burger Bar's greatness.  Upon arriving we found out the BB was closed for a private event so we had to pick another place.  Since we didn't feel like walking more than 10 feet we decided on Hussong's. 

The name might be a little off-putting as it doesn't scream ""Mexican Food"" and they claim to be the inventor of the Margarita.  Still, we gave it a chance and we were pleasantly surprised.  It was a little pricey for Mexican food but cheap for Strip standards.  The waiter did an okay job but was a little slow after we ordered.  My wife had Enchiladas and the rest of us had their Chicken Tostada Salad, which was pretty delicious!  They had two fried strips of Flour Tortilla that came along with the salad rather than a fried bowl and I was a big fan!

I did have a couple of problems with the place, however.  As I said the waiter was 'ok' but he constantly tried to upsell us stuff.  I hate when they offer you Guacamole like it's on the house when it really isn't.  I'm of the opinion that if you offer it, it's free.  We didn't bite.  The biggest thing that I didn't like was the fact that their Margarita's came in Pint Glasses.  Really?  You claim to be the Margarita inventor and you're going to put them in a pint glass? I don't think so.  That alone lost a whole star for me.

Okay, I get it. There just seems to be the ""Vegas factor"" in many non-buffet restaurants (okay...buffet restaurants too). The food prices just seem to be much more than back home in Canada, even after taxes. I understand the whole phrase ""go big or go home"", but at the end, is it worth it?

Stripsteak is located inside Mandalay Bay, which mind you is probably one of the largest hotels in The Strip...and one of the most poorly accessible from public transit. Good thing I was living in NYNY so I was able to take the tram there. The first thing you would've thought is that with the high prices, the restaurant would've been on the quiet side. Nope! It's about as loud as a Chinese dim sum restaurant on a Saturday afternoon; very loud.

We ordered the Japanese A4 wagyu satays, American wagyu vs. Australian wagyu, NY strip, and wagyu rib eye. Yeah I know, a lot of wagyu...I mean, you don't get wagyu in many places in Canada! As for the food quality...the two wagyu comparisons were interesting, but I certainly did not feel the value of $69 for all the wagyu foods, and honestly the $59 NY strip tasted a little better. However, this restaurant is definitely something I would recommend trying once if you're a steak lover, but not twice.

Service was great though. The server explained all our foods when we first ordered, and when they were being delivered one by one. We also got complimentary fries and different dipping sauces for each fries. Again, it's a restaurant I was glad I tried since I was able to experience a non-buffet higher end dining style in Vegas, but I wouldn't do it again.",2014-06-24 00:13:19

I got stuck in traffic and ended up almost 20 minutes late, which had me apologizing profusely to the receptionist.  Luckily, it wasn't a problem, and I got right in.  

The esthetician was very nice, asking me repeatedly if everything felt all right.  I am ticklish on my feet, but she was very accommodating once she caught me giggling like a little school girl.  The spa pedicure, which was $35 (very, very reasonable), included lavender mask, a salt scrub, and a paraffin treatment.  They also did a really great massage on my legs and feet - one of the best I've ever had.  They had a wide selection of colors as well.  The polish on my pedicure lasted for a couple of months without chipping off.

The salon itself was clean and inviting.  The staff was also quite nice, conversing a little bit with me, even though there's a bit of a language barrier.

Once we realized the masses had the same idea we had on our night out, we started really weighing our options. Then like a beacon in the night... the neon glow of beer signs caught our eye from across the street. What's that? Over there... Is that? Can it be? A new pizza joint\bar? The yelp-gods sang out!

I remembered seeing the Pizza Bar sign and thought they were saying it was a pizza buffet. (It's not. Trust me I learned my lesson from Cici's, while pizza buffet sounds great it's sometimes a horrible scary thing...) Looking in the window it was the bartender and a girl on her laptop at the bar. PERFECT for us. 

The bartender was especially nice and turned the tv from college football to Pens hockey for us. It's clean and spacious inside, not to mention slightly dark which I love. We ordered beers (I got a Great Lakes Eliot Ness which is on tap!) and a quesadilla (beef at the bartender's suggestion) w/ guac and sour cream as an app. Hindsight being what it is, I should have gone with just the plain jane cheese pizza. My love for cheese knows no bounds, as my wide hips will prove, so we went for the 5 cheese extravaganza. 

It was good. The cheeses were mozzarella, provolone, fontinella, ricotta, and feta. Honestly though, it was a little much. All the cheeses made the pizza sort of soggy. It was still delicious but just heavy. The bf said he thought the sauce was a little too much like spaghetti sauce, although I couldn't taste it beyond the multiple cheeses. A true test of pizza for me is the morning after test. Upon waking I tried a slice of the fridge chilled pizza and it was actually even better than the night before. 

In all, I have a lot of hope for this place and the fact that they deliver (and their menu goes well beyond pizza and covers the entire pizza place/italian food scope) means there is a really good chance we'll be checking back on various pizza's in the future.",2011-11-13 13:05:40

After extensively perusing reviews here and the menu online, I finally went in to order my takeout- wonton ramen soup, spicy crispy eggplant with brown rice, and green tea ice cream with sticky rice.

The spicy crispy eggplant is out of this world. It's amazing, and I'd come back just for this dish- side of brown rice wasn't even necessary. Delicious way to have eggplant, and despite being a sticky and almost sweet sauce it did not feel like a heavy meal. 

The won ton soup was a bit underwhelming. I did appreciate how the noodles were packed separately for my takeout order so as not to fall apart in the broth, and I liked the won tons themselves. But the broth was lacking. I liked the green taste to it, and it oddly reminded me of a green smoothie, except in broth form. As in, you could taste the veggie vibrancy. But it was still somehow flat. Noodles were also much thinner than I prefer, and seemed to simply be thin spaghetti rather than ramen.

The dessert was underwhelming as well. The green tea ice cream melted very quickly and was also lacking in flavor- I've experienced varieties with more of a chalky texture but stronger machta taste, but this version was on the thin side rather than creamy. Also struck me as odd that the sticy rice was orange.",2014-04-10 05:37:19

We don't stop at cuisine.  Cocktails and other libations accompany our regional tastes for a full dining experience that echoes the days of home."" Kinda Cool.

The Good
+ Cool design and nice décor, modern and classy, very open and a nice big bar on both the inside and the patio.
+ Ordered the Grilled Cheese Club and it came with tomatoes and bacon - awesome.
+ Very decent wine and drink selection, all reasonably priced going along with the ""Regional"" theme

The Bad
- We were sat and then waited 15 minutes before anyone came over
- My dining partner was brought the wrong beer
- I asked if I could sub a salad for the fries and was advised I couldn't, you have to purchase the salads separately - no half sizes and the house salad was 6 bucks (lame)
- They have a pretty limited menu for lunch, only 4 sandwiches (no chicken sandwich!!) and made to order burgers

The Ugly

From the outside, the place is adorable and I love the bright color, it's really inviting.  However, I hate the place inside.  Had the decor been overkill hippie like in the burger place, I could sorta dig it, but this was all just halfway and I don't like a pair of pointy boobies staring down at me from a poster.  I HATED the rolling chairs that bumped into everyone and everything.  The place is entirely too cramped.  A lot of people get their food to go, so there is no reason to have that many tables.  There are just too many obstacles to make this even a semi-comfortable dining experience.

False advertising makes me angry and had I come here after 11:30 on the premise that breakfast is served all day, like they advertise, I would have been fuming.  Why call yourself a breakfast joint if I can get a burger all day but not some scrambled eggs?

There is way too much crap on the menu and I think that this place could really be much much better if they pared it down to just breakfast bowls and sides.  Practically everyone got one anyway, why slow the line down with messy pancakes and waffles?  Like Glenn said, there should also be little order forms that people can fill out while waiting in line.  Things would go so much smoother from there.

Aside from the many many things that irritated me, the food was only okay.  I got the breakfast ""bowl"" which is a great value, but was left a bit disappointed.  I love being able to choose my own ingredients, so that was cool, but the distribution of ingredients is sporadic.  Some parts of my egg were covered in cheese and bacon, while the mushrooms and sausage were sparsely sprinkled.  I would rather have it even all the way around.  The potatoes tasted okay, but were really greasy and ultimately made me not feel good later in the day.  That brings back the same feeling I got from the uber-greasy magic mushroom burger a while back.  Not good.

I probably won't be back unless some dramatic changes are made.  I don't mind waiting in line for food, but I hate waiting a long time after I have ordered.  I also don't understand how a ""hippie"" place that boasts of using organic ingredients could go and use inefficient, very expensive, not to mention environmentally unfriendly plastic and styrofoam containers.

Good greens (no iceberg or romaine), a sprinkling of rice noodles, tangerine slices, almond slices, two small vegetable spring rolls,  sliced grilled chicken and a sesame ginger dressing (on the side).

Last night was not as good as usual.  The greens played a minor part in this particular salad.  Isn't the greens why people get a salad?  There were some greens but a PLOP of rice noodles were on top drowning out the greens.  I don't get a salad for the noodles, I get it for the greens.

The first time we went was for the cough. We managed to get a same day appointment at the very end of the day. We arrived quite early, and headed for the waiting room. North Scottsdale Pediatric has a divided waiting area...one side each for sick children and healthy children. Unfortunately for us, the ""sick"" side was still jammed pack with people. The staff were running a little bit shorthanded, but I guess that's to be expected during cold and flu season.

The waiting rooms were both quite nice. There are lots of chairs, plenty of games with which the children can play, and a television. On this day, everyone seemed to be in a particularly foul mood...though, if your child is sick, you're guaranteed to be less than pleasant. 

After a little longer wait than we expected, we went back to figure out what was going on with our little one. The nurse came out and greeted my daughter, and was very pleasant. Although she was a little under the weather, my daughter was very receptive to the nurse. After taking her weight, the nurse led us through a seemingly endless maze of different examination rooms to go and see our physician, Dr. Whitehouse. 

Dr. Whitehouse was amazing. She was extremely thorough with our daughter. Through some very in-depth questioning, Dr. Whitehouse was able to finally figure out the cause of our daughter's annoyingly persistent coughing.

After our first experience with Dr. Whitehouse, it was a no-brainier as to where we needed to take our child in for her four year check-up. And, once again, the doctor was amazing. 

Doctors, in my opinion, are like insurance. You have them, but you hope you never really need to use them. But, in the event that you DO have to use them, you need to make sure that they're reliable. Dr. Whitehouse certainly fits that description!",2013-03-17 17:40:51

Squirrel Hill's Sun Penang restaurant, owner accused of unfair labor practices

April 21, 2016 5:36 PM

Squirrel Hill restaurant Sun Penang and its owner were federally indicted by a grand jury today on charges that its workers were asked to forfeit back pay or work for no pay, according to a release from the U.S. attorney's office.

U.S. attorney David Hickton alleges that Hsiao Yen Wu, 40, who also goes by the alias Sophia Wu, had agreed to pay back wages to her employees and provided information and copied checks to the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Office in Pittsburgh in order to show authorities that she was in compliance.

Federal authorities say Ms. Wu then ordered her employees to deposit their checks into her personal account or to work without pay until the restaurant recouped the backpay.

The indictment also alleges that Sun Penang, located at 5829 Forbes Ave., did not pay its workers minimum wage or overtime pay during a one-year period from Jan. 1, 2013 to Dec. 31, 2013.

In the three-count indictment, Ms. Wu is charged with falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact. It charges Sun Penang with willfully violating the Fair Labor Standards Act.

The indictment was returned Tuesday, but unsealed today.

""All employees working in Western Pennsylvania deserve to be treated fairly under the law,"" Mr. Hickton said in the release. ""Prosecutions like these demonstrate our commitment to stopping wage and hour abuses in the workforce.""",2016-04-22 20:21:54

Nevertheless, I always receive friendly and knowledgeable service from the waiters. In terms of the appetizers, I enjoy the calamari and the tuna tartare. My favorite entrees (the only ones I can order, really) are the kaya burger and the crispy fish tacos.  The burger is huge and packs a punch, but for some reason has a sunny side up egg on top of it. I don't understand where the egg fits into island cuisine, but ok. The fish tacos are less substantial but still very tasty.

Casbah's brunch is a prix fixe...which at first seems expensive, but when you realize the amount of food you're getting, it's sooo not. You get an appetizer, entree, and drink (yes, a real drink, with alcohol) for just $24. I usually end up spending more at my other Big Burrito brunch spot, Kaya, so I consider this a pretty good deal.

They start you off with a basket of muffins and biscuits with honey butter on the side. And it's refillable. Try to restrain yourself from eating too many baked goods though, so you can get to the real food. For appetizers, everything I've had was pretty good (polenta and the salads have been my faves), but for the entree, there is only ONE thing you should order: The lamb & eggs!  Crusty sourdough bread topped with spinach topped with braised lamb shoulder and roasted garlic, topped with poached eggs. One of the best things I have ever eaten in the morning. The scallop scramble is just okay, the steak & eggs are pretty delish...but the lamb & eggs is by far the best thing on the brunch menu.

This is one of the few places where I don't opt for the Bloody Mary...it's pretty blah. I do their Salty Dog with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, or sometimes get it sans alcohol if I'm really feeling the pain from Saturday night.

Unfortunately, while I love the atmosphere, I feel like the service is lacking.

You enter the restaurant by first going through a really high-end jewelry store, it then gets dark and intimate inside the dining areas; I really enjoyed the lighting, chandeliers and complimentary champagne while you await your table.  

The food is good, like really high-end tapas; however they ask you to order everything at one time for the whole table. We were there on a Friday night, for a friend's birthday- we were literally yelling to talk to each other and our server. 
Our bill was around $600 w/o tip, not awful for 6 of us but 1 is vegan/no drinks and two hardly ate. 
The dinner is a longer process because the tapas come out at different times (they are shareable, we had a lot of food at the table and some left-overs.

THE ISSUE: There was a restaurant host who had mentioned (several times throughout our dinner) getting us a comp. table at Marquee Night Club. When the club host FINALLY shows up and asks how he can help, my friend says ""well it's my friend's birthday and we were told maybe we could get a table"", he literally says ""I don't give a fuck""!! I am not sure why he said it, maybe he was intimidated and/or joking..Either way totally inappropriate to say to any ladies and my friend went off, a glass was broken and I called the restaurant manager over to diffuse the situation.

I paid about $110 per night for a three day weekend (incl taxes), which was about the same price I would have paid for Hooters if I wanted to stay there again.  So I opted for the better deal.

However, it is a bit off from the strip.  I stayed at South Point for my 22nd birthday, and I'll admit it was a bit hard to have to find a DD to take us to the strip and back for some exploring.  However, the hotel itself is not too shabby.  The room we were in was very spacious, although I didn't understand why the accessible room had to be placed as the LAST room in a long hallway...  Regardless, our rooms were pretty big.  Although there are no mini fridges (sucks that our alcohol wasn't always chilled) and no TV guide.

Helpful tips:
- Don't get a room on the 2nd floor.  The view stinks... (I mean, what view?)
- You can book a room and not be charged until 36 hours prior to your check in.

All of the rooms are located at the back of the casino, so you need to walk through it to get it.  Even though we were placed really far down the hall, I still enjoyed my stay here simply because it was a good price for the level of comfort you get.  They provide you with a coupon book, and I made use of the free cocktail and souvenir.

Only big drawback for me was the Casino... kind of dingy, and it doesn't help that I didn't win anything while I stayed at South Point.  And no Monopoly Tycoon slots??  For shame...

Oh well, at least the room was nice.  Check this place out if you're not feeling the strip during this Vegas trip.",2010-05-03 09:42:37

Orient Express is a great place to lunch when you want inexpensive Chinese food, fast.

Once again my friend argued, ""Orient Express is inauthentic!""  Okay, we are from Pittsburgh.  Has he ever been to China?  No, he has not.  So I don't know what authentic Chinese food is, but I've seen some people eating some pretty gross food on the travel channels, so I'll pass on it.

What I am familiar with is food that is tasty, which the food at Orient Express is.  The menu is diverse so everyone in your party will be able to find something, vegan, veg, carnivore, dieter, etc.

The hotel staff were outstanding. Overall, my room was clean and comfortable. And quiet - I never heard anything from another room during my stay.

The things I will ding the hotel on are the temperature controls in my room - it appears to be a very old central HVAC system - and it was hard to get my room cooled to the temp I like for sleeping. I called the front desk and advised them on this - they responded they would send an Engineer up - one never came. I eventually discovered that if I turned the digital thermostat control waaaaayyyyyy down - like 62 degrees - the room would eventually cool to 67 or so.

The other thing is - it's frickin' 2017. For gosh sakes - stop offering standard definition TV channels - they look like ass on a large flat screen HD TV. A couple of things I wanted to watch at night during my stay - were only offered as a SD channel - I ended up not watching due to the poor picture quality. Offer HD only please! No excuse for this!

The Westin has a Starbucks on the lobby level. It also has Urban Farmer attached to it. There is no convenience store in the hotel - there is a tiny ""pantry"" by the front desk - with an extremely limited selection of stuff.

The wait for the elevators could be long at times.

One again, Caste Village proves to be the South Hills' lost world  of well-kept secrets. 

It's basically another suburban shopping center, but come here and you'll find some pretty cool places, Silk Road's Gourmet Chinese  being just one example. 

From the outside, all you can see is a sign and a tinted doorway. Like most Chinese restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, you'd assume that the inside is modest with a small amount of dining space and that they mostly do takeout. 
 
Well to think so in this case was folly. Probably the most lavishly decorated and spacious Chinese eatery I've ever gone to, I kept thinking there couldn't be much more to the place until I kept walking back. I almost wanted a guided tour!  Large, flat, abstract sculptures floated over our heads. We ate in some sort of enclosure made of brick and wood. When I peeked around the corner, I saw another enclosed area with circular ceiling drapes for privacy. 

No, we were not in Highland Park. Whitehall, kids, Whitehall. 

I was ready to give Silk Road 5 stars before we even started our early dinner. The fine Chinese fare only reinforced my preconceived rating. 

I went with 2 apps: Beijing Style Potstickers and Skewered Sacha Prawns. 

According to the menu, they use pork for the potstickers, and other than that, I have no idea what else they put in them. The potstickers compare favorably to Dormont's Amazing Wok which also have doughy wrappers and obscenely rich meat. There are 6 to an order, plated extravagantly on an artful, rectangular dish.

Pssst. I had forgotten how much fun it can be to eat-in at a Chinese restaurant. It's a totally different deal than takeaway. 

My Skewered Sacha Prawns were also aces. I forget how many you get with an order (I think I got 6), and I cannot remember what the marvelous sauce was made of (the takeout menu is barebones in terms of info, but the in-house menu had all the details, and I wish I had photographed the pages or something, arrgh...), but they basically took something you'd get from a Strip District vendor, put it in a limo, and sent it to Mt. Lebanon. Sweet, savory, select. 

They have desserts as well, which is uncommon for a Chinese establishment. I almost got the Fried Ice Cream, but instead me and my ladyfriend opted for the Milky Coconut Puffs, and we were glad to have made such an exotic choice. They were like a cross between macaroons and the Indian confection known as Gulab Jamun. Deep fried, honeyed, and not overly sweet, they were a welcome diversion from the sizeable decadence of so many other restaurant desserts.

Not that I don't love sizeable, decadent desserts, now.  I'm not wimpin' out on yas, but the Milky Coconut Puffs were a nice change of pace for me. I'm glad we rolled the dice. 

As far as the service goes, the staff was efficient and attentive but were also a little harried, curt, and somewhat impersonal, as if they were really busy and were just trying to get us in and out. It didn't affect my experience enough to knock off a star, though. 

Journey southward onto the Silk Road and find yourself cruising into a gastronomic Tian. 

All right,  that was a little over the top. Just go. It's pretty frickin' good Chinese.",2010-08-16 06:13:16

I called and they said the groomer would be in till 7pm and I could bring Bella, my baby, in for a nail trim without an appointment. 

Bella loved the store and tried to eat just about everything on the shelves.  They even had the cutest doggy bakery with donuts, cookies, cupcakes, and other treats for your dog.  There were self washing stations and a ton of toys, dog food, collars/leashes, and pretty much anything you could imagine your pet would need.  I was surprised at how large the place was and a great selection.  

They had a great deal for $25 for nail trimming, two baths, ear cleaning, anal glands, eye cleaning, and a cute bandanna.  Plus the oil treatment was free when I checked in on yelp.  You usually have to make an appointment but the groomer said she had time to squeeze us in and it would take about an hour.  

Barking Dogs called exactly an hour later and I picked Bella up.  She was very energetic and had apparently bonded with the groomer very well.  Happy dog = happy owner.

My friend had been trying to take me to Sambuccas for a while to try their $25 Prix-Fixe menu which apparently includes the best crème brulee, so we eventually went on a Sunday evening in June. The restaurant itself was nice enough, upscale-casual, not too loud or bright. The service was okay, but the server was a little hard to find at times.

The prix-fixe menu had a wide selection, and the food was generally good. I started with PEI mussels in cream sauce, which were very good, and my friend had the mixed salad. For entrees I had risotto with grilled chicken and mushrooms, and my friend had the Spanish paella. We both agreed that the risotto was the better choice, although I also tried some paella which was okay.

The service was great and the casino is ideally located around the intersection of Flamingo road.

Our favs are the following:

1. Mung Bean Ball Soup - Deep Fried Balls of some kind of bean and batter in a clear soup with some veggies

2. Hot and Sour Soup - Generous helpings of tofu and bamboo shoots and mushrooms in this soup that is THE best on a cold or sickly day

Anyways, Wvrst is a cool bar/restaurant that serves up good libations with a whole menu filled with sausage. And not just any normal brats either. They have a variety of game meats, which is what drew me in. Where else can you eat kangaroo, venison, or duck sausage??

Coming with a friend of mine, she had no idea what this place entailed. So I surprised her with some kangaroo sausage in a bun with grilled onions, and also tried the regular bratwurst, currywurst style. You have the option of sticking your sausage into a warm toasted bun, or to have it served currywurst style which is just your sausage of choice cut up and served with sliced country bread and a tomato curry sauce. 

The kangaroo sausage is something I've never dreamed about eating. But seeing as how I wouldn't mind eating every animal possible (maybe not humans...maybe), I knew I had to give it a shot. The meat itself is rather tough but not gamey in flavor at all. Similar to pork in taste and texture and honesty, probably couldn't tell the difference between them. Being encased in sausage may not be the real way to encapsulate that true ""kangaroo flavor"", but it was still good with the bite of the slightly grilled onions on a toasted bun. 

The bratwurst, served currywurst style, was pretty good. The brat had a sharp bite to it and I loved the curry sauce. Rich tomato-y taste with a thick texture. I'm not sure why they call it curry because I could not taste any hint of curry (coriander, cumin, or anything of that sort). Portion was small though, and it really leaves you wanting more, especially for the $8 price tag that it garners.

Overall, it's a good place to come for beers and sausage, but if you were as hungry as we were, it wasn't the right place to grab dinner.

This was the first place I ever met fellow Yelpers in Phoenix, as it was the venue for an UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) and I was brand new to the valley.  It did not disappoint... the food is amazing, for both the price and the quality.  And, of course, I was thrilled to discover how nice all of the new people I met from Phoenix were.

I've continued the tradition of introducting people from out of town to one of Phoenix's (Tempe... you know) brightest gems.  Even a friend from Napa, who knows fine wine and fine dining, was blown away by the food here.  I had the chicken schwarma platter which, in my opinion, is the best sampler of what they offer here: delicate Basmati rice, creamy creamy hummus, spicy chunky chicken and tabouleh (I believe that's what they call the greenish side salad-ish stuff). My dining companions ordered the gyro platter and were happy as can be.

Another treat here, besides the incredible food, is the grocery store.  I was on a mission to find a spicy Tunisian pepper condiment, harissa, for eventual use in homemade merguez sausages. I found it and have it tucked away for the next time I dare to make my own sausage.  Haji Baba has become my one-stop shop for all things Middle Eastern and delicious.",2014-01-31 00:12:18

Anyway... They give you just enough garnish for your pho (bean sprouts, basil, like, and jalapeños).  Although the broth was delicious, I don't prefer my pho that sweet, so I had to add jalapeños for a kick and lime to tone down the sweetness.

After hearing raving reviews, I decide to give this place a shot. 

I walked in and sat at the bar.  The cook was standing there looking at his phone and didn't greet us until we said something(all the while still looking at his phone).

I decided to get the corned beef sandwich since it was recommended to me by some people.  Easy on the coleslaw and fries.  I also tried their chili.

Even being easy on the coleslaw and fries, it was a pretty big sandwich.  The fries and coleslaw definitely overshadowed the corned beef.  The sandwich was decent but definitely not amazing as some reviews would say.  The fries could have been cooked a little bit longer imo.

Update:
I didn't want to do a complete update as I only went back for the ""almost famous chili"" the 2nd time around.  I have to say they totally butchered the chili.  It's probably ""almost famous"" for being the worst made chili ever. It was practically tomato soup with onions.  VERY little beans and beef.  I wouldn't even call this chili.  Sorry but if a fast food joint like Wendy's can make better and heartier chili than this place, something is wrong.  The only thing they got right was the bread and butter.

The chicken they use is so fresh and the strawberries were too! Especially since it's not strawberry season anymore! 

For the soup I went with the chicken tortilla, it has nice chunks of fresh chicken too! I just don't like how they charge you for tortilla strips, the strips are just a given when you think of chicken tortilla soup, so they tack on that and they charge you for cheese :/

I guess the food makes up for it because everything tasted great! I even took a dessert home which did not agree with me (it was too rich/decadent for my tummy LOL) I didn't even taste my chocolate strawberry since I got too full!

People can go shopping at the mall, and then find a restaurant to eat. The location is such convenience for people.

Our noodles came out fast. The noodles were well cooked. Vegetable in the soup was fresh. The soups were very hot and tasty. I believe both of them used the same chicken soup base. Each bowl had lots of meat. Both noodles bowls were large portion so delicious and tasty. We ate them all. My hot milk tea was OK. It was very simple, which tasted like Milk + Tea. My boyfriend's cold milk tea was very different from mine. It was super delicious and had very strong flavors. The whole meal cost us $19 include the tax. Add the tips, we spent $21. It's such a great experience at Pebble Street. We enjoy our dinner there. Definitely, we should come back to this place again.",2017-10-23 15:41:34

When I think of short rib, I think of braised short rib...long pieces of falling apart deliciousness in a rich sauce. Not the case. This was chopped into small cubes short rib (and too much of it), with a tiny amount of potato and onion in it. The meat was lacking flavor and was a bit chewy. I did not like it, sorry Bouchon! I was really really regretting not just getting the eggs and toast breakfast. The good part, however, was they did have toast with home made jam that was good and the BF loved his food.

If you really need a lower cost hotel, it's a weekend where there is a big event in town or a holiday weekend and you forgot to book something till the last minute, or everywhere else just has crazy prices (both true in my case) then this hotel is alright for a night.

It's not far from the Strip, so that's a plus. But the casino is old and smokey, the halls are smelly and dirty (we saw someone's leftover room service outside of their door all day, night, and into the next morning), and there are lots of people using it as an extended stay motel- full families with cribs.

We were able to get an updated room, and it was actually pretty decent, aside from the bathroom, which did not look like it got the benefit of the update. The shower didn't have fantastic water pressure, but at least the water got hot enough. Beds were just fine.

They have a liquor license now!  Sapporo!  They have a late night happy hour that looks pretty decent.

The strawberry shortcake was also excellent.  Very light and not too sweet.  The specials vary everyday so your food choices may differ.

For some I might agree (sorry 4th Street Bar & Grill) but Chinato? No way, Jose.  It's in a class of its own.

Chinato gets my official Dego endorsement.  This is the best Italian food I've ever eaten in my life.  It's not your traditional spaghetti and meatballs folks -- not even close.  Instead, this is mind-blowing, coma-inducing fare straight from my motherland.

I was fortunate enough to dine at Chinato with a group, so we sampled a number of items from the menu.  My absolute favorite appetizer was the Suppli -- deep-fried risotto balls.  In the words of Perez Hilton AMAZEBALLS.  They were crunchy on the outside, and creamy/cheesy on the inside, combining to create absolute perfection.  The wine list was also extensive and amazing; although I cannot take credit for our selection, a Brunello di Montalcino, I thoroughly enjoyed every last drop.  

Let me also say that dining at Chinato is an experience, not a meal.  To enjoy all Chef Zack Bruell has to offer, make an evening out of your visit and be sure to order every course.  Your tastebuds and  your tummy will thank you.

That being said, i started with the fennel and orange salad, finished with fresh ricotta.  I've eaten a lot of salads in my day (what female in her 20s hasn't?) and this is one of the best ever.  The right balance of crunch, sweetness and decadence, thanks to the ricotta, this had it all.  I then decided to go with a small order of the seafood cannelloni for my entree... big mistake.  I should've gotten the large!  The pasta was crispy, the filling was tender and meaty, and the sauce had a little spice that provided a great finish to the dish.

You also can't go to Chinato without ordering dessert.  I mean, that's the best part of any meal!  We sampled the chocolate hazelnut mousse cake and the lemon polenta cake.  Polar opposites, but equally delish.  Chocolate and hazelnut is pretty much the official dessert pairing of Italia, and Bruell nailed it.  The lemon was tart and sweet, topped with gelato, making me feel like I was at a trattoria in Roma, and not across the street from the Q.

Go to Chinato, that's all I can say.  You won't be sorry.",2010-10-01 16:57:07

No, I owe it to Yelp to warn people about what the experience really is.

First, there is NO ambiance.  This small restaurant is tucked into a mall/retail area that is called J-town (Japanese).  I've been to Japan and it's not this shabby.  So this place is NOT suitable for business dinners or a date night, unless you want to relieve that small village feel of Japan.

Second, the menu is an abundance of the ""leftover"" parts of animals.  Liver? Check. Gizzards? Check. Bones? Check? Knuckles? (aren't those bones too?!?) Check.

I wanted to order a char-grilled item to try, but the only thing I could eat was the waygu beef.

My coworker and I ordered what we knew, or what we thought we knew...
-Edemame. Not that fresh or else it was over-steamed.  And where is the salt?!?
-Agadashi-Tofu. Honestly, this was the best thing we had.  The broth had lots of tasty mushrooms.
-Hamachi and Toro sashimi.  The yellowtail was fresher than then tuna, which was mushy and flavorless.
-Spicy fried shrimp.  It was not that spicy, nor flavorful.  
Finally, the ""dumplings"".  I guess we didn't that this is really ""fried chicken wings stuffed with pork"".  My coworker ate one.  I couldn't stomach trying it because of the feathers that we still on the fried wing.  So we left two of the three ""dumplings"" uneatened.

My husband and I had been here before but went to the one on sunset this one is a lot closer to home. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated right away. The service is impeccable they're always coming back to ask you if you need anything and check on you. The food is also amazing the eggs Benedict is very good and I highly recommend it if you like it. The pancakes and waffles also looked very good from what I could see people eating. Everything is fresh and gets to the table right away. They also have a great yelp coupon for a free banana nut muffin which is also very good.

In one, you can pick the raw foods (shrimp, crab meat, fish, meat, mushroom, bamboo-shoots, baby corn... and dozen more) and select the sauce (from 8 choices) and they will cook it in front of you.

The Con's:
* The bathrooms are up stairs. A real bummer when your all cocktailed up and have to navigate carpeted stairs. There is an elevator, but you kind of feel odd waiting for an elevator to go up one floor.

The Pro's:

* Staff is always top notch, from the hostess, to the bus guys, all are great and seem to have been trained very well. Anyone can help you with anything. Never do you hear ""I will tell your waiter"". They just get things done and do it well.

* Food I always top notch. Never had a better steak on the strip. 

* Great vibe and crowd. Upscale and nice looking crowd. No torn jeans and camo here. It's nice seeing folks get cleaned up and dressed for dinner.

If you're stuck waiting ona  table, the bar has plenty of sports and well-mixed cocktails.  Reservations?  You'll be fast-seated and waiting in a large, red velvet booth.  All the waitresses are ladies who reminded me of Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast, prim maid costumes.  Everything's about style and presentation here, coupled with deliciousness.  I love the giant Pulitzer Prize-style medallions every chef wears!  

The giant salad is big, but every cut of prime rib is twice the size you think it is when you see it in the menu.  English Cut would be the sane man's choice -- the Lawry's is for leftover prime rib sandwiches the next day.  (Delicious even then!)   Their creamed corn is not to be missed either, trust us!  We never knew we would be so amped about creamed corn either until we were halfway through our portions demanding more.

Today you became forgettable, typical AYCE. The criticisms are many but can be easily rectified if you just stuck to what gave you success early on. Otherwise, you are on borrowed time. I'm still scratching my head how quickly you became bad.

My friend and I came for the melt-the-mouth, just flame-torched oishi that had the fish still warm with a caramelized smokey flavour. That's what it used to be like. Now you've cut the fish into paper thin bits and replaced it with huge amounts of cold pre-pressed rice straight from the fridge. The aburi is either mass-produced before and seared for a millisecond because it is neither warm, melt-in-your-mouth or smoky anymore. I know you want to speed up the process but please don't pre-make them, use fresh rice, and give the torch another 15 seconds to do its work and meld the flavors together. 

I still love the ebi (shrimp) oishi but again protein rationing is becoming a big thing here. Although you've raised your prices already, I don't mind paying another $5 if you stop skimping on all the good stuff. Rice is not what made you guys good.

If you are looking for good Italian kitchen family style food you must go to Maggiano's, 5 star and you get a ton more food for the same price as this joint.  The service tonight was slow and I didn't expect that since we came in after the rush.  The waitress seem experienced but she only pretended to care.  She seem as if she could not be bothered by us even after we introduced ourselves as first time customers.

If you talk to them, notice how they have a pause between each statement, comment, or question that they tell you. They are cautiously calculating what to say, because they got missile lock on you. 

Wednesdays is Ladies Night, which is prime cougaring hunting grounds. And then there is Thursdays Latin Night, there is a small drop on the cougar population, but remember, travel in a pack to avoid getting pounced on. 

They provide industry discounts for retail employees on The Strip, or restaurant employees with their health cards. 50% off all drinks and a few dishes. Show the bartender your wristband that you got from the hostess. 

I recommend the PB & J Cocktail from this one guy that works here. He adds a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the peanut butter. Thats probably the most unique drink I remembered seeing on the menu.

First off, the kimchi is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the kimchi, but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre kimchi.  Not this kimchi.  You'll get this as an appetizer, so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it.  Our server (the owner?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the kimchi, being the kimchi fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The crust was kind of thick, but not greasy at all.  The meat was delicious, great spice and herb flavor.  A good sign of things to come...

I ordered the Hot Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.  Quality beef, super fresh veggies, and really nice Kochujang(?) sauce.  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly flavored.  What set this dish apart for me was the high quality for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized rice grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of kimchi, I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last rice grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean dish!

I also managed to taste my friend's bulgolgi.  I normally don't like bulgolgi because it is always tough and overly sauced.  Not this bulgolgi, which is the best I have ever had.  VERY tender, and expertly seasoned.  The sauce was light and of a homemade quality.  Just delicious!

Again, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean food, this is the place to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean food, this is the place to go when you do.  If you are a Korean food snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!",2012-06-13 22:24:44

Four different featured made to order juices such as ""digest, cleanse, energize, and detoxify ( of which I love the ""cleanse"", made with apple, kale, mint, pineapple, and spinach) are available at 16oz for $6.5, 24oz for $8.5. 

Cold pressed 16oz juices are bottled and ready to go at $9.5 and cover all bodily needs from recovery to strengthening to flushing out impurities (think cayenne, lemon, turmeric)

Acai bowls are also available here for $5.5 for small and large for $7.5.  The ""cyclist"" is my go-to as it is the sweetest with dates, peanut butter, almond granola, cacao and banana.

Having frequented whole foods and various other juicing locations, I do love this one for the more sweeter combinations, and the expediency with which my order arrives in my waiting hands.

The restaurant has a really good vibe. We were seated at a table underneath a very large artificial tree. That sounds bad but it actually had a very good feel to it. Our server, Lisa, came over almost immediately and took our drink order. I was really disappointed to find the restaurant had no beers on tap, only bottles. We decided to start by sharing a bowl of gumbo. Warning! A $6 bowl of gumbo is quite small and not large enough to share. It did have a good amount of sausage in it considering the size of the bowl. But overall, I found it somewhat bland. It was okay, but disappointing for a New Orleans style restaurant. Being in the mood for Cajun food, I ordered the jambalaya. The portion was quite large. There was ample sausage and New Orleans vegetables in it. Overall, I would rate it as a good jambalaya but not excellent. Again, disappointing for a New Orleans style restaurant. My wife ordered the Portobello sliders. She described them as ok but not really good. Also disappointing. I did get a bottle of Stone IPA beer. That was excellent and did not disappoint at all.

I had decided to try their macarons ($2.50 each). I got the green tea and mango flavoured macarons. They were also one of the better ones I tried, not as great as Nadege macarons, but relative compared to Ruelo, in my opinion.

We also tried their strawberry souffle ($8.50). The waiter had told us that we needed to wait about 45 minutes for the souffle to be prepared because it wasn't the peak hours and we got to see the chef bake it in front of our very eyes. We patiently agreed and it was definitely worth the wait! Fresh out of the oven, the top portion was slightly crisp and placing it in your mouth, the souffle melted like cotton candy.

u7t5rpllY-Jmzn9Spy7iuw,eRDWzHCldd6YXypRECvHYg,lZwjDCAna4K9V5A-rj0-vQ,3,32,9,7,"My brother and I just returned from 3 days in Montreal and I took the Megabus both ways (he met me there because he had flown in from Miami--yeah, he is a lucky butt!) The drive to Montreal from Toronto was great. I left at 9am on Tuesday morning from Toronto and the bus was only half-full. This was great because it allowed me to take up two seats and spread myself out (I am pretty small so I could make myself into a ball and I slept the whole way). 

The return was a whole different story. 

It has been 2 yrs since I have taken the Megabus to Montreal and the last time I was there, the stop was located indoors. On our way home last night I made the mistake of not double-checking the address, and I ended up getting my brother and I lost. It turns out that even though you still get to wait indoors for the bus, you still need to go through the outside to get to the entrance of the new stop. This was not the case before.

The stop itself is sparse and there is nothing around. Since my brother and I were taking the 12:15am bus to Toronto, the area looked even more sketchy (imagine dark, dead and gloomy). My brother and I were the first to get on the bus and we went straight to the 2nd floor and snagged the row in the back hoping that we would be able to sleep using up an extra chair each. Wrong. The bus got packed really quickly and we had to give up the extra chairs. I know, it's not cool to try to take up extra chairs, but come on, you can't tell me you have not tried to avoid having someone sit next to you! So, we lost the middle seats to 2 gentlemen and my brother and I got comfortable in each of our corners. Right before we left the station, a man with 2 dogs got on the bus. The man did not exactly smell great, so many people moved from the back of the bus where the man had chosen to sit with his dogs, to the front or bottom of the bus. The 2 gentleman sitting between my brother and I tried to cover their noses, but after 20 minutes or so, they gave up and left their seats. So yeh! For getting the extra seats for my brother and I to stretch on, but neh for having a pretty smelly ride home. 

Here is my advice:

*As soon as you arrive, get in line (sit on the chairs against the wall by the window) 
*If taking a bus after 9pm, buy food in advance
*After they open the line, you need to walk to the bus located on the street--sometimes not in front of the waiting area. Why park so far? Who the heck knows?
*It gets really cold on the bus. Come prepared with scarves and blankets",2013-09-28 01:46:42

Had the quinoa balls as a starter which were delicious.

My favorite guacamole was the pineapple and jicama. I am not a huge fan of blue cheese, but I thought I would give the blue cheese guacamole a whirl...after trying several scoopfuls I am still not a fan of blue cheese. I usually say that there is only one food I dislike: anything from the fennel plant. But I take that back. I also dislike blue cheese. While other foods may not be my favorite, I am at least able to tell if it was prepared well or artfully. This is not the case with fennel or blue cheese. My gut is that everything at Momocho is prepared skillfully, just as my carnitas tacos were when we did get our table. Momocho is dimly lit and not a great place to take someone with ailing vision.

While Mango's is not quite a place that I would give 5 stars (yet), it certainly has some elements that I quite enjoy. 

Atmosphere/Service
Located in NoDa, Mangos provides a great vibe if you enjoy Caribbean food and good cocktails. They have a great street side location and patio. I wish the patio was in the front of the building, but structural I assume it is not possible. The general dining space provides adequate seating, beautiful murals and a small bar.

The service is quick and friendly. Joe, the bartender is great. Be forewarned, he makes a mean mango Mojito, which pairs very well with the roti. 

Food
The ceviche was quite good. It was the perfect pair of fresh, citrus and heat. Garnished with pickled mango, it's one of my faves.

I used to come to this establishment all the time when it was a wonton house lol. So coming back was pleasant and the new food too!
Service was friendly and great! The food came out quickly as well.
They have a lunch special from 11:30-3:00 for $6.50, with comes with a variety of selections from tofu, veggies,fish,and even seafood! It also comes with soup, served with white or brown rice or you can opt for a bun roll.
Everything was priced so decently, it won't take much to fill you up and NOT hurt the wallet!
I had Thai tea and #97 Hunan Scallop Pan Fried Noodle. Both of which were tasty!

It was great that they could accommodate the large reservation and the staff seemed to handle our group pretty well.  There were a couple of errors with food (forgetting bacon & sausage for example), but nothing too major to throw off the mood of the group.

Apparently the famous dish here is the red velvet pancakes, which I only got to taste a bite of due to being gluten intolerant.  The small bite I had was pretty tasty and they are well presented - those who got the pancakes really seemed to enjoy them - like having candy for breakfast!

I ordered the regular breakfast with no toast and it was sufficient enough to fill me.  When I first looked at their menu I thought they had gluten free options, but actually all they do is highlight that your meal is gluten free if you don't get toast or the tortilla in the breakfast tortilla.  Thanks for the head's up I guess.  Good to know I'll pay the same for less food then other people.  If you love your caffeine, the coffee does flow pretty freely and they fill up the cup lots.

We ordered the Chestnut Millie Crepe cake and I found the filling to be too creamy. They use crumbled chestnut however, it lacked the chestnut taste. The filling was very heavy in creamy taste, it leaves a buttery aftertaste in your mouth. However, the pastry (crepe) of the cake was a good texture.

I ordered their Cappuccino and loved the little cup and plate they served it in! You can definitely taste the espresso in their cappuccino and its not too milky tasting. I must say it was a pretty good cup of cappuccino.

Pros:

- They had great live music on Sunday
- Dog friendly patio

FdiT-l6m1Fzw_jeRyGrjJw,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA,5,2,1,2,"Full review blogged.  Dish Highlights Below:

Scamorza Pizza with house cured fennel pork salumi, radicchio, chili, local smoked buffalo milk cheese:  Featuring oblong Roman-style pizzas served un-cut on large wooden cheeseboards alongside a pair of shears, this $17 pie would certainly prove a step up from the nodini and with ample amounts of aromatic salumi, bitter radicchio, slightly acidic tomato sauce, and creamy cheese this was a case where the whole was not only as good as the sum of its parts, but better.  With the crust minimally charred and slightly floppy plus each ingredient fresh and flavorful this was the sort of pizza worth going out for and given the lightness of the crust it proved an excellent appetizer for three (and would have proven a formidable main for one.)

Spaghetti Alla Carbonara with bronze die cut gragnano di napoli pasta with house made guanciale, pecorino, black pepper tossed tableside with farm hen's egg:  Dining with two of the least adventurous people I know the pastas at Buca would prove a bit of a challenge as none were boring in the least, but after a more than a week of great eating I was given carte blanche to order something I thought they would like and we started with a rather traditional carbonara featuring salty pork and an ample shake of both pecorino and pepper with the egg added and mixed tableside while the pasta was still steaming.  With the noodles thick and springy and each ingredient melded into silky smooth sauce this was simplicity done right.

Fusilli Al Ferretto with fresh hand rolled fusilli with fennel soffritto, green tomato and golden delicious apple sauce, spot prawns, toasted focaccia:  Obviously more adventurous than the spaghetti this large pile of fusilli would prove to be the savory of the afternoon and also one of the most impressive pastas thus far in 2012.  With each wide noodle prepared to just past al dente and the prawns still snappy it was in the juxtaposition of apple and tomato, fructose versus acid, and the manner in which the aromatic slick of olive oil infused with fennel and garlic that truly made this dish 'pop.'  Uncertain as to how the family would react to such a non-traditional dish I was admittedly surprised when both my mother and aunt seemed equally as wowed as I.

Bigoli hand cranked duck egg pasta with duck ragu, mascarpone, basil:  Perhaps the restaurant's most talked about pasta I ordered this pasta for myself with hopes that the ladies would give it a try but more than willing to eat the whole thing if they did not.  Ignoring the ""duck egg"" pasta as I find it hard to believe anyone could differentiate they type of egg used in noodles, I will note that the pasta itself was substantially different in texture from the flour/semolina based dishes that proceeded it and with the noodles less absorbent the use of creamy mascarpone mixed with the rich duck ragu worked brilliantly to make the sauce adherent.  A bit 'funky' without being gamey and rife with the flavor of duck confit tucked beneath ripe tomatoes I'm happy to say that while not quite as impressive as the Fusilli I definitely understand this dish's fanfare and would also place it amongst the best pastas of the year thus far.

Tiramisu di Buca with espresso soaked house made tapioca biscuits layered with mascarpone and chocolate mousse:  At $12 I expected this to be one hell of a tiramisu and...well...it was.  Having never heard of ""tapioca biscuits"" before we were informed that this was a gluten-free recipe utilizing tapioca flour, eggs, and butter to build a fluffy base that was subsequently saturated with espresso prior to being topped with mascarpone, tapioca pudding, chocolate mousse, and finally a crispy chocolate tuille.  Crunchy and creamy, sweetness balanced by bitter - it was a great take on a classic with the tapioca pearls adding another layer of intrigue while the only thing missing, maybe, was a splash of rum.

Risotto Originario with sweet risotto of heirloom Calabrian rice finished with buffalo milk, chianti poached plum, Quebec Flora Honey, Amaretti, Candied Clover:  They had me at ""risotto"" on a dessert menu and although it was nearly as expensive as one of the pastas ($14) it was worth every penny... toothsome but creamy, sweet but funky...it was perfect, and in this case a picture truly is worth a thousand words as it was the best dessert I had in all of Canada.  

The Verdict:  While some have complained that Buca is expensive (both the food and the all Italian wine list) and I certainly do not disagree with this claim as our lunch (without any of the aforementioned wine but including tax and tip) came out to nearly $45/pp, I can only say that for my tastes it was worth almost every penny.  High on quality, big on flavor, and rustic without sacrificing precision I've been to very few places executing Italian food on the level of Gentile and his team and nearly all of them have either been helmed by men named Vetri, White, Benno, or Batali.",2012-07-12 18:31:04

The meal started with complimentary cups of soup - a clear broth with a few vegetables and tofu.  For entrees, we shared the crispy spicy eggplant and spicy crispy beef.

As someone who's never late, I had to have experienced a certain level of satisfaction to cause this coma.  After years of promising to try this Shadyside gem, I finally bit the bullet with Jonathan D. and headed there for a lovely little Wednesday date night during Restaurant Week.  Though their full menu was available, we both opted for the 3-course Restaurant Week menu which consisted of: Choice of Starter - either Falafel or Mussels; Entrees - Vegetarian Bolognese; Arctic Char and Scallops; and Braised Pork Cheeks; and a dessert of Ice Cream and Bread Pudding.  We both opted for the mussels to start and what a perfect beginning it was.  I'll order mussels anywhere...including places I shouldn't. Though I love them, I'm often disappointed with the broth and/or bread - always left longing for something more. Not this time.  I don't know what they do to those mussels or what that sauce/broth/heavenly soup was, but it was the BEST I've ever had.  I chose the Arctic Char and he chose the Pork Cheeks for our entrees, and neither were disappointed.  The scallops were the highlight of my dish, and while the char could have used a bit more seasoning, I loved it just the same. After tasting Jonathan's Pork Cheeks (not a euphemism), I was equally hooked.  We both ended with the bread pudding, of which I'm not generally a fan. For what it was, it was delicious.

In theory, it sounds like it would be fun to fit as much as you can between two loaves of bread; however, it is not as appeasing in practice. The best game-plan that I can offer is to try to bite the sandwich as is for the first bite in order to appreciate the experience, and then to ""accidentally"" allow the french fries to fallout during the second bite so that you can appreciate the food.

The owner showed me the artist motif around the restaurant which is very catchy. Even the tables have the names of various streets on them.

My waitress came and reviewed the menu with me. She told me that most of the dishes are small plates but if I wanted more then order a sandwich. I settled with the brick chicken  chlebicek (aka open faced) sandwich. It comes with fries coated with cheese.

I had to wait about 15 minutes for my meal but my waitress was attentive and made sure I had enough to drink during that time. The chicken comes with the skin on It is topped with a chicken liver mousse spread along with pickled onion and radish. It is served on a thick baguette. The chicken was mouthwatering good. Only difficulty I had was cutting it through the whole piece. Would have been easier with a sharp knife but my waitress suggested I just eat it by hand which I did.

The fries were good too and with the cheese added on top, absolutely filling. She then showed me a dessert menu but I was way too stuffed to try any of it. Will save that for next visit.

I usually get an omelette and love the size and the price. They have an apple sausage that is excellent. 
    Unfortunately, the last three times I ordered my omelette it has been about half the size it used to be. I finally asked the waitress if this was intentional and she said it was. The corporate office has not only cut the size almost in half but they have also raised the price 70 cents. Now the omelette is extremely small and not worth ordering. After the last time I was there I ended up going home and eating something else because I was still very hungry. 
     I can go to places like Ronnies cafe and have a huge omelette and only have to pay about $9. U.S. Egg is more expensive but there omelette's are good sized and filled with things like roast beef or chicken and veggies so there's a good value for my money. 
    Cutting the size and raising the price is completely unacceptable to me so I will not be eating at Black Bear ever again. It is very sad when a restaurant makes changes like this and ruins things for there customers. I hope that Black Bear is reading this and takes note.

They were also all very friendly and welcomed us as we took our seats by the sushi bar. As a side note, you should call in advance to make a reservation if you want to sit at the sushi bar.

The main menu consisted of a limited selection of only 5 courses to choose from. We each ordered the Omakase Sushi, which came with miso soup, 13 pieces of sushi, and a handroll. We watched as our chef made each piece of sushi, and his knife skills were phenomenal. I liked how the chef described what each of the fish were as he served each piece of sushi to us, so I knew what I was putting in my mouth! As a heads up (for those who don't eat wasabi like me), they put a bit of wasabi in every piece of sushi, but it wasn't overwhelming, so it still tasted good. They also grind lemon and brush soy sauce on the fish before serving it.

Compared to uni that I ate at another sushi restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of an unpleasant aftertaste after eating the uni sushi at Zen, which shows how fresh their seafood is. The handroll was the last piece of the night, stuffed with tuna belly. According to the chef, the tuna belly is stored in a freezer of minus 50 degrees Celsius, to maintain its freshness and so that it wouldn't change colour! He advised us to eat it as soon as it was made to get the full taste. The seaweed was extremely crispy, so you don't need to bite on it forever to break it apart. The tuna belly melts in your mouth, and the onions mixed in with it added a subtle refreshing taste to it.

Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious! I will definitely be back to try their Omakase Sashimi. :)",2016-02-22 00:23:31

The tables had been covered with tablecloths and large platters of wraps, sandwiches, veggies, fruits, treats, bakeries and more. There was also plenty of ustensils, plates and napkins.

I really enjoyed opening day at Murphy's Law. This place looks so polished and interesting, I could have sworn it was part of a larger restaurant group. They had all the staple items you'd expect at an Irish pub (stout, stews and plaid clad wait staff).

Food
Fish and chips were tasty and crispy. It was a large portion and the standard fries were really good.
The hamburger I ordered medium came out bloody rare and cold. Their second attempt was well done and without a lot of flavor. This part was the biggest flop of the evening.

Service
Super friendly and amazingly attentive. They did have opening day jitters, but I'm willing to overlook a miscooked item on opening day if your servers have a great attitude. They did!

Special
They have a special item on their menu that if you order it, they will donate 1/2 of the price of the item to a local downtown Chandler non-profit ICAN. That's cool!",2008-11-23 16:13:01

Cop Cars: If 3 cop cars were here eating food...then it must be filling and good. The place was almost empty so we got seated right away. The ambiance had a definite shabby chic/ country feel to it....

True enough...we got our money's worth for our orders. Nothing beats eating breakfast on a non-breakfast hour....

Cory got the Lumberjack and the serving was enough for his appetite. and trust me. It's hard to fill his growling athlete's stomach. He savored every bit of it....And i too got a taste of it. It was good, packed with meat...and the eggs' texture was great and the flavor was amazing. 

I, being the more traditional one, got my most favorite breakfast (you can even include lunch and dinner to that)...Bacon and Eggs with Toast. It came with potatoes which I was too full to even touch. I liked how it came with 5 long strips of bacon that were perfectly fried and not too salty.

""Now I know why you have a shopping bag on your head :) Dont make stupid statement by inviting our cooks to learn how to cook at Pita Kitchen. If you prefer Pita Kitchen then by all mean enjoy their beef . Also dont compare apple to orange and this also tells me how naiive your opinion in the food industry. Go and read the reviews on Zeta's Grill.""

John S.: Your spelling, punctuation, and basic grammar errors really made me smile.  You wrote your comment at 11:23PM. Were you up late drinking?

John S., you admit to being _employed_ by Zeta Grill and you conveniently left yourself a 5-star rating!  Now we know why Zeta Grill ""appears"" to have fans! How utterly self-serving and dishonest.

The recent review by Daisy Y. on 5/29/2018 is spot on: ""However, I have to say the food was lackluster""

The service and ambiance at Zeta Grill are nice, but the food is utterly average and forgettable.  Reviews brought me in, but the food pushed me away.

6/18/2018 - Private message from Madhi, the Owner of Zeta's Grill:

""Can you just stop your low steam attitude and stop criticizing Zeta's grill . We know well your opinion and like we said there are many Mediterranean customers out there . Trust us we don't need customers like you in our restaurant . Why don't you open a culinary school and teach your nasty attitude in food to the public . You seem to be a sycho .  I bet you don't know how to cook couple eggs and you keep rising with fake stories :) we always respect our customers opinion about the food because we know they care, but your reviews mean nothing to us and go play somewhere else with your nasty attitude""

Based on the grammar and spelling errors, I am guessing Mahdi is ""John S. Detroit, MI"".

Mahdi, I don't hate you or your restaurant. I just want to eat authentic Mediterranean food with _flavor_.  I didn't find that at Zeta's.  I gave your restaurant THREE tries, and was disappointed each time.",2018-06-17 18:43:16

At 5:30 PM, we were the only two customers at the restaurant.  The server was super friendly and attentive.  He suggested a couple of his favorite side dishes to go with the fried chicken, Cider Slaw and Chili Garlic Broccoli.  

Around 5:45 PM, we could hear the sizzling sound of frying chicken.  We knew that it was going to be good.

About 6:00 PM, behold ... perfectly fried chicken.  Golden brown crust.  Crunchy.  It stayed crunchy until the last bite.  Juicy on the inside.  Not oily.  With the right amount of buttermilk batter.  It was so good, I picked the bones clean.  I also enjoyed the two side dishes.  The Cider Slaw had the right amount of acidity which contrast the chicken beautifully.  Chili Garlic Broccoli was also a hit.  It was garlicky with a kick.  Drenching with butter, it went down smoothly with the fried chicken. I would order this again.  The scallion biscuits were divine!

I really liked this shop. Now that I finally made it in to see what they're all about I was impressed with their selection. Being closed on Sundays is a bit of a downside for me because it's one of the only days I can usually make it down this way. The selection was awesome and they had everything you could expect as a professional or hobbyist photographer and then some. They're the only place I've seen in the area with Ilford film for example.

There were at least 4 guys working here when I went in. Of them only ONE came and asked me if I needed help and was even nice about it. He was an older gentleman named George. He was extremely helpful and even insistent on helping me find what I was looking for to accessorize my old 35mm Pentax K1000. But when I went to check out and pick out some film on the other side it seemed like the only thing the other guys could even muster up was some kind of stupid inside joke amongst themselves. It's unfortunate that a place with such great potential has a majority inconsiderate staff.

In my interactions as a photographer and assistant working with other photographers I have found that many of them really are inconsiderate, pretentious and down-right pompous.

Lexi kindly went above and beyond to arrange for a great table at the last minute. --Thank you, again, Lexi!-- Lexi's actions were a harbinger of the phenomenal service and experience that followed. 

Buffet options were extensive with the following favorites: 

Teas: vanilla orchid tea and a green tea that per its fragrance, I suspect was a tung ting jade oolong.

Appetizers: charcuterie; diverse cheeses from around the globe, including an exquisite tea-rubbed cheese; cut fruit and berries; delightfully dried prickly pear; a divine beet, watermelon and feta concoction; plus a fiery peach and serrano pepper arrangement. --For me, the flavorful and often innovative appetizers stole the show.

Entrees: a potato-chip pontine was quite good and waffles were ordered repeatedly by some at the table. The Chinese savory pancake and the Eggs Benedict crab option were not to my taste as both were a bit too heavy, dense, and fishy (crab). San Francisco and Baltimore restaurants might offer Wright's inspiration with the pancakes and crab... The buffet had some wonderful pork that was accompanied by a corn side. I also enjoyed the crab and fresh shrimp. Simpler options, such as a plain yogurt with fruit, were nice after all the richness.

Desserts were myriad with standouts including: an almond bar, various chocolate confections, and amazing apple pie.

Service was impeccable and kind.

Signage might help improve parking and valets might more carefully monitor the disabled/handicap spots - a vehicle was parked diagonally blocking two disabled/handicap spaces.

They were accompanied by delicious cocktail sauce and a second balsamic vinegar dressing thing.. Never had that type of dipping sauce for oysters before but it sure worked!

I then moved on to the Fried Catfish and WOW!  It was excellent.  The perfect amount of herbs and spices in the batter mix complimented the an ideal flaky delicious fish.  I was blown away with the taste.  Not to mention, they gave us three side options for the entree.  I went with the collard greens, fried mac n' cheese, and the mashed potatoes.

Would LOVE to give this place 5 Stars because the atmosphere is poppin,' the DJ was rockin,' and they have flavored Saki for the takin'! But everything ELSE considered, it winds up a solid 3 stars.

Seems like there are a few people that had a rocky start with their dining experience at Geisha A Go Go- such was also the case with our group. 

It was Saturday night and we were asked to relocate to another table shortly after being seating because another party, that was already seated and enjoying their sushi, preferred our location. I know, strange... to cut my venting about That to a minimum- we did eventually get menus, a server, and water... yay.

DJ was amazing- better than the club we ended up going to! Mixed B.E.P.s, Tupac, a lil Biggie Smalls... perhaps a lil Britney :). Bathrooms were also unique, contemporary, and clean. The Lettuce Wrap App with all of the Tasty dipping sauces is a great decision.

A poor dinner choice is the scallop bento box... Three scallops. Needless to say I regretted not getting sushi.  Instead of dining here, I would unregrettably recommend G.A.G.G. as a chill venue to kick-it.

I do, however, like the mall for its variety of stores (Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, Armani Exchange, to name a few), as well as having one of the best food courts I've ever seen in a mall (Urban Eatery). 

Outside all that pizzazz, however, it's just another mall that only happens to get the amount of tourists just because it's in downtown. Other malls (or independent stores) closer to where I live serve the same purpose, so the only way I would visit the Eaton Centre is if I do a downtown trip (which, unfortunately, hasn't been as often as a couple of years back). Oh, and it closes too early for a tourist mall.

I avoided the bathroom so I can't tell you if that was okay, but a woman did walk out of them with a comfortable expression so I'm assuming her experience was decent.

The cons.  And I'm not comparing to other stores, simply to other Walmarts.  This is a smaller location and has a smaller selection of items.  The layout was also really off for me-the clothing section seemed to take up half the store, yet the few items I looked for that I know exist were not there.  It also took a few laps for me to find what I needed.  The patio/garden section was minuscule, but the associate in the area asked the three women (including myself if we needed assistance, so that's still a bit of a plus).

It sounds like their associates were missing in action or ignore the speakers.  As I walked past the fitting room I overheard an associate looking for a manager to pick up a phone call for Toys that had been on the line for 15 minutes.  I heard the department paged a few more times, so I hope the person waiting had the patience of a saint or the store was stocked with a smooth manager.

I brought my set of Henckels here to have them sharpened and was really impressed.  It took less than an hour to get them sharpened and only cost $24 for eight knives.  Note that the prices are based on the kind of knife - chef's knives are $5, paring knives are $3, etc.  Now my knives are ridiculously sharp and cut through anything (including my fingers) like warm butter.  They also do knife repair in case your knives are screwed up and need some TLC.

Unlike some of the other frozen yogurt places that have more of a creamier tasting product, Pinkberry has a tartiness that some like and some don't. You'll want to get a free sample to see if it is to your taste before making a commitment. I found that the right topping addition cut the sweetness and really make for a delicious dessert. I'd recommend going with the nuts and not so much the sweeter toppings.

Their dipping sauces will put the french fries over the top with various choices and ""gourmet toppings""!!  Their choices include sauces like lime chile curry, vanilla icing for the funnel cake fries, barbeque, tiki masala curry etc. (The shoestrings are a bit better for dipping into the sauces.). 

Their gourmet varieties are french fry servings for two- with pepperoni pizza fries, Parmesan and truffle fries, chilli cheese fries, etc.  I can't wait to get their pizza fries (my arteries are slowly clogging at the thought of it).

A silk eye mask was placed over my eyes but i felt claustiphobic & after a few minutes and removed it.

Oh, and get this: you have to undress (like for a massage) and put robe on before getting your nails done.  I immediately foresaw the furture of getting dressed later & almost refused changing.   OK, so how the HECK r u suppose to get dressed afterwards with tacky nails??? ya, that was fun - i got all stressed out thinking about it.  Then heart pulpatations began when leaving: I had to pull clothing out of the locker, & do up zippers, buttons, ect.  (that was quite a feat).

I am giving 3 stars because it does not effect the over-all rating system.  and basically i am still mystified at the whole different experience.  
1 star for no quiet, zen-like waiting room
2 stars for clothing hassle
3 stars for strange position
4 stars cleanliness
5 stars for end result.

My friend told me about this park and said they had a play area for the little ones. Right then, I was sold. I had to take my son here. 

I live about 15 minutes away, so the drive wasn't terrible. It's super easy to find with plenty of parking. As others have said already, there's actual workout equipment for adults, a jungle gym for those under five years of age, another jungle gym for those between 5-12, swings, a miniature town where kiddos can ride scooters or bikes and a Pringles-looking climbing thing. So much to do!  The equipment looks pretty decent and I wasn't too grossed out letting my son touch things. There is also a huge grassy area for ball games, a hiking trail towards the back and an abundance of picnic tables for parties. The day I visited, I chatted with a few parents who all seemed pretty friendly. 

Here's where I drop a star.
1. ALL the grassy area was dead and brown. Really depressing looking. 
2. The park looks clean, but I saw a bunch of smaller pieces of trash everywhere: bottle caps, candy wrappers, straws, things of that nature. This should be addressed because since it is a park for the kids, the younger ones tend to pick up anything and everything to put in their mouths. I had to watch my son closely because he kept finding trash. 
3. Around the picnic area, there were shards of glass. Again, needs to addressed since it's shiny in the sun and attracts the little ones.

Papa behind the counter is super friendly, which is quite refreshing after a long day at work. There's a small tv in the back of the store, where you can sit (i think there's about 6 four seat tables), the tables themselves don't seem to be regularly cleaned - I think there the do-it yourself place, and the chairs aren't overly comfortable, but this isn't the type of place you sit and chill for a few hours.  

Overall their pizzas are pretty good. They aren't the greatest. Each slice is massive, a quarter of the pizza. The sauce is pretty good, but I've had better dough/crust elsewhere.

Oh, Thomas Keller serves his chicken roasted with his chicken and waffles.....
I take that back. It was delicious. That mans a genius. 

Located on the tenth floor of the stunning Venetian hotel, Bouchon is one of Thomas Keller's fantastic creations. 
The inside of Bouchon is elegantly decorated. It actually looks like an old French bistro you may find in France. 

Bouchon is open for breakfast, weekend brunch and dinner and is usually pretty busy, especially for brunch. And speaking of brunch, that's the meal my wife and I had at Bouchon. Since they don't take reservations for their weekend brunch we had to wait about fifteen minutes for a table. 

Once seated, we were given complimentary bread, butter and housemade jam. The bread was fantastic, as was the butter and jam. 
After the bread we ordered a side of pommes frites. These fries tasted so similar to fresh made McDonald's fries, which I mean as a compliment because I love fresh McDonald's fries.  For our main entrees this is what we ordered;

Me- Chicken & Waffles- Roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffles, Tahitian vanilla bean butter, sauce chasseur & maple syrup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=Jax-5woyQAIcJpNaHQkPHQ

My chicken and waffles were great. The roasted chicken was so tender and juicy. The waffles were light and fluffy but the star of this dish was Tahitian vanilla bean butter. I have never ever tried a better tasting butter. I could have eaten it with a spoon. Actually, I did. Although it looked plain, my wife's dish was delicious. The white sausage was amazingly juicy and the beurre noisette sauce was excellent. The buttered croissant that came with her dish was also great. Probably the best buttered croissant I've ever had.  


The service here is wonderful. Every employee we encountered was very warm and friendly. The prices for brunch are slightly high but since they use the best ingredients and since everything tastes so great I had no problem with the prices.

I like, I don't like it, then I like it again. This is pretty much the feelings I had when visiting District one. If a place projects itself as hipster, does that mean really they are no longer hipster? I got some googling to do.

After a cool yelp night at the Mirage, we decided a late night snack was required and after seeing some nice reviews of District One and throwing it up on my bookmarked places we decided to venture here.

Thursday night, the car park is packed, I have no idea why, maybe something was going on in another business that I didn't see or hear, so make sure you be patient. 

Walking into a near empty restaurant we were seated in a nice booth with a nice window view of some cool cars and neon lights. The layout is actually quite nice, with a nice long bar at the rear of house and nice big Tv's. The centre has 4 tabled chairs with a few booths closer to front of house. This place is a hipster bar, it doesn't seem like a restaurant in china or Asian town.

We were greeted by an extremely nice sever who went through a bit of the menu and made a few recommendations. All prices were very very reasonable, and dishes were quite large.

After looking at a few reviews on yelp we went with the Pork Belly Buns. And I'd like to pass on they were great!! As a main I grabbed the 5 Spice Hen. Little disappointed in this dish, very very dry and a little bland. I tried the Oxtail Soup which was a little difficult to eat but I will say to give it a try!

I like District One, I'm a little unsure how successful it has been, but I do believe the location might hurt them a little. This market would serve better on the strip or in a Green Valley or even in the heart of Summerlin with less Asian restaurant competition.

Loved the interior and atmosphere. You walk into a gorgeous, dark-wood accented bistro with an impressive bar, and a beautiful blue floor. Once seated, our busser introduced himself and said he'd be taking care of our drinks. Then the server came over, introduced herself, and helped with menu questions and told us the specials. Our child has a nut allergy, and we had no problems getting a safe meal. Food was delicious and very generously portioned. Large mountains of fries came with our croque madame and tartine. Egg dishes came out with thick slices of toasted brioche, accompanied by a butter and jam plate. All was delicious. 

You can tell they work hard to maintain their level of service. Our water got low a couple of times, and the server noticed and refilled our glasses. I believe the busser was reprimanded out of sight for poor drink service, as he came out rather sheepishly later, and our drinks never got low again during the meal.

Really enjoyable. The daytime atmosphere was wonderful, and we never felt that our kids were unwelcome. We'll definitely return.",2015-07-12 17:11:44

I've been to both dinner and lunch service, and was equally impressed with the food and service both times.

Pita bread is served pillowy and when punctured, it lets  out a puff of steam. Paired with the Factory Hummus,  it's even better.  The falafel appetizer is generously portioned and perfectly crisp. The veggies underneath offset the density that falafel can sometimes have. I had the beef schwarma sandwich. Once there was a tad too much tahini, but I scraped the excess away to make it better. The kafta is evenly seasoned and was mild enough for my son to eat too.

If I had to find fault with one thing, they plate so much vegetables - lettuce, cucumbers, etc. - on most of their dishes, that I feel like they could save some money giving a little less. I love my veggies, but i don't think their customers would notice or mind if they held back a little.

Our lunch waiter was extremely attentive but not hovering. Dinner was served by Niki (owner) and her daughter. Again, they were attentive and wonderful conversationalists.

We shared a margherita pizza and I must say they have hands down the BEST margherita in the city. The crust is perfect, it's thin with a great mix of cheese, tomatoes and basil. Too many of the places I visit tend to sprinkle what looks like 5 pieces of basil across a large pizza. Not Local.

My only complaint is that it always takes forever to get a pizza. I've been here a handful of times, and it's the same every time - 40 minutes to an hour. Kind of ridiculous, really. First time I took my boyfriend, raving about their pizza, we ended up waiting close to an hour and a half because our first pizza was burned. Fortunately, we were in good moods and our bartender was mixing excellent drinks. It also helped that the manager came out himself to apologize, took our pizza off the bill, AND upgraded it to an entree size (we originally ordered the smaller one). AND my boyfriend ended up loving the pizza and we were back the next weekend. :D

I like going and just hanging out at the tables or at the end of the bar nearest the windows, even when it's not nice out. I love fresh air and, of course, South Side has excellent people watching.

I've had the turkey focaccia and the southwest mesquite turkey sandwiches. Both are fabulous. The turkey is tender and tasty, but what really stands out to me (other than the best bread ever) is the fact that they use tons of fresh and delicious veggies on the sandwiches. Remarkably, the lettuce isn't floppy and microscopic--it's leafy, crunchy, and takes up a huge amount of sandwich space, but not TOO much. 

The bread, though. Oh those herbs and cheeses and the way it just falls apart with deliciousness. 

With such fluffy and well seasoned bread, you have to be careful with the flavors of the sandwich ingredients. I feel like TT is particularly careful and knows exactly how to sandwich. Perfectly. I can't speak for the sides, other than wherever their fruit comes from, it's heavenly. For under $10, this is a wonderful meal and I can even stretch it to two, but I'm often tempted to just eat the whole sandwich, even if I'm not that hungry. Unhealthy eating habit, I know, but these sandwiches are so wonderful. They practically melt in your mouth. 

The staff is always super friendly and even brought our food to us outside once. Something I didn't expect and was totally out of their way, which I really appreciated. Nice people are nice!

Lately I have been going here (surprisingly) to get some of the takeout food.  Specifically the Japanese food and fresh fruit juices.  Why do you ask? Well it is cheap for one.

The quality I would say is just a-ok, but if you consider the quality of the Japanese restaurants within a short distance to my place, their quality isn't too good either for the price you pay.  This includes the Ninja Sushi that is close by.

They also have fresh mango and watermelon juice which are pretty pricey, but for a quick fruity beverage + sugar rush associated with it, it is still cheaper than going to the other restaurants in the area (well save Pho 88 which has more selection and the soursop shake though I think it is $1 more expensive).

Some other things I have tried there and regretter are:

the onigiri (the filling isn't good, and their spicy salmon was the cheap kind of spice)

any bento box with eel (skipping those, the eel is tough and spiny plus they're more expensive)

I like Bannock for their (new) free wifi, to go counter and food in general. Most recently I enjoyed their version of a caesar salad, made with the-green-of-the-moment Kale and lentils, and I had a bite of a pal's pot pie. Both excellent. The ambience is fine. A bit Bay St Boring, but whatever.

Otherwise, this is just your average diner--so please don't compare this 4-star rating to anything outside of the diner-zone. 

This time it was a lot busier, but we were still seated right away. The hustle-n-bustle was a little on the annoying side, but really didn't bother our experience. The coffee was spot on and the eggs Benedict + side of perfectly crunchy bacon were also delicious, like last time. I added two mimosas to our order and the result was quite entertaining. They start by giving you a cup of juice filled to the brim, then follow that up by handing you a white wine glass and a mini bottle of unopened champagne. I'm not one to complain about serving myself a mimosa--heck--it's even great to have control over the bubbles-to-juice ratio. But I don't trust the average Joe opening champagne bottles on his/her own. And they could make it a little easier to pour the juice in the glass. But really and truly, it would have taken the server under 1 minute to make our first two drinks for us and then hand us what was left of the mini bottles.

I had the gnocchi with pesto, and it was clear that it was made fresh in-house, as it thankfully lacked the rubbery texture most gnocchi has at other places.

We also had the daily cheese selection which was freaking amazing.  We sampled 3 different cheeses, served with 3 tapenades.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable, and helped us select the most amazing cheeses flown in fresh that day.

Dessert was ok.  We had the doughnuts - one was filled with an apple sauce-like filling, and the other was a caramel custard.  I say it was only ok, as it did taste just like apple sauce, and the custard had a bit of a disarming chemical-y flavour.

It started off with the Rosemary table bread. The first bite was okay, until when you go for the second and then you realize something is off: it's salty. But whichever, assuming that was just the table bread and not the main course, perhaps things could've got better.

We had the red sauce seafood risotto. I usually like risotto and you know what, had they been less heavy on the salt - this would've been perfect. The rigatoni with the Italian Sausage - salty. The pizza with the prosciutto which generally I like to order - extra salty. Every food we had was salty and I could not understand what the correlation was.

We all left after about three hours and it was only upon exiting the building that I realized I had been given a bit of a headache by the acoustics. There isn't a soft surface in the entire place to soak any sound so once it fills up to peak dinner levels you are in a large room full of people yelling to be heard over each other's reverberated yelling...

Tong Por, you proved me wrong. My extended family and I visit the restaurant on Saturday and the place was packed, even though it's a pretty big restaurant. We ordered a bunch of food (salt & pepper lobster, prawn, razor clams, Chinese broccoli beef, and many more.) All the food came out hot and they were all excellence. The razor clam, which I tried for the first time, was nicely cooked and juicy, the lobster and prawns was crispy and not oily at all. Everything was sooooooooooo good, I wanted to keep eating even though I was stuffed. 

Want to know what was even more amazing? All that food that fed 15 adults very well only cost less than $250 bucks ( $ 1 CA dollar = $1.10 US dollar). Wow and wow. If I ordered the same thing in California or Las Vegas, it would have been over 400 bucks and the quality wouldn't even be that good.

I have wanted to try this place for quite awhile, but hadn't been able to make it in. It was my turn to plan date night and I figured this would be the perfect place to take my boyfriend. It ended up being more than I imagined and we both had a fabulous time.

I love how unassuming this place is - it's in a residential neighborhood and then in a business park within that area. When you enter, you are in the wine shop - note that they do not sell bottles of wine at the table, so if you want a bottle, take a few minutes to browse and find what you like, then take it to your table with you. You are able to purchase glasses of wine while at the table.

The service was fantastic - I really liked our server and will definitely go back to see her. The food was really good as well. We started out by sharing the Bacchus platter, which is basically the house charcuterie. It was a great selection and I enjoyed everything. My BF had the beef tenderloin and I had the steak frites. The steak was damn near one of the best I've ever had and was cooked to a perfect medium rare temperature. I also ordered an extra side of the goat cheese mashed potatoes, which were crazy good.

The ambiance is what really sets this place apart. You really don't feel like you are in Las Vegas - it's a serene feeling, on the lake watching swans float by. This is a great place for proposals - in fact, the couple at the table next to us got engaged while we were there.

20 minutes after our reservation time we were seated by pleasant staff and our waitress got our drinks promptly. 

Waited over 10 minutes for refills and no bread came out.  When it did, it was 1 small loaf for 6 people. 

Then another 8+ for refills and 2nd bread.  

Hopefully the food is worth it.

45 minutes later....

Shrimp was room temperature, all steaks were rare, ordered medium rare.  They tried to reheat the steak, which if you cut it open, loses a lot.  Jamie, the manager on duty had them cook new ones which came out perfect. 

Aioli for each was 'broken' before it got to the table. 

Vegetarian taco was woefully light on toppings.  The Pico di Gallo was weak.  They did include avocado, but that's ALL she could taste. 

My fish taco had very good flavor, but the slaw was tasteless and the same issue with my Pico di Gallo. 

Found hair in a shrimp skewer...
They replaced it of course. 

They did get the girls cheesecake as an apology.  That's appreciated.  My son opted for the chocolate milk shake which he found to be the best he's had (it's the only kind he gets)

No complaints with the quality of the food at all, everything we ordered we really enjoyed. The issue is with the service:

We got there around 7 and they were pretty packed, we were seated immediately and sides were brought out right away. Then we sat there for a long while waiting for the waitress to come to take our orders. She was very friendly but the rest of the service was not the best:
-we asked for two glasses with ice which never came
-we had to ask for napkins twice
-we had to stop a staff and ask for drink re-fills and for more sides, they never came back to re-fill our waters
-the guy that cooked our meats was very messy, he dumped the whole plate of garlic steak on the grill then put the pork belly right on top...I did not like the fact that the placed the non-marinated pork belly on the same grill as the garlic steak
-they were so busy they just throw the meats on the grill, never told us what we were eating
-we ended up grilling our own meat half the time because they rarely came back to check on us
-we ordered lobster which never came

It was obvious that they were under-staffed, towards the end of our meal when a few tables have left, they came more often and cooked out meats. I felt that the female staff were great, Bora cleared out dirty plates, asked us if everything was ok, and cooked our meats neatly. Whereas the guys were very unfriendly, we asked for stuff and even though they did give us what we asked for they never reply to let us know that they heard us, they simply walked away which is rude. 

I realize that this is in Chinatown and I usually don't expect much service from Chinatown, but the place is nice looking and gives a fancier vibe so I expected more service wise. Also, for the price we paid service should have been better. 

I really like the place and the quality of the food, but service really annoyed me. There are cheaper KBBQ places with better service.",2018-01-20 06:45:27

We were tired from work and definitely not in the mood to go out to the strip. I remember seeing a food instagrammer post about this place so I checked it out immediately! To be honest, we both were not expecting this place to be that good since I never kept up with those food bloggers. Plus, it is a beer pub.

HOWEVER, this place had so many craft beers to choose from. Our server let us try samples until we could decide what to order. We even told her that we are a blonde ale fan and she knew immediately what to reach out for (Super chill and sweet). Each server checked up on us on a timely manner and it wasn't difficult to reach out to them even if the table/bar area is a bit segregated.

Now with the food, the fried deviled eggs were amazing. The crispiness with the soft boiled eggs were an amazing combination. The gochujang aioli wasn't super spicy and overpowering either. The pork belly banhmi had a nice jalapeno kick to it and the craft burger was extremely juicy.

This mid-Dec evening, our party of three came for both happy hour AND dinner, and had a wonderful experience! We'll be back!


YELPY DETAILS you could Skip

On this cool, mid-Dec evening, our party of 3 came for the happy hour first in its spacious, stylish lounge with a classy bar. Although the bar counter was large, it was more than half full around 5. Our nice hostess placed us at a comfy corner table. 

We ordered our rounds of red wine (Penfolds Rawson's Retreat Cabernet, $5; BR Cohn Retreat Cab Sauvingnon, $7). Both wines were smooth and tasty. For munchies, we shared several small plates (pull pork quesadilla, 3 per order;  $5; Angus sliders, 2 per order $6; Jerk Chicken Lollipops, $5). All of them were quite flavorful.This evening, they also had a young man (Joe) with a pleasant, mellow voice singing and playing his guiter! We all warmed up to him quickly by his nice performance! 
- He even took requests from audience, and did an excellent rendition of ""On the Road Again""! 

At dinner time, the hostess led us to our table by the window facing the beautiful park with a gorgeous, gigantic Christmas Tree! Our sweet waitress, Joni, helped us select our entrée: 2 Ribeye with a side of potatoes ($39@), and Crabmeat stuffed shrimps with a side of spinach, $30. The shrimps were crunch, fresh and delicious. The ribeye steak, medium rare was juicy, tender and full of flavor. My ribeye order, cooked to MEDIUM, was a bit too dry, though still tasty - my own mistake for ordering it MEDIUM! The potatoes and spinach were excellent. 

Over dinner, we were entertained by the view of the beautiful Christmas Tree in the park with its lights changing colors over music, and occasionally peppered by falling (faux) snow flakes! What a wonderful holiday treat it was!

We were too stuffed to try their tempting deserts, but did enjoy a hot cup of coffee for good measure. The attentive service of Joni and her wait crew, and the tasty dishes...made our dinner another memorable experience! We'll be back for more, perhaps, even sample their deserts!

Every dish was one noted. Nothing special. 

The paella was also a disappointment. The saffron tasted off to say the least... maybe it was burnt or a kind that I don't know.

They essentially share the same space. The two places are divided by a half wall and a door. The food comes from Sainatos, but I think the tavern is it's own entity.....

Take the hill down Columbus Road, towards the Cuyahoga River, across the rusted Depression-era lift bridge, adjacent to the Heart Crane Memorial Park, just East of Rivergate Park, on the corner of Columbus and Merwin and you will find Sainatos and the attached Rivergate Tavern. A brick monolith surrounded by a sea of industry that used to be.  

Sainatos/Rivergate Tavern has become home to many of us at the summer league rowing session at the nearby Western Reserve Rowing Association. It's a place where firefighters, local townsfolk, and rowers converge. A friendly bar staff, adequate beer selections, HDTV's to catch the Tribe game and a huge menu. 

A newly formed connected bar has joined Sainatos called Rivergate Tavern. Inside Saianato's doors and through another set of doors to the right takes you to the bar area known as Rivergate Tavern. The food though comes from the same long standing Sainatos take-out kitchen. I'm pretty sure both the bar and older kitchen area of Sainatos are one in the same, although the bar area looks much newer and more conducive for relaxing and staying for a while than the take-out side of this place. Either way, the food, especially the pizza and wings that come out of this place are legit! 

The pizza we ordered was a basic pepperoni and cheese. The pie was sinfully good. Greasy pepperoni slices, cheese that strung as you bit into it and a crust that was, as proclaimed by the bartender, entirely homemade, as evidenced on how good it was. No frozen discs of dough used here. Everything's made on site. 

After a long evening of water sport, there are fewer things that complete the night than a cold beer, a good pizza and crispy wings. Sainatos is one of the few gems on this barren, almost eeriely deserted industrial side of town that is sandwiched in between one of the many bends of the Cuyahoga River. A gem worth seeking out even.",2011-06-22 17:00:48

Remember to take your iPod or some great tunes from your phone as you get to link it up to the stereo.

There is enough customer parking on the side BUT the lot is a bit tight so I would strongly suggest that you try and park closer to the back end where other cars aren't adjacent - you'll know what I mean when you get there.

This happened on my first visit: even though I'm from Etobicoke, I probably have never gone across Advance so, when I parked in the customer lot, I couldn't find the entrance because the actual bakery factory (not the store) is located beside the lot.  Anyway, I called to ask where the entrance was but, unfortunately, the woman who answered spoke very little English and just gave me the store hours then slammed (I mean SLAMMED) the phone down on me - nice ... nonetheless, I went about my business.  

Anyway, they have an array of breads, pretzels, buns, sweets, you name it and it's dirt, dirt cheap.  Most of the loaves of rye are about $2.35 and it's always still warm and fresh.  I've also picked up olives buns - $0.40 each, cheese pretzel for like $1.00 - best pretzel I ever ate in my life!  However, my all time favorite are the hot dog buns that have sesame seeds all over them.  Toast them up on the grill with a hot dog or sausage and you'll be in heaven!  I don't recall any of the buns of specialty pretzels to be above $1.00; it's really that inexpensive.  Also, you can rest assured because it's immaculate in there.

Customer service is hit or miss.  First time when I went to pay, no hello, no thank you, nothing - not surprised though.  They treated the gentleman in front of me the same way too - I felt like I was in the Soup Nutsy episode of Seinfeld. You have to ignore most of the rude patrons though - the majority of them have miserable looking faces.

On the flip side, their non-alligator food has been pedestrian.  I did enjoy the tournament burger, but it's a glorified bacon cheeseburger.  As much as I like a pile of bacon on my burger, that's not enough to score a ton of points with me.

The bread is good.

The lemonades with the different flavors are nice, especially the pomegranate lemonade.  +1 for the bread and lemonade.

Today I had the Islamorada sandwich, which is mahi mahi on a bun.  I obviously should've paid better attention to the description, because I *hated* the cheese on it.  Too much of it, and it totally dominated the flavor.  It's a fish sandwich, not an 800 proof Irish whiskey/paint thinner.  Also, the bun was soggy, presumably due to the gross cheese grease.

We all started with a glass of beer, which they have a great beer and wine selection.  They carry many great choices at reasonable prices.

Our group split the quesadilla of the day, which was very good.  It changes, so I can't remember the actual ingredients, but one of the better quesadillas I have had.

For the main course, I had the pork porterhouse, which does not appear to be on the menu currently.  It was great.  The side came with potatoes au gratin, but was a very unique taste and this alone would bring me back.  I also sampled the mushroom pan-fry, their signature dish.

Tomo's building is quite unique with 5 different floors- main restaurant (1st floor), VIP area (2nd floor), ""nightclub"" area (3rd floor), ""casual"" bar (4th floor?), private party room (basement) and I am not quite sure / remember what the 5th floor is.  The layout is a bit odd (a mish-mash) of Asian Contemporary with old-school Asian and Craftsman styles.

The service was completely horrendous- they messed up the bills and we were forced into an incredibly tight hibachi table.  Additionally, what was suppose to be maybe a 1.5-2 hour meal turned into roughly 3 hours.  Typically, when you order hibachi and sushi, the sushi comes first.  It was not until after we completely finished the hibachi that we got our sushi.  Many others at the table got their sushi orders before we did and it's fairly safe to say the waiter completely forgot about the order until we asked not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES about the sushi.
  
I had to have a friend of mine move his chair back and out, every time i wanted to move.  They sat us at this table even though many of the other tables were completely empty. 

I got the scallop and shrimp hibachi which was fairly decent, nothing special though.  It tastes like any other hibachi restaurant I have been too.  The hibachi chef was relatively interactive and animated with everyone at the table.  The sushi was where the food went downhill.  

I order tuna tataki and salmon sashimi, both of which were ridiculously fishy.  Unbelievably fishy smelling and tasting.  Contrary to popular thought, fresh sushi shouldn't taste fishy or have an overwhelming smell of a sitting dead fish.  If that occurs, that is a big, BIG, MAJOR sign that the fish is not fresh.  I had to leave a few pieces on the plate it was that bad and the rest were slathered in wasabi and soy sauce to mask the taste.

I also attempted to order a bottle of saki and you would expect a Japanese restaurant to know their saki.  When I asked the bartender for a nigori (sp?) type of saki (which is a milky, unfiltered saki), he had absolutely no idea what I was talking about and had to ask someone else.  It wasn't until I went up to the bar and he took out every kind of saki the restaurant had, that he knew what I was referring to. 

Never again. I paid $70.00+ for poor service and poor food.  I wish I had better things to say and that I could support the growth of this business downtown, but this is not the kind of restaurant that I want downtown.",2013-02-20 05:14:51

The server warned us that the Dijon mustard was spicy and she was right. Dora here. Phew! Have a tissue handy. The mustard sauce will clear out your sinuses, but I liked it! I was expecting these little nuggets to taste chewy and soft, but instead they were a bit crispy.

I chose the Shepherd's Pie with Guinness gravy, layers of beef, mushrooms, carrots, celery, and onions topped with mashed potatoes along with a side of tater tots. The meat was tender and the vegetables cooked so that they still had a crunch. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the tater tots outstanding. My biggest issue with this dish was that it was only lukewarm, causing the flavors not to mix well. 

My wife had the Fish & Chips, deep fried Haddock, battered with Harp lager, an Irish beer. Dora here. Since Kennedy's is a pub, I had high hopes for this dish. The fish was lightly battered, flakey and tender. The sweet potato fries were a bit lackluster, and the slaw was just average. Nothing  really tantalized my taste buds. And the iced tea? A total loss. Bummer. But then I'm quite sure people don't frequent this establishment for the iced tea. :)

I would rate this restaurant 3 forks out of 5 forks for a family friendly restaurant serving good food.

I like that it's open really late but it's like we said on the ride home, ""Hey now we know where to come and eat really crappy food late at night."" We stumbled onto this place because Pete's was closed by the time we got down here. My falafel was dry and crumbly and the pita was like something you get out of a bag at the store. 

The Greek fries were a joke, cold and soggy with not very flavorful Parmesan cheese on it.

The pizza has an incredibly thick crust that doesn't have a lot of flavour. I love a good Hawaiian pizza but this one came with maraschino cherries inside the pineapple slices?? 

The service was very mediocre and they didn't take cards which meant I had to get cash out from the atm located awkwardly in the middle of their restaurant.

Being known for their prime rib, I obviously ordered it and it did not disappoint being quite a tasty piece of beef albeit being extraordinarily pricey. It's like you can take most of the dishes you find elsewhere and multiply the price by three.

There seems to be quite a bit of hidden costs. For instance, when served with the prime rib, the server would ask whether you would like some creamed spinach or corn without me even thinking that would be an added cost. The bill can add up fairly quickly. 

The prime rib entree came with house salad which tasted just like a typical salad, mashed potatoes, and a very small portion/slice of the Yorkshire pudding. Restaurant seems rather stingy on various fronts.

The restaurant itself is quite open and spacious. They've decorated with vivid colors and contemporary lighting, definitely not extravagant but I'm here for Pho not brunch at the Four Seasons! It is clean, appealing, and inviting; more than good enough for me.

First timers are most likely going to be drawn to the 'Most popular Bowl' and while that is a solid choice, I prefer the more savory broth that comes with the Hu Tieu (Pronounced Who-Two). It's a blend of many different stocks and feature slices of chicken, seafood, and pork pieces with your choice of noodles.

Start with the ""Just Right"" size bowl and if you're still hungry afterwards the prices are affordable enough to get something else like the Grilled Pork Spring Rolls. The larger size bowl they call the ""Train"" is big enough to make a wedding cake with. Seriously, I didn't know restaurants could get ceramic bowls that big, like 'family size salad' big!

Other than the Pho and other broth offerings, I have given their Fried Rice dish a try as well and it's very good, but for newcomers just 'go with the Pho!'

Bubble Teas are very good, I wasn't a big fan of the tapioca balls as first, but I don't know, it's growing on me...yeah I'm a fan somehow. I get the Strawberry bubble tea every visit now. For the adventurous, they have a Durian Flavored one... I'm not that adventurous!

When we entered, no one acknowledged us initially. The guy sitting at the bar was just chatting it up with another restaurant patron and did not notice us. I walked around looking for someone to sit us, which got his attention and told us we could sit anywhere. After looking over the menu, this is what we ordered:

Tibs Firfir ($9.50 prior to tax)- This dish is beef tips made with a tomato based sauce, onions and sliced injera. Wished there was more beef in this dish, but it was quite flavorful. I really loved that sauce and so did my husband. But he did find it odd that slices of injera was mixed into this dish, that was served on top of injera. 

Veggie Combo ($10.99 prior to tax)- This vegetarian combo came with 6 different tasty options on top of a spongy bread (injera). Two of the options I had were potatoes (seasoned differently) that were pretty filling. One of the options was spinach, which was my least favorite (I do like spinach but this was just not very flavorful). One option was made of chickpeas and another was made of lentils. I also got a side of salad with dressing on my injera. Each option was a fun culinary adventure and it was fun to eat with my hands (I am not a newb to Ethiopian food... make sure you wash your hands before eating, especially if you plan on sharing your food with others).

Portions of this food is definitely more than enough to feed 4 or more people. After our meal, we had plenty of leftovers to take back to our hotel room (we had a fridge in our room). And leftovers tasted even better the next day, especially with the Tibs Firfir (which allowed the sauce to sink in a bit more). 

Service in general was not as attentive, but our water glasses were refilled at least once during our meal. The owner actually stopped by our table to see how we liked the food. She told me that she was the one who made our food as well. 

Food truly is delicious and I will keep this place bookmarked so that I can come back here for another amazing meal the next time I am in Las Vegas.",2014-11-29 20:47:37

The first half of this meal would have gotten a 5-star review; the second half, 1 star.

We were greeted instantly and seated outside without a wait, which is always a plus.  Our waiter came right away; he was a bit ""affected"" and disinterested, which always rubs me the wrong way in restaurants.

We ordered drinks (sangria and some fruit-blended margarita).  The sangria was, in my mind, not as sweet as at Farenheit, but not as dry as at Prosperity.  But, unilke other Goldilocks tales, this did not make it Just Right....instead, it was Just OK.  (My husband was drooling over his margarita, though.)

We ordered the guacamole sampler, which, as a previous review mentioned, was way too much food for two people, but all three varieties (original, goat cheese/tomato, and crab) tasted wonderful (we ignored the fact that we hadn't actually ordered the goat cheese/tomato but some other flavor.  Whatever.).  However, this is where it starts to go wrong.

You'd think that when the main focus of the table is the guacamole, they would pay attention to the refilling of the chips.  Nope.  After one basket, that was it.  We waited ten minutes before someone came over to even take the main order.  Then we also asked for more chips.  Nope.  Waiting, and more waiting.  It was like we were invisible...and it's not like the place got extremely crowded.  Finally, halfway through our main courses, a busboy noticed that we had stopped eating and brought us more chips.  We ended up taking them, and the remaining guacamole, home...although, who wants to eat day-old guacamole?

This wouldn't have been so bad, though, if the dinner itself wasn't really, really bad.  I got the tilapia tacos, and they were just unappealing: soggy, with slimy peppers and onions and a REALLY fishy taste that isn't usually present in tilapia I've eaten.  Even though there wasn't much food in the entree, I didn't finish it.  This is saying a lot for me, because I usually power through Mexican food like a bulldozer.  Oh well.

The waiter finally resurfaced to clear our plates and again took forever with the check.  I think that, despite all the food weirdness, the service is what really struck me about what's wrong with this place.  Unfriendly and ""too cool.""

But, because this was only our first visit, we've decided to go back another time...maybe just for guacamole?  Would it be tacky to bring our own bag of chips? ;)",2009-09-20 01:28:48

Yes, I watched the Olympics when I was in Vegas....call me traditional...call me boring...I'm the homey type. 

The exercise room was small, it had only a few weights but three treadmills and I think three steppers. They have a small water fountain but no water dispenser inside here. Again, the small TV on the wall.

Wk4TpFpHMU1J9XwiS83t_g,ahwwAXJ_qwGmuRjTOHHMWg,_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg,3,5,1,2,"Found this place listed on the Best of Phoenix in New Times.  Clearly the explorer, I drove to Chandler to see what this was about.  It is a simple place, nothing fancy. But I'm not into fancy I'm into good food.   I noticed that we were to be the only non-asians here (for quite a while) .  I thought that was a good sign of things to come.  

Their menu has very authentic items such as intestines and tripe, but have hope you fans of americanized chinese food.  They have items such as fried rice, mongolian beef, etc.  The menu has several lamb options which is unusual for a chinese restaurant. 

We ordered the cumin lamb which came as an extremely generous portion, the cold sesame noodles, and mongolian beef.  They gave us complimentary edamame which seemed to have been cooked in five spice powder (at least that's what my taste buds said.)  The cold sesame noodles came with sliced cucumber slices and sesame sauce.  It is also known as tahini sauce which is not the usual for this dish at least in an Americanized chinese restaurant (that one is made with peanut butter).  We thought this dish was just ok.  Nothing exciting. Nothing special.  

My mongolian beef came with a lot of onions in relation to the beef.  Totally opposite of the lamb with cumin which was a meaty, generous portion.  I literally had to push the onions to the side to find the beef.  ( I have a theory that chinese restaurants give females smaller amounts of food.  There was no comparison between the portion that my husband got and what I received. It was like night and day---but it's just a theory).  

So I picked through the onions to look for the beef.  It was also very greasy at the bottom of the dish---too greasy.   The white rice which came with the dishes was fluffy and whole grained not mushy as in some chinese restaurants.  

No one refilled the water glasses.  I found that annoying.  Little attention once your meal came to your table.  Maybe it's an asian thing.  
From the lamb with cumin I can see why people would really like this restaurant.  But I would never order the mongolian beef.  At $12.95 for this dish, I should have had more than a few scraps of beef.  
Right now I can't really decide whether this is the Best of Phoenix as indicated in New Times.  There are many, many good chinese places in the valley that could give this place a run for it's money.",2016-10-09 05:08:19

These platters are worth the wait.  The grilled chicken takes longer to make since it takes longer to cook the meat.  This place takes a bit longer to prepare the food but the wait is worth it. I've also called in advance for pickup and they had the food ready when I arrived. I've tried the donair before and I still prefer the donairs at Jimmy's.,2016-10-21 22:25:28

I went with some friends who were regulars who raved about the food and I'll admit it was good!

My short ribs plate seemed...short compared to the dishes my friends got but it was amazing.  I had to savour every bite and vs my normal military principles of ""get'er done"" or ""leave no morsel standing"" I actually enjoyed every bite.  The portion was perfect because being a great dish I devoured it but wasnt left with the often after effect of feeling stuffed and I'll...this time I was satisfied, which only complemented the chef on his/her excellent control of flavones and portions.

My only reason for not hitting my first 5 star here was because of the service...even though my friends were regulars the waitress forgot our drinks...it's ok to do that but not 1) on a slow day (a Tuesday where half the bar was full) 2) we were the only ones in our area so not like the section was too busy to handle 3) my friends were regulars who knew the kitchen staff even...no excuse in my books to miss their orders...mine maybe but definitely not theirs.

I can't decide if I liked the crowd or not. On one hand, I fit in with the douchiness since I was wearing a v-neck linen shirt and true religion jeans. On the other hand, I don't have diamond studs in my ears or barbed wire tattoos around my entire body. And I'm really not into trampy platinum blonde whores with white stilettos, it's just a teeeeeeeny bit too much for me.

On the OTHER OTHER hand, there were some complete biscuits walking around this joint. Some of these girls looked like they stepped out of my dreams and into my reality. Obviously I didn't talk to them, though, because who can do that?

For four people, our bill came out to $170ish for 8 rounds of drinks. I think our waitress left some off on purpose to apologize for the crappy service in the beginning, but it was cheaper than I thought it would be. We smoked a lot of hookah, I highly recommend the watermelon-kiwi and the pina colada. Incredible blends!

I have been here twice and really didn't enjoy the first trip.  I enjoyed tonight's visit even less.  We only came here to eat because our favorite restaurant was so packed we couldn't even find a parking spot.  I ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it.  It took over a half hour to get our food.  We sat there and waited and waited.  Our waitress at one point said our food should be up soon and then we didn't see her for another 15 minutes.  When my food arrived it was cold.  Not wanting to wait another half hour for a replacement meal I scraped all the cold chicken (half of which looked disgusting, btw) off the cheese crisp and just ate the cold cheese/tortilla.  My mom's cheese enchilada wasn't cooked either.  The cheese wasn't even remotely melted.

Our waitress took another 15 minutes to bring our bill and asked if we needed boxes.  We said no.  Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to get the card.  By this time I was irritated.  She obviously had too many tables and couldn't keep up with her workload.  When she finally came back with our card she asked again if we wanted boxes.

C had just finished with his play and wanted pizza. He and K bantered back and forth, C wanted Oreganos, K wanted Rosati's. C wins. We were already heading home so instead of turning around and going to the Gilbert location, we headed for the dreaded Germann Rd. location. I say dreaded because I knew, I knew the parking would SUCK. And, it did. heck, it was a Saturday night and Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers was kickin it. The parking lot was packed but I drove around the back of the buildings and found a spot. Not the safest place you want to be on a dark night, but oh well.
We got sat right away. No doubt. It was almost 10 and there was no one waiting. Probably couldn't find parking. Scott was our server. He came up almost as soon as we were sat and took our drink order. We also tossed in an order of Cheese Bread with Marinara ($5.88). This stuff is soooo goood. Oooey Gooey melted cheese on an entire Baguette which ends up toasted just right. And with my favorite marinara, it's just the best cheese bread around.
As I always do, I ordered the Big Dinner Salad ($3.99) w/ dressing on the side. The lettuce is fresh although I do wish the prep cooks would tear it or cut it into smaller pieces. sometimes you can end up with a huge strip of Romaine which is just unruly.
We also ordered an 18"" Thin with sausage and caramelized onions ($19.87). The crust was almost perfect as were the toppings. A great job on a thin crust. 
Now comes why not 5 stars. Styrofoam to-go boxes. We had a good portion of pizza left and Scott brought out a Styrofoam box. Would someone at Oregano's please put a stop to this practice. Pizza belongs in a box. The layers of thin crust end up sticking together and really, you might as well just throw the whole thing away because it can be very difficult to re heat the leftovers. BUT, being an Oregano's regular, I have learned to keep the paper from the cheese bread and use it to separate the layers of leftover pizza. Shouldn't be my job though.
Crappy parking (again), yummy cheese bread, awesome marinara, very good thin crust pizza, fair prices, decent service. 4 Stars.",2016-01-14 18:40:10

Pretty quiet at 3pm, a couple tables scattered about but even so the place looks good.  A big room with a high ceiling, bar at one end and a small stage at the other.  During the day the room is filled with light and is inviting, if a bit vast.

Happy Hour allows half price on beers and appetizers, so that is what I ordered.  A half liter of wheat beer, is cool and smooth, nice and mellow makes it very drinkable.  

The apps platter had fried pickle spears, onion rings, potato pancakes and sauerkraut balls, since the sauerkraut balls have meat, I had them substitute a pretzel which they were nice enough to do.  The two huge onion rings were nice, with a crispy batter that slightly overpowered the onion inside.   I would have preferred more onion flavor, but overall pretty good.  The potato pancakes were very well done, crispy on the outside and nice and starchy on the inside.  Topped with the sour cream it was a very fine app.  I also really enjoyed the applesauce that came with the potato pancakes, diced apples lightly cooked so they still had a bit of crispness and just the right amount of sweetness.  The fried pickles were the highlight of the plate; large pickle spears are wrapped in a soft dough.  The pickles have a nice salty bite which contrasts well with the coating.  Dipped in the honey mustard sauce, the fried pickles taste great with the cold beer.  My only complaint with the pickles would be that they were a bit greasy.

The pretzel was a slightly disappointing, I was anticipating a really great pretzel and instead got a decent pretzel, but nothing memorable or exemplary as I would have hoped from a German beer hall.

Service by the bartender was friendly and prompt.  

Hofbrauhaus is a great place to get some fine German style beer and have a great time.  The food is nicely done, simple and straightforward, but don't come looking for cutting edge culinary innovations.",2016-06-09 00:27:38

Located a bit off the strip this place gets overlooked but boy its worth a 10-15 min walk I took to come here. 
I didn't have any reservations and had to wait in the bar area for a bit nevertheless I enjoyed one of the better martinis in the city. The main dinning area is old school with service to match (it reminded me of the bygone era of fine dinning shown in Mad Men). Though its Las Vegas and I saw people in casual clothes I would recommend dressing up when coming here. 
Service was immaculate from start to finish. I ordered a shrimp cocktail for starters  which was served nicely chilled. The cocktail sauce was OK and the shrimp were large but run of the mill stuff. 
For the main I went with the Lawry's cut of Prime Rib and ordered it rare.
Salad was done table side an ode to old school fine dining. I am not much of a salad eater but this one was good and consisted of Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with their Vintage Dressing.
Next came the main event a nice rolling trolley  with huge chunks of Prime Rib was brought table side and the meat was carved to my liking by an expert chef.  The main's come with an unlimited supply of Yorkshire pudding (very good) Mashed potatoes (OK) jus sauce (memorable) and Whipped cream horseradish but beef is the star attraction here. It is amazing how good the prime rib is and it is cooked to perfection. My cut was perfectly pink all around with a good meat to fat ratio. The crust was seasoned well and gave a nice contrast. I ordered some cream corn and mushrooms which were good as well but I don't think were needed as the main serving was generous. 
I wanted to try some desserts but I was full.
I must mention again how good the service was, my needs were anticipated and the servers would disappear after picking up stuff and refilling wine and water and not even once I had to look for them. 
Wine selection is extensive though I didn't explore it much and stuck to a Cabernet.
There you have it folks Las Vegas the way it was envisioned initially!

Since I've only first tried it not too long ago, I only have a few comments, and here they are:

- The Godzilla (Gojira) roll is to die for. Loved that one. Possibly the best Madison sushi roll i've ever had! Also, my sushi plate had great presentation. It's rare for me to notice that sort of thing, but the whole plate just looked stunning. There was some good thought put into it i'm sure.

- Others have mentioned some problems with the service, and I can possibly see where they're coming from. Our Edamame appetizer took longer than one would expect to come out. But, the main course came out quickly, and everything else was up to snuff with what I expect at a good place. Our waiter was nice, but like some people have mentioned, he came off as kind of pretentious. As I was interested in trying out multiple rolls, I asked him which 3 rolls were in the chef's choice for tonight (Which I didn't find unreasonable to ask here in Madison WI, but in eastern countries this might be frowned upon), and he explained for all too long what ""Chef's choice"" meant and I didn't receive the names or ingredients of any of the rolls. I got the chef's choice regardless, but i'd rather not be assumed to be completely clueless about how to order anything.

- The sign thing (or lack of sign thing I guess?) people are referring is not a big deal at all. There's a sign on the door, and it's only going to be a potential issue the very first time you go. If you're going to complain about places with lack of signage, then check out the Natt Spil on King Street. It has no labeling at all, nor does it even have a phone to call, and guess what? That's a potential problem only on your first visit too! It's an easy thing to get over. It was a thought out decision by the owners in order to help establish their setting, and I applaud their decision.

Walking into this place, you can tell it's ideally set up to handle the uptown lunch rush.  Plenty of space between the tables, is a great plus.  Even at the peak times, you can have a meal without being jostled and still be able to hear yourself think!

This is where it went downhill.  First timers here will be confused when they are handed a card, menu and wished the best of luck.  Good thing I was lunching it with two veterans.  They showed me the ropes behind the self-service concept (I assume this was supposed to be the charge of the girl at the register, but she wasn't interested).  I ordered a special off the board.  It was billed as pasta with pan fried ham, french blue cheese, arugula, and garlic. What I got was a bit different.

The chef started out by pan frying the ham.  All 4 little cubes of it.  Added the blue cheese (again, missed the portion of cheese I was supposed to get by a WIDE margin).  In what I can only assume was a little kitchen creative liberty, he then substituted spinach for the arugula (spinach = inferior greenery to the almighty arugula).  Finished off the pan sauce with not even enough of a ladle of cream to get the spinach wet!  That's OK though, because his plan all along, I guess, was to add the requisite moisture by not completely straining the pasta from the water before adding it to the pan.  End result was a bland, underseasoned bowl of pasta (and little else) sitting in water.  No bueno.  Accompanying this disappointment was bread (VERY good and fresh baked, actually) and a side salad which was served in a dish big enough to hold 4 pieces of lettuce and one crouton.  

$20 out the door (whaaaaa?).  This place is like a hibachi grill.  You aren't paying for good food.  You're paying for the entertainment of cook to order and ambiance.

A friend took the time to gather all of us here with the intention of trying it with an open mind. For our party of 6; we ordered four of the $118 tasting menus and a few supplementary items as well. It was more than enough to leave me feeling full and uncomfortable.

We started with the mixed dim sum. All of their dumplings were juicy and cooked to perfection. The crispy duck salad was next. The fact that they could call this a salad is outrageous. It was predominantly chopped up duck meat with a little arugula, pomegranate seeds, and nuts. Don't get the wrong idea. I loved it. It just caught us by surprise. Then the onslaught came. The spicy and sweet lobster was good. The sea bass with honey was odd. The wagyu beef was everything you could ever want. It melts in your mouth. The abalone dish was shaved too fine and came out like eating cartilage. The crispy duck with truffle oil was nuts. I was just craving duck something fierce, too. I left more than satisfied. The green beans dish had a nice kick and the texture of the beef/shrimp combo was good. By the time dessert came around, I was stuffed. The strawberry rhubarb dessert with champagne was lackluster. The rhubarb was undercooked and tough. The chocolate cremeux with yuzu sorbet was good. I would have eaten a whole bowl of the sorbet alone.

I always have to go searching for a staff member to assist with opening locked cases, and when you find one, you're almost guaranteed that they don't work in the section your item is in and they're too busy to help you. To the management at this store: get a hint,  you're an AA (at least) level store - hire more staff to serve your customers.

I've rarely had issues with finding products at this location and when we're on short notice, its super easy to pop in, find what you're looking for and get out in 10 minutes. This happened recently and I know if I'd been to Future Shop, it would have taken me 20 minutes to find the part I needed.

I think this goes without saying: if you can stand to wait for your products to arrive via mail,  you're usually better off staying away from the big box stores like Best Buy and Future Shop and doing your research online, finding a reputable seller and buying that way. But if you're technologically inept and don't know your way around buying high ticket items on the net or aren't comfortable doing so, this location will probably work well for you if you're in the downtown core. Just don't expect superior customer service, even if you're buying something big ticket.",2012-02-23 04:59:47

When I first ventured to Scottsdale Quarter I was so disappointed by the lack of stores available, but now, after a few years, it has finally filled out (she's finally an adult, hee hee).  The grounds are always clean and in the center of this shopping complex is another ground water fountain-esque fixture that you will find little kids running around in and enjoying in the warmer months. At night, the Quarter is starting to become awake with 30+'s hitting up Narcisse Champagne Lounge, Primebar, and Salt.

Restaurants currently include: Brio, Dominick's Steakhouse, TK's Urban Tavern, Stingray Sushi, True Foods, Tanzy, Primebar and a few more.

Shopping stores currently include: the Apple Store, Nike, Beach Bunny Swimwear (full on expensive non-practical ""swimwear"" that probably wouldn't survive water), Brookstone, Buckle, Calypso St. Barth, Free People, Pottery Barn, Republic of Couture, and many more.

One of my favorite things about the pizza is the crisp crust.  This is easy to find when eating a reheated slice, but not so easy when you order a whole pie.

Perhaps I was more sensitive to it because of our prior experience. I'm sure the majority of their patrons do not notice. 

The service was great! Their staff was very friendly. The food was pretty good. I love chips and salsa and I was happy with theirs; they bring out red and green salsa.

Gone were the friendly owners, replaced by a new crop of much younger, less interested employees.  I can recall on not once, but at least 2 to 3 occassions going here shortly after 11am for an early lunch and the place was closed.  I've walked in at 11:30 am and they're still setting up? 

Prices went up, small changes to the menu items started showing up and the coma-inducing, extra scoops of food that really defined the value of their offering started to wane.  In other words, now you're getting too much food (instead of WAYYY too much food) for $9, instead of $8.  Subtle - but impactful to the discerning lunch goer.  

One correctable, subtle issue that popped up, and still persists today as I pull another one out of my mouth while chewing and writing this review, is exhibited by the fact that they cook with in-tact, full-sized Cardamom pods and cloves.  Now in and of itself, this is not at all an issue, and in fact encouraged as the subtle flavors are a terrific layer of flavor.  The problem exists when the pods and cloves are not removed prior to serving the dish and so you'll occassinally get a mouthfull of surprise when you bite into an entire Cardamom pod which can simply destroy your pallette for the next several minutes.  It's a rookie mistake, that can be easily changed and make a subtle improvement to their quality.  

Unfortunately, after some serious evaluation of this place for several weeks, if not months (yea I still come here pretty much weekly because it's the closest place to my office) I can no longer recommend this place to folks who may have an Indian food itch burning in their appetites.   The subtle changes that the Aroma management team has made have deteriorated the overall offering beyond my comfort zone.  In fact, the line out the door that used to exist for Nirvana II is gone - the people have spoken!!  

The other factor here is that Persis Biriyani opened up a place across the street in the Latta Arcade.  In another month or so, after they work out the kinks, I would expect Persis to crush this place on every facet of their offering.  DING DING DING - LETTTS GET READDDY TO RUMMMBBBLLLLEEEE!!!!!

I remember dinner was under $20 last time I was here. Granted it was a while ago and things could have changed, it jumped to $25, almost the price of an AYCE sushi dinner. I only went here before because it was cheaper, but since the price gap is closed, it's almost worth just going to an AYCE sushi place unless you really want some hot pot. 

They now offer more seafoods such as oyster, scallops, lobster, and crab legs. They are more expensive pieces of food, so that is where you can justify the price increase. The lobster that they put in the fridge for you to get through, are not meaty pieces of lobster. It seems like they take out the meatiest part of the lobster and store it away for themselves, or they just get the less meaty parts of the lobster. A few lobster pieces I got were 95% shell and it was incredibly hard to get the meat. It's like not having lobster at all. Everything else is the same, the meat, vegetables. They chaged the island in the middle and now they have some Thai specialty stuff, dessert, and a few Thai dishes. Another change that I personally don't like that they made was the change from washable plates and bowls, to plastic and styrofoam plates. They only put a few pieces of meat on a plate and then the plate is gone forever. At least when they had the ceramic plates, it could just be washed, but they probably were going through too many dishes, which is understandable, but I don't like the extra waste that they are producing because of it. 

Yeah this place is still good for what it is, but the changes that have been made are making me less inclined to come back.",2014-12-11 19:45:18

So he goes to find one of those dinosaur-size ladders that warns they are only for employees to use.  He proceeds to go through a number of boxes on the second and third level to find the product, without any success.  At this point it would have been easy and adequate to say, sorry dude, I was mistaken, looks like we don't have it.

Originally our group was planning on going to the dueling piano bar at MGM Grand, but we were depressed to find out upon our arrival that, that bar no longer existed as a dueling piano bar. By that time we were REALLY set on going to one, so we quickly hit ""the Googles"" (haha) to find the nearest one & we were on our merry way to NY NY.

Upon our arrival, we were made to wait in line for about 20 minutes as the place was super packed, It's also worth mentioning that it was a $10 cover charge (which was never the case at the MGM piano bar...just saying). We went to the back of the bar where there was an empty table, but we were immediately told that the table was ""reserved"" by someone who worked there--even though there was no sign indicating as much on the table.


Unfortunately, because the bar was so packed, we were nowhere near the pianos and couldn't even see them let alone get close enough to ever request a song, but we could hear fine. By the time we got to this place, we were all pretty tipsy, so the non-piano experience didn't really bother us at the time, but looking back I would have liked to have been able to request some songs.

There's no bathroom inside and you have to exit the bar (they give you a hand stamp so you can skip the line to get back in), but it isn't close--a bit of a walk through the casino area. 

The good news was, for as crowded as the bar was (and it was) I was able to continuously get drinks at a really quick pace! I don't think I ever waited more than like 3 minutes to get a drink. To be honest, I have no idea how much the drinks cost because I was drunk and just handing them money--I hope I didn't get ripped off ;-D

4 of us left around midnight or a little after. The 2 girls stayed until around 2am!...PAR-TAYYYY!

I will say it is in prime location and the environment is very casual and comfy. I always love that aspect when it comes to places..makes me feel right at home.

I ordered the shroom burger, crinkle fries, and a pie oh my concrete. I was excited because the pie concrete is based on seasonal flavors and also the proceeds go to a foundation of good cause. The seasonal flavor was blueberry pie and it was the best thing on my plate. The shroom burger was okay, definitely not disguised as a burger because the mushroom taste is very strong. The cheese within the burger is a bit much it caught me by surprise when I took a bite and scorching hot cheese was spot back at me. The only condiments they have for fries is cheese, yellow mustard, ketchup and I feel like within today's times people eat fries with so much more but could just be me. I spent 18 dollars on one meal which seemed like a bit much to me for a ""fast food"" meal especially when all I really enjoyed was the concrete.

This past Saturday, Labor Day weekend we had 6:00 reservations. Darko our server was amazing, extremely informative and very attentive, on top of his game.

We ordered cocktails while looking over the menu.  For appetizers, we chose the Steak & Lobster Tartar (truffled steak tartare and chilled fresh Maine lobster with toasted baguettes) and the Batterfried Oysters (light curry, cilantro, with pickled Asian cucumbers). Entrees were  Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (sauteed Maryland style with spicy chive remoulade), 
Chilean Sea Bass (steamed Hong Kong style with light soy broth), Georges Bank Scallops (sauteed with citrus fruit, roasted almonds and brown butter) and 16 oz USDA Prime New York Strip Au Poivre  (cracked black peppercorn cognac sauce).

All the food was excellent, prepared to request and cooked perfectly. Our only complaint this visit was the extended time period we had to wait between our appetizers and entrees.

A raw bar with oysters as the headliner and a full bar highlighted by a list of creative cocktails. The food menu is relatively short, but every single item looked delicious and I could have easily just closed my eyes, pointed my finger on the menu, and would have been pleased with whatever it landed on. Every item we had was delicious and we placed two extra orders of food after our initial order because we couldn't get enough.

Expecting a wait when we came at 8:30 on Saturday night, we were pleasantly surprised when we were able to sit at the table directly in front of the specials board. The board being in plain view was the primary reason for our extra orders. We were greeted immediately and were given excellent service by the team of servers for the entirety of the meal. There were no issues with the kitchen as everything was timely and with the kitchen being open, we could easily view how our orders were progressing.

We ordered 7 items along with 18 oysters (blue point, Wicomico, and otter cove priced at $1.50, $1, and $2.50 per oyster respectively) served with three different mignonettes. My wife had the dozen East Coast oysters and I had the half dozen briny, otter cove oysters which I thought went very well with the ponzu salsa provided. You're not going to find the selection of oysters of Other Mama, that are priced this fairly, anywhere else in the city, or at least I haven't found anything comparable yet.

My other favorites were the mackerel sashimi, yuzu panna cotta, and the cocktail, Sofia. We probably would have tried another dessert but we decided to pull the plug when we saw the kitchen starting to close everything down. Chef Dan made his way to our table, kindly greeted us, and we briefly conversed. Dinner for two that night before tip was $150 which I have no problem with and would have no problem driving across town again.

Hated the part that as I'm going to the different stations I'm told I'll have to order from the bar. That's fine because it's slow but if the bar were to get packed and you only have two bartenders, doing things like...tending bar. People with food orders are going to start getting backed up. Weird concept if you expect it to be busy.

I order the cubano, my friend orders a burrito, and the jerk off that wanted us to come in here to try the food just orders a coffee (wtf!). Anyway, I had a bite of the burrito with rotisserie chicken and the meat is actually pretty good. That coupled with the rice is actually pretty damn good. I'll be back for this.

The dry cubano on the other hand, I feel as though it's a little overpriced for $12 that came with no fries, maybe they forgot it, maybe it just doesn't come with it, I don't know. But $12 for basically just a sandwich and it's not sit down service? That's not crazy expensive but damn give me some fries, chips, f*ck I'll even take a deli pickle!

After hearing my friends talk about this place and after sampling their lunch specials at the local Indian grocery store (Manpasand), I decided to give this place a try. I have been here for a sit down dinner as well as ordered food to go.

Let me start by saying that the food is on the spicier side so order a level down than what you usually do. For our sit down meal we ordered Chicken Sangrilla (a new dish for me). This was tasty but SPICY (we ordered a 7 but could have done well with a 6). I could not really pin-point all the herbs an spices in this, however for a dish I never tried before, I found myself cleaning the plate. We also got the Chicken 65 which is fried marinated chicken strips (small pieces). While great in flavor this dish did not taste as I expected it to be (an overdose of spices that numbed my mouth). The two appetizers were however sufficient enough for our table of 4. BTW they do serve Papad once you place your order so you can munch on something till your appetizers arrive and they also have a full bar.

We then proceeded to get a plate of the Malai Kabab and Boti Kabab. Both of these were delicious - chicken was tender, lamb was perfectly cooked and both the meats were marinated well. In my opinion the size of the kababs were small. For entrees we ordered Kadai Chicken, Saag Paneer and Dal Fry. I am usually very picky about eating spinach at Indian restaurants but did not have any after-effects so I give the spinach here an ""all-clear."" Since all the entrees came with rice, we supplemented our food with only two Garlic Naans and by the end of the night we were stuffed (haha maybe because of the sheer amount of food we ordered). I cannot remember if we ate any dessert.

Our server was attentive, food prices were in line for a 3 star Indian restaurant and the food was good (not overly oily or greasy). 

During my second experience (take-out), I ordered a Garlic Naan, Sheekh Kabab and Tandoori Chicken. I felt like I was eating a health conscious chicken as the pieces were not very meaty. However, my major let down was the Sheekh Kabab - the meat felt dry, though still perfectly marinated.

Summing both my experiences, I would happily give it a 3.5 stars but to err on the side of caution a 3 for Yelp will be good for now.",2013-05-01 04:35:23

I have never been giddy for a restaurant before this. Ironically, the couple that came in after us was just as giddy. The kept talking about how their friend raved about the place and I can assure, it's not all hype.

Everything is made to order so expect a wait for crabs and chat it up with the owners. Live crabs are delivered on Wednesdays and boy oh boy are they good. I can honestly say that the garlic crabs were some of the best crabs I've ever had. They were seriously Orgasmic with a capital O. What's KFC's slogan again? Finger licking good? Heeeeeck na, this place is so much more deserving. I seriously sucked every single one of my fingers. 

Crab cake kinda guy? The crab cakes were made just how I like them. Little filling, lots of crab lumps, cooked to a golden brown on both sides and amazingly tasty. Lemonade kinda person? They have some good homemade lemonade. Don't do crab? Okay how 'bout shrimp. The fried shrimp, OMG, seriously? My new, absolute favorite shrimp. And they tell me the steamed shrimp is even better! 

If you're worried about looking cute while you gnaw on a claw, don't stress too much, it's to-go only ATM. They do plan to expand next door and add seating though. 

The Crab Shack is just that; a Hole in the Wall. There's a counter, a kitchen, some benches, and two awesome owners manning the register and kitchen. Upon entering, you'll be happily greeted and they might ask how you heard about them. It seems most of their customer base is due to referrals and word of mouth.

The interior of Prime exudes luxury, with long, tapestry like curtains hanging from the ceiling everywhere in a rich colors and fabrics. 

The service was wonderful from the moment we walked in! I love having a good steak dinner to celebrate (this time for my birthday) and this place did not disappoint. They had a lovely selection of bread prior to our soup and salads arriving (try the French Onion it was perfect). My husband also enjoyed their house Old Fashioned and said it was on point. I enjoyed the filet for dinner while my husband had a NY strip. Both were cooked perfectly. But what put them over the top was a house ginger sauce. It was to die for. We also enjoyed the mashed potatoes with truffle oil (was eh) along with the Brussels sprouts with pear, and that was a lovely side!

Maybe it's because I went with low expectation but whatever expectation I had, Midi has blown it out of the water. 

Their food is delicious with large portion size. We started with the Cassolette d'Escargots and Salade Midi. The Escargots won out this round; it was perfectly seasoned and perfectly creamy. I wish they gave a few more slices of bread to soak up all that soup. The salad was good, and loaded with plenty of cheese, but not as exciting. 

Second round we ordered the Seafood Pasta and the Lamb Shank. This one I would say was a tie, both thoroughly enjoyable. The pasta was loaded with seafood and the sauce is rich with flavor. The lamb shank is very tender, delicious with the sauce and mashed potato. I wasn't expecting to taste the cinnamon with the beets served with the lamb, not too bad but not how I'd prefer them.

Round three, desserts were nice little end notes to the meal. The creme bulee had the distinct cardamom flavor with crunchy layer of hard caramel. The profiteroles were smothered in sugary chocolate sauce. We were both completely stuffed at this point.

We reserved for 6pm on a Tuesday and the bistro was not too busy. All the food came out pretty quickly one after the other so we didn't really have time to digest before the next course was served.

I've been about once a month for the past year or so. This recent visit really made me think we need to change our happy hours to another place. 

It's Labor day and there are 3 of us, young 30s young professional business women. I say this because when I worked as a server years ago I would ""judge"" my customers sometimes as though I knew they tip they'd give me. Okay so our server is a dude about our same age, didn't know his name until we got the check. 

Time to get our drink order: about 3 stories deep. The 3 of us talk quite a bit, so that means it was about 13 minutes at the least. Time to get our drinks: after discussing my friend's entire experience with the Dave Ramsey seminars: so maybe another 15 minutes. The bartender delivered the drinks. 

Usually the drinks are what bring us here: martinis 5.25 each during HH. These were not as strong as usual. 

Food order: took it quickly, food arrived in normal time. Trio dip: small bowl of salsa, small bowl of cheese, tiny scoop of guac. This used to be small bowl of quac- I think they are cutting back on food. Flatbread: okay but dry tasting. Cheese quesadilla: nothing to complain about. 

Round two for drinks: drinks were completely empty, including the waters before our server came back to ""check in"" on us. We asked for another round. This time was delivered by him within 5 min. Great! 

Now, a crap ton of stories later, he comes back more than 30 min later (I used my text messages to estimate time) and drops off the check. So he didn't ask if we wanted more food, more drinks, nothing. We were all going to order some food to go for the hubbies who were at home...but decided we would rather leave since our server wanted us to. 

We ask if he can split the check....and instead of splitting it as we ordered he just 1/3 the entire check. This is fine, but super lazy!

First off who would ever think about making a free standing building next too college campus (CSN) with not exactly the most attractive decor on the inside and out. Nor would you call it in the best area of town or clearly visible sure they have big sign out front but could easily pass it. Never judge a book by its cover!!

An ethnic diversity that would please most souls in life from Korean, Mexican, Southern Cuisine, Japanese Curries, American Hot Wings, and Healthy Alternative. Most part Campus Commons is not that busy. I never went during lunch hours when most students are on campus but in the evenings not too busy. The fall back with evening hours is half the restaurants generally closed. The chairs are classic food court style with the turning chairs get in and out. Most if not all the restaurants serve food in styrofoam plates or bowls. No servers but for the most part they all deliver the food too you. Parking lot all around the building. 

In all think Campus Commons has personality all its OWN. Every business in the building is truly family owned NONE of this mass marketed or chain restaurant brand. Nothing fancy about the decor just proves my point its OWN. Just refreshing too see such diversity of restaurants all under one tiny roof and supportive of each other.

Great for parties, bachelor/bachelorette, team outings etc. Boyfriend and I were here on a Sunday evening around 6:40pm and it was already alive and jamming. Got the emcee startin it off....hypin up the crowds...dancers all around the dining floor, up on the bar tables....definitely entertaining.

We ordered the following items:
-shishito peppers
-baked crab hand rolls (two hand rolls per order) - baked snow crab, spicy aioli, avocado in soy paper.
-tiger roll - shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna, negi, spicy dynamite sauce
-kamikaze roll - shrimp tempura, jalapeno, avocado, tuna, jalapeno vinaigrette, eel sauce, lime juice, micro cilantro

This may not seem a lot of food, but it was enough to fill us up. Plus these rolls can start off at $16.00....it can add up...QUICK. The baked crab hand roll was $20.00 and it only came with TWO PIECES. Yikes. For $20, you would think you get more than that. So don't come here if you're on a budget....or if you're starving or else your bill would be like $70.00 PER PERSON. They can charge this much for sushi because A.) they're located on Las Vegas Blvd and B.) the ambiance + entertainment is different than your usual sushi restaurants.

It was a perfect meal! Had the prosciutto with lamb brains, horse carpaccio, a plate of delicious meats and cheeses, the ricotta gnocchi with fermented butter and truffles.

The sorbets are made in a pacojet, and an interesting ""Parmesan"" flavour was delicious, as was the clementine.

Their version of a tiramisu was good, but I prefer more traditional recipes.

They got an awesome selection of beers. I would come back just for this reason...seems their selection changes often so looking forward to their next rotation. 

Food was hit or miss....

Deviled egg: recommended appetizer which turned out to be the highlight. Fried egg white with creamy/paste-like egg yolk on top. Came with a dipping sauce. This is one of those simple but great appetizer. 

Furikake tuna burger: tuna was seared and perfectly cooked. I liked how the sauce had a hint of spice, but wish they sprinkled more furikake or offered extra furikake on the side. This was one of my favorite.

Chicken sandwich: sadly no bueno. Chicken was waaaay to greasy and there was aftertaste of old oil or grease that lingered in my mouth. 

Loco moco poutine: Choose spam, came with 3 slices. Egg was cooked perfectly with runny yolk. Fries were not too crispy as it was covered in gravy that instantly turned all the fries soggy. Gravy itself was mediocre and not my favorite. 

I'd come back here to drink. Great service but food was hit or miss. 4 out of 5 I would recommend!",2017-11-30 05:59:44

Their chips and salsa that come to the table complimentary are also always warm, crispy and fresh. I have enjoyed myself the three times I have visited Salt & Lime and plan to come back this summer!

Here's why...  I last visited Malee's for a business lunch with a client.  He is very familiar with Thai food, so he knew exactly what he wanted from the menu and ordered it with ""medium"" spiciness (also called 2 stars).  We had the salad first, which my client said was good, but not excellent.  Upon trying his meal, however, he said the food was too spicy to even enjoy...far beyond ""medium.""  It was so spicy he actually would not eat another bite.  The server kindly offered to bring him a different item on the menu, which he accepted, but I felt the damage was already done.  I had recommended this restaurant, and it was a disappointment to my client.  Then, after my client's new meal was delivered, it became very difficult to get our server's attention again.

In the future, I would just keep in mind that Malee's dishes are served spicier than you might normally expect, and then hopefully avoid the experience I had last week.",2010-09-22 05:52:50

We've loving this place for 5 years because of the amazing flavors and sauces.  Food today didn't have any of those amazing sauces and was void of flavor. Asked the waiter if they forgot the sauce but he said they no longer include the mango sauce with the tacos. I think hospital cafeteria food would have tasted better than what we had today. New cooks? New recipes? The table next to me complaining to the manager about their food too.

The quality is better than you would expect, especially considering the drastic cost difference compared to the big name tools you see at Lowe's or Home Depot.  They have a lifetime guarantee on tools - but at the cost who really cares?  

The main tools that I use from here are my $5 socket set that I actually use on a regular basis.  My orbital sander has seen a half-dozen uses.  Blades and drill bits are cheap here - and for wear items that's what you want.  my table-saw blade works just as well as the $15 counterpart.  

What I like is that I can get odd-ball tools that I need for a single project now, and might or might-not need again (like fish tape or angle an grinder).  I end up lending stuff to neighbors who thought you had to spend a bunch of money to get the right tool for the job.  Now mind you, I still own a porter cable drill as I found the Harbor Freight ones a little cheap.  But my dremmel, orbital and oscillating sander, and hammer drill are all harbor freight brand.  

The other nice thing is the coupons - %20-25 of your purchase is fairly normal - and that $5 socket set got me an electric fly swatter with a coupon - and the pure joy I receive from eliminating those flying pests was so contagious that my neighbor got on as well.",2018-04-03 01:57:18

These are the biggest shrimp wontons I've ever encountered.

For $4.50 (A2), you get 4 golf ball size, fully shrimp-stuffed wontons and a good amount of noodles. It's likely the best deal in town for wonton noodle.

Husband tried the combination bowl that comes with some beef and 2 minced fish and 2 wontons (A1, $6.00). We agreed that beef and fish wasn't anything special and he said he'll stick to wonton next time.

The noodle texture was perfect for me, al dente. The broth was a bit salty IMO.

Service was quick, 2 min to look over the menu before a lady comes to take your order and 1 min for the noodle to arrive.

Though a lot more spacious and cleaner than most wonton noodle places in HK, it's still not a place you would want to linger long after your meal is done. Though the ladies provided adequate service there, their voices were extremely loud and annoying, even to myself who had resided in HK for awhile. They practically screams the orders from the front to the back and kept at that pitch while chit chatting with one another.

Nevertheless, the wontons are still great and I will definitely come back for more.

They really knocked it out of the park that first time, so I went again and ordered the same thing.  It came out so fast that the server made a little joke about how they must've been waiting for me.  I wouldn't be surprised if the dish actually had been waiting for me, because it didn't seem as well put together.  It seemed like the parts of the dish had settled into one another.

My first experience was great, I dined with two other foodies and we each ordered a different menu item from each category and then tasted each others dishes. The cocktail list definitely needs some tweaking, I actually ended up sending my first drink back because it was pretty gross. (This same fact contributed greatly to my second and worst experience, see below) The Devils on Horseback appetizer was quite delicious despite the fact that I usually do not eat bacon. However my favorite appetizer was the House Made Fromage, it tasted like a cross between goat cheese and cream cheese , I could have licked the plate. The highlight of the meal, without a doubt was the dessert, the Caramel Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme, the mix between sweet from the caramel, salty from the sea salt and the intense chocolate flavor was divine. 

And now for my second, less than desirable experience. My boyfriend and I were craving a great meal but couldn't decide where we wanted to dine, we chose E 4th street figuring something would pique our interest as we walked. We came upon Greenhouse Tavern and given my first great experience, I suggested we eat there. There were no tables available so we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink to see if a table opened in the meantime. We sat at the bar at least 10 minutes with not even an acknowledgment from the bartender. When the bartender finally came over, my boyfriend ordered a vodka and diet while I looked over the drink menu. I was quickly interrupted by the bartender stating, in the rudest tone, that they didn't carry the specific brand of vodka my boyfriend wanted and they didn't carry any sort of diet anything because they do not serve artificial sweeteners in their restaurant. At that point, my boyfriend and I were completely turned off by this blatant display of poor service and decided the leave and dine somewhere else. 

All in all, I really like the concept of this restaurant and given my first positive experience, would give it another try. I'm sure I will probably be back at some point albeit sitting in the dining room as opposed to the bar.",2011-02-07 05:33:04

I loved the fact the food is coming quite fast, the sashimi was fresh, although the red tuna was not to be found on the sashimi list. Sushi rolls were of good quality, but I can't say any of them was outstanding except for the honey roll that I loved. My crush that night were the coconut dumplings, wonderful dessert, can be combined well with eel roll as a fine finale of the dinner. 

I would say the food quality is around 3.5 stars, but the good company of the yelping friends made the sushi time enjoyable and in the end this place deserves its four stars for what it is. 

I would definitely recommend Sushi 999 to all you can eat sushi addicts!",2014-07-25 11:39:45

I don't know what people are expecting when they walk in the door, but it's clear that a lot of folks aren't quite getting the magic of the place and its food. It's been said that Pittsburgh has a ""nostalgia-industrial complex"", and maybe that's part of it: I go to Primanti's when I need to remind myself of who I am, where I've come from, and where I'm going. I know that that sounds terribly hokey, but it's the honest-to-God truth. Going to Primanti's is like going back home after a hard day, and seeing people trash it in their reviews gives me the same feeling I imagine I'd get if I saw someone belittling their own child's artwork: the point isn't to decide whether it's a world-class technical masterpiece... the point is to enjoy it for its uniqueness and its idiosyncrasies.",2010-03-06 00:28:23

The wait was only about 30min during prime time. A lot of little things here make me happy. The wooden theme which feels nice and warm along with the lighting. The ample room for people waiting at the entrance then also standing room around the bar. It was easy to get beers while we waited (a lot of bars you can technically get a drink while you wait but the arrangement of the bar means you would have to rudely get right on top of someone to get a drink, not this one because the bar is so large you can find an in and the bartenders are very attentive) and there was a ledge built into some of the wall/pillars around the bar so we had a ledge to sit our beer on and phones and scarves and to lean on. Then we were seated and the waitress remembered us from the one time we had been there months ago which was cool (ok and a little creepy lol) . We got the devils on horseback (still no pic because I can't wait to eat them but I see someone else succeeded in this endeavor) and we got the deviled eggs which had goat cheese and were very good. Next time we have to try the angels on horseback. Then I got the shrimp tacos and a side of asparagus. It was delicious! The shrimp tacos were the best I have ever had. The shrimp and guacamole were so creamy together and plenty of cilantro. It was great. And the asparagus were humongous and perfectly cooked and the dipping sauce was perfect with them.

Waiting....in line, for your food, at the doctor's office, at the DMV, etc. No one likes the waiting game!

Enter the Dash Pass...wait times have gotten less painful, and a lot more convenient. Wooohoooo! A few leaps and bounds over the quick kiosks, you are able to check in FROM HOME by smartphone or computer as early as 7:30 am (according to the worker I spoke with) and it will automatically put you in line.

No more looking at the clock, holding on to those pesky little  paper numbers hoping you don't lose it while you wait, etc...this awesome texting system lets you know how far you are, and keeps you up to date about every half hour up until your number in line is called so in the meantime, you can go get your groceries, shop, work out, or grab a bite to eat depending on the length of your wait time. You never have to dread the DMV any longer!  ALOHA!!!

Tasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. Before I continue, I will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(As was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(I assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  However, I will chalk some of it up to my mistake because I thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. So, Tasty, you get a pass on the rice

Anyhow, I ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). I ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. Also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. I want surface area, and I don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. I will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.

The eggroll, as I said, was tough.. It tasted good, but it was tough, and small... This probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum I do need to order something else with my tofu... I hope the soup is good.

The lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when I ordered. Portion size was good, for the $10.44 it cost me, I'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.",2011-06-24 02:08:22

I surprised myself by even coming here based on the yelp reviews. I'm glad I did!  

I asked for a basic pedicure and I was taken in promptly (arrived at 950am). I was given a very thorough pedicure with an AWSOME leg massage with hot stones. 

I am very pleased with my experience and will set be back!  I had tommy (although we weren't able to directly communicate everything was successfully translated by the neighboring nail tech). I will for sure be back and ask for Tommy again!   Give him a try!!!  

Update 5 days later - glittery polish has begun to chip. Went in for a repolish and Nam was accommodating and polite about it and did an excellent job!  To be fair I've never chosen glittery polish before and I think that was the issue. I've never had to have a repolish before so fingers crossed it's just the glitter polish. 

2nd review. - total disappointment. It's not the glitter polish. Had another pedicure with regular polish. Chipped 3 days in.  Maybe using a cheap top coat? I don't know but typically my toe polish lasts 3 weeks.  Only if I stub my toe has it really ever chipped before the 3 week mark.",2018-08-13 13:44:52

Sure, I'd found some that were average where you could get your basic Mexican ""fixins.""  But it wasn't until I dined at Cantina that I said, ""Yep, that's the one!""  Cantina isn't your traditional Mexican restaurant; it's more of an upscale/gourmet Mexican restaurant, but not at all pretentious.  The atmosphere is very jovial, lively, and casual.  I have yet to have a poor experience...for lunch, dinner, or even brunch!  

To start, they bring chips and two types of salsa (one red, one green, both delicious) to your table.  And if you're really daring and love it spicy, ask your server for the extra hot version!  Of course, everyone knows that by the time your main Mexican entree comes, you're already filled up on the chips and salsa; however, don't let that stop you from ordering the freshly made guacamole to go with the chips and salsa.  It's a little on the high-end pricewise, but it's well worth it.  They make the guac right at your table so you get to see all the fresh ingredients going into it.  Then once you take a bite...WOW.  You'll want to order it all the time.  It truly is the best guacamole I've ever tasted.  (Even better than the real authentic stuff in Mexico -- shhhh!)  

As for the entrees, I've tried a variety of items, but I keep going back to (1) the Enchiladas de Dennis (spinach, chicken, and cheese) and (2) the taco combination platter where you can pick one, two, or three tacos.  The shrimp and tilapia tacos are out of this world.  

And don't forget the drinks!  Both the mango margarita and white sangria leave me wanting more.  

One of my favorite afternoons was when three of us got out of work early for the day and went to Cantina for lunch.

It was a good day spending time with my lovely friends.  However it wasn't a good experience we had with the restaurant service.   Our waitress didn't seem to pay attention to our needs.  After serving our food and drinks, she disappeared for more than half an hour.  We tried hard to call for her attention but she never walked close to our table.  It wasn't busy at the time we were there.  There were only few tables at the time.  We only needed WATER but it never came.  

After half an hour we saw another waiter showed up.  He noticed that we needed his help.  He was busy with another table but he came by after that.  We got water afterward but the waitress never came back again. 

Service was very poor and they really need to improve it.  Though the food was ok, their service was bad.  Wait staff is the face of the restaurant.  If the service is bad, I don't think we should talk about coming back at all.

The place was packed, but was it from the food being good or the car show? We would soon find out.

It's a quick service restaurant more than a normal Mexican restaurant. You order at the counter and wait for them to call your food number.  We ordered one carne asada burro, a cheese crisp and a pint of Albondigas. This might have been a five star review if the lady taking our order would have been a little more pleasant. She never once cracked a smile. Even when my husband added a tip to our bill.

After ordering you help yourself to the salsa and chip bar and drink station. Salsas all fresh, chips a plenty. Everything was clean and free of spills.

It took forever and I mean forever to get our food.

At first glance my Albondigas was like never I had ever seen before. A big uh oh went through my head.  The bowl had very little broth with a scoop of rice, what looked like a whole boiled potato cut in fourths, a extra large carrot cut in half inch circles, large pieces of squash with my meatballs all hidden beneath. But. The broth was flavorful and the meatballs tender. If the veggies would have been cut a little smaller with less rice and more broth this soup would be my go to on a cold day. 

My husband's carne burro was filled with lots of tender, diced, seasoned steak wrapped in a paper thin tortilla. He said it was so good he could have eaten another one. My husband is a small man who isn't into food so that means his burro was a 5 star. 

Kids ate all but one piece of the crisp so it too must have been satisfactory.

After our meal we were wanting something sweet. Ordered a churro and cinnamon sugar chips. The chips were fried a little to long so we would probably never order again. The churro were standard but good enough and satisfied the craving. 

We will definitely be returning to Mixteca.",2017-03-12 18:25:08

xsCu9j-1Qe1r2LPOHJUf3A,dD5vTDPzv_79m8_zZhc9hA,PJ8VJqsTdJno0beARzaTrQ,4,5,1,2,"Kintaro Sushi & Hot Pot is an interesting place with quite a bit of potential.  A free standing building in front of Lowes, you would never know that this was recently a Chinese Buffet; they have remodeled the place to look very Asian modern, lots of browns and tans with tiles.  The overall effect is upscale and cool with a nice bit of class.  

While Kintaro has several all you can eat options, it is not a buffet, rather you are served at your table.  I've tried Kintaro several times for the weekday lunch $14.99 all you can eat Sushi and Hibachi.  You are given a single page menu which you check off what you want.  There are a couple of limitations: you eat all of what you order; they will not modify any items and they will limit how much you get at a single time.

I tried a bunch of apps and other hot items, including the teriaki squid, the hibachi shrimp, the spring rolls, shumei and fried squid app.   The Shumei and squid app were both nice and relatively small, nothing special, but nice and the right size so that you are not filled up.  The Teriaki Squid was a larger portion of squid with peppers, onions and brocolli in a decent sauce; the portion size was a bit too big for this type of dining, it will limit how many other items you can try.   The Hibachi  shrimp was a more reasonable size, with a side of fried rice and a nice creamy sauce.  Overall the hot foods are good and well made, but nothing really special.

I have tried quite a number of the sushi items, Nigiri, small rolls and larger rolls.  The sushi menu has actually expanded a bit with them adding a number of items including more types of nigiri sushi.  The sushi was better then the buffets, not as good as the fine Sushi places around town, but good.  The rice to fish ratio is ok, I would prefer a bit less rice but I understand why it probably will not change.  The fish that is used is of good quality.   I was more impressed with the nigiri sushi which tends to showcase the quality of the fish being served, with the Tuna, White Tuna and Smoke Salmon all being very good.  The regular rolls are good, although I would wish that the spicy rolls were a bit spicier.   The large rolls are interesting, but tend towards using tempura frying and sauces to add flavors, rather then letting the flavors of the fish come through.  
  
During my first visit, I had a big issue with service, which was extremely slow, a huge problem when you are doing all you can eat table service.  In addition I did not get all of the items that I ordered each time.  I did talk to the manager who told me that they were short of servers , but even so I was sadly disappointed with the server I had.   On the later trips, they seem to have resolved these issues, with service being much better, with food coming out in a more timely manner.  I also limited the number of items I ordered at a single time so there was no issue with with missing items.

A couple of other notes, all beverages are an additional charge, there are a number of other options available from the all you can eat menu.  There are hot pot options at lunch and dinner.  The sushi options have grown, you will not find anything very exotic here such as soft shell crabs, uni, scallops and the like, which I would love for them to add, but those are expensive items so I understand why they are not on the menu.

The improvements in service, have made Kintaro an excellent option for all you can eat sushi, especially at lunch when you have plenty of time.  Although not cheap you get high quality sushi and other Asian cuisine with good variety.   I have also heard that the hotpot option is very popular, so I will have to give that a try.",2016-11-08 23:55:36

Restaurant Week dinner, party of two.

Happy discovery - with a Yelp check in, free appetizer of fried cuttlefish! (Similar to calamari but more tender, $12.00 value!)

The place is very clean and well appointed. Service is attentive but not annoying. As for décor - I enjoyed the novelty of Vespas instead of stools at the raw bar. 

We each opted for the  1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell. While I neglected to ask the breed of oyster, they were too small to be Gulf, and too large to be N Atlantic - so the guess is Pacific NW. Very fresh and tasty.
Neither of us could decide between ""Petrale Sole = Heirloom Tomato + White Bean Ragout"" and ""Lemon Prawns & Lobster Ravioli = Pan Roasted Prawns + Lemon Caper Reduction + Lobster Ravioli + Lobster Bisque Cream Sauce"" - so we ordered one of each and split them. The sole was well cooked, very delicate and the tomato and bean ragout was lovely - lots of fresh ribbons of basil; very fresh and light - complimented the fish well. The lobster ravioli was insanely good - too bad there were only 3 mid-size ravioli to split up. Super rich, great flavor and texture - incredibly well conceived dish with just the right amount of bisque. The shrimp were the letdown of the night - nothing wrong with them, just bland and plain and nothing memorable.
For dessert, I was all about the neopolitan panna cotta and my friend loves tiramisu. Sadly, there was no tiramisu as listed on the Restaurant Week menu, it was a chocolate cake instead. Both desserts were tasty, but neither was amazing.

All in all, it was a very enjoyable meal, I am glad we went. Truly, no complaints. And while there are a lot of items that sound really good on the regular menu, the price point is high enough and I don't know that I was blown away enough to venture so far from home for an above-average meal. I'd go farther for an AMAZING meal, but this just didn't rank quite that high. If I am in the general vicinity and in the mood for seafood, I would not hesitate to go back, I just don't feel it is good enough to go out of my way.",2014-05-21 21:29:13

This is the hot spot during the spring, summer and fall seasons along the Lakeshore. The line ups are ridiculous but definitely worth the wait. And I would suggest walking to this place from the plaza just west of it that has the shoppers drug mart, b/c the area they have for parking is tiny and it gets packed really quickly.

It's pretty simple dessert at its best, but what separates it from every other dessert place is the FUNNEL CAKE. You don't have to spend $30 to go to Wonderland just to get a $10 funnel cake anymore. You can get it cheaper and it taste way better than the one at any Fair, Carnival or Amusement Park. As well the fruits that they use is so so fresh. Besides the funnel cake you can get Ice Cream, Banana Splits, and a Slushie to cool you off during our ridiculously hot summer. 

If you do end up going make sure you bring cash b/c there is no debit but there is an ATM but do you really wanna pay for the extra fee of $2, when that two dollars could go towards an ice cream or even better yet stay in your bank account?

- funnel cake with strawberries and vanilla ice cream",2011-06-21 01:16:33

So I told one of the staff that was nearby and he was very nice and offered me that they can make me a new one and apologized for it. After about 10-15 mins later they brought a new plate and warned me the plate is very hot. This time the Scallops were too salty, I thought it might just me so I had a friend tried the cauliflower that came with and was salty as well.

Beautiful little store, in a basement in Yorkville. I love the neighbourhood and feel the location is a good fit. The store has everything stationary-related- from cards and journals (huge selection, and excellent, of both) to wrapping paper and quills and ink! A wonderful place to browse in- I feel it would be impossible NOT to find something that you would want.

Extra bonus points because the proprietors were absolutely wonderful. My cousin was looking for something very specific, and they weren't pushy, but thoroughly helpful and kind, even giving us tissue paper because she had to ship something. I would come back again for sure! Highly recommended.",2013-06-19 19:57:02

If I wrote a review based on my last 2 visits this would be a 5+ star review.  However unfortunately for the restaurant I'm writing this review based on my current visit.  I came here for my 40th Birthday dinner with my aunts. This was my top pick so I wanted to come here for my birthday. From my past visits the service was impeccable and my main server was always so nice, helpful and friendly.  This time the server who's this tall blond lady was a little rude. She seated me while I waited for my aunts.  She knew I was waiting for more people to come and they were running late but she came to me twice asking if I wanted to order. Obviously I'm not going to order until everyone arrived.  When they finally arrived only 10 mins late I asked the server for her advice on the meats  and cheese to get on the charcuterie board but she seem impatient and short with me. She's like ""I don't know what you like"".  But I wanted her opinion as to what's good.  Shouldn't she be the one explaining the menu to me?!  In the end I ended up making an executive decision because she couldn't help me and choose some random stuff.  When I asked her for recommendations for the mains her answer was just get the dishes that's always on the menu, she said it's always there so People must like it!  In the meantime not answering my question as to what was in entrees.  Later on in the evening I was on the phone but I heard my aunt asking our server what they do for Birthdays.  I looked up from my conversation and saw the server ignored my aunt's question and walked away.  We got fed up and when asked for the bill it took her forever to bring it to us.  All the while the assistant servers were amazing and brought us water refill and chilli sauce when asked so quickly. I felt like the assistant servers were so much better than our server. We hope they get some of the gratuity we gave the main server since they deserved it more. So enough with my complaining about the poor service from this one individual.  Let's talk about Buca. The restaurant is in the basement so cellular service is very slow. However you're having a nice dinner you shouldn't be on your cell anyways!  The decor is very romantic and dim.  I ordered the peach Bellini which was yummy.  We shared the charcuterie board with 3 meats and cheeses and the baked olive with pork(a must have side) so delicious ! Mains we shared between the 3 of us the funghi mushroom pizza ($30)( I order this everytime, it's amazing), also the pigs blood spaghetti ($24) and Bigoli ($22).  Both pasta dishes and pizza were amazing.  After the main server ignored my aunt about the Birthday comment we decide we had enough of this poor service and forgot dessert and go to The Shangri-La Hotel for dessert instead. I was so excited to come to Buca and although the food was still out of this world the service for this visit left a bad taste in my mouth and ruin my Birthday dinner! That is why I gave Buca a 3 star instead of 5. Our server ruined Buca's perfect grading!! I think service is just as important as the food. I'm not sure if I would come back again with the poor service we experienced by our server.  For the price we paid I'm sure there's better Italian places out there that I can go to. Like Gusto 101 across the street or Terroni's which are my other two favs with amazing service consistently.  It's really too bad, since it was one of my aunts first time to Buca and I was ranting and raving about how great it was and it turned out she had a poor experience.  Goes to show how important it is to hire great people these days.",2017-11-05 05:45:44

The sauce (worcestershire-based) was really good, though the bacon was extremely crispy (as in zero moisture left in it - still tasty though).  The bun wasn't that special, and should've been toasted, maybe with a bit of butter to crisp it up.

The meal was sizable.  The two pancakes were on the larger side served with whipped butter and syrup.  They were dense and tasted good.  The eggs were a bit on the runny side of over easy.  The bacon was thick and crispy (how I prefer) but lacked in flavor.  The hash browns were less than well done, which was a bit disappointing.

There's always something new popping up in Chinatown, and Hot Feel is part of the newest crop, located in the same strip mall as Kinh Do, waaaay in the back, surrounded by foot spas and massage parlors. Similar to Hot & Juicy/Boiling Crab format, they offer assorted seafood by the piece or pound, with sauces of different heat levels according to the amount of heat you can handle served in heavy duty pots instead of plastic bags as well as various appetizers, fried items, skewers, and hot pots.

Prior to demolition time, you are given two pieces of paper as your placemats with a pair of annoying gloves that don't even ""fit like a glove"" and be sure to ask for wet naps which are up at the register(found that out after our meal) cause its gonna get messy.

Our party of four decided to share the Lamb Skewers, Shrimp Skewers, Chicken Wings, Rock Crab, and Garlic Shrimp. The Rock Crab was sweet with a nice lemony accent, the Shrimp Skewers(head on, shell on) were okay, and while the wings were  hot, crisp, and juicy, I would've liked to see a Hot Feel twist to it, rather than just a cup of ranch, especially in an Asian restaurant. The standouts were the Garlic Shrimp(head on, shell on) which was packed with tons of flavor with the right amount of heat(we asked for mild). The Lamb Skewers were also soft and flavorful. If you come here, this is one of the items to try.

Right now, they are running a VIP Card special for $20(no expiration date) which allows you 10% off your dining bill with future visits, and BOGO specials(This night, it was BOGO Crab, and if you post any food pic on Facebook(NOT Yelp or Instagram)

All in all, I do think this place deserves another try, as there were good parts to our experience there. But we certainly will not be rushing back anytime in the near future.",2018-07-03 17:55:38

- ambiance: nice club/bar feel. kind of loud and dark inside, but it was much better at the outdoor bar
- crowd: pretty mixed
- service: not once server came by our table - maybe not interested in making any money? we had to go to the bar every time to order our drinks
- drinks: i had the cantaloupe martini... maybe i chose the wrong one, but it tasted like crap. all i could taste was the alcohol. i understand that martinis are strong, but this just tasted like orange colored vodka... and not even good vodka
- bathrooms: surprisingly clean... but maybe cause it was still early in the night.
- music: top 40s",2010-06-21 06:30:00
znpaZvQuZgaoogPVE_HpMg,cD4sHHO5sEljk7qSGhVaEw,CfxVkwEJk1NAqgqMSesLzA,3,1,0,0,"I don't get the hype. I recently came because the name change with a group of friends and I just found the food very ordinary with a high price tag.

Staff: We had a reservation. The front area is a bit of a mess since it seemed like they didn't have someone dedicated to handling the entrance. It took a while before someone even asked if we had a reservation, however we were seated immediately once they found our reservation and service was prompt. You get the boisterous greeting when you enter and thankfully I wasn't seated at the bar or else I'd probably be irritated by all the yelling.

Ambience: The place is really nice. I enjoyed the furnishing and we were seated in the back where we had to take off our shoes. Like I said before, it is loud but for some reason is was also boiling hot. It was as if someone turned on the heat to a broiling temperature! I didn't get it but after a while (and taking off most of your layers), you might get used to the heat.

Food: I think my biggest disappointment was the food. We had Saba and Salmon Oshizushi (Mackerel and Salmon Sushi) and I think the poor craftsmanship bothered me the most. Some pieces were huge, while others were smaller. Some had a lot of ginger while others had few. And some of them fell apart when you picked them up. We also tried Karaage (Deep Fried Chicken) and Ebimayo (Deep Fried Prawn) and they were both good but nothing that wowed me. I liked the Kurage (Jellyfish) but it wasn't any different than the stuff you get at the supermarket. We also tried the Almond Tofu for desert which was passable but a bit bland. Now the saving grace was the Banana Tempura, which was amazing. It was sweet and had the right amount of batter, plus the accompanying coconut ice cream provided the added texture and flavours to the dish. I would go back just for that dish alone.

Some dishes were alright, but overall for the price I won't be dying to go back any time soon unless I want that Banana Tempura.",2015-11-16 18:25:07

Johnson's in the past but today I tried to limit myself to only browsing, and man, it was tough. The store is a massive showroom on Dupont that's easily missable as it has no signage (each time I go at least one person getting out of their parked car asks me if I know where it is). 

The showroom is loaded up with gorgeous furniture that would best be suited to a large, roomy space as most of it's pretty big. The kitchen tables are so big they can probably easily seat 12-15 people and they're very rustic looking. Tons of dark brown wood and leather-backed dining chairs. Huge dressers, ornate chaises and bedroom sets - including an ornate goldleaf canopy bed that I've been lemming for months (minus the $2200 price tag). They also have really, really nice mirrors - HUGE ones as well as smaller ones that are unique and beautifully crafted.

You can often find prices drastically reduced by up to 50%, and on this visit I noticed that they were renovating to include a second floor. As a result, all of the bedding was on sale and I must have spent 30 minutes eyeing a velvet tulip duvet cover from the Nygard collection before deciding it'd be easily findable at a better price. 

It's a family business that's been around for 60 years and features products from its own designers as well as imports from the U.S., Italy, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. There is no pressure to buy and no salesperson breathing down your neck - you can easily stop in and stroll through the showroom without encountering a single employee. Take your time and sit on the sofas, beds and touch things as you please. It's great for getting home decor ideas, too!",2009-04-26 23:01:06

Not a very good start and I haven't even taken a bite of my burrito yet. Asked for the churro's at the cash register. She said sure but at the end she still forgot to key it in the bill and I just about given up at that point and didn't even bother with the churro's.

Polar Snow has been my hang out all summer long!  I reviewed it way back when they first opened, so I figure it is time to update the Yelp community on the awesomeness that is Polar Snow!

I had to bump these guys up to 5 stars for the awesome customer service!  Every time I have stopped by, I have been greeted by a super big smile, a friend hello, and just a nice atmosphere.  Great customer service goes a long way with me and I want to congratulate them on their A+ service!

Another reason for the added star is that I am totally addicted to their Polar Soda.  I mentioned it in my previous review, but I need to shout it from the mountain top how brilliant this yummy, tasty drink is!  It is like an Italian soda times 10!  You can order it in any of the snow flavors, which is then it is mixed with sweet cream and soda water to make a FANTABULOUS drink!  Yes, I said fantabulous because fantastic and fabulous alone just don't do this drink justice.  I have to get one at least once a week or I start twitching a bit.  My addiction is hardcore!  At least my fix is only $3, so I won't break the bank succumbing to my needs.  My favorite options for the soda are Strawberry/Vanilla, Cake Batter, and Orange/Vanilla

The Snow (Snow cones for those of you out of the loop) is also super duper good as well.  The serving size is huge, especially compared to the price.  You can get an awesome treat for $2.  That's right, $2!!!  It is a great place to grab a sweet snack.

I have tried a lot of the flavors over the summer either in a Polar Soda or a Snow.  All have been really good and did not disappoint.  I do think my favorites have been the Red Velvet, Cake Batter, Tiger's Blood, and of course the Orange/Vanilla split.

Another amazing thing Polar Snow does is give you a 2 for 1 coupon every time you visit and pay the regular price.  Talk about a great idea for repeat business!  I love a good coupon, so Polar Snow, you hit the head of the nail with this deal.  Thanks for being so affordable and delicious all at the same time!

So the moral of the story is you need to head over to Polar Snow and get yourself a yummy treat ASAP!",2013-10-24 00:47:12

We didn't even review what was included in the menu- we just wanted to be surprised and delighted. And surprised and delighted we were!! 
Each dish was elegantly masterfully crafted and created to please the palate and the senses. Puree of this, shaving of that, foam of this, with reduction of that... all combined perfectly to create a beautiful symphony of a meal. Not just saying that to justify to huge expense, but my husband and I really did enjoy every bite.... but if you don't dare try the 16 course taster, they are 6 courses and 3 course options + a la carte which doesn't put such a huge dent in your wallet....

Located inside the Center on Maryland and Clark. Best spur-of-the-moment find ever! They offer scones, cheesecake, cookies, healthy bars, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, lattes, coffees, and quinoa sides. They have flavored agave packs here! Skinny tubes of it for less than $1. Very cool. Offers vegan, vegetarian, and meaty options. Now that's what I call: choices! 

NOTE: They do delivery here! $3 charge for orders less than $30. Free for over that price. Great idea for DTLV residents or for company lunches.

Goodwich was closed by 3pm on sundays. Thought we could make it, but we were an hour late! Curse you daylight savings! But really, if we didn't forget, we would have not found this place sooner.

I pulled up the yelp app looking for nearby eats and they directed me to the Bronze Café located in the Center. I did not expect this place to be so good! The guys working here were AWESOME. Love them. They made excellent recommendations. 

While we were waiting for our food, he gave us spoon samples of their chocolate cheesecake, strawberry, and pecan. Amazingly high-quality. Fresh. Housemade and NOT bought from a distributor. Bronze Café, for sure, is the real deal.

We ordered the kale, banana, apple vegan smoothie. Yummy. Not bitter and the perfect amount of sweet! Refreshing for a perfect spring/summer day. Comes in two sizes. 14 oz. ($4-5ish) and 24 oz. ($5.75). Get the bigger size. So worth the health.

There was extra smoothie in the blender so our server gave us the rest in another cup (See pic). Now that was really, really thoughtful. Seriously. It was a lot of juice! More than what I can say about Jamba Juice (you just know those jamba jerks have extra but won't give it to you!) 

To start we had the HUMMUS: chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, cumin, paprika, lemon juice. I could have sworn it had roasted red pepper too... Comes with warm pita. ($3.95) kinda small for the price but it's only $2.25 if you ordered a sandwich/salad. Great for a small lunch/snack size. Creamy, smooth, fresh. Ridiculously tastes like tacos to me. The spices they used and the freshness just got to me. I wish I bought a tub to take home. Waaayyy better than store-bought hummus. Must-try!

My friend and I also ordered the Tree of Life (vegan) and I ordered the LGBTQ sandwich. 

Tree of Life sandwich ($9.95): roasted red peppers, avocado, mixed greens, tomato, housemade pickled onions, housemade vegan cashew creama, brazil nut crumbles, mango cilantro vinaigrette on a pita flatbread. Comes with a small side salad of mixed greens in the vinaigrette. 
LOVED this. The crunch of the nut went surprisingly well with the avocado and the veggies. What the heck. These guys know how pair flavors! Who knew vegan could taste so good. (They make sure to note that pita bread isn't vegan, but this was so good).

LGBTQ sandwich ($9.95): housemade bacon jam, maple-glazed bacon, mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, basil aioli, lemon vinaigrette on ciabatta bread.
Obviously not vegetarian. Comes with a small mixed green salad with vinaigrette as well. So freakin' bomb. The right amount of salty from the bacon without being overwhelming. Balanced out perfectly by the cucumber and tomato. Bacon was NOT greasy and complemented the veggies amazingly. And for Jesus's Chrysler sake, this has bacon jam in it. Bacon jam. I wanted to cry, confess, and break down in food-heaven convulsions right then and there. 

Going to try their scones next time. Reasonably priced and way better-looking than starbucks' overpriced frozen sweets. Ranges from $1.75-$4ish. Big portions for pastries/scones/bars.

I think I found my new lunch spot. It's also a chill place to kick back and read a book or bring your laptop. I believe there is free wi-fi and a few outlets. There's a reason why this place has 5 stars and I can definitely see why. 

Checking out The Center was on my to-do list forever, and it's an absolute gem to find this awesome café here. Character, culture, and no gimmicks. The service, well-thought out fresh menu, and the options are fantastic. My favorite surprised find by far!! Next time you're in the area, you have to stop by here!

If you said ""yes"" to all of the above, then Barbers at Blakeney is the oasis you've been searching for. While not an old-school barbershop like the ones your dad used to take you when you were a kid - no, you're not going to find beat-up copies of Playboy laying around - the gents that cut hair at Barbers at Blakeney take cutting your hair very seriously. You'e always going to get a razor-like attention to detail from any of the guys cutting your hair; doesn't matter who cuts your hair, you're going to get an excellent cut.

Best part of it all, a cut at Barbers at Blakeney won't set you back a week's pay, nor is it going to look as if it was just cut by someone who flunked Basic Haircutting 101.

We arrived Monday late afternoon for any early dinner, sat inside as it was quite HOT! (this is the desert, y'all!!) to enjoy the A/C. The patio looked very inviting with the mountain views, once the sunset it was THE PLACE TO BE!

 Lets start with the salads. The GOLDEN BEET salad is just beautiful to look at AND tasty with a balsamic glaze. If you like beets this will satisfy that craving. The ROASTED BROCCOLI Salad is outta site!!! sooooo DEEELISSSH and without raisins which really floated my boat, cuz I hate those little dried fruit things......the peanut dressing/sauce is a perfect addition plus the slivered almonds are a welcomed topper. Lastly we had the CAESAR Salad with Homemade Dressing (inc, anchovies) and Homemade croutons. Really lovely presentation - creamy dressing,  freshly grated parmesan cheese and those house made croutons! SIMPLY DEVINE.

  We ordered 3 pizzas, a margarita, a pepperoni & the fig & pancetta. Ahhh, couple things here to mention....... the MARGARITA, the red sauce is a very light tomato sauce which does provide for a fresh light taste. The PEPPERONI looked great (I don't eat sausage of any kind :**/) with small bite size pieces of the spicy sausage, again with the light tomato sauce. The FIG PANCETTA, this is kind'a their special offering. It features small (yes!) bite size pieces of sweet fig and salty pancetta with a balsamic glaze. Keep in mind there is NO SAUCE on this pizza...So it's a savory offering....

  NO cocktails, however beer & wine are featured along with soft drinks, iced tea & Italian sodas. Also many coffee options, so an iced coffee would be a very niiiiice addition with any of these lunch/dinner options, and of course with your breakfast selection too!

   Cottonwood Eatery has an on site baker, so the small bakery case displays yummy, deliciousness pastries like muffins, apple or cherry turnovers etc. again with a fresh cup of coffee to quote Ina "" the Barefoot Contessa"" Garten ""How bad can that be?""

I like that this place isn't massive. I didn't like the $6 I had to pay for one bottled water. However, with that said, I didn't actually pay for it. The guy standing next to me at the bar did it. That's nice. In fact... I got offered a steak dinner from someone else within minutes.

Single ladies. If you're hungry or thirsty,... this is the place to meet someone for a free meal. Just kidding! Seriously though, I like the size of the place and the lighting is beautiful. You feel kinda glamorous just standing there in your jeans and t-shirt.

As I came in, a fresh batch was coming out from being fried and were about to be glazed. I knew I was in for a treat.

The staff there are very friendly and gracious. The atomsphere is quite loud once the place gets more busy, but there is also music playing in the background. There is a large seating area in the lounge and also additional seating for large  groups upstairs.

They are known for their fresh mozzarrella and their giant meatballs. The fresh mozzarrella was amazing. However, the meatball has been consistently very salty (stuffed and non-stuffed). Also, I believe their pasta is supposed to be fresh, but the last time I went, the spaghetti tasted like it was from dried pasta, so I was a bit disappointed there. The first time I went, the spaghetti was chewier and tasted more like fresh pasta.

We also had their white and red wine sangrias which were delicious. You can order them by the pitcher as well. No drinks specials on Wednesdays though, FYI.

I would probably return if I was downtown with friends and we didn't want to walk further to another restaurant.  My main issue with this place is the saltiness of the food.",2014-05-23 19:36:11

I literally did not know that was a thing that could exist. I have never had friendly attentive service at a sushi restaurant and so have learned to expect forgotten items, surly servers and a generally lacklustre customer service experience. This is not at all the case at Sushi House. Last time I came here, we were greeted by the sushi chef upon arrival and then promptly greeted by our server with a smile.

The decor is very nice; probably the most pleasant setting for sushi in Brampton.

The sushi itself is delicious and reasonably priced for high quality fare. My last visit made me wonder why I don't come here more as opposed to going for AYCE.

It probably won't appeal to 'regular' women in Vegas and here is why. When I say regular, I mean women who are a size 8 and bigger... Who only shop for clothes maybe once or twice a year... And don't care about what they call 'fashion'. Women who dress for comfort and practicality, and wear sneakers at least 4/7 days a week. There is NOTHING wrong with this, however this boutique is really not for these types of women. This boutique really carries, what most people think is fashion forward. It's not THAT fashion forward... The clothes are very wearable and very 'on trend' to what is hot right now... But, to what Vegas chicks are used to.. Some will say this store is 'fashion forward'... 

With all of this said, the store does have a great selection of just denim and t-shirts... They have amazing selections of affordable jewelry. The hats, absolutely perfect. I get so many compliments when I rock a hat from this store. They have perfect 'every day' tanks when you first walk in, in virtually every color. They have a tiny men's section... I believe?? They have great accessories, like scarves, purses and backpacks. I love that there are only a few of each item...And I also love the way the store is designed and merchandised. I love the affordable prices and I love that the owner buys most things from LA... I also love that the owner has exquisite taste and isn't scared of buying clothes for the 'masses', but fashion forward young women. I clearly LOVE a lot about this store. 

However.. I do have some constructive criticism... 

They have some shoes.. Which, if I'm being honest are the only things I don't love about this store... (There can be affordable shoes that also appear to be well made.. These shoes, to me, look cheaply made and like they could be from Payless). I would LOVE to buy cute shoes here if they had them... But the ones I've seen, look like all fake leather, bad stitching.. And just not a great shoe selection at all. 

If the low prices really are compromising the quality of shoes.. I feel the store should just show better quality shoes. The store's clients wouldn't mind spending more money for quality pairs of shoes. I've seen boots here that are trying to look cool and like they're quality, but with a quick glance it's obvious they're not well made.  

One other small thing.. Usually when I come, the girl I get is super friendly. But one time... Recently- the girl there was being very passive, because it was 8:10..  I told her I'd only be 5 more min...(I've worked in so many retail stores... And I've never once made anyone feel weird about keeping me late...So.. I 'get it'. And when I was kept.. It could be hours...) So when this girl was sort of snobby and rude to me, over s few minutes it left a really bad taste in my mouth. Again, she wasn't overtly rude at all.. But if I was running a clothing store... I would never ever, ever want one of my girls making any client feel weird, if she needed a few extra minutes to shop... Lock the door, but turning off the music and staring at me... While I'm trying to hurry...just really sucks- there's no other way to put it. 

Also, as I was deciding between a few shirts on a table, she came next to me and started putting back the two shirts I had set aside... She didn't have to do that- she was just 'letting me know for the 10th time, it was 10 minutes past closing'.  I made sure to tell her that I was aware of the time and would be quick.. I just thought the actions were VERY unnecessary and made the experience that night very uncomfortable.",2016-01-03 05:02:15

It's a great place to get some human interaction when you've had a long day working from home too. The place is absolutely huge. Unfortunately, as with every other dog park, the grass is non existent so when I brought my dog here on a rainy day, she was a bit of a mess. 

My routine is bringing my dog over to the lake side, let her run around there for a while, play in the water and chase the big dogs, then bring her to the ""dirt"" side for more running around. They have a special area where you can hose your dog down after she gets dirty. I usually have a towel I keep in the trunk to dry her off before putting her back in the car. 

My dog loves playing with little dogs and they have this great (grassy) area for ""timid"" dogs, but my dog is the least timid in the would and she would probably upset the other dog owners there so we stick with the 2 large parks. 

Something else to note, they there is a nice ramada area in case you do find yourself out there on one of the 3 days out of the year it rains. I been going here for a long time and didn't even realize it!! 

The bad thing is I do see a lot of dog poop around, I wish dog owners would be more responsible. I hear Gilbert partnered up with ASU to put in this device where you put in dog poop and it exports electricity to power the lights in the park, if that is true, hopefully the owners will be more motivated to clean their dogs ish.

Let me start by saying this was my second visit to the restaurant in about two years.  I had the best gnocchi of my life on Visit #1. I had one of the most disappointing experiences there today.

First off, for a place that's so committed to sustainability and eco-consciousness, the vegetarian and vegan options are ridiculous.  There was exactly one truly vegetarian entree on the menu, and that, the waiter said, was ""basically a wrap,"" one of the most boring meal combinations on the planet.  The rest of the menu was meat or meat-based.  

I get that Cleveland is a meat-lovers town, I really do.  But for a place that strives to be veg-friendly -- at least I assumed it did -- it's disappointing that only one vegetarian (not vegan) entree was available. (My waiter said as much.) Strangely, there is a little vegetarian symbol next to some foods but some of them have meat. The PBT, for example, has bacon in its name! Why flag something as being vegetarian when it's not? 

What I did order could not have been more confusing and unappealing.  The PBT (minus the bacon) consisted of a grilled sandwich the size of the palm of my hand with a huge schmear of pimento and goat cheese inside.  It was rich, and tasty, but also tiny.  The other two-third of the plate consisted of a gigantic mound of mini-shoestring potatoes and a huge serving of tomato coulis, which I guess I was supposed to dip my sandwich into (see my photo).  A tiny sandwich, a mound of cast-off potato pieces and what basically amounts to tomato soup, not even served with a spoon?  I just don't get it. The proportions were off.  The flavors were OK but also proportionately strange. The whole thing just didn't make sense. (My two guests had burgers, which they said were fine.)

The lighting was also off. We were sitting in an area that was well lighted. But the folks behind us were in almost total darkness.  Another strange sighting? Tablecloths on some tables but not others.

The waiter was nice but had no idea how to handle our complaints.  When we said the food was ""just OK,"" he said ""Oh ok"" and walked away quietly.  The correct reply is ""What can I do to make it better?"" He seemed untrained on how to react to unhappy patrons.  The eager busboy didn't help either; he whisked away a glass of soda without asking. I wasn't done with it.  That I had to ask for the bill twice didn't end the meal on a pleasant note.

I'm sad that I have to write this review. I really had high hopes for this place. I brought two people with me who I wanted to impress, after the great experience I had two years ago.  But after this meal, I'm unlikely to return.  I don't care if the walls are made of old barn; if you can't offer truly sustainable food -- vegetarian and vegan included -- and your staff has no idea how to make things better when people are not happy, then I'm not your customer.",2011-12-27 05:03:15

Although this place had a huge sign that advertised its doner kebabs, I decided to be a bit more adventurous. I ordered off the traditional Turkish menu and got dishes that you don't normally see at a doner/shwarma joint.

Iskender Kebab- This resembled a shwarma plate dinner with shaved meat. However, the tomato-based sauce and the yogurt complemented the flavours of the meat. However, I wasn't a big fan of the bread underneath the meat as it got soggy from the heat and sauces.

Adana Kebab- Two huge skewers of meat on rice. The seasoning of the meat was not overpowering and it was made fresh, which added to the tenderness of the meat. 

Veggie Eggplant- Cold dish of egglant rolls with minced meats. This was mediocre.

Special/mixed peta- Probably the best part of the meal. Fresh bread made in a traditional oven topped with minced beef, onions, feta, and lot more seasonings from Anatolia. I definitely recommend trying the peta here!

The food is overall above average as its price range. However, the decor and environment are a bit lacking, which reminded me more of a take-out shawarma joint than a traditional Turkish restaurant.

Although it is not AYCE, I think for the quality of fish, it is perfectly priced.  I never leave here feeling like I overpaid. 

Every roll is cut into huge pieces.  If you have a small mouth (like myself), it makes for some interesting eating trying to cram a whole piece into your mouth.  But it's also very filling!  I'ved tried the majority of the rolls at this place.  Here are a list of my favorites:

Kiss of Fire - Very spicy.  This is one of my favorite rolls I've had anywhere
Franky Special - Just the right amount of spicy and sweet
Burning my stomach - This thing is hot!! love it!
Tastes Like My X-Girlfriend - Got to love the names of some of these rolls, but this is very good.

Everything lives up to par. The food, coffee, and service. 

It's a small little place hidden in a business complex, but if you're smart enough to find it - then you deserve to eat there !! Think of it as a treasure hunt. If you take the time to find it, you'll be rewarded in the end. 

The owner, Olivier, is a very friendly man. If it's your first time, he gladly explains almost everything he has on his menu. And what I liked most, is that he takes the time to find out your name and shake your hand. Not many establishments do that. 

Although he does have a set menu, the soups, quiches, & tarts seem to change almost every day. Plus, I do believe he just has other random food items available each day, so be sure to ask him what he has for the day [though, I'm sure he'll tell you before you get the chance to ask]. 

I had the chicken curry sandwich, an item not regularly available on his menu. Damn, it was delicious. Good flavored curry, tender chicken, great baguette, plus some fresh herbs and such. I hope he has this on a more regular basis. 

For you vegetarian and/or vegan folk, he has quite a few options on his menu, and he said he was looking to add more. 

The croissants there are supposed to be really great. I wish I could confirm this, but unfortunately I'm not a big fan of croissants. They're just too buttery and flaky for my taste [a lot of people judge me for this, but it's OK. =p]. But, I will comment that they did LOOK good.

Sara: 3/5
Suk: 4/5

We felt lucky to get into Garde Manger when we called the Sunday morning to ask about reservations that evening and were told, yes, please come at 7:15pm.  

We felt less lucky when we showed up at 7:15pm and were told by the hostess, we will be with you in a minute.  

That minute morphed into 30 minutes, with nowhere to sit, no offer of water or a beverage, no preview of the menu and no acknowledgement of our presence beyond the first, ""hello, do you have a reservation, we will be with you in a minute"".   

I am an impatient person and the only reason we stuck around that long is because Montreal had an amazing video series of it's history projected against different buildings around old Montreal which we viewed to kill the time.  That, and Suk really wanted to eat here. I personally would have been ready to leave 15 minutes in.  

We were eventually ushered in and seated at the back bar.  Once we were there, we ordered oysters, jerk crab and the braised short ribs.  

If you have read any of my previous reviews you know I do not review oysters unless they are off - oysters are oysters and these oysters were great.  Thank you ocean and thank you fishermen.    No need to thank a particular restaurant for serving the fruits of other people's labour.  

The jerk crab was amazeballs.   Yum yum yum!  What's that? This isn't your own homemade marinade? Maybe Graces? As in available at most grocery stores across the country?

I give them the benefit of the doubt and understand that sushi tends to cost more and the labor involved in crafting the pieces entails skill and time but if they want to limit the amount of sushi a patron can indulge in, an asterisk and disclaimer underneath the ""All you can eat"" sign would help!! :P Or don't serve sushi AT ALL if you're gonna be stingy about it - Jesus Christ!

My boyfriend and I liked the atmosphere. It's Rustic Chic. Distressed wood, modern lights. The tables are a comfortable distance apart. The music was a bit on the loud side, but we were sitting under a speaker. 

The service was just okay. Our server took our order for appetizers and we told her we needed another minute. She didn't come back for ten minutes and we were surprised to learn she hadn't punched in our appetizers during that time.

The menu was a bit confused. Are these fancy tiny portions or is this comfort food? 

We had:
The steak tartar - nice and spicy. I didn't love that it came with sour cream and onion chips. 

French onion soup - Good broth. Not to cheesy, which I like, but I don't know if it would appeal to most. 

The Spaghetti and meatballs - This was very tasty. Pure comfort food--I don't know how well it jived with the other dishes on the menu. Also, I don't think it was worth the $22 price tag. 

Yellow fin tuna - This was not nearly tasty enough to justify the tiny portion. It came on top of a mashed sweet potato patty, which was nothing special. The tuna itself was fine, a bit on the bland side. Nothing stood out about this dish.

 I don't understand the overwhelming excitement over this particular hotel.  Yes, it s NEW!!!  But aside from that,  the W offers much the same amenities that we have grown to love at other properties here in the valley... without the stilted arrogance one must have acquired by watching  too many episodes of  ""Gossip Girl"".   I would rather stay at Sanctuary on Camelback over the W in a heartbeat.. But then again, I don't own a pair of DD cups, or consider ""TMZ"" the ""BBC"" of America.  

I attended a company dinner event here tonight, which was actually very well orchestrated.  The new wait/bar staff was friendly and ambitious.  Drinks were made correctly, the food had prefect presentation, and had great flavor.  Normally food served on a large scale is nothing to get excited about, but the steak I enjoyed this evening was exceptional!  God bless the cow that has given its life for my meal tonight!  This experience alone was the reason behind 2 of my 3 star rating.

After dinner, we investigated the ""drink-pouring"" areas of the hotel. The living room on the first floor is spacious and very comfortable.  This is what an African hunting lodge would look like if Philippe Starck designed it.  The best part of the living room was the older crowd it attracted; most patrons looked as if they were at least 24 or older.

After a quick drink we decided to check out the notorious ""Wet Deck"" (aka the bastard child of Rehab,  Vegas).  We took the elevator up to the 2nd floor and accessed the deck via the ""Zen Garden"".. Since no-one saw our entrance.. Friends assumed we had been up on the deck all night... a perfect alibi! 

 One can instantly see the drunken potential this pool bar has!  The only prop I didn't see (although, not looking) was a strippers pole.  I'm not sure if I would ever come up here to party.... well, that's not entirely true.

Cost:
-A bit more than your regular dim sum place, but not as expensive as LWH 
-$4/5/6 for S/M/L dim sum dishes.

Atmosphere/Decor:
-Tucked away in the nondescript Double Tree Hotel near the airport, everything is covered in yellow and gold table clothes and chair coverings.
-This place is one of the brightest, cleanest and fanciest Chinese restaurants in town!

Ordered:
-Follow this link for a lengthy and photographic breakdown of most items on the menu: http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/557688

1. Of particular note are the foie gras fried dumplings and the steamed beef ball.

2. The presentation of most dishes is much better than any other Chinese restaurant and really enhance the experience of eating carefully prepared dishes instead of the usual 'fast food dim sum' experience.

3. Of somewhat of a disappointment were the shrimp dumplings (the gold standard of any dim sum place): the skin was too thick and therefore wasn't steamed to an appropriate translucency, and the shrimp, whilst fresh, was overcooked and mildly 'mushy'.

Service:
-Some of the most courteous and professional staff.
-Depending on how busy it is, the food may take a while to arrive.
-You get three hours free parking if you show them your parking ticket.

Conclusion:
-A good, but not great, dim sum place that I'll definitely be going back to have their more creative dishes.",2010-07-05 02:13:53

To me it is important that unless your customer is rude or abusive, a difficult client is the one you want to please the most because they are usually the ones that when satisfied will keep coming back and sing your praises to the world!  I have been getting my hair done at this salon for two years and have gotten mixed results.  Prior to my last visit I was debating a switch.  The salon is one of the nicest, cleanest, most efficient salons i have ever been to, the staff is so nice and everything about this place is comfortable, hip, and cool.  Problem is they have not been able to get my color right.  The cut I got last visit was Phenomenal! But, even my stylist admitted that the color we were trying to achieve was not what we both envisioned.  I had to go back for a redo which was not done by my stylist, no one wants to go back for a redo but if the redo does not do it then it might be time to look elsewhere.  When I went back for the redo Kandi (SP) was nice yet condescending, I know you are the professional yet I have lived in my own skin and hair for a very long time so give me some credit too.  She looked at my hair, gave me a bit of a ""you are so difficult"" vibe, turned to my stylist who was supposed to redo my hair but was working on someone else, told her what she did wrong an how to correct it then sauntered away directing another stylist or technician (never introduced to this person so don't know what role she played in the salon) to re-do my hair.  The results were no where near what we envisioned yet by this time I did not believe that they would want to hear me complain.  I contemplated going back to speak with the owner because they are usually so accommodating, to get a refund on my color but I let it go.  I spent a lot of money, $200.00 for cut and color so I do expect a lot.  It has taken me a couple of months to write this review because truth is I really like this salon, I just don't trust them anymore to get my color remotely close to where I want it to be.  I am now having to research other salons and this is the worst part because I am busy, don't make a gazillion dollars and need to find a place where I can get the whole package.

I booked a suite back in January for my bachelorette weekend that happened April 25. As a local, I picked the Flamingo for me and my girlfriends to stay because of its central location and the ""Forever Fabulous"" suite was just perfect for our theme. It's pink details throughout the room and spacious floor plan were just what we were looking for. When I had spoken to a lead guest services rep in January I had specified that we needed two roll aways in our room and she assured me that would be no problem. I called again earlier this month to reconfirm my reservation and again made sure the note was on my confirmation about the roll away requests. It was. 

We arrived around 11:30 knowing our room might not be ready but decided to see about checking in early and getting some pool keys anyway. The line was SO long. We waited over thirty minutes just to check. Of course the room was not ready so the woman let us know to check back but gave us some pool keys. We checked back around 3:30 and the room still was not ready. (It is supposed to be ready by 4:00 pm) Once again at 4pm we checked in, they told us the room was ready, but when we went to go try the room key it did not work.

This took us an extra 30 minutes just to get in our suite!! When we entered the room we noticed there were no roll away beds. We called the front desk over TEN times to try and get someone to bring them up! They transferred us, put us on hold and then hung up on us each time. We finally gave up. 

At check out good luck trying to get a bell hop to help you bring your bags down. We called for that to and they told us 45 minutes to an hour wait. How are you supposed to check out on time if you can't even get your bags downstairs?? Another twenty minute wait for the elevator and four trips downstairs to get all of our luggage down. We headed over to valet to pick up my car and waited another thirty minutes! We had reservations at noon for brunch for 10 girls at another hotel and we were an hour late for it.

The tortilla soup was a huge winner with bright, fresh flavors and a nice spice.  Not over-the-top spiciness, but just enough to bring out the chicken and tomato flavors.

Coconut shrimp came across as fairly standard.  Not a real stand out dish, but I was impressed with the freshness of the shrimp.  

Also had the Jerk Chicken.  To put it simply, it was perfectly cooked, tender, and nice balance of sweet and tangy.

They then scratched my scalp and it was the absolute BEST part of the massage (until we get to the feet...again, amazing). 

They spent a lot of time on the neck, shoulders and back, all the time with my clothes on. They simply sit behind you as you're reclined and reach into the back of your shirt. They then moved to my arms, and after massaging them, they do some pounding (punching maybe?? Not sure but my arms felt great afterwards, so no complaints). They then moved down to my feet and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. After a lengthy foot massage (the toes and heels too...ahhhhhh), they massaged my legs. I had my jeans pulled up to my knees, and she actually pulled them up higher and was massaging up to my thighs. My legs are always sore from running so this was much needed.

Side salad came first and out came a huge family style platter. We barely even touched this as it wasn't needed. It was just simple salad of greens and tomatoes oddly with Italian dressing. There was a mixup though and while we wanted a side salad the lady gave us a full size. The veggie platter comes with a little salad so I don't think its needed. 

Then the yemisir sambusa came and for $1.50 is a large pastry filled with lentils. I was expecting a small samosa sized thing. It was pretty good and filling with all the lentils. There was a side of a horseradish-y paste to accompany it.

Vegetarian platter- came with lots of goodies and it was all delicious. It doesnt seem like a lot of food at first, but when you eat it with injera it hits like a brick. We had a cold lentil salad, some greens and tomato salad, cold injera salad, braised cabbage and carrots, red lentil, yellow lentil, collard greens, curry paste. With the platter and the yesmisir sambusas the BF and I were full and we would definitely order that again and skip the salad. 

Service was just OK. There was plenty of waiting around after eating for a box and then it was a long wait for a check to come to us. It seemed usual so don't expect a speedy place. 

The food here is really cheap and the quality and flavor is great so I will be back!",2012-01-24 03:23:48

I remember the first time I had one, a co-worker brought a box into the LA law firm I worked in back in the early-mid 90s. I was hooked! For 20 years, I could not fathom eating a glazed donut anywhere else.

I am also a fan of their apple fritters, you must try one. They are different from the oily mess that other donut places serve. When I was a kid, I worked at Winchell's donuts so I've had my share of donuts in my time and understand how they are made. So KK in my opinion is up there!

At this location, it is a hit or miss. Majority of the time they will hand you a free sample right off the conveyer belt and other times it seems like you are just standing there. 

We do the drive thu more than we should and 98% of the time our donut box is hot. We live in Anthem, so it's nice to have warm donuts for the fam when I get home. There were a couple times I sent someone for a KK dozen run and asked for an apple fritter. Twice they said, they ran out :'(

The areas of the store were organized and defined in some parts, but in others I felt like it was a total crapshoot.  The women's section was especially mished-mashed.

They also seem understaffed or poorly organized - there wasn't a lot of people in the store when we were (10pm) but it seemed like there was a consistent line that they kept having to shuffle to different departments to get checked out.  Maybe it's because they're painstakingly slow at the checkout... My lady was and I watched two others who weren't much better.

Don't have much of a desire to return unless I want to look at dress clothes or something.  Even then, I'd much rather go to Target or suck it up and go to the mall.

Fast forward to Saturday visit with his parents and a hot yoga class at nearby Moksha Yoga Markham. We chose the 2pm class with Darnel, a Hot Power Flow. Hot Power Flow here was more like a Level 2 flow at any other studio I have tried. The class was fast paced (Love it) with lots of Vinyasa (Love it) and challenging poses. All the extra core work was really interesting, effective and difficult. This class was a serious workout. The teacher was really warm, friendly and kept things light and fun. He did not, however explain things in detail, or do any adjustments. The SO who is newish to yoga found the class too difficult for him. The first 3/4 of the class was no music, the last 15 min or so, the instructor put on some MGMT or something similar on a  little boom box. It was tinn-ny and distracting.

As per all the other Moksha's I have tried the room is more ""warm"" than hot. Nothing like Tula or Bikram. The studio was clean and the change room clean, the people at the desk were friendly but not overly accommodating. There is a selection of mats, outfits, and yoga goodies to purchase. 

Across from Markville mall and beside party packagers. Arrive early, it was nearly impossible to find parking.

Pros
- Really challenging class
- filtered water
- large change rooms with hooks for my jacket
- its Moksha, which I really enjoy


Cons
- have to drive to get there (I am REALLY not a suburbs/strip mall kind of person)
- no lockers, and signs expressing that nothing can be brought into class except wallet.. no keys.  I like to lockup my blackberry, ipod, laptop if I have it etc. I guess people leave things in their car? see above.
- no adjustments
- This studio lacks a ""spas-like"" feel which I enjoy
- I prefer soothing music during my practice or something audible to focus on 
- no shampoo and conditioner in the showers (As I live downtown and had to go back downtown I wanted to be full cleaned for the journey)
- There was a number of GROANERS. like serious groans. This class? This studio? do not like.

I eat here like I'm in a food eating contest shoveling in huge mouthfuls of salty, doughy, cheesy goodness. The ham and pineapple pizza is pretty rad and I love the calzones too. It's so much cheese my heart is ready to stop with each bite. You would think that the 5 cheese calzone is what to get when going for the calzone but I have found that some of the different cheeses that are in it are an extreme salt overload. The meatball calzone or the ones I have gotten with filling then don't have enough cheese! The Goldilocks in me has me choosing the regular plain calzone it's juuust right!  

The pastas are pizza shop pastas, greasy, thicker gummy noodles reminiscent of Chef Boyardee comfort! I like the spaghetti and meatballs. Going simple here is the way to go.

As odd as it may sound coming from someone who has yet to visit Japan, it can only be described as the most authentic izakaya experience I've had thus far. At least, authentic with respect to my romanticization, imagination, and social media-driven impression of what it should be. From the heated stones to grill the wagyu and beef tongues, the overt and unadulterated freshness of the seafood, the thought put into composition of these vibrant dishes, the tasty synergy to the sake, to the live goldfish aquarium in the middle of our table; Kingyo has been the most memorable izakaya experience up to the time of this writing.

The two highlights I'd like to bring forth include the stone bowl uni don and the kaisen don. The briney and creaminess that is uni with the scallions and the vegetal crisp texture of nagaimo fit perfectly with the piping hot rice. Just sampling once from my friend's bowl prompted me to get my own to devour, despite the party having moved on to the birthday cake. The kaisen don I was barely able to restrain myself long enough to snap a shot. Beautifully put together and very fresh.

Every course, plate, and bowl that arrived initiated a sort of ritual. To savour slowly to extend the bliss as much as possible, take some sips of sake which in turn lead to more anticipation for the next bite.

I took half the Gyro home to my Greek friend and he said he actually thought it was delicious.  It wasn't too greasy.  I also took home some baklava, but it was just average.  Nothing special really.  Obviously, nothing like what they have in Greece.

Today, my coworkers was in the area and decided to bring me back some Greek fries.  When I opened the box, the amount of fries and feta were pretty pinch.  They looked pretty average to me.  Again, nothing like Alexandros, but when you start to get to the end, they do get better.  Probably because you're soaking up all the oil and feta (the best part).  The fries were pretty soggy, but I like soggy fries, so that's me.

Krazzy Gyro is a pretty good option if you are craving a gyro.  I don't think there's other Greek places like it in the area, besides the typical chains.",2016-05-17 18:33:56

Why 3 stars? All the food was good (except the meatball sandwich, I'll get to that after). But -1 for not having cornbread. Seriously? A BBQ PLACE without CORN BREAD!? 

Onto the meatball sandwich, it was meh. The bread was kind of stale, the sauce tasted similar to ragu and the meatball itself didn't taste or feel like it was made from ground beef (which I was expecting). 

Regarding everything else we ate; it was good. Not great. Definitely more serious BBQ smoke houses out there with much better food. 

I would come back for the pulled pork and mac and cheese, but only if I was in the area. Not worth the trek in my honest opinion.",2018-04-14 20:57:56
REcAzV2fbylFD5W_KTXsWQ,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,2,10,1,4,"During it's heyday, the Las Vegas Hilton was quite possibly the fanciest casino hotel resort not on the strip. Nowadays it's become dated, a ""classic"" Vegas establishment in hotel speak, and is a destination for nostalgia seekers, folks visiting the Las Vegas Convention Center next door, or simply people who are looking for a deal off the strip.

As a hotel, the LV Hilton is more than adequate. Standard rooms are all oversized and the beds are solid. While the rooms may feel somewhat antiquated for some folks, they've done a decent job of attempting to modernize the themes, though there is always more work to be done. The suite selection isn't as vast as some off strip properties, but there is some opportunity to enjoy a quality amenities, especially in the villa suites which feature a space as large as 13,000 square feet. If Hilton heiress Paris were to stay the night, I have no doubt those rooms would be her *only* choice.

The casino here is a total flashback to the early 1980s. They do have a decent and more recently expanded sports book, but most of everything from their table layouts to the slot machines scream old school more than anything. Their player's club program doesn't have much sell for casino offers and even the multi-tiered program isn't much of an incentive when the amenities simply aren't enough to match the nearby competing casinos. But in the same token, the comp rules are less stringent and the casino staff is accommodating and friendly.

My biggest beef with the property is their awful dining options. When their ""high end"" selection includes the dreadful Benihana (http://www.yelp.com/biz/benihana-las-vegas) or the laughable Asian fusionesque Garden of the Dragon (http://www.yelp.com/biz/garden-of-the-dragon-las-vegas), it's easy to take issue with the rest. The classic buffet served here is a real sight to behold, with bland food being managed by a real unmotivated bunch of service staff. Instead of the confusing options, I will see on occasion a crowd of tourists over at the Pizza Hut Express (http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-cafe-las-vegas), but I suppose even they know what's up here. It's real sad when I'll opt for the Paradise Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-cafe-las-vegas) before throwing any additional money or wasting comp dollars on any of the aforementioned establishments. 

Though nightlife plays an important role at most casinos, this isn't much of a strong suit with the Hilton. Their pool attracts folks from time to time during the summer, but it's not much to write about. Tempo Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tempo-lounge-las-vegas) shows a little bit of promise, but the overly cheesy decor and crowd is a real detraction at times.

Many folks have been screaming for a makeover at the Hilton for years. Until the day it gets one, it will remain one of the lower tiered properties among Sin City's eclectic collection of casinos.",2011-11-27 08:55:23

When I used to live in Woodbridge, there were a few other seafood depots that served up comparable quality seafood at half the price.  Not that price should really be a deciding factor when you're talking about fresh seafood but I find it irksome that people blindly trust shops like this to carry the best just because they charge top dollar.  

I've bough fish, oyster, lobsters...etc and they've all been ok.  Not outstanding.  Now that I'm older and more discerning, I'd rather spend my money in specialty shops that do a few things really well, like Star Lobster and Taro's fish.

Went here for lunch on Friday 12/31..... it's not great but not bad. I went in with a bit of trepidation since I had read the Yelp reviews... and they are a mixed bag of good and bad. 

Setting: About 1/3 of the tables had people at them.... so not crowded. 

Menu: Good selection of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, entrees. 4 stars on selection. 

Service: Our server was very nice and attentive. BUT... and this may not be his fault... but the bar and kitchen seemed to take longer than expected to get our orders out which seemed odd considering it didn't seem all that busy. 

Food: Ordered Puffy Tacos for an appetizer.... and you get 3 good-size tacos that could easily be a regular meal... in fact, I wouldn't suggest ordering anything else with them if you plan on eating all 3 by yourself. These were fantastic and I'd go back for these. 
Puffy Tacos = 4 stars 

I had the Veggie Chopped Salad which was very fresh... and crispy... I like my veggies crispy and I wanted something light knowing that I would be eating heavier for NYE... and I was not disappointed with this salad. 
Veggie Chopped Salad = 4 stars 

The husband had the Lobster Sandwich with fries.... and I took a bite of each.... YUM! 4 stars 

The FIL had the Tuna Wrap with Sweet Potato fries.... I tried the sweet potato fries... not super fantastic... but would give it a 3.5 star rating and the FIL said he liked the tuna wrap which was a hearty size. 

The MIL had the Grilled Cheese and Soup meal.... the grilled cheese didn't look that great (she liked it though).... and the Lobster Bisque tasked like the cream or something was burnt or off... it had a really strange (not pleasant) after taste.... so she sent it back and got a side salad instead which took longer than it should have. 

Price: Medium.... not cheap... not expensive. 

Overall: I'd go back... just to give it another chance. And to have more Puffy Tacos. :)",2011-01-03 19:34:25

Cole slaw, also no flavor, however my fries we good, not hot, but good. My server stopped by to check on things and left my bill. I immediately put my cc in the holder and waited for my server to come back. Finally she returned, took the bill and cc and dropped it off to the cashier. I watched the cashier complete the transaction and place my cc and receipts directly behind her on a ledge. There it sat, and I waited for my server...and waited...and waited...never to return, honestly. I went up to the cashier and told her that was my cc and receipts behind her, and thankfully she asked me for ID to make sure. I signed and left 20% gratuity for the ""ghost server"" anyway.

       - Cheap - I love Chipotle, but this location's service and portion size has been dwindling in months past. It's to the point, I'd rather drive an extra 10 minutes when I'm getting a craving for burritos.
       - Strike #1 - Trying to charge me for double meat when I didn't ask for it and they only gave me the normal amount.
       - Strike #2 - Being so cheap with their portion size as compared to other Chipotle's in town.
       - Strike #3 - Treating their customers like criminals when they screw up and order or forget to give you what you ordered.
**Visit 1**
       - After getting the normal amount of steak I usually get from any other Chipotle, the cashier charges me for double meat.
       - When I told him I didn't order double meat, he had to verify with his staff (since he didn't trust me) and then tell them they'd have to ""talk"" later.
       - This shows me that they are actively trying to lower the amount of meat per portion.
**Visit 2**
       - Ordering a steak quesadilla, the amount of steak on there, couldn't even fit half the quesadilla.
       - When they cut it into 4 pieces, there was a 1/4 of the quesadilla that had 2 tiny pieces of meat on it.
       - I ordered a bowl and drinks as well that day. After I paid, I asked the cashier where my drinks were and she told me she gave it to the person I was with, who had walked to the drink area to get napkins.
       - When I looked over and saw this wasn't the case, I told the cashier. The cashier has to walk around the corner and actually visually see she had not given the drinks to us before actually giving me the drinks.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't really recommend this place. There are many other Chipotle's around town that don't try to cheat you at every turn.",2013-10-20 22:26:54

Angie, Amanda, Anita and Vitra each had the Ultimate Brunch Bundle for $18.99. They came with a Mimosa (they had raspberry) and started with a fruit plate.

Angie, Amanda and Anita had the Grilled Shrimp California Benedict (two Grade A poached eggs topped with house-made Hollandaise sauce, grilled shrimp, double-smoked bacon and house-made avocado salsa on English muffin slices, served with breakfast potatoes topped with their Mediterranean salsa). Amanda didn't want shrimp so got extra bacon instead.

Vitra had a Spinach and Feta Omelette (fresh chopped spinach, crumbed feta cheese slice button mushrooms and diced Romano tomatoes, served with breakfast potatoes topped with their Mediterranean salsa and multi-grain toast).

They ate most of their meals so I'm assuming they enjoyed them.

I didn't feel like brunch so ordered the Red Curry Chicken Bowl (chicken breast, red peppers, green onions, Thai red curry coconut cream, jasmine rice and steamed Asian greens). I got it without the greens (I find they are too mushy).  It's what I usually order at Milestone's and it was good.

When I first walked into the spa, no one greeting me. I had to walk around to find someone to assist me. 

Secondly, my masseuse was horrible. He was a heavier set gentleman and I was actually pretty happy to get him. From my past experience, male massage therapist would be stronger and give you a deep massage, just what I did! But I was wrong about him! I told him that my neck and back is really stiff and I would only want work to be done at those spots. He did a horrible job and did not listen. When he massaged me with his hands, I asked if he can go deeper and he said ""I will work up to it"". 15 minutes later, it's still the same pressure. I asked him nicely again if he would add more pressure and he began to throw his elbows on my back. Please keep in mind that he's about 250 lbs and he's about 5'8. I felt nothing but flabby forearm on my back instead of his elbow. Now the pressure is lighter than ever! His massaged me with his flabby hairy forearm skin which was uncomfortable.

I've always thought that avocados get on very well with eggs, and the people working at Coca Cafe agree. Hence, the Avocado Omelet, which also includes, jalapeno muenster, apple smoked bacon, and salsa on the side. 

The only drawback was the salsa, which tasted like it came from a jar. I asked the excellent server, and she confessed that it is sometimes made fresh and sometimes is not. Hmmm.

Other than that is was one palatable hulk of an omelet. Another confession the server made to me was that despite her vegetarianism, she can't quit Coca Cafe's bacon! It's easy to see why. 

Filling and flavorsome, this omelette really didn't need anything on the side, but it does come with toast. I decided to break the white bread habit and go with the cinnamon swirl. 

Who needs dessert with this on the menu? Again, like the toast I ordered last time, it was expertly made, as if toast is something that can be expertly made. It was moist, flaky, rich, sugary, and...already buttered. Who else butters your toast for you in Pittsburgh?

I kid. Sorta. 

I even ate my twisted orange slice garnish too. Perfectly ripe, juicy, and sweet, I was reminded of why people consider fruit to be Mother Nature's candy. 

My bill before the tip was $9.90. Dining here will not bust up your budget.
 
Oh, and ignore the bohos, or better let, allow yourself to be amused by them. You're allowed to eat here just like they are. 

Please. Come. And for God's sake, make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy your experience here. This isn't Denny's. 

By the way, I was seated immediately and really didn't wait all that long for my food. I ate here between 10:40-11:15 AM, so maybe it depends on when you visit. 

I just hope they make fresh salsa the next time I stop in. Is it that hard?",2010-09-24 06:16:42

They had a private event which had prevented customers from coming in by locking the doors. & They only unlocked the doors at 11.35pm when the movie started at 12pm. 

Rushed to buy the tickets via the self-service machine and it froze on me the 1st time, and the 2nd time was awfully slow... And half of their self-service machines were out of service. Horrid.

Ticket lady was friendly but didn't point us to the area of our theatre... It IS a big cinema. So we had to find it ourselves, not a big deal really. 

The washrooms were also huge, with a lot of waiting(?) space. It's nice since there wasn't alot of customers anyways :) . 

The theatre itself was small but that was because Warcraft had been out for quite awhile already, hahaha. 

With not much patrons about, it was nice to roam about the large theatre. Other than that, nothing else really wow-ed me.

Around the theatres were a ton of food places like Wild Wings, Subway, Baton Rogue... There is ample parking space and the entrance to the theatre is not anywhere noticeable from the parking lot (just saying). :)",2016-06-21 19:30:06

It was so much fun to be walking north on the strip just past the Stardust(*sigh*) and be able to walk a few feet from the sidewalk of the strip and start playing some blackjack at a table! Those were the days!

Slots A Fun is basically a part of the Circus Circus property. It is a seperate building off of that main casino and just off Las Vegas Blvd. From what I've been able to ascertain, it opened sometime around 1971. 

It is a small, unassuming space. You will find a fair amount of slots, some old school arcade games, and a deli that offers some great deal on snacks! The table games were taken out sometime around 2010-2011 ish. That is a shame, too. That was one of the best features of this place was to have table games within a few feet of the sidewalk. 

I've only been in a few times in the last few years, but every time I go it's a ghost town. There is just no energy to an empty building. 

I honestly think if they just spruced up the space a little bit and brought back the table games, than they would see a lot more foot traffic here. I hope this actually is something they consider one day.

Until than, it is just a lonely and depressing space...which is a damn shame...

I have yet to have the pleasure of coming here for dinner, but I'm a big fan of their weekend brunch. I've celebrated my birthday here and took the day off from work to do so - which was totally worth it. They do not take reservations for brunch, so you have to come and give your name, but I've never waited too long. Even during my bachelorette party weekend, where they said the table for 8+ was 45 minutes, we got seated in 10 minutes. If there is a wait, they have a cute little seating area and usually pastries for you to sample. They have some daily specials, like a quiche of the day or soup of the day. Their quiches are perfectly soft and pillowy on the inside. I'm actually not a huge fan of their chicken & bacon chive waffles, but since everyone else raves about them, don't let my opinion stop you. One of my must orders is a side of fries - though I do wish they gave slightly bigger portions of ketchup and mayo, I always feel like such a classless fool when I have to ask for more. If you're with a larger group of people, the pastry basket is always a nice way to start off brunch as well while your entrees come in. I was so hungover and sick during the morning of my bachelorette weekend, I couldn't enjoy eating here. I sustained myself on ginger ale and their tasty cauliflower soup, while i watched everyone enjoy their mussels and steaks. I did have some of the foie gras that was ordered for the table - amazingly silky, and a big hit with all the Californians. I was so jealous of everyone's enjoyment, my husband and I ate here the next weekend so I could enjoy Bouchon like how it's meant to be enjoyed. I actually prefer sitting inside since it's beautifully decorated. The outside patio is right next to the pool and some bodies are just not meant to be looked at while you eat brunch. Their champagne cocktails are all really interesting, so you don't have to be basic and get a mimosa, there are a ton of other options. One of my favorite things to eat here is actually complimentary - I love eating their warm baguettes with the mustard on the table while my husband prefers spreading jam and butter on it. 

I will  definitely be back here several more times and hopefully get to enjoy their dinner menu soon.",2014-11-26 23:58:29

Because the desserts are made to order, each dessert took about 30 minutes which was fairly long but it was worth the wait. The affogato I ordered was very rich in flavour and with a nice blend of bailey. It was a bit on the pricier side for what it is (around $8), but I never had an affogato before so it was worth it.

I used to order online in the past but i needed one asap, so i googled the brand and one of the stores that carry it was Yummy Market. I went and to my surprise, found my dream grocery store. (If there's a thing as such) 
First, its has a cafe serving Illy coffee. I used to appreciate longos with a starbucks inside the store, and the  that has a cup holder. Here at Yummy, is an actual sit down cafe that serves fresh pastries, espresso, tea and gelato. Why would i not want to be there at 8am on a cold winter day? The americano is calling my name. So ever since I've discovered this gem, it became a ritual for me to get up early and grab a cuppa joe and relax before i shop.
Second, the wall to wall cheese and smoked meats section is the bomb. I've never seen so many options for cheese and meats. 
Third, their produce are fresh and good quality and are not overpriced. They even have black radish! 
Fourth, the meats are of good quality, from chicken to pork and beef.
Fifth, the smoked fish and the pickled veggies. 
Sixth, tons of chocolate choices.
Seventh, fresh breads baked in house
Eight, plain old good customer service. When you ask one staff for help, they actually stop what they're doing and walk you to the correct aisle.

My last visit to Shake Shack was probably my last, at least until after fly season is over. There were flies everywhere.

The flies don't even have to wait in the line like everyone else; they just fly in and start eating. SS really needs to do something to address this unsanitary condition.

Popcorn Chicken Ramen - The popcorn chicken was served on the side to maintain the crunchy texture.  This was a fine touch.  The ramen had good texture and tasted fresh.

One of my vices is that I enjoy an occasional cigar. It's something I picked up many years ago, then took a break from for several years. Recently I've reignited my passion and have found a new love for cigars! I've had La Casa  bookmarked for some time, but couldn't seem to find the right company that would appreciate it like I do, until recently.

The day I visited I was in the area for an early dinner and was looking to enjoy an after dinner cocktail. I didn't know how the atmosphere would be, since it's a lounge and we were dropping in around 6:00 pm. I worried we might have the whole place to ourselves and it would be boring. To my surprise, we arrived and there were at least a dozen other people there all seeming to enjoy themselves.

I knew from doing my research that the cigar selection would be good, and it was. I had a hard time selecting just one cigar, and truth be told I purchased two to take home with me as well and one for myself and my date to each smoke. The price range on the cigars was around $6 - $40, so really there's something for everyone - including a decent selection of flavored cigars for those who are not big on cigar flavor.

I am a total fan of drinking scotch or whiskey with a fine cigar, and La Casa has an extensive selection of each available; many brands they have multiple aging options on hand as well. But I've been on a Moscow Mule kick for a while and couldn't resist trying one here. So my date enjoyed a 12 year Balvenie ($20) and I tried the Moscow Mule ($15). Personally the Mule had too much lime for my taste, and I prefer a Mule with some bitters. It wasn't bad, but it also isn't something I'd order again. I tried the Balvenie and will definitely order that next time... smooth!

We had the rare experience of seeing a small time celebrity there during our visit. We bought him a drink and got to visit with him for a bit. It was an unexpected treat and made our experience even more memorable!

The lounge is filled with comfy leather pub chairs, so there's not an uncomfortable seat in the house. It really lends to wanting to stick around for a while. I can't wait to go back in the later evening hours to enjoy some live music! If you enjoy cigars, and or don't mind the smell of cigar smoke this place is a must try hot spot! I'll be returning soon!",2015-11-02 19:01:30

There's a big grocery, little food court, a tiny electronics shop, tea/ginseng shop, all featuring purely Korean products. The crew who make this place run are very pleasant and very customer oriented.

The main reason I have reviewed this place is because the food court here is worth mention. For under $10 you can get a complete, delicious, and very satisfying Korean meal. I order some pork bone soup or bbq beef for $8 and I get the works. Big bowl, rice, 3 sides including kimchi, bean sprouts and seaweed. One of the best deals IMO.

two bonus reasons I love this place: 1) they have a water dispenser in the food court and they give you a cup when you purchase your meal 2) My meal costed 9.03, I gave $10 and got a loonie as change.",2010-04-27 14:12:00

Inside was quite nice and modern looking. I had called my order in ahead of time to save some waiting, I felt rushed on the phone and figured they were super busy. 

I arrived to an empty restaurant, Italy was playing in the Euro Cup shortly, and to my surprise they were actually super friendly in person. He asked if it was my first time there and gave me a take out menu. We got to talking about the upcoming Euro match and he offered me an espresso at no charge.

I was eager to try this place as previous reviews were quite positive and we like fish and chips and have yet to find a really impressive place to go. After I dug into these thick cut fillets I was impressed the size of the serving was quite good. The flavour was great and not too oily as is the regular issue we have with most places we have tried. The fish was nice and meaty not soggy either, also the batter to fish ratio was spot on. 

There will definitely be a return trip, and it was recommended we eat in as everything would be more fresh and taste even better, which is hard to believe it could because it was pretty good to start.

we shared the beef Fajitas... they were amazing!! grilled on top of bell peppers and onions... red and white... mm served with rice, beans w/cheese, guacamole and a tray of salsa, sour cream and cheese... it was SO good and they brought out your tortillas in a little bowl with a cover to keep them warm.. but they tasted more like pita bread... either way everything was hot and fresh and out in a very timely fashion.. especially since this place was packed...

Chez Gatse sounded promising with a long history and a location just off the main strip.

The owner, who was very nice and who took my call, already had a table set for us in the rather large terrace out the back of the restaurant.

The food was a big let down.  The bulk of the menu could be found in any of your average Chinese restaurants in Montreal.  I had one of the more Tibetan dishes ""Lhasa Chicken"" which was a chicken leg and thigh batter fried and then drenched in a brown gravy.  It was edible, but I wasn't impressed.

His television persona exudes a bit of social akwardness that at times comes off as arrogance.  It is undeniable that his New Mexico flavor profile brings a dimension to food that is beyond good cuts of meat that can be a dime a dozen here in LV.

The duck tacos as recommended by our server were excellent.  The smoky taste of the duck was well balanced with the sweetness of a hoisin style sauce, and then further complemented with a bit of heat.  That is the one thing I have noticed about food here at Mesa Grill.  They add heat without burning your senses but yet retaining the flavor profile of the chile peppers.  Tuna nachos were also very good.

The bone-in ribeye was excellent with a nice spice rub.  I prefer ribeyes when it comes to grilling because it provides a better taste when the fat gets slightly burned. A bit kinky, but delicious.  The side dishes went a bit unnoticed except for the corn with green chiles and cotija cheese.

We first asked for Guacamole and our server asked us if we would like it table-side and if we wanted one avocado or two. We gave him our answer but we were never given our Guacamole.

I was really, really impressed with how delicious it was!  The milkshakes came in adorable glass milk bottles as well.  The Vanilla one didn't taste too sweet at all while the Maple one was definitely sweeter.  My friend was really impressed with it too.

The General Chicken & Waffles were these golden waffles with general fried chicken on top, tabasco-pepper honey to go with it, and vanilla butter. It looked amazing with the fried chicken on top of the thick waffles. I could see the vanilla butter melting from the heat of the fried chicken. While I have had chicken & waffles that are more moist and tender, this General Chicken & Waffles from Old School was still very tasty and solid. The waffles were really thick and easily filled us up!

We ordered two sides: the Mac & Cheese Cobbler and the Smoked Sausage.  The Mac & Cheese Cobbler, as a side dish, was huge!  It could have been a dish by itself due to its sheer size.  It was ""ooey gooey elbows & cheese"", crispen, and buttermilk biscuit crumble.  It was very good macaroni and cheese and very, very cheesy.   I was glad that we were sharing it because there was no way that I could have finished the portion of chicken & waffles plus the Mac & Cheese Cobbler side.

So one day I tried it out and left completely unimpressed. Usually when a place is packed there is something special about it, but obviously I'm the exception here.
After reading other reviews on this restaurant maybe I didn't approach it the right way. It seems the best way to enjoy the place is to order and share a bunch of different plates. I went to my staple chicken souvlaki and my wife had some sort of meatloaf style meal. I didn't have any complaints about the food (although my wife didn't really like the meatloaf as she thought it was very salty), and the service was fine. I do believe they had a good selection on wines, but I'm not a wine drinker so I didn't get the benefit of this.

The reason why I would choose other restaurants over this one is for 2 reasons
1) the tables are set way to close together, and its almost like you are eating with strangers
2) they charge for extra tzatziki (this irks me)

That price can't be beat, especially with its centralized location on the strip. That's probably the one best thing about this hotel. We were upgraded, upon arrival and had a decent view of Bally's and the Bellagio Hotel/watershow. The rooms are fairly new and recently remodeled, so the carpet looked clean, the bathroom was modern and the beds were OK comfy. The air conditioning in our first room was broken, so we had to switch rooms. Our new room had a nice view of the pool area and The Linq carousel, not too shabby and the aircon actually worked. One thing that was annoying was the super weak shower. The water pressure was low in both rooms and this was a huge thumbs down for me. I also noticed that the air ducts were super dirty and very dusty. Yuck! To bad I just noticed this on our last day, but it was nasty. 

The hotel didn't have many ammentities like restaurants and bars. The self parking fee is $10/day and the valet parking fee is $18/day. Besides the room fees there is a resort fee of $34.95 per day.

So we started off with some chips with a mild red, spicy red and a green. All were good salsas and chips warm.  

We got a order of avocado fries. I assume it was the ""full order"" which was just the amount of a full avocado with a chipotle ranch. I thought it was pretty decent version of this dish. 

Fajitas wise, they didn't have steak with shrimp on the menu but we asked if that was possible and they did it for us. You can order a 1 person or 2 person portion so we got a 2 person one. They give you your own beans, rice, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and tortillas and have a shared hot skillet.  

At first I was thinking, ""thats it?"" when I was a few steak strips and shrimp but I was super stuffed. The steak was tender and was cooked to about medium which I appreciated. I prefer things to be not well done, but I know medium rare is kinda hard to do in fajitas. It had a bit of a ranchera sauce (ask for more to dip) The shrimp was cooked well as well.  Peppers and onions had a nice char and seasoned well, no white raw onions or peppers to be had. The beans were a surprise as I don't normally like beans but forgot to ask for all rice. These were flavorful beans though, similar to my moms/grandmas style, similar to that deep porky flavor Leticias has which is the only other place I really enjoy the beans at. 

Service was good. He was friendly, he did our special substitution request with no problem and he was on it with drinks and checking in on us. We also had a drink spill and he got it cleaned up in a jiffy as well. 

It may not be the most loved of places, but it was actually pretty good.

I have always loved the restaurant and it was my go-to place for brunch in Vegas. My last review was 5 stars. However, this time, I invited new guests to enjoy brunch at Mesa Grill and overall, it was an embarrassing and unpleasant experience.

First, one of our guests (a 70 year old Vietnam veteran) was asked to remove his hat (which was a Vietnam vet hat).  I understand there is a hat policy, however we then saw women in hats throughout the restaurant + even a man with a flipped back baseball cap.  If you are going to have a policy and actually ask a guest to remove the hat, at minimum you should be consistent and unbiased in your approach.

Our server was atrocious.  He interrupted our conversation many times, was super confused about our order.  I explained I had a dairy allergy and he insisted on announcing that information loudly and then got confused on another guest's order thinking they had a dairy allergy.  Once our food arrived, he forgot numerous items including maple syrup for waffles, an order of bacon, and delivered sauces to the wrong people.  We literally had to get up a few times to go to the kitchen to ask for syrup while the waffles were getting cold.  We complained to the manager, and they sent us a new server... but never checked in to see how we were doing. 

It was so bad, we finally got up and tried to speak to the manager. The manager was incredibly rude to us and said if we liked the food, we shouldn't worry about the service. This really was the end for us as by now our whole party was upset.

Honestly, the whole experience was so bad, I can tell you I will never visit this restaurant again. It's really a shame as the food is great and I love Bobby Flay, but this has tarnished the whole brand experience for me.

We've made at least 5 visits at this point and think it's safe to write a review now. If you like to grab an appetizer I say go w/ the pretzels and beer cheese- this will work for kids and adults. I've tried multiple burgers, love the beer cheese burger and I usually add blue cheese crumbles to whichever one I go with. I haven't been dissapointed with a burger yet. The wife n kids all like the pizza. It's brick oven style w/ a pretty thin crust and multiple styles to choose from. I've had the pasta dish as well and it was delicious...it was swimming in sauce so if you don't like it that way you may want to say something when ordering. The beer selection is great and I typically go w/ a flight of 5 different options or a State 48 blonde or lager. You can grab a Growler to go as well.

I don't blame myself - who would guess that the Urban Bakery, which sells the usual bakery suspects such as bread, buns, cookies and slices, would also be serving up speciality wood-fired pizzas?  They use their own special whole wheat flaxseed crust and use gourmet toppings like artichoke hearts and smoked cheeses.  They also make a couple different wood-fired sandwiches on their homemade bread.
I didn't know then, but I know now, to go to the Urban Baker to get my pizza fix.  Any day but Monday, that is.  I suffered the fate of going there on a Monday, so no pizza unfortunately.  But I didn't suffer long because I bought a chocolate ganache brownie for $2.14, which turned out to be a heck of a consolation prize.

One negative was that the cafe itself was really small and narrow. The booths are literally 1/2 meter away from the counter/bar, leaving only enough room to walk to or from the entrance/exit.

They have an extensive list of Kentucky Bourbons, plus different scotch whiskey's, etc. They aren't cheap, but if you want to try some Bourbon, this is definitely a great place.  They also have probably 10 craft beers on tap.

Since this is a BBQ place, I got the Pork Sandwich. I thought it was very tasty, comparable to Mac's and other better BBQ places I've been to in Charlotte.

I wish we had been hungrier because it seems like the food is the big star here, but we opted for the pretzel (as always) and the chips, salsa and guacamole. 

The pretzel was fine, not the best I have ever had but not the worst. It came with packets of mustard and a microwave cheese cup. Slightly disappointing for a place with such high reviews for food, but again, it was fine.

The chips were delicious, the menu said homemade and they were certainly good. The salsa was fine, tasted like a jarred salsa, but again, tasted good with the chips. The guacamole was also tasty, so no complaints there.

Between my beer buzz and the waitresses suggestion, we ended up getting the special dessert, apple dumplings. It was actually just one, dumpling. The dumpling was very tasty, but I was thrown off by the apple filling because it was cold. Possibly just a preference of mine though.

The place was pretty dead for a Saturday night, and even more dead in the dining area where we sat, but the waitress was nice and the bar area seems like it would be a good place to hang out, especially for Packer games which, by the decor (LOTS of Packer stuff) I am assuming they broadcast during football season.

I love these self-serve yogurt shops that offer a variety of different choices and an even wider range of toppings, and at a less guilty feeling than the regular ol' ice cream shop.

The store itself is a bit small, and had maybe four tables at most to sit at. You just walk in, grab a bowl, and help yourself. I went with a little bit of the vanilla bean, pomegranate and peach, while the miss' combined key lime with coconut. The vanilla was pretty good, and definitely had more of that ""vanilla"" flavor that you associate with ice cream as opposed to the vanilla flavor you get with plain yogurt. The peach was definitely my favorite and had a nice fresh taste to it. The pomegranate was decent but the flavor was a bit too light and didn't really come out all the way. I also enjoyed my little taste of coconut and key lime, which says a lot since I am not a fan of coconut.

As for the toppings, they had plenty of choices from the sinful (like sour patch kids and chocolate sauce) to the more natural (coconut flakes and fresh fruit.) I topped mine with chunks of kiwi, mango, strawberry, white chocolate chips, and this weird little thing called ""mango bola."" It looked like fish roe, in that they were these tiny, shiny, jellied balls. I wasn't a big fan though as they felt and tasted weird when you bit into them. Just stick to the fresh fruit!!!

Not only do you want to watch how much you put in your bowl so that you don't take more than you can eat, but you also pay by the weight of your bowl. You simply bring it over to the cashier, place it on the scale, and they tell you how much to pay. Simple as that.

This place is very open concept, bright and airy - feel like those loft style condos. 

Their website says it offers free drinks, but perhaps it's Sunday night and there's no drinks available? Anyways, minor issue which can easily be fixed by water cooler and/or tea machine.

Now the haircut, first Hiroki provides sort of consultation with what hairstyle I wanted at the chair - I'm a firm believer that a good hair stylist knows what hair style suits your face and would provide suggestions - which Hiroki did for my hair :) Then a hair wash, like other Yelpers have mentioned, it's comfortable washing chairs.

It was delicious ... thin crust but a little chewy with fresh mozzarella ... oh I'm in  heaven and I want to go back!!!

We were so happy with our meal, that we ordered tiramisu for dessert. It was divine ... not too sweet, I wanted to order a 2nd one!!! =)

Definitely stop by on the way -- I think it's much better than Secret Pizza (although, SP allows pizza by the slice but you must order a whole pizza here).",2013-05-06 19:11:52

I would throw an extra star on here if their servers were more attentive and not standing around chatting at the bar.

I noticed the sign along Scottsdale Road that said ""TANNING $19.95/MONTH,"" and thought what the hell, why not? I stopped in one evening, and the guy that helped me was so friendly and explained everything about their tanning beds and prices. This place actually has 12 tanning beds, both stand-up and lay-down, that are not old pieces of junk. They are actually really cool! They have built in radios, and extra functions, and the place is very clean. Their prices make perfect sense too. They have three levels of packages you can buy: a $20, $40 and a $60?( I can't remember the price for the higher one.) and all are good for 31 days of unlimited tanning. They also sell all kinds of tanning lotion, and although I don't really like using that stuff, I know it is expensive, and the guy assured me that they sell it for cheaper than most tanning salons. You don't need an appointment to come in, and there is never a wait.
I am very happy that I decided to stop in here, and I think that more people should know about this tanning salon, since it is kind of hidden in a weird shopping plaza.  SO, if you are sick of paying nonsense ""membership fees,"" ""activation fees"", etc....just drive a little bit farther south on Scottsdale Road and check out One Stop Nutrition!",2011-04-15 02:03:48

First she asks my mom if she wants to try out one of the sangrias and when my mom says she will think about it, she instantly replies saying she will bring one out. 

After our meal she asked if anyone wanted dessert and I said I wanted to try the mini $2.99 lemon dessert. She brought out something totally different so I politely say I wanted the small lemon dessert, again she brings out a large slice of lemon cake. I didn't even bother asking her to replace it since I felt like she was purposely trying to leave me with a higher dollar item. 

When we got the tab I noticed she rang in a higher priced dessert than what I ended up with so I asked if she could correct it, she says they are the same price. I point out that the dessert I got was actually cheaper, she then checked and says oh you're right..

Salami's, prosciutto, cheeses, olives, chutney- it had it all and was the perfect thing to pick at while conversing and enjoying some drinks. If you sit on the patio or at the window, there is some great people watching opportunities too, since you are in the heart of downtown.

My only criticism is how packed it got the evening we were there. It got really difficult to order a drink at the bar and there didn't seem to be any system to make it any easier for the customers.

The pasta primavera was very good, with lots of fresh veggies in a savoury tomato sauce. You could just eat mostly sides and pack your entree to go and then you got two meals out of one LOL!

We own 2 Corgis and decided to go down and see if we could meet her. We brought our older Corgi with us and arrived about an hour before they closed. It was pretty crowded, but it was nice to see that many people were interested in adopting animals. One thing I recommend is to look at their website and know the names of the animals you are interested in, because the volunteers will ask you:
a. Have you looked at our adoptable animals on our website?
b. Do you know which ones you would like to meet?

There were 2 potential owners who were meeting the Corgi when we got there. One of the volunteers told us that we were welcome to wait and see if she's going to get adopted. If not, we would be next in line to meet her. The first lady walked out. The second lady spent a while with her, so we thought she would be adopted for sure. Then, I heard her say ""sorry"" to the volunteer and walked out.

We finally got to meet her and she was very sweet. 7 years old, in pretty good health, but obviously neglected and left on the streets for who knows how long. Her nails were extremely long. I wish they had cut her nails in the first place. But, I understand, they probably have so many animals coming in and not enough volunteers so they must be extremely busy. She also had hair missing from the back of her ears. Possibly from a food allergy or ear infection that never got treated. Looks like she may have gotten into a few fights on the streets because tiny chunks of her ears were missing as well. My guess is, these were the main reasons why the other ladies did not want to adopt her. So sad that they didn't want to give this poor girl a chance! But on the other hand, it is a good thing they walked away. What the NSPCA wants are people who will provide ""forever homes"" for the animals, and if they can't commit to that, the animals are better off waiting for someone who will.

Yes, we adopted her and are now one big happy family! We had a very good experience here. Friendly and knowledgeable volunteers, affordable adoption fees and they even have a play area outside if you want to bring your dogs in and see if they get along.

Lets start with the good:
* Decent salsa
* Good guacamole (a pleasant surprise)
* Warm tortilla chips
* A nice clean, mildly-tacky-but-appropriately-so atmosphere

Now, the rest:
* Margaritas were TERRIBLE. I'm sorry, you can't charge me $10 for a margarita and use a MIX in it! Are you kidding? Simple recipe: Tequila, fresh lime juice, cointreau or Patron Citronge or Gran Marnier or Paulas Texas Orange. This is not hard to do right.
* Crispy shells everywhere on the menu.
* No breakfast tacos offered
* Veggie options were strange. Broccoli? Cauliflower? WHAT? Why not calabacitas? Sweet potato, grilled corn, rajas, nopales, caramelized onion, Mushrooms... Huitlacoche? So many better options than a salad bar shoulder shrug.
* Limited salsas. No mole or tomatillo.

The menu is simple. It's consists of bowls of noodles in broth mixed with shrimp dumplings, beef slices, fish cakes and veggies - with your choice of 3 different types of noodles or the same dishes served as plates - no broth. The simplicity of this place is genius. 

I recently went twice - in less than 24 hours. 

First visit - Saturday evening around 7pm. Kitchen closes at 7:30 but they stay open until 8 selling frozen goods in the last half hour. We sat down in less than 15 seconds. As a first timer - it took me a minute or two to learn the menu. Once conquered - ordered the soup with the shrimp dumplings, beef and veggie (substitute). 

Brother was great - simple yet complex. Dumplings were full, well cooked and salted to perfection. The broth is not salty and this helped balance everything out. The beef was cooked, sliced thinly and delicious. The snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked - crunchy and delicious. 

Second visit: went with 3 friends. Twice as busy as the previous evening but still got a table in less than a minute. Was offered forks upon arrival but obviously declined for the standard chopsticks. 

All friends were super happy. Happy as - I'll let you fill in the blanks. Total bill 4 people - $26. Do the math. 

This place is a gem. Will continue to go back. If you ever have any sinister plans of replicating the broth at home - good luck. I asked the owner of the restaurant for the recipe but she said it was 3 generations old and top secret. I can see why. 

The bowls are cheap. Like really cheap. They range in price from $3 (veggie) to $7 (trifecta of toppings).

Atmosphere: the lobby is always clean and I really enjoy the retro art-deco nuances in the decor.  Also, the location is great- Mesa Riverview is dead compared to AZ Mills or Tempe Marketplace. This may sound bad, but for theater-going purposes it is perfect.  You can fight loud crowds at the malls, or you can enjoy a movie at Cinemark.  I choose the latter.  

Food: better than Harkins. Perhaps I am just unlucky, but Harkins' popcorn is always salted to the point of inedible.  Cinemark popcorn is always fresh and salted perfectly.  The pretzels are soft and warm, and the nacho cheese is served warm (I had a completely cold cheese from Harkins recently- won't make that mistake again).

Most important?  The movies... Cinemark offers a weekly classics series which is wonderful.  Everything from Pulp Fiction to Some Like it Hot.  We always look forward to finding out what they will offer next.  Also, they sometimes offer Hindi films, although only those released in the U.S.",2014-06-23 06:12:06

The pitcher didn't save us any money at all which we all found strange - next time we'll just get our own glass I guess. The Margarita's were good though.

The food was good but the service was so-so...our friends said the service is usually much better and that the waitress may be new since they had never seen her before (we sat on the bar side). I won't really hold the slow service against them too much right now.

I did not like the cupcake place so I was worried that this new bakery would also be overpriced and run by not very nice people. Happy to report I was wrong. 

I love that this bakery offers fresh bread and croissants. But to me, their quiche is the most amazing of all the items. The texture is creamy and reminds me of the steamed egg dish my mom cooked growing up. I highly, highly recommend it. Bakery Phx also offers potato knishes which are really flavorful as well. Lisa also offers several different kinds of bread and I love being able to ride my bike home with a loaf of bread. I think her prices are fair and Lisa is very nice and seems like an accommodating person. You can tell by the baked goods, she's not phoning it in or using any boxed ingredients like the last place. So far, I've tried the quiche, cheese danish, croissants, knishes, breads and a mini cherry pie. All pretty good. I have not yet tried any of the cookies or the Texas-size cupcakes.

I worked up an appetite at Thursday night's Cleveland Yelp Elite Event, so when Cara asked if I was up for a late night sushi fix, I didn't even think about it... my answer was YES!

She told me that Ginko was her fave spot for sushi and after our meal, I can totally understand why.  Fresh, inventive sushi rolls, a warm and friendly atmosphere, and an all around cool vibe... 

Upon walking in, the staff welcomed us with a big ""Irashaimase!""  (I love that!)  I opted for hot tea as I was a bit under the weather, but Cara had a gorgeous looking clementine martini.  Mr Cara (aka Jason) went with hot sake.  We ordered our food family style and everything was delicious!  

We all started with bowls of truffle lobster miso soup.  I'd never had truffle oil or lobster in miso soup before, but I'm a fan of the combo!  Next up was an appetizer with spicy scallops and avocado on Pringles - yes Pringles potato chips.  A unique combo that definitely works!  Following that was a huge plate filled with sushi rolls:
spicy tuna, california sunshine, shrimp tempura, and eye of the tiger.

We were so full after all of that, we had to turn down dessert.  Not sure when I'll be back to Cleveland, but when I am, I would not hesitate to return to Ginko.  I'm definitely a fan!",2012-02-26 02:13:23

So I did some work on my buddy's house out in Brunswick one weekend in exchange for food.  Yes, I will work for food!  I'm not ashamed.  He is Indian, so I was expecting Indian food, but he said I could choose the restaurant.  I asked him if he had ever eaten Cozumel and he said, 'Yes'.  In fact, it's also one of his favorite restaurants.  Game on!

We get to Cozumel in Brunswick and I ordered something different, as I have been trying to do.  Don't get me started on my fajita spiel.  This time, I tried the Pollo Con Crema, or Chicken with Cream.  It had a spicy kick to it and it was good...but, say it with me, 'it wasn't as good as the fajitas'.  Good job, class!

There is a building just south of the park with public washrooms, because sometimes your dog is not the only one who needs to go...

Not sure who decided on that shit but seriously, it's BEYOND annoying.

I worked in mobile for 3 years - I'm not one of those idiots who don't know how to work electronics, especially something as easy as the Apple OS. I still have the same stupid issues now as I did before going to this store. Yeah, everyone is friendly. But they need to train everyone THE SAME. Both in store and through ""apple support"" because this run-around shit is beyond annoying.

I swear, they spit shit out of their mouths half the time. I asked multiple times, ""Isn't the restrictions passcode going to be on my backup? because it says right here 'it backs up settings' and restrictions passcode is under the settings.""
Sure as shit, I was right. Here I am, unable to reset this stupid shitsicle of a device. 

Why the hell aren't users able to see what's ""backed up"" WITHOUT using another Apple device? Maybe I don't want to restore some unknown backup to my iPad. So then what? It's a guessing game that is full of shit.

I don't understand how a company that's so ""above and beyond"" technology doesn't offer something so god damn simple. THIS is why I miss having an android. I can see what the hell is on my memory card and Google backs up shit without me asking.

It's interesting how the new phone and IOS come out and all of a sudden the older devices start crashing. It's almost like it was an accident at first, but Apple now uses it to con morons into buying the new shit-piece.

They text you non-stop when you sign up to be a guest-my sister's experience- and won't talk to you on the phone to discuss pricing..unless you come in to speak with someone. Whenever I go, there seems to be equipment broken, usually the Stairmasters, which btw, is something that is always full even during the slightly busy times.

I realize that I can just come during a really slow time of day but that's not always an option. 

I also use to do the classes but they keep changing how you are able to use those. Before, you could just walk in. Then, you had to get a ticket from the front desk and hand to the instructor. Now, there are these little screens where you sign up for a class and it prints you out a piece of paper to hand to the instructor. This seems like an unnecessary and wasteful change. I used to come to this gym almost everyday but lately I just haven't been feeling it and I go to the one on Nellis. Also, I was at first impressed with this place because there's a daycare, but they don't change your kid if they're in diapers, nor feed them any snacks. Also, they lost my daughters paperwork twice so I had to keep filling out her paperwork and getting her shot records. There's personal information on that paperwork so that really ticked me off and it speaks to the responsibility of people who are supposed to be watching your kid.

We walked into a pretty vacant restaurant, and were seated promptly.  This place is very ""fine dining"" but because it is located in a hotel you get all sorts of tourists.  Lets say Thomas Keller might not approve of a diner wearing cutoffs and running shoes, while choking down a $22 breakfast, but hey, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  My sis and i  both ordered the the breakfast plate that came with  two eggs, potato croquettes, toasted brioche & applewood smoked bacon.  Moments later our food arrived, and my sis took one bit of her bacon, and pulled a face, the food was cold.  We debated just eating it, but if Keller can make oysters and pearls, can he not make bacon and eggs?  We told our server our issue, and she seemed shocked that there was an issue, and returned it to the kitchen.  Our plates came out again, this time they might have been 1 degree warmer.  We didn't want to send our food back for the third time, so we sucked it up.  The manager was very generous accommodating us with a box of pastries for the trouble.

But this restaurant came up with an incredible prix fixe menu for Yelp Spring Break, and my party of six was blown away with the quality of our meal.

Our waiter and the rest of the staff were attentive, although, if I recall correctly, it may have taken a while to get the bill.  Other than that, recommendations were awesome, drinks were always refilled before they went empty, service was prompt, etc... and I really enjoyed the environment of this restaurant as well; just feet away from the casino floor, yet not too loud that you can't carry on a conversation.  Our booth was comfortable as well.

My group chose a bottle of Terrazas Malbec from their plentiful wine selection, although the cocktails looked awesome too.  And before our first course, we requested Brand's infamous cast-iron baked dinner rolls, which were doughy heaven!

The best part of the experience, aside from the company, were the courses that followed.  Be forewarned though: portions are huge!  I had a wedge salad to start, the Chilean Sea Bass as my entree, and I shared sides with Katie B: the creamed spinach and the asparagus.  Everything was delicious!  I think I was in a food coma half way through my entree, but I managed to almost polish off my Baked Alaska dessert as well!

Others in our group were also pleased with their selections: Filet Mignon, Chicken, Tuna Tartare, and more.  

Time to start watching my diet again now that Yelp Spring Break is over, but I'm sure I'll be ready to dine at Brand again next visit to Vegas.  It was a memorable meal for sure and I highly recommend a visit if you find yourself on the hunt for a steakhouse in Vegas!",2012-05-26 22:44:06

This is what we got:
Regina: pizza with red tomato sauce, basil, and I switched the buffalo to smoke buffalo cheese. This pizza was really good with the smokiness of cheese adding an excellent touch.

Salsicca: pizza with red tomato sauce, Italian sausage, mushrooms, garlic, basil and mozzarella.

Brushetta: tomato and herb mixture served with bread. We weren't a fan of this one. I make this at home and die for it but this recipe was not our favorite. The bread has excellent flavor though.

Tiramisu: To my dismay this, like the brushetta, was not very good. The flavor was alright but it was actually watery tasting/texture. A bit unexpected compared to what we were expecting from ones we've eaten in the past.

So although the food wasn't perfect, the pizzas really were very delicious. We highly recommend everyone to try them out. Not only are they pleasant folks but their passion for their food shows. Can't wait to grab another slice and try another dessert.",2014-11-09 22:06:27

Our entrees were lamb vindaloo, eggplant curry (bartha), and a shrimp dish. Not spicy enough for my tastes, but decent. What they lack in flavour Waterfalls makes up for in presentation.  

Obligatory Title Pun: FALL in love with this classy option in Kensington.

Menu Readability: Divided cleanly into apps, entrees and desserts.

Although their menu consists of a good selection of skewers (chicken, seafood, vegetables), I wanted something a little more filling for my lunch, so I decided to go with the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. It was nothing special. I did like their Garlic Teriyaki sauce. However, I felt that they were a bit stingy with the chicken. Looking at a copy of their menu that they gave me, I noticed that you can order extra chicken, but that would cost an additional $1.95. Also, the two pieces of broccoli that was in the bowl was rock hard, I couldn't even bite into it!

I also ordered the Strawberry Slushy, which was very good and not overly sweet. It was served in a boba-like drink cup with a sealed lid. Just perfect for the hot weather we've been having lately!

The employee who helped me was very friendly. He asked me how I heard about the restaurant and I told him that I saw their signs a few days ago as I was driving by.

I finally managed to flag down a server and ordered the veggie omelet which the server told me came with toast and gave me a choice of bread.  Twenty minutes later, my omelet arrived sans toast.  When I inquired about the toast the server looked confused and went to the kitchen where it apparently took another ten minutes to toast some bread.  The omelet itself was very disappointing as they had sauteed the vegetables in an excessive amount of grease and then cooked the egg separately so that the greasy veggies were simply set between the folded egg rather than being cooked into the omelet as normally done.  Additionally, a slice of unmelted cheddar cheese had been placed with the veggies.  Definitely one of the worst veggie omelets I have ever had.

Some of my friends write the best stuff about carne asada, amuse bouche, foie gras and other gastro-porn delights (if there can be gastro-pubs, then there can be gastro-porn).

When my buddy, Hotdish, wrote a glowing review of Sonora Mesquite and their carne asada, I knew that I needed to try it out myself!

Really, it's not like I'm just following Joel around, eating lunch where he eats lunch, having drinks where he has drinks, going to the movies where he goes to the movies...well you get my drift...it's a complete coincidence that I just happen to show up at the same places at the same times!

I follow lots of you around...via Yelp (so you don't need to be too worried that I'll show up at your respective houses).

But you could frankly do worse than to stalk Joel and eat at the places he recommends...the man finds some gems and he really knows his victuals!

So I got the restraining order quashed and headed out to Sonora Mesquite for some of the best food I've had (and I've had some good stuff, believe you me).

I've been back 3 or 4 times since I first dropped by and it's so damn cute...Selena, the owner, greets me like a long lost son every time...and she never remembers that I've been in before!

That cracks me up!

Selena is like my wise Latina mom (well, except for the fact she's younger than I am...and I'm not really as Latin as I look in my profile picture)...she is so sweet!

And...she makes everything from the carne asada and barbacoa to the charro beans, salsa and guacamole, herself...fresh...from scratch...every day (BTW, the folks at the Mission need to drop by and get a Guacamole making and pricing lesson from Selena...$1.50 for the same size side of guac that costs $15.00 at Mission...and isn't as good...maybe you're paying to watch it made at Mission).

It's hard for me to recommend any one thing...the taco's are sublime, the quesa's are wonderful, the charro beans and rice are among the best in town...the carne asada is (as Joel testified) some of the best around...in short...Sonora Mesquite is a wonderful little find...and heavily in the current lunchtime, retox rotation.

Drop by, say ""hola!"" to Selena and have a taco or a quesadilla...tell her I sent you...she won't remember who the hell I am, but that's OK...she'll treat you like family anyway!",2010-04-18 18:05:19

Each time I've gone, I have loved it more than the last.  For $9.99 at lunch time, you can eat as much of their tasty sushi as you like.  On the buffet, they usually have about 12 or so different types of maki rolls that you can eat.  On the other table, they have sushi, delicious fried calamari, stir-fry, desserts, and other little appetizers and salads, in case you get sick of just eating maki rolls.  They keep rotating out different kinds of rolls throughout the lunch period.  I was surprised on how many different types of rolls they put out.  

Yes, it is pretty much always busy here at lunch time.  Yes, you have to buy individual cans or bottles of drinks (particularly soda and beer).  It can get pretty noisy with all the people, and sometimes it gets a little difficult to get into the buffet lines.  I can never figure out which direction you're supposed to go, which is mildly chaotic.  Even when they first open, there's often a line outside the door waiting to get in.  Sometimes, when it's really busy, you have to wait a few minutes before the servers come so you can pay your tab.  If you don't mind that, this place is delicious, fast, and pretty cheap for a sushi lunch.

That being said, I've never been to dinner, so I can't speak as to that aspect.  At lunch time the servers basically just clear plates, which I've never had a problem with.",2011-11-20 02:08:04

Unlike other cities, finding street parking for MTO (right next to City Hall in Downtown Vegas) was a breeze; and only $2 for 2 hours.

We entered to a very cute interior, think modern diner. Turns out that BF knew the manager, Mike, and he seated us and intro'd us to the menu and what's really good (which is truly EVERYTHING). 

Considering it was just the two of us, we ordered quite a lot of things.

Green juice, latte, black ice tea, salmon skillet, tomato basil soup, the Hangover burger, side of (chicken apple) sausage, and complimentary apple donuts.

My salmon skillet was HUGE. I was not expecting it to be that big. Generous portions of lox on top cream cheese on a bed of fluffy dill scrambled eggs and potatoes. I don't normally eat scrambled egg but, this had to have been my favorite part of my meal.

The BF's tomato basil soup came with grilled cheese and he was pleasantly surprised because he still had the burger and fries coming.
I thought the tomato basil soup and grilled cheese on texas toast was the best I've had...I think much better than Nordstrom's infamous soup/grilled cheese combo! The toast alone was delicious and tasted better when I ate it later in the day. The soup wasn't too sweet or basil tasting as others tend to be, which I loved!

THEN, the Hangover burger came out and it was deliciously huge, too. Who doesn't like it B.I.G.?!!!
Fried egg on top of burgers can never go wrong. The bun(s) were toasted which added a little crunch to the burg. Fries were thin and not oily which is always amazing. It was, also, accompanied with buttered sandwich pickles, YUM.

Apple donuts were a pleasant surprise, too. Mainly cause I was expecting a donut type of dough with apple flavors but, it's actually an apple ring with dough and cinnamon & maple syrup around it. Reminds me of a mini apple pie =)

But my first impression was not so hot. We went on a Friday night, it was fairly busy, but seemingly well staffed. Despite the crowd and lack of seating, we were rapidly greeted and given waters and menus. A seat at the end of the bar soon opened up and we felt golden! So we sat there. And sat there. And wondered who of the three men behind the bar was supposed to serve us. Finally, the same person on the floor who greeted us with water picked up on the fact no one had taken our order (that guy was truly on the ball!). 

Drinks: The Manhattan was excellent and reasonably priced. The Almost Home, was fine, but it was $12 and I actually liked the Manhattan better - thus traded with my partner. I'll probably stick with the classics here. 

The biggest issue, the only real-harder-to-solve problem, was that the space is extremely loud when full of people yelling over each other, so the atmosphere was jarring. While beautiful, the high ceilings and tiled walls and floors don't help dampen the noise. Not sure if that can be reconciled.

Really nice wood tables and bar to the side, and on a Thursday around 8:30 we were able to get a table without trouble. Beer menu is stocked with craft brewed options, with Okanagan Lager being my poison of choice on the night which went down well.

The menu is small but just about everything it needs to be. We started with tortillas and cold black bean dip which was even better than I expected it to be. Some people might be scared off of paying $14 for a pound of smoked wings, but the mountain of well seasoned and perfectly cooked french fries make it a fair option as well. I suggest ordering the wings ""skinny dipped"" for a bit of extra crunchiness.
For a main I went with the side ribs which were smoked to perfection and came out plain but they had 3 bottles of sauce at your table to choose from for dipping. I surprised myself by liking the sweetness of the Mango BBQ sauce over the smokey sauce that has actual fryer drippings in it, or the super spicy maple habanero.
The side of beans was amazing, although very spicy (assumably using the previously mentioned habanero sauce)! One of those things were you just want to eat it all at once because they are so good, but also because you want to get through the spice in one pass.
My lady chose the steak frites which she swapped out the frites for Caesar Salad (great choice, you could really taste the smokey bacon in it). The steak was well prepared and had a nice blend of seasonings atop it. Impressive stuff.

(man that was a long sentence....)  I didn't have a specific food category I was searching in, I just wanted to stumble upon a place me and Hubs could frequent.  

I think I might have just found it.  *cue music*

Hubs and I were invited to a work dinner with some of his  work peers and his boss wanted to go to Fran's.  I knew nothing of Fran's....never heard of it...and didn't even know where it was. His boss didn't even say anything like ""oh this place is awesome"" or ""you're gonna love this place"".  Just told us where to be and what time.   My expectations were LOW.  I just knew that  we had to go because it was for work.  We pulled into the parking lot and when I saw the establishment I was really glad my expectations were already set low.  I kinda sighed and thought ""great...it's going to be like bar food with bar fries and saggy bar hot wings.  gag.""

Boy was I pleasantly surprised. 

Inside, it's like a totally different atmosphere.  I thought ""hmmm this place is cute on the inside....""  It was basically just my table and about 3 other couples that were there.  It was a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy at all. It's small though. We had a table of 8.  We had several rounds of the appetizers that was ordered by Hubs' boss.  Even though everything that was ordered was all FRIED, I still wanted to try it.  There were these corn fried hush puppy things that I couldn't get enough off.  I can't remember what they were called but my lawd....it was good.  Then I tried these bacon wrapped tatter tots...what the?!  LOL!  Everything is better with bacon apparently.  YUM.  Then I caught a glimpse of fried pickles.  O.M.*chewing* I LOVE *mouth full of pickles* fried pickles.  I apparently looked like an addict shoving those in my mouth by the fork full.  I haven't had fried pickles in a long time and these were fresh, hot and crispy.  My mouth is watering just typing about them.  I then had the french fries which were ok.  I'm not a fries lover...but they were good. A bit soggy but good.   Now in a food carb coma (and a good one at that)  I had to order an entree.  The menu has  only been out for a week now.  And the waitress was extremely knowledgeable already.  I asked about the lighter food menu options and she was so helpful.  I had the muscles in white wine garlic sauce.  They were off the chain!!! (is that still a cool slang term?) wanted to jump in my bowl and bathe in all that garlicky wine sauce.  mmmmm.  
The wine list was not huge HOWEVER they had some really really good wines on that list.  Local beers from Birdsong as well.  My hubs' boss told me the story of Fran's background and who Fran is.  It made my experience even that much better and I can def tell that she loves what she does all because of the food.  Prices were really not that bad.  Sure a burger on a giant pretzel roll will cost you $8 but it's worth it.  That's what Hubs got and it was delicious.  I will pay money for good food.  It's good quality food and the prices are not extremely high.  Wines were about $6-8 a glass and it was a GOOOOD wine.  mmmm...

I can't add any perspective from a cost or payment standpoint since I was not the organizer, although I imagine this place is not by any means cheap. But that all said, this place impressed me so much I felt it was warranted to provide a review.

The Palais Royale has an interesting backstory, going back to the 1930's when it was a concert venue. From those days of Duke Ellington's big band sound, into the 90's and 2000's when this place hosted bands including Blur, Blue Rodeo, and even the Rolling Stones.
Admittedly the last time I stepped foot in the place was in the late 90's for a rave. And let me assure you they renovated the heck out of it, and now offers a clean and polished venue for weddings and corporate events. 

Upon arrival, the couple were having their wedding ceremony on the back patio, which overlooks the lake, with a marina to the east and a beachfront to the west, and a skyline decending down the waterfront. Very picture-esque, and a great backdrop for pictures. They had a large tent to make sure that even if it rained, all would remain as scheduled.
After the ceremony they held a cocktail hour outside before ushering everyone inside for the reception. The food was top form. Delicious and well presented. The servers and bartenders were friendly, professional, and attentive. Dancefloor is a good size with good sound and lights, so after the speeches were made everyone was given an opportunity to cut a rug with good results (okay, this part may have had more to do with the crowd in attendance than the venue, but still, a decent dancefloor environment was provided).

Honestly, this was the best wedding I've ever been to, and the venue had a lot to do with it. For anyone looking for a review from an average attendee, let this be your stamp of approval that this venue will impress those attending your future events.",2016-06-09 19:52:44

When I went there during those monthly sidewalk sales that often interests me, I found out that there this cafe opened, I really wanted to try it out.

Going into the cafe, I am quite pleased about the atmosphere mixing Japanese with Western design that was affected in the place. The ambience and vibe that I am getting felt like an actual cafe, from the soothing music to how relaxing it is when the restaurant was completely emptied during the afternoon. It's really a place like Italian restaurants, that it seems to fit into the romantic crowd not really for families. The place even has live music or what I assumed when I saw a small stage with a drum set.

I was disappointed that I did not go here on the weekdays as lunch specials were only on those days. I ordered the Napolitian which is spaghetti with sausage, small bits of onion and nigri (seaweed) including half a slice of garlic bread and salad with a putrid sauce that I did not like. It costs about 10 bucks and I was actually good while it was kind of oily and the seaweed had left a foul aftertaste plus there are only a few slices of onions, it was still a relief to eat it. 

One of my friends had ordered salmon with spaghetti which was even worse; the salmon tasted bitter (it almost tasted like it wasn't fresh which is a damn shame considering there is a supermarket next to this freaking place) and they did not remove all the bones which completely destroys the dish. 

However I did have a good time at that place considering it was nearly empty but to my surprise the service wasn't that great for a cafe with Japanese staff. I mean I get more customer service in the freaking supermarket with the staff there being polite but the waitress/hostess or whatever did not ask, at any moment if my dish was alright although she did refill my water. 

I might try this place again if I am craving for Italian-like dishes but I did not like the fact that some of these dishes were served with seaweed on the top.",2012-06-22 00:22:57

In my opinion, producing good solid breakfasts isnt exactly rocket science so most places that specialize in it usually get a pretty good ranking from me.  Even with my modest expectations, my visit to Egg Works was a pleasant surprise. The menu was varied, the portions generous and the service crisp.  

After just getting destroyed by some octogenarians at the 9am bingo session, I decided I need to assuage my wounds in some eggs and potatoes.  I had been meaning to try Egg Works so after inviting my mom to come with me (hey someones got to pay after the drubbing I took) we entered the surprisingly rustic and charming restaurant for a late breakfast,  My mom instantly loved the bucolic decorations and I loved the big plasma tv's playing the World Cup games.  Distractions aside, we both commented on the wonderfully large menu and were impressed to even see ethnic Hawaiian and Mexican options.   

I opted for the Sunrise Special which was essentially a greek omelet with feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  Accompanying the omelet was breakfast potatoes and my choice of their famous banana nut muffins or toast.  Wanting to kick it a tad more old school (with the bingo I was certainly kicking it old, old, old school), I opted for the toast.  Mom had the eggs benedict which she found to be exactly what the doc ordered.  As for my omelet, it was perfectly fluffy with the right balance of filling.  The potatoes were seasoned and plentiful however, they looked to be frozen and not freshly made.  I love fresh homefries and this was a slight disappointment.  Otherwise, by the end of meal I was full and ready to wash the dauber stains off my hands.  

Overall, Egg Works is a fun, neighborhood breakfast joint.  Its larger than meets the eye which Im sure helps move crowds on the weekends.  Service was consistent and friendly and the prices were very reasonable, especially given how much food each dish seems to contain.  Both our meals were in the 9 dollar range and there were few things that really exceeded that in price.  They also are open for lunch and have a selection of salads, sandwiches and burgers.

It's always busy and at peak hours you might actually wait a few mins for a table. As soon as your seated however, miso and green tea arrive to great you. The menu is quite typical and priced moderately to slightly higher than other joints on the block. 

The salad is delicious, that dressing tho :P so tasty. If you dig fatty green fruits, the avocado salad is easily worth the $5.50. It's a meal sized portion accompanied by a small bowl of their house dressing. *They have lunch specials starting at $6.99

The fish is always very fresh. The Salmon is buttery in its raw state and tenderly flavorful in its teriyaki form. 

One thing to note however, is this restaurant seems to emphasize rice in their meals. Their white rice is billowy and wonderful but I prefer my maki with a higher filing to rice ratio. As well, their Bento box has a huge 2 cup serving of that carby goodness, but personally I'd go for half the rice, and maybe get some cooked/stirfried veg in there.

Overall, if I'm looking to sample some appetizers and have a couple extra bucks to spend I'll come for the good quality food served up by this popular sushi joint.",2014-01-31 04:58:25

The hours are convenient, open 7 days, until 9pm during the week.  I have been coming here for years for convenience, and sadly my health has suffered as a result. 

Long story short, I went here for pre-op testing - I needed medical clearance for a scheduled surgery. The doctor told me if there was an issue with my tests, anything to prevent my surgery from going forward, they would call. 

THEY NEVER DID. 

14 hours before my surgery my surgeon/podiatrist calls to cancel my surgery. She received the fax from Urgent Care clearing me, but the individual test results clearly indicated I SHOULD NOT have been cleared. She called & spoke with the Dr who cleared me, wanting to know WTH was he thinking?!?!!!! clearing me with those results. 

Thank God my podiatrist, Dr Nicole Delassandro is as thorough as she is. Thank God she's more of a doctor than the ones who work here. If she weren't thorough & reviewed my test results herself, if she just took the word of this Urgent Care doctor...I could have died on that table!!

If you value your life & health, don't come here. 

ALSO....MediCare beneficiaries pay attention. If you have an auto accident, they will tell you they can't bill for services & you have to hire an attorney to be seen on a lien OR have MedPay on your auto policy.

All the flavors of the Fender Bender just blend. Now... I did get mine without the mushrooms. Remember? I don't like woogly shit in my mouth. Perhaps it may have elevated the burger, but I'm sure it was just as good without. I could taste everything. The saltiness of the cheese, the spices from the chili, the mild yet subtle taste of the coleslaw and the simply seasoned meat. I like that the chili had chickpeas in it. Interesting. 

The sweet tots were good. I wasn't really feeling the mildly flavored maple syrup? It didn't really add to the flavor of the sweet tots for me. Just wasn't hittin it. I settled on a mixture of mayo, mustard and ketchup to dip them in. 

The shells and cheese were good the first bite. But then I took a second bite thinking, ""this reminds me of something"". Third bite, ""I feel like I had this before"". Fourth bite, ""maaan this is like Velveeta box mac and cheese"" Nothing wrong with it, it just didn't stand out. 

Now I would have been satisfied if I could have gotten a coke float. I didn't need it but I wanted it. 

Service started out great. One of the recommendations from our person was the Fender Bender, and I appreciate it. I really do. But then service was a bit mucky. 

I told him I wanted the mac and cheese to try now but will take home. He asked me before he left if he could just put it in a to go container. I said that's cool. He comes back with it in a bag with the mac in a container talking about something like I put it in the container and didn't know if you cared but it's in there anyway so ""that's what you're going to get""... not with an attitude or anything but I thought it was weird to say that. 

Anyway fast forward to eating our food. Someone else checked on us which was cool. Then the guy checked on us which was cool, but this was all like maybe after I took a couple bites of my burger. Now I don't need someone coming to the table all the time, but all of a sudden I see checks on the table as I was getting through with my meal. Sooooo... I guess no dessert? He didn't ask if we needed anything else. Perhaps I should have put in my coke float when i was ordering everything else??? No float for Tieren... --- {insert sad face}

Also, the entire time I'm drinking an Arnold Palmer. I asked for a to-go cup for my drink. Normally at other restaurants they just give me a cup with a fresh drink in it. He doesn't. No biggie. However, when he put my drink in the to go cup I asked for a top off. He pours tea in there.... I wish you could see my face now.. Yea um I had an Arnold Palmer. Now it's just mostly tea. 

Whatever. He seemed pretty rushed from the beginning to the end. I feel like there was a enough balance of him recommending the great burger I had to checking up on us once to a couple of the small things that I'll put a half star loss on him. The other half star was the concept of the sweet tots being just okay. 

But I would definitely go back to try another burger.

I have some very fond memories of kicking back soju here, while chowing down on some crispy fried chicken. 

I have gone back quite a few times over the years and it definitely has not regressed compared to other restaurants out there. In fact its stayed pretty consistent through out the years in terms of food quality, service and food selection. My other half and I got the spicy chicken with fried rice, and soft chicken bone on the side for a light lunch on my most recent visit.

If I had written a review a few years ago I likely would have bumped up the star rating to be honest, but unfortunately this place seems to be in ""a rut"". There are quite a few more newer Korean fried chicken restaurants and their prices actually seem pretty steep compared to some other places (such as The Fry to name just one) that has really upped the competition. Other places have newer decor, a slightly different spin on things, different ban chan (korean side dishes) while Home of Hot Taste has remained stagnant over the years. I havent really seen them offer much, if any new ban chan, or new dishes. 

Hence, I would say that if I were in the area and had a hankering for Korean Fried Chicken, I wouldnt hesitate coming here for a bite. Though I actually would not go out of my way to specifically come here as there are a lot of other options out there. So Home of Hot Taste wont disappoint you, and if you have not been here its definitely worth a try if your in the area.

I will rank the food much better than the Edulis dinner earlier that week.  I ordered the sea bass, which is so fresh and the flesh was so sweet.  Their tiger shrimp is fresh and the sauce was so good that I have to order that as pasta next time.  The tomato base scallops is fresh and sweet.  I use the bread to dip the tomato purée.  Both the seafood pasta and risotto are tasty, with huge portion of seafood in each dish.  Ask for their special chilli oil on your next visit.

I ordered a glass of white wine ($10) and I found the pour too small. After couple of sips I had to start saving it. For appetizer I ordered hamachi sashimi ($18). It was disappointing. It was served on round taco style flat bread. To me, the enjoyment of sashimi comes from tasting the subtle flavours of fish and feeling the texture in my mouth. The hard taco made this impossible. Also, the amount of fish was so tiny I did not feel it or taste it at any point. It made me think of Mexican food, really.

For main I ordered the organic salmon ($23). It does not come with anything other than few tiny greens sprinkled on top of it. I was expecting perhaps veggies or rice or something else to make it filling enough to qualify as a main. The fish was actually very delicious and my favourite part of the meal.

The restaurant from the outside does not look roomy, but once you are in you see that's not true.

I saw on the board their daily special was called an Ajo Grill, so I started to wonder what that was, but took the menu that was handed to me and checked out what other options I had.

Now my daughter, she knew right off the bat what she wanted, cheese enchiladas beans & rice, so when our server came to our table I asked him what the Ajo Grill was, he told me it was Steak or Chicken cut up with peppers and onions cut up on top of a bed of rice served on a skittle grill that came with pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream & tortillas, omg yes that's what I want to order!!

Dinner came, and it was beautifully colored, the red & green bell peppers or orange of the rice, it was very eye pleasing, and it tasted great! I made me some soft tacos with my tortillas and was only able to eat about half of it, but don't worry, it made for a great burrito at home!

My daughter, who turned 21 in June, but was prego and unable to drink, ordered her 1st strawberry margarita, and I giggled when she got carded!

We both wanted dessert, I had been craving Fried Ice Cream, and boy oh boy did their fried ice cream hit the spot! It was covered in chocolate & honey, and who would have thought those were good combos, but omg they were!

The prices are affordable and the options are plentiful.

The orange chicken had great flavor (real orange, not just a courtesy peel on the plate to make you think so).  It was a little heavy on the sauce, but we would definitely order it again.

However, the downside to that is the price - you'll be paying about $14 per person (plus the cost of sodas if you want them).  If this was $5 cheaper, I would've given them 4 stars.  Regardless, it's a fun place to go to.

One of my favorite things about this place is that they just have an enormous selection of different foods.  They have lots of the standard Chinese buffet foods you would expect, but they also have sushi, a few different kinds of buns and dumplings, and then just random things that I would assume are fairly authentic.  I've had pig ears, chicken feet, and jellyfish here, so if you want to try something new or disturb your squeamish friends, you have a lot of opportunity for that.  Last time I went they didn't have any jellyfish out which was disappointing because honestly, jellyfish is pretty delicious.  If they have it while you're there, try it out.

There are generally a LOT of Asian people at Phoenix Palace Buffet, which to me seems like a good sign that this is at least semi-authentic.  Also, they have a gigantic space in their building and have way, way too much seating, so you shouldn't have to worry about trying to find enough chairs and tables for a large group.

One last thing - don't forget to try the lotus seed paste buns.  They're a semi-sweet dessert bun and they're awesome.",2007-12-01 19:11:08

You'd never know looking at the place from the street that housed inside is an incredible Indian spot. Copper is basically in a classic house on the side of East--it looks like a wealthy family would live inside. This makes for an interesting inside-of-the-establishment: you're basically sitting in a converted dining room, living room, library, etc. There's a bar there, and it looks like it's where the den used to be. Again, though, this is a nice old building, not some crappy shack. I'm  not doing it justice. The bar isn't a great scene, though: kinda small, not too crowded. Just so-so. Go for the food. 

It's amazing. The samosas are particularly great, and we always order the Chicken Tikka Masala, which we order spicy (always).

As I walked in the restaurant I found the decor was very warm and comfortable.  The menu wasn't too big which I like. The tables were kind of close to each other I was fine with it but some may feel a little crowed. The advantage with tables so close is that I can easily check out what others are having.
Things I liked:
*Wasabi butter, celery root oyster which was very refreshing.
*Lobster wrapped in Kim Chi, if you like Kim chi you will need to try it and the foam was delicious.
*Foie Gras with corn meal and pickled carrot was excellent. Great contrast with all the parts of the dish.
*And I loved the Honey toast with mascarpone ice cream. The toast was nicely brûlée and the ice cream was smooth and creamy but not too sweet.
Things I didn't like:
*Oyster shiitake mushroom and lap cheong vinaigrette - I love shiitake and lap cheong but with oyster just didn't work for me. They overpowered the oyster.
*The dinner took over two hours. Not sure why. The next table came at least 30 minutes behind us but their dishes seemed to be arrived about the same time as mine. Our server was fine but she seemed to struggle to keep up with all her tables.
*Beef Kafta - actually everything of the dish were good except the beef. The beef just didn't have a lot of flavor.

Pretty far, considering we live in Las Vegas. Quiet area. 

Washed by power water by two people. One spraying, one scrubbing the sides and tires. Hand dried. Vacuumed. Carpets cleaned. Vinyl wiped down inside and outside. 

Whole process took approx 30 minutes. It was a super windy day, so took longer than expected (they said). its understandable. 

Free air freshener ! A few sprays from their fruity Febreeze can ! :P

I must say that the Keg is not my favourite restaurant.  But I have never been to this location.  I must say ambiance wise I was pretty impressed.  It looks really nice and not chain like inside.  A place where you wouldn't be embarrassed to take a date.   In fact we saw a lot of early daters in this place.  

Pretty big with a nice lounge/bar area, this place can accommodate a large group quite easily.  The service we had was great.  We decided to have a few starters and some drinks.  We had the sliders (not bad); calamari - pretty decent; and the baked garlic shrimp - pretty yummy...but what happened to the rest of the shrimp??  For the price you pay I would have thought I would have gotten twice as many, but there were only 5 shrimp.  Yup you read right 5.  Five.  Cinq.  5.  Overall the food is overpriced which is why I'm giving it 3.5 Stars.  

I was also impressed with their drinks selection!  This would be a great place to grab drinks and chill after work.  Skip the overpriced food, feel lush in here with a dirty martini and bitch about the boss.  Ahhh..what could be better?",2015-09-18 01:58:21
h9TQ9W3kbytX1A44WCRtCA,-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,oLb3-eXUFtCFJl2DuBhcvA,2,2,0,0,"This is a newer Hampton Inn and is quite chic for a limited service hotel, it's also a far, far cry from your Fairfield Inn's or Holiday Inn Express type of hotels.

The rooms are pretty awesome!  The little foyer area as you enter the room is tiled and connects you to the amazingly large bathroom with stand in shower and large granite top vanity.  The closet located just outside of the bathroom is a little small, it can hang maybe about 6-8 items perfectly.  The bedroom area was great and well decorated.  IMO, I think the interior designer of this hotel must really like DWR, Z Gallerie and those type of furnishings.

Each morning, they host a complimentary breakfast, which is really an upgraded continental.  I wasn't a fan of it but, no complaints really since it's complimentary.  They had your basic breads, bagels, muffins, danishes, cereals, fruit, make your waffle, eggs and one meat, coffee, juice, milk and tea.  The bread products were cold and when the hostess would replenish them, they literally were just out of the freezer.  The coffee wasn't the greatest but had caffeine which is all that mattered to me.  One day they had a ham and scrambled egg mixture going on, which was tasty but the next day, it was dried scrambled eggs and paper thin bacon on the side.  Again, it's complimentary, it's not designed to satisfy your morning appetite, much less your palate, but, it'll get you through the morning.  We ended up only eating there the first 2-mornings out of the 5-mornings we were there.

Okay so it's going from excellent to good to bad, it eventually had to happen.  The hotel is literally next to the runway of LAS.  You can see the runway, from our room at least.  You don't hear the planes landing as much as you hear and feel the thunder of the planes taking off.  The first night, I literally woke up to the rumble of a plane taking off at 12:40am, probably because our window was vibrating.  No kidding!  We asked the front desk agent the next morning, who BTW wasn't all that pleasant, but seemed like she had a scripted answer to the ever popular question.  We were unpacked anyway and didn't want to move so we just went to CVS and bought ear plugs, which DID help.  However, we were in an odd number room, facing the back.  I have a feeling if you got an even number room, facing the front, the noise isn't as significant.  Not sure why the front desk agent wasn't so proactive in trying to make us happy, the hotel wasn't full or anything the whole time we were there.

Overall, it's a nicely furnished hotel.  The service might be a little iffy.  But it's just too close to the runway for me to comfortably stay there again.  But, the concept and design of this newer hotel sure made me appreciate Hampton Inn's much more!",2011-01-05 05:33:55

Stick to more ethnic dishes and you'll usually be fine; if you don't know what those are, I would suggest first eliminating the typical Americanized dishes like beef and broccoli or whatever. 

Noodle soups (e.g. beef), rice noodle, pork chop or ground meat rice dishes, and Taiwanese veggie dishes such as bamboo shoots are all quite good and cheap.

They also offer drinks such as bubble tea and smoothies, but cannot compare to Rose Tea in my opinion. Finally, the service sucks and the lady at the counter will often ask if you have cash if you try to pay with card first (just say no if you prefer not to pay with cash).

Anyhoo....Kaya was our fallback dinner spot.  It was pretty empty, but then it was a Monday and it was only 4:30 so that wasn't a bad sign.  Or was it?  Our movie-star-handsome-waiter highly recommended the Jamaican green curry.  I LOVE curry!  It came with saffron rice.  I LOVE saffron rice!  They could make it with shrimp.  I...well, you get the picture.  Both my dining companion and I ordered the curry - how could we go wrong?  Fail.  It was acceptable.  Period.  No punch of heat, although I'd ordered it hot.  The veggies were cut oddly with huge chunks of carrots and tiny pieces of green beans and cauliflower among other veggies making for hard carrots and the rest of the veggies overcooked and soft.  So disappointing.  My dining partner tried hers, but didn't even eat it.  Not wanting to hurt the waiter's feelings, she had him pack it up and then tossed it in the trash outside.

Their meat quality is top notch and you get large portions. Oysters were fresh along with their seafood. Their filet cubes was one of the best I've had.

For our first date my now boyfriend said I could pick anywhere in the city so I turned to a seasoned local for suggestions and Soul was the perfect choice. I love the concept of the tapas bar where everything comes out as it is ready. You can linger over plates and rest assured they are as fresh as possible and haven't been sitting under a light while the rest of the meal cooks. If you particularly enjoyed a plate, or are still hungry you can easily order more. As a first date spot it is trendy with delicious and very strong cocktails, and allows you to review important sharing attitudes. Does he give you the last sashimi taco? These things are important in a potential mate! 

Next time I go I think I am just going to order several plates of the sashimi tacos.  They are beyond amazing marinated raw tuna in a fried wonton shell. Hands down my favorite dish in Charlotte.  Their sushi rolls are all tasty and reasonably priced for the size they provide. The pork in their pork belly tacos is super tender and the sauce on it is perfect (though I remove the watermelon from mine it just doesn't work for me). If you are feeling adventurous the bone marrow and toasts is a great flavor combination. 

Soul can be affordable or it could be pricey. Their sushi rolls are large so you could make one a dinner if you wanted. The price spikes rapidly when you order several plates, or just one more of your favorite. The cocktails are about the price you would expect for the area, but they are shockingly strong. So in the end I actually think they are quite the deal. 

Everything I have tried at Soul has been so delicious and the staff is very friendly. The only complaint I have with Soul is the wait time is underquoted. If you go during the week it shouldn't be too bad but last time we went was on the weekend and we were quoted an hour wait, but it took two full hours to get to our table. Being off by an hour is a pretty huge miscalculation. Only for you, Soul, will I wait so long for a table.

First of all.. best practice fields. You can catch home run balls from minor and major league players, which is super fun! There normally aren't many people, but since Kansas City won there were a lot more people. 

The parking is super easy and convenient, also it is FREE which is great. 

I always enjoy to sit out in the fields on the grass because tickets are cheaper and its lots of fun. Bring blankets and food and you are set! 

If you sign up to be a Designated Driver at the beginning of the game, you get a free drink, which is really nice on a super hot day.

Thankfully none of them looked like they were on Steroids and UNthankfully none offered any inspiration, neither from their Physiques nor style of performance, intensity nor efficiency!

The rest of the equipment ranges from A-OK to almost worthless, so what, it will do, Because you have the opportunity to to train the Largest Muscles in the Human Body on this one ""Machine"" (Hammer Strength V - Squat) probably Designed by Gary Jones (the late Arthur Jones, Son)!

Like, David S. mentioned, their froyo definitely has a mousse/whip consistency, but I wasn't a fan of it at all; It was just too strange for me and I didn't feel like I was eating frozen yogurt. I normally don't get any toppings, so all I had was the full flavor of the yogurt I got, which I wasn't very fond of at all. They were both sour, but not in the tart way that I like and, other than the sour taste, I felt like the flavors were pretty bland. The three smoothies that I got were more like slushies rather than ""real fruit smoothies.""

We ordered some brisket, chicken, sides we got Mac n cheese and potato salad. The food came with cornbread muffins. For dessert we ordered a banana pudding and a peach cobbler. The brisket was amazing. Super moist and tender. The bbq sauce is really good too. The pulled chicken was good, not as good as the brisket. It was a little dry but with the sauce still good. The Mac n cheese was decent. I cook so I'm use to homemade Mac n cheese but it was decent and the potato salad as well. Definitely better than most sides I have tried at bbq spots. The cornbread muffin was also good. Now let's get to the dessert. Terrible. Both the banana pudding and the peach cobbler. Possibly the worst I've ever tasted. I was surprised because the food was good. So I expected the dessert to be the same. Nope don't do it. Naked needs to contract out for dessert. And I have people who make amazing banana pudding and cobbler if they need numbers. Finally I think it's a little pricey. Not too bad but it's a bbq joint nothing fancy and a meal

After reading some less than stellar reviews I felt compelled to jump in and send Caffe Mona some love!

This place is incredibly cute - very European inspired, brick walls, wooden tables & an awesome back patio. Reminds me very much of Birchwood Kitchen in Chicago, which I love! Plus they have a killer location literally right across the street from Children's Hospital. 

The $13.99 prix fixe brunch menu was an exciting thing to find. The only thing that could have made it better would have been knowing it was BYOB before we went. Nothing better with a tasty brunch than a good bottle of champagne, although their coffee was pretty darned delicious.

I started off brunch with a fresh fruit plate and everything served was in season, ripe & juicy. Great start. Then I was served a dish that made my eyes roll back in my head (even without the champs)! The savory French toast topped with house made fig jam, Brie that was super creamy & buttery and Granny Smith Apples was absolutely superb. The flavor combinations complemented each other perfectly and I only shared a couple of bites with hubby & devoured the rest. 

I was totally stuffed when the final item, an apricot jam crepe, was placed in front of me. Sad to say, they should have skipped this item. It was crunchy & pretty flavorless. I couldn't have eaten it anyway, but based on the rest of the meal it just didn't compare.

In terms of the room, it depends what room you get. The regular rooms are no frills 3 star hotel amenities. The bed cover is definitely not a duvet. The TV monitor is dated and so is everything else but if you don't mind this, it is decent. The Flamingo has GO rooms which have much better amenities such as a TV in the bathroom mirror, a Denon stereo system, a flat screen TV, and motorized window screens.

The casino is not really that great. If you are looking for the older crowd who is trying to save a buck by staying here, then this is a great place. I rather go to the other casinos on the strip where the people are younger. The games here typically are older than the ones on the strip.

I just ate at the Paradise Garden buffet earlier today. It was alright I suppose. What I really like about the buffet is that they have cocktail shrimp that is fully peeled. Most places do not peel their shrimp. There is a large variety of food but again, it is alright.

I have been to the pool before, the topless one but it is alright. It doesn't have the party scene like the other casinos on the strip. If you are an older person who is here to drink and smoke, this is a perfect place for you.",2010-09-21 23:49:17

It was stringy and just tasted terrible. That is not how lamb should taste or look. However, the basmati rice and the Mac and cheese were good that came with it. 

Move onto the wings, they were good except they put salt all over the wings. You could literally see the salt on these wings. Super unnecessary and over powering on my lips.

Brunch is served Saturday and Sunday's from 10am - 3pm.  

Camille, our server at the time (yes, I know this must have been a long time ago then) showed us to our seat.  We were supposed to have this basket (Poppy Basket) which sounded delicious of croissants and scones but they were out of scones, and the croissants were left a little bit too long in the oven cause it was beyond toasty.  It was a shame because the butter, jam, and honey were good.  I kept the butter though cause it was good and I love butter.  I love butter on my butter.

For my meal I got the mochi pancakes, I really liked the flavor on it and the berries and sauce kicks it up a notch.  But these were like two crepes then pancakes.  I think half my batter went on someone else's plate.  But I made it even taste better with the scones butter.

I was super duper hamberry so I also ordered the Steak and Eggs, for $18 it might be too pricey but it was good.  Actually it was more than god, delicious.  The sauce that came with it was prefect, I added the last bit of my croissant butter to the steak to melt between the cuts and the gravy sauce.

I was also able to taste the chicken and that is worth getting.  The portions were good and having your fingers sticky to eat it even better.  The ice cream dessert in the end is good, but I know which bakery it came from so there's no going wrong with that and I wouldn't expect anything less.

Happy Hour and Dinner is what makes me a fan.

I've had the lettuce wrap which came with a sesame dressing, tuna deviled eggs, but the winner winner for me was the roasted duck.  Roasted duck is primarily a Chinese cuisine, Kim Chi is Korean, blah blah so I've tasted a little bit of everything.  I needed to push this out since I'm returning for Restaurant Week!

The inside of Nami is quaint with retro fruniture and art mixed in with little cacti in the windowsills and proud displays that they are open to all.

The menu stretches across the wall and features assorted coffee drinks, pastries and a lovely hot breakfast menu. From what I could tell, all of the items are organic.

I ordered a samoan but received a samoan bar instead of samoan donut instead. This was quickly remedied by the friendly cashier. The hot chocolate was also delightful with almond milk, my favorite.

Sure, it's expensive, but I've never had a bad meal (or drink) there.  But, I took an unintentional hiatus from Ocean Club when I got married and had a baby, and what do you know, at least two years have passed... 

So when it was time to choose a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday dinner this past Saturday, Ocean Club it was, and once again, I was reminded how fabulous it is!  While I used to sit in the bar (where there is great people watching including plenty of ""hired help,"" awesome bartenders, and live music), we had the baby with us and a party of five, so we were seated in a back corner... this was totally fine by the way.  They had a highchair for the baby and everything!  

Tyler was our waiter and he was great... the rest of the staff was extremely attentive as well.  My husband, mom, and I went with dirty martinis, and my dad and brother went the bloody mary route.  We were all pleased with the drinks - as mentioned in other reviews, they are indeed pricey, but you get two drinks in one!

Bread bowl - this is worth mentioning as they always have a nice selection of breads and crackers including my favorite: pretzel bread... yum!

Appetizers at our table included two types of oysters, a lobster sushi roll, salads, and calamari.  Hint: ask to split their salads - they are still a decent size when split.  I love their ""Ocean Club House salad"" - It could possibly be a meal in itself as it has crisp lettuce, fresh shrimp, egg, blue cheese, tomato, and onion.  The other apps were delicious too.

For my entree, I split the Chilean Sea Bass with my husband... I'm a huge sea bass fan and this is up with there with some of the best I've had.  Again, splitting it is great as even a half serving is plenty once you add family style sides, etc...  My parents went with lobster tail and brother had a bone-in ribeye.  We chose the roasted brussel sprouts and signature lobster mashed potatoes (both cooked perfectly and oh so delicious as well).  Note that it's very difficult to choose just a few sides as there are so many to choose from and they are all delicious.  The sweet potato fries, onion rings, creamed spinach, and steamed broccoli are other faves that I've had in the past.  

As if any of us weren't full enough, Tyler brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake for the birthday girl, served with fresh whipped cream.  Mmmmm.... and once we licked that plate clean, we also ordered their signature butter cake, which came with more fresh whipped cream.  OMG - that butter cake is incredible!

There was a small chunk of cheesecake hidden under a massive amount of tiramisu flavoured ice cream. It tasted ok, but I was not entirely satisfied. I was expecting more cheesecake and less ice cream.

The latte on the other hand was delicious and way different from ordinary drinks. 
My cousin liked her crepe and tea.

I hand the girl at the register my coupon too and in a whiney-sigh calls for the manager.  The manager comes to the counter and proceeds to tell me that they are a franchise and do not accept corporate coupons.

She brought our vegetable tempura and forgot the drinks. I had to remind her as she breezed past the table. Our rolls arrived shortly after. I wasn't really impressed with the presentation or the quality. Mind you, I am NOT a sushi snob. The rolls just seemed thrown together.

Finally made it out here!  While they were offering up their ""Dog Days of Summer"" (everyday in September offered two different gourmet hot dog selections, most of which sounded divine even though I rarely consume them nowadays) and fresh lemonade, I decided to try their bacon blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries.

While I waited for my order, I decided to check out the restroom facility to wash my hands and found, to my slight discomfort, an animation film classic ""Stingray"" playing on a 13"" television console inside (along with showcases of Barbie and Ken on the walls).  While novel to see, as I said, this blast-from-the-past just made me want to leave the facility as fast as I could.  Something about those faces creeps me out!

This burger was SUPERB!   I cannot find fault in any of the components, from the grilled bun and perfectly-grilled patty, to the tasty homemade BBQ (a popular offering from JFG's sister company, Joe's Real BBQ) smothered on huge and crispy bacon and onion rings, to the heavenly chunky blue cheese dressing!  (Oh, that blue cheese dressing... Just give me a cup of this dressing and a straw to slurp it all up and I'm a happy camper!).  The sweet potato fries were amazing!!  Yes, I'd gladly drive 70 miles RT to order this platter of food again and again.  But, let's not forget to make room for dessert!  Hot fudge sundae lovers must try the mud sundae, a twist on the classic hot fudge sundae with malt added.  Mmmm....

It was a little busy when I arrived at 11a, and thankful I was to arrive then for the lunch time crowd was ridiculous!

Server doing karaoke as she approached table. Not knowledgeable about menu or specials and communicated poorly. While live music was on she tried to stand at end of long table to take orders instead of moving around. Friendly but aloof.

Now the food is also over-rated in general. The bone-in ribeye was absolutely flavorless. Literally no flavor. That's very hard to do! Very overpriced at $49.

The veggie platter is a disaster at any price let alone $21. No seasoning. Poorly cooked. Mushrooms inedible. Asparagus same. No seasoning or flavor. Small portions.

Potstickers are the same as you'd get at Panda Express.

Heirloom Tomato-mozzarella salad extremely bad in all aspects. Mozz is chewy/grainy and entire dish is undersized for $14. Tomatoes were flavorless.

The crab fried rice was great.

This is probably the go-to place for happy hour, and the best way to describe happy hour here is: ""a party in your mouth!""

We had Fried Deviled Eggs & Bacon Cheddar Biscuits to start. Biscuits were yummy and I thought it was strange that it was served with apple butter but after tasting it, it worked. The deviled eggs were okay... I'll probably try something else next time.

We came to Joe's Crab Shake to stuff our faces with what else crabs because you can't just come here and eat a burger! The location is On N Rainbow Blvd and West Mead Blvd, you seriously can't miss it considering there is a light up sign that says ""Joe's Crab Shack,"" with an arrow pointing to the restaurant. 

Once seated, you can get a good view of how this restaurant is set up. There is tons of seating, and the décor is nautical, it honestly reminds me of how some of the seafood restaurants in NY that are on boardwalks with a beachy vibe. 

Our server was pretty awesome and told us everything we needed to know about this place, the various ways to have your crab cooked or season and the rest of menu. I ordered the KJ Steam Pot, which is snow crab, mussels, scallops, corn, and potatoes cooked in a Kendall Jackson wine sauce. 

I really loved the flavoring of the crab it really did not need to be dunked in butter because it was seasoned perfectly. However the mussels did, for some reason they were sort of bland- everything else in the pot was the bees knees though.

The service is friendly, fast, and they can usually get you a pretty nice selection of cars. Sometimes they do ask about insurance, pre paid gas, and whatever else they want to sell even though I already have selected that I don't want it online, but they are probably trained to ask anyway.

My biggest gripe is that prices are definitely hiked to meet airport demand, which is annoying. I rent through Enterprise at least once a week but I was told that because I'm not doing it through a business, I can't get any of the business perks or whatever. 

Either way, I've always been way more happy to rent with Enterprise than anyone else in the airport. The cars always seem nicer, and they don't deduct a $200 charge for you using a debit card. (Other rental agencies at the airport hold $200 on your bank account until you return with the car, which is massively annoying.) 

I fly to Pittsburgh every week, and Enterprise is my go to company! I will even choose selecting them over other rental companies there even if it's a few more bucks more because they are just much easier and friendlier to work with.",2014-09-20 18:15:34

From the street this restaurant doesn't catch the eye. Once you get in, it's more interesting. You get welcome by all the staff cheerfully screaming a nice Japanese word that I did not understand.

The bad part was that I had to sit on a wooden crate thing. You need to order the 'Sake Bomb' a fun drink made from rice beer and, of course, sake. 

Now, the food. There's all kind of little plates you can order and also bigger plates like the best Ramen i have ever eaten, spicy and tasteful. I can't get enough of their octopus balls which melt in your mouth. Special mention to the Koroke, incredibly original fried potato croquette and my son's favorite. I particularly love the dried fish flakes you can find on most of the dishes. There lots of things worth trying or reordering.

I would rather just order things on line. The store is not really ever organized and things are miss tagged, have to dig for your size because sizes on hangers are never correct. The store clerks are not thorough in removing sensors, after two tags left on items that didn't trigger when I left the store, I had to return to have them removed. Was a pain, as I was wearing one item for a party and the other was the gift. When I returned to the store, there was no apology from the clerk, she just said ""we have problems with these things, all the time"". How about I'm sorry for the inconvenience. If I didn't have somewhere to be, I would have told them to keep them. I've witnessed a stressed Manager snap at a seasonal worker which was really inappropriate. Look I understand people get tired and fatigued during the holidays, but it's not right for a person to be hollered at especially in front of customers. Once again, the tag was not marked correctly and the customer indicated what the sign said and the clerk just asked for clarification. Isn't that the Managers job? Ordering on line is the way to go. I can try items on in the comfort of my home and if it doesn't fit, just return it. It makes it easy to shop clearance items, they are in better condition than what you would physically find in the store.

As usual, we started with the guacamole, and as usual, it was incredibly tasty. The chips were fresh and the two accompanying salsas were delish.

I usually get the enchiladas, but since I am now vegan, that is out of the question. I opted for the three tostadas, and it was a great choice. Crunchy corn shell, fresh veggies, and really tasty black beans made a great base for the vat of the tomatillo sauce I poured on. Man I love that sauce.

Our service was incredibly friendly, like always, and even when the kitchen made a mistake it was correctly quickly and correctly.

We decided on Local for a few reasons. 1) the first place we stopped at had a 1.5 hour wait. 2) their brunch menu looked tasty 3) We never ate at Local before 4) bloody mary bar.. end of story.

We strolled down E. Carson on a sunny Sunday funday and headed into local. For drinks, i got a mimosa carafe (a good 5 drinks.. atleast) it was $8. you could also get unlimited carafe for $14. Bobby ordered from the bloody mary bar. You got to choose your vodka and then it was served to you. The bar was behind you FULL of fresh veggies, spices, hot sauces. Also they had 3 different options for the drink. One was an already spiced bloody mary mix, another was straight tomato juice and the last was V8. I'm not a huge fan of bloody mary, but bobby made a great one! (actually he ordered 2)

For brunch, I ordered Banana's Foster Stuffed French Toast. It was stuffed with honey cream cheese and had a delicious glazed syrup on top, topped with bananas. It came with a side of breakfast potatoes. Bobby ordered the Southern Style Breakfast- sausge gravy over biscuits, piece of ham, sausage, 2 eggs + grits. He seemed to like it but im not sure if he was a huge fan of the grits. I did try the sausage gravy and it was great!

That was until I saw Andrew Zimmern and his crew from Bizarre Foods America, aired on the Travel Channel, visited Pittsburgh.  I was of course excited to see the cities culinary offerings represented, and remember talking all through the hour long episode like I was standing next to Andrew helping to explain what he was taking in.  However, when he got to Lucy's Sandwich shop, in the Strip, I was like ""hold the phone, where is this? And I want one.""  

Years of working in the Strip and I have never seen this food cart, why?  Well as it seems, Lucy may hold varying hours, as noted in reviews, and is only open during certain months?  Well whatever the reason was I am bummed that all those years I never tried one of her Bánh mì sandwiches.  That is until recently when I asked the Hubs if he would pick me one up this past week for lunch.  I had to go over with him, based on the helpful yelp reviews, where she may be located and approximately how much it would be, and when would be the best time to go.  So he called yesterday afternoon with the exciting news that he was on his way to my work to deliver the Bánh mì... I was instantly excited!

Enough of the backdrop and on to the main star.  Once I unfoiled the Bánh mì I cut it in half and began to dig in.  Oh my how do I explain this sandwich.  The crisp pieces of pork mixed with some chicken along with the thin spicy sauce, topped with the pickled daikon radishes and carrots, matched with the super fresh thin slices of jalapeno and cucumber, topped with one of my all-time favorite herbs, cilantro, just to balance all the flavors and smells of this little piece of heaven.  Truly this is a sandwich made for the Gods.  Superior.  I loved every bit and seriously wished I had another one on wait for dinner.  

I did ask my H what he said when he ordered it just to get a fill of the atmosphere.  He explained that she didn't have a menu, he asked what she had.  He told me she said Bánh mì but he didn't know what that meant (other than it being a sandwich) and he said I'll take that with everything and make it hot...

I've gone here twice, both on Sundays at 11am and 1pm, and both times I was seated immediately despite the fact that there was a LOT of people. I'm shocked that even at peak times there's no wait. (Maybe it's because we live in Arizona and not California anymore so there's a smaller Asian population? lol I have no idea, but I'm not complaining.)

I overheard a lady tell the host that she didn't want a table far away from the entrance because her mom was very frail and could not walk far into the restaurant. They had to wait a few minutes longer for a table but it was no problem to accommodate them. I thought that was very nice.

If you want to quickly order to-go desserts, you line up at the bakery at the side of the entrance! There's even free samples.

Now, onto the good stuff.. the dim sum experience! The second time I was seated, they brought me to the corner of an extra room they had wayyy in the back. The pessimist in me was concerned that I would miss out on all the dim sum carts, or that they would rarely visit our table. FEAR NOT - despite being in a small corner, in another room from the main dining hall, the cute pushcart ladies came VERY frequently. In fact, after ten minutes my table was already full of dim sum and we ended up overordering! Not to fret though because I love eating dim sum leftovers.

The excellent: xiao long bao (dumplings with soup inside, make sure you eat it quick while the soup is hot), the siu mai, cha siu bao, the chicken pot pie (lol no idea why this is a dim sum option, but it's really good and I found it in the same cart as the dessert cart), THE EGG TARTS.

The ok: curry bun, coconut macaroon, fried crispy taro (forgot the name but typically this is my favorite dim sum dish, but it was just OK here), radish cake, chicken feet. (My boyfriend loves chicken feet and he liked the ones here, I'm just not super into chicken feet in general.)

Honestly there wasn't anything I hated or disliked. Great variety of dim sum, fast service, and my tummy was happy.

OH - and THEIR EGG TART IS AMAZING. Get the one that looks more yolky and yellow. The egg tart that looks more cooked is still good, but if you get the yellower egg tart, IT'S SOOOO BOMB. Especially when they're newly made so they're still hot. Homg. Freaking amazing.

My bill ended up being $45 for two people, which is higher than usual, but keep in mind I was getting wayyyy too excited trying out all the dim sum. We ended up with LOTS of leftovers. Normally, two people at dim sum will come out with a check totaling around $30-$32.

Yes, I'm definitely returning and loading up on those egg tarts.",2017-03-26 20:14:50

We only tried one sandwich as a snack, but though we had to wait a bit because they are made to order, I was so happy with the wonderful combination and textures in the ""Punching One Shoe"" - roast beef, cheddar, horseradish, 1000 island, coleslaw, tomato, onions and peppers. It was toasty and made fresh to order. We've got the chewiness of the roast beef and cheddar, the tang of the 1000 island, the zing of the horseradish, and the fresh textures of the crunchy coleslaw and vegetables of tomato, onions and cooked bell peppers.

I have been so excited to try Tamaleria ever since I read The Observer piece about it. This place is tucked in a strip mall on Arrowood Road, next to where the Salvation Army does its Christmas Center. It's not very big, just a handful of tables. Our group wanted to dine in, so we took Faith D's advice and went early at 11:30am on a Wednesday. If the tables are all full, just get your order to go. Super quick and easy. Probably a good thing I don't live near here, I would be stopping by every day to grab some tamales. 

We wanted to try a little bit of everything. Our order for three people: six tamales, four empanadas, two chorizo tacos, and a Mexican Coke. The grand total: $26. That's a lot of food, folks. We mixed it up with several different tamale preparations/variations: chicken, pork, mole, verde, red sauce... I thought they were all good. There are also some vegetarian and dessert tamale options. The chorizo tacos were delicious. They bring a few different sauces to the table. I recommend trying a small amount of each to experience the different flavors and heat levels. Want to make a meal of it? You can score two tamales, rice, and beans for about $7.

Everyone here was so nice. If you're a little shy about trying a tamaleria, don't worry. There are pictures everywhere to help guide you. They do take credit cards. I recommend bringing several friends so you can order a lot and try a little bit of everything.",2016-03-04 17:54:28

Let me start by saying that I frequent IN-N-Out in Vegas and in California. I'm eating at one at least once a month.

My usual is a total of 3 Flying Dutchman's.  A Flying Dutchman is two patties with two pieces of cheese. That's it.  I carb load (3 days carbs kept to only 100 grams, followed by 1 day about 400 grams of carbs).  On my ""No Carb"" days, 3 Flying Dutchman's hit the spot. Only about $6 for 90 grams of protein.  Can't beat that!!!

Now for my recent order:
-Double Double:  Spread Only / Extra Toasted
-Cheeseburger:  Same Way
-Fries

Since it's been awhile since I had a burger.  This truly hit the spot.  IN-N-Out burgers are a bit small, so I always have to order 2 burgers.  Patties are small, but always fresh.  

Out of all the IN-N-Outs in Vegas, this one is probably the easiest and quickest.  Anyone been to the one on Craig and 15, they are the longest wait.  This location is in a not so busy shopping center.  Service is good and scary that they even know what I plan on ordering sometimes.  

TIP:  Most know about their secret menu (i.e. Flying Dutchman, Animal Fries, Neopolitan, etc).  You can get the full secret menu online.  I remember back in the day, before the internet, when you only got the secret stuff by word of mouth.",2012-10-08 08:16:45

I personally got the Honey Bacon Club panini, which had turkey, ham, smoked bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese, and house-made honey mustard spread. Now, I've never been a huge salad person but they had so many different types of fruity salads. I just had to go for half of their Summer Chicken salad, which had chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, & grapes on a bed of mixed greens with house-made fresh strawberry vinaigrette dressing. Along with your full orders, you get bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. 

Their sandwich? Not really all that memorable. It was quite thin. Don't get me wrong ... it was good but it wasn't great. I could've honestly just passed it up because their salad just out shined it by a few thousand miles.

I love strawberries so at the first bite of this summer chicken salad, I was in heaven. Why? Their strawberry vinaigrette dressing is to DIE FOR. It's amazing ..and the cashews add a nice touch of flavor into it as well. My goodness. I don't think I've had such an amazing salad elsewhere before. 

I think I just found my favorite place. This place would be PERFECT for summer. I'm just craving their salads right now and will be coming back soon! VERY SOON! I can't wait to try all of their fruity salads!!",2014-03-28 09:07:49

The food is good enough, but didn't blow me away.  Though, did you see them on ""Diners Drive-Ins and Dives""?  The pork really does fall of the bone in the Osso Bucco dish.  The garlic bread appetizer consists of 4 pieces of bread, and no real garlic.  The prosciutto and melon was good, but the prosciutto was not as soft, or maybe not as fresh (?) as I've had.  The lasagna is a surprisingly small portion, but is filling enough.  And the chicken parmesan is a giant portion that leaves you with probably too much food for lunch leftovers, but perhaps would be better as dinner the next night.

I thought it was really reasonably priced.  The total including tax and tip for our party of 4 was just under $150 and that included 2 appetizers, a soup, 4 entrees, 1 dessert, and 1 bottle of wine.

You know how you have your ""go-to"" restaurants in your neighborhood?  They're the defaults when you want a decent, reasonably priced meal in a familiar place.  The food may not be the best ever, and there is usually no ambience, but they're close and they fulfill your craving for that type of cuisine.

The service is fantastic. The sushi chef that took care of us was quick and rolled a tight roll. The waiter removed dirty dishes promptly and refilled our drinks in a timely manner. 

The nigiri is the highlight of the whole menu. The generous cuts of fish is a good balance to the amount of rice. The starch is well flavored and has a good consistency. The rolls are nothing spectacular. The ones marked as spicy do not hold up to the chili pepper symbol that sits next to the name. The tempura batter is also too thick and does not fry up crisp enough to give a contrast to the rest of the ingredients.

The seaweed salad and ahi poke are delicious. I ordered two to share with a friend and found that I had devoured most of it before he saw what happened. The poke is not like anything you have seen before. They do not believe in small chunks, these pieces are the size of Vienna sausages. I do not mind and actually prefer it this way.

Not unlike super grad schools, sometimes I wish Canada could serve up something approximating what is common in the USA...

But for the city and the country this grill has a good breaky. Ordered the classic benny and blackened chicken burger with bacon strip side, all of which was not at all outstanding (3.25 stars) ...

The blackened quality of the chicken breast was missing, something I simply don't get! 
Why call unblackened meat blackened? 
As I used to blacken snapper at home in a cast-iron frying pan, easy to distinguish the colour of 'blackened' meat and the flavours of a charred blended-spice rub!
The bennys were well laid-on, but the 'smash browns' were just slightly squished spuds with little taste. 
The bacon strips were tasty, but almost cold. Not okay!
And the tap water was pretty standard. 
So far, this breaky is more or less similar to the competition (mostly all 3.5 stars!), but nothing much to crow about.

Service was average, but most of the time the staff stayed behind the high counter pleasantly chatting with one another. Other than politely delivering the meals, no one interacted with patrons.

A fairly large outdoor patio backs onto the paid parking lot where one can redeem 2 free hours of parking if need be.

Just cannot get excited, again, but the aftertaste spoke of a pretty decent pair of meals. Would sure like to frequent some of those real diners in the States: as standard practice, they know how to lay on a spread that's seldom short on quality and quantity with a price that's generally much lower than up here.

The restaurant is nicely decorated and I found the service to be pleasant and very well informed.  Hopefully, if you dine here you will have a love of oysters because they are fresh, beautiful, large and a very good deal.  I had a mix of the $1 and $2 oysters with the wasabi cocktail sauce, rosemary mignonette and the ponzu salsa.  All the sauces work very well with the oysters, but the ponzu salsa was tangy and fresh and it was the absolute best.  To be able to have a dozen or two of excellent oysters and not break the bank is the number one reason to visit this restaurant.

I was very let down by the nigiri and crudo at this restaurant.  We ordered the nigiri sampler for $15.  The fish on the nigiri was dried out and sliced too thin for the price.  The rice in the nigiri was flavorless.  So many other AYCE sushi joints in this town would shame Other Mama when it comes to nigiri.  We also tried the amberjack crudo.  The flavor of the salsa on the crudo was amazing, but once again the tiny and thin slices of fish were not acceptable for the price ($13).

I wasn't terribly impressed by the cocktails, and I tried two of them.  They were small and the fascinating descriptions of the ingredients just didn't deliver a satisfying drink.

In fact, I really don't remember the last time, it was that long.  Also, for some reason it seems like I can't remember a particularly great mexican meal that I have had in Charlotte.  Most of the mexican food that I eat is made at home and satisfies me.  Maybe I don't know where the good places are?  Anyway, we stopped by for a drink, in this case a couple of margaritas, but I was looking at the food menu and got tempted into ordering a couple of tacos.  The al pastor pork taco and the carne asada steak taco were calling my name.  Both tacos were excellent, but I would get the al pastor only next time, as the cabbage, pineapple and cilantro really went well together.  The tacos came with beans and rice, which I enjoyed, but I was already overly stuffed with the tacos.  I had ordered a lunch portion at 10$ and it was a very good value for the amount of food that I received.  Sitting outside on the patio was nice despite the heat.

I'm still new here and Valentine's Day and my birthday were coming up and my mom and I love to decorate the house to lift my spirits up, each time we've come in they greeted us right away, and ask if we need help looking for something. The Party City I've been to in Orange County that service is really spotty so this is a nice change of pace!

They have tons of selections! No shortage of decorations at all, if you don't find what your looking for here than your just crazy! We mainly came in for balloons and they blew them up right there on the spot, we didn't have to wait an insane amount of time. Yes I feel like all Party City's are understaffed and don't have enough employees when it comes time for check out but  they apologize and try to handle all the customers waiting in line as quick as they can.

And at 12:20 in the afternoon they didn't have meatballs for meatball sub. That is the third time I have attempted to buy something at Capriotti's and they either didn't have it or they were missing one of the ingredients or it was just nasty sandwich. The Bobby would've been a great sandwich had they not put on so much stuffing and if the stuffing hadn't been all gooey. And then there's the fact that they don't have green peppers to go on sandwiches. But that was another visit. This one was the missing meatballs. I give them two stars because at least they were able to fulfill my coworkers sandwich order. And of course the Pepsi was OK.,2017-03-02 21:10:49
raUrqaZGUWCd7nlwXNz8BQ,Rzf35jKV8e8EJdssrae_AA,atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg,3,6,6,7,"My husband decided we should go out for a nice lunch today.  That means he wears a collared shirt and I wear something other than my standard summer attire of an old tank top and shorts I would never wear in public.  Too bad the woman I just saw at Bashas' didn't have the same philosophy-my husband was temporarily blinded when he witnessed the horror.   I digress.  We chose Metro since we had only been once before at the Yelp Adopt-A-Family UYE last year, and unfortunately, missed the Yelp Eats week.

We arrived about 1:30 and were given the brunch menu.  As both the website and the menu list lunch and dinner available at 11 am on Saturday, I asked for an alternate menu.  It was disappointing that only brunch was available for the next 30 minutes and most of the entrees were breakfast items.

We went ahead and ordered cocktails, and they do have an impressive cocktail menu.  I had something with blueberries, lemonade, and a ginger liqueur.  It was perfect, not overly sweet at all.  Since lunch options were limited, we shared a petit plateau ($42) which included shrimp, clams, and oysters.  I really have no idea why I suggested this since I'm generally not a fan of oysters or clams unless garlic and butter are somehow involved.  The clams had an odd taste to me, but I had never had raw clams, believe it or not.  The husband commented they weren't cleaned quite to his liking either.  The oysters were very nice, once I thoroughly soaked them in lemon juice, but hey that's just me.

Since this raw shellfish lunch had virtually no calories, I was not about to share a dessert.  I ordered the sticky toffee pudding (why do they call it pudding anyway?) and it was the best.  The cake was caramelized and crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The pistachio gelato was a nice accompaniment.  I also tried my husband's peach cobbler.  There were two great things about it.  One, the peaches still had a nice bite to them.  Two, it was huge, and I am always a fan of a big dessert, especially when you're sharing.

Our server was great, and we never felt forgotten.  Unfortunately, the time it took to get food and drinks was completely ridiculous.  The restaurant was not that busy, yet cocktails were excruciatingly slow.  The bartender certainly did not appear to be stressed.  The seafood took so long that by the time it arrived, I am certain the lunch menu was available.   Dessert was at least 20 minutes to arrive as well.

I had so much time to kill that I found myself becoming increasingly irritated by both my husband and the restaurant.  For example, if they are going to put butcher paper over the table cloth, then why don't they change the paper before they bring your dessert?   God knows they have ample time, and I didn't necessarily want to look at the paper that was spilled on and wet where the glasses had been.  Yes, I am positive it's a pleasure to dine with me.

Overall, I will come back and could easily see adding on a star or two if only the kitchen could get it together.",2009-08-02 00:36:41

Portions were really good, tasted fresh! Bill was $38 something not including tip. Pretty fast service, got our food within 10 mins.

I ordered the vegetable spring rolls ( nothing special, taste the same in most restaurants) and got the fire dragon roll as well.  It was really presented really nicely and even better when it tasted as good as it looked. I uploaded a photo of this artistic roll :p

#1 The ambiance: They're BIG! Whether you want to sit on the balcony, on their AWESOME COUCHES or inside, on a table, you'll be fine. Right now I feel the couch (OMG I love them), in front of the BW TV is my favourite, especially during the day. Last sunday they had Raiders of The Lost Ark playing. It was that cool! 

#2 Food: Their menu is not very veggie-friendly, which upsets me a bit. I don't eat red meat/pork and avoid deep fried things, so I couldn't enjoy most of their food. I had, though, very good Gravlax and a fruit tart with blue cheese ice cream which were THE BEST. I hope they improve, as they work with tapas and that's quite easy to change. 

#3 Drinks: Here it comes: their bartenders are fantastic. I tried going there for the first time recommended by my favourite bartender, Vince,  who works there a couple days a week, and then met Josh. Wasn't disappointed at all. Josh made a citrusy martini for me which is now my default drink, if you wanna try, ask for ""the citrus martini you made for Renata"", but he can make everything you ask. Also, ask Vince for recommendations. Vince is my friend! :D 

#4 Beers: I'm not a beer enthusiast, so I'm skipping this. I've heard the Junction Conductor Ale is great.

1.  Parking - Easy Peasy. Strip mall as normal and easy to get into and out of on the corner of Paseo Verde and St. Rose.

2.  Ambiance - Small but long and narrow, there are about tables here that you can eat in.  Clean, spartan and minimalist, however, very comfy overall.

3.  Selection - Takes a few minutes to figure out all their choices, but their menu covers almost anything you would want to order.  Great selections of soups, breakfast, sandwiches and salads. Overall very nice.

4.  Food -  You gotta come here for the bread, as it is warmed in the oven and then your sandwich is made.  The taste of warm sourdough is awesome and can't get any better for a really nice taste of good ole San Francisco.  They also pile on the meat and cheese, unlike the other traditional sub places that seem to give you just a smattering of the meat and cheese and then a lot of the other filling.  So, pound for pound, this place gives you alot!

5,  Food Part 2 - I ordered four sandwiches all diferent.  The Turkey, the Sourdough, the Garlic Pesto and the Pastrami.  All very good and the best part is that they are of good and decent size.  They have two sizes.

6.  Price - The price is very reasonable. I ordered 4 of the large sandwiches for a total of 30.00.

7.  Service - Wow, now this is what I call professional.  They are all there waiting to serve you.  I went at 2:00 pm and there were several people in front of me. When it came time, they are very fast at making the sandwich and they will come out from around the serving table and give it to you.  Kinda like when you buy something at Nordstroms.

Now, my family enjoyed, and yet they do like the bread selections of the other sub places as well as the spices and oils used at the other places.  For a real meaty sandwich, I prefer this place.

And, the owners are british and well, I have had plenty of sandwiches in the UK and these folks make a real mean US style sandwich. Not as much meat as a deli like Jason's, but a lot more than the other places here....

When I got a new phone from the store it started having some issues that night, it kept turning on and off on its own. The next day I went in and told the staff what was wrong, he brought out a new handset and made a comparison, and immediately saw the problem was with the power button, mine was stuck flushed to the side which means it's constantly pressing on the button. Without a hassle, he made an exchange for me. He made sure to remind me about transferring all my saved info and cards into the new phone.

The owner is a nice guy, who is trying very hard, but they are missing some things.  First off, the hotdog quality just isn't good.  ""Boiled bologna"" is how my date described it, and she hit it right on the money.  The toppings were pretty good, very sugary and sweet.  We had three dogs and tots.  The dogs were luke warm, not grilled to order, not even really done.  The buns are good, very sweet too.

Here's my thoughts: increase the quality of the dogs and show that off, doesn't have to be organic, but should be a good name.  Grill the dogs to order, takes a few more minutes but I'd come back for it.  Make sure everything that is supposed to be hot is hot (chili, tots, etc.) and everything cold is cold (slaw).  It's that difference in temp that makes a great eating experience.

The entrance is a large ornate wood door that leads into an open space with tall ceilings. There are booths, a modern bar with glass shelves, and rustic wood paneling on the walls. Even the bathrooms are beautiful! I honestly love how it is decorated. I guess I am mostly surprised that a sports bar is decorated in such a manner. Yes, it is a sports bar. It is probably the prettiest sports bar I have ever laid eyes on. It is also the only sports bar I've ever seen that has TVs lining every single wall. There are so many TVs, the place could save electricity by forgoing the use of lamps and simply light the place by the glow of the TVs. 

Unfortunately, the food was just okay. Mainly it was bar fare - burgers, wings, etc. with some modern twists/flare. The soup of the day was asparagus soup - not typical bar fare but they did have chili on the menu. There were salads but nothing crazy. The burgers all sounded typical with some avocado thrown in. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich, I ordered the turkey burger, and my sister-in-law ordered the California burger. All three of us ordered sweet potato fries. The fries were good but nothing to write home about. I didn't try the chicken sandwich nor the CA burger but the overall verdict was just okay. My turkey burger was super thin and dry. The flavor was nice, but not something I'd order again. Since we all ordered burgers, as we ate our dinner, we wished we went to a burger joint instead.  

Overall, I don't think I'll be back. The food quality isn't what I expected (yes, it is a sports bar but it is a high end sports bar) and for the quality of food, I don't want to pay high end prices.

it was great. it was quiet on a Friday late morning, and I was seated w/out a reservation after 10 minutes on the patio. i never even knew there was a patio, since when i had dinner there, it was dark outside and the middle of summer, so i was inside.

this time, I got a coffee and the boudin blanc. I wanted to order more, but I planned a big lunch so I had to say no to the pastries, etc. the coffee was ok, didn't love their roast. the boudin was amazing. the eggs were scrambled perfectly and the sausage was seared just in enough for flavor and color, and super juicy; i soaked up the juices and the buttery sauce with the eggs and the croissant. 

the service was attentive but not annoying, although I was distracted by how many times one of the morning managers came out to patio and made notes. I couldn't tell what she was looking for, since she was looking only at tables, not customers. I felt like she was taking notes on what people were ordering and I felt weird, as if I were being openly scrutinized and judged by my dining choices. 

all told, I had a lovely experience and felt much better about bouchon. the only thing I didn't enjoy were the patio view of sunbathing Venetian pool guests (fat people in bathing suits do not whet appetites) and thr fact that some diners wore rubber soled sandals of the pool variety. this is Thomas Keller! show some respect!",2012-06-17 01:24:43

It is a deli only by name - this store is primarily beer and a little bit of wine (which has 0 impact on this review). This is by far the best and most expansive beer selection in Lakewood, there's well over 500 beers here, and about 100 available as singles: very important to me as someone who loves toz sample them. Most of them, but not all, are organized by type (with devoted sections to kombuchas and sours, natch) and it's about 50/50 of what's refrigerated and not refrigerated. Their selection is a little titled towards IPAs - not my cup of tea, but understandable, it's the long trend in the American beer scene. Their selection also goes into shabby ones like Mickey's, Hamm's, and Old Style..  

There's also dozen or 2 Belgian breweries... my only nit is that west coast USA items could be a bit more inclusive and their Belgian selection isn't as good as over the Lizardtown store. 

They also have growler and small jars (16oz) available as well to fill up one of their 6-7 choices on draft. You can even sample them 25 cents each. The fact that Rozi's has kegs and places to sit is their only advantage to Ross Deli. 

The younger gentleman answered my questions and wasn't obtrusive. Prices are extremely fair; I walked out with a dozen single beers under $40; and you certainly can spend triple that on the same quantity of beer. 

Carry on, my wayward son. I'll be back. I doubt that it's worth checking out Simone's or Cap n Corks again after visiting here.",2016-03-26 19:14:30
_W-6zp8fyGrh-zktpVib6g,bkcWR-bVxx4wjRkjZdUfNQ,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,4,4,0,1,"I have been hearing fabulous things about the new nightlife mecca that is Hakkasan long before it's opening this past April. My friend does PR for the brand and I grew up in Las Vegas, so any new opening  is exciting and warrants a trip home to see what all the buzz is about.  We made reservations weeks before, and had planned to eat around 8:30 on Saturday before entering the club later to see Tiesto. It is a bit tricky to find/enter the restaurant, because you have to walk through the entirety of the massive MGM casino floor to the other side, and navigate the signs and ropes that herd the club-goers into their appropriate lines to find a little opening that says ""restaurant"".  Inside, blue lights glow and 4 hostesses wait behind a lobby desk to check you in. 

The service is impeccable from the start, and although we were a few minutes late (leave about 15 minutes to walk through the MGM), we were seated right away. The restaurant takes up the first 2 floors of the 5 story Hakkasan space, and the interior is breathtaking.  While the restaurant is huge, it is broken up into intimate spaces by an endless web of intricately woven wooden panels stationed horizontally and vertically. The walls glow blue, and the dark wood decor is tasteful and elegant. The menu is vast, and is broken up into sections i.e. Meat, Fish, Veggies, Starch, etc. like a standard Chinese restaurant, but we asked our server for recommendations.  

We started with the Crispy Duck Salad which is one of their renowned items and for good reason. The duck alone is divine, it is poached and steamed in a chinese spice mixture for hours before being fried in rice flour, then added to a plum dressing mixture with greens, pine nuts, pomelos, and more mouth-watering ingredients. It was truly astonishing how amazing it was. 

Next came the Sesame Shrimp Toast w/ Foie Gras which I was most excited about, since CA has outlawed the delectable delicacy, but I was greatly disappointed. The dish was 4 hearty spheres of a solid shrimp mixture completely coated in sesame seeds.  Supposedly when we bit into them, foie gras would ooze out but that was not the case. If there was foie gras in there, we did not find it. Disappointing and bland. 

Next we ordered a cup of Hot & Sour soup, a dish my boyfriend and I both love and were curious to see how Hakkasan interpreted it. It was good, different though... it had a sweet and almost fishy flavor to the broth. 

For our larger dishes we ordered the Black Pepper Rib-eye Merlot Stir-fry which came with sauteed onions and garlic and was absolutely out of this world.  Some of the most tender steak I've had in general, and was a wonderful experience to have that flavor and texture in a stir-fry dish.  We also ordered the Sweet & Sour Pork which was fresh and very flavorful.  

We had wanted to order the fried crab appetizer and a veggie dish as well, but realized quickly we were getting very full because we foolishly had a snack at the Todd English Pub around 5:30 pm (more on that later!). I wish we could have sampled more dishes and cocktails...I only tried the Hakka which was vodka and sake mixed with passion fruit and lychee juice and was absolutely incredible. 

The menu provides plenty of options for a fantastic meal, for 2 our bill was about $137. There are also specialty dishes with abalone and caviar and some seafood dishes that can run up to $400, so clearly it depends what you order. I believe the average cocktail is $15-18, although they also offer about 5 for $120. So, you can choose what type of experience you wish to have, although dining at Hakkasan alone is absolutely an indulgent and upscale experience.

Our waitress Catalina was the most gracious, helpful, and genuinely fantastic server we have had in years, she really helped make our experience memorable. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu, hopefully I will in 3 weeks when I'm back in my home away from home!",2013-05-28 18:30:59

The price is quite high for what you get.  The quality of food, if you like it makes it worth it, but if the food didn't come out as good as you hoped then you'd most likely think it is way over priced.

We had the ebi-mayo. It is shrimp tempura with some salad around it.  This was one of the better tempura dishes I tried in a while.  I would get this dish again.

Then we had some steam egg dish (not really sharable but we tried to share it).  Too salty for my taste.

Then we got the Seared BC Tuna with ponzu sauce.  Presentation was nice, but the taste didn't stand out.  For something like this, I would recommend Sushi-Ya to make it.

We then tried the duck breast, it was a cold dish.  It was quite meh for me.  You can probably get it tastier with less cost at Chinese places.  Go for Peking duck at Chung King is a better use of money.  Heck even the roast duck at those takeouts taste better.

Then we ordered the Osaka Fried Rice with Octopus.  The presentation was good, but the rice itself was pretty bland.  It needed something salty to be combined with.

That salty thing which we got last was the grilled salmon.  Considering I don't like cooked salmon in general, I really liked this dish.  My friend ate the skin so I didn't get to try it.  It blends well with the rice.

My other friend who came last minute liked all his orders, though we didn't get to try it: yakitori-wing, yakitori-iiver and monkfish liver.  We just took his word for it since I don't like liver and the wing was good for one person.

The service is excellent. We were there for a couple of hours and saw it from empty to nearly full.  The service was friendly and they seemed to have a lot of cooks and waitresses to support the crowd.

The cost to eat here is very expensive, you should come here on a relatively full stomach and be here just to chat with friends rather than eating a proper meal.

I was told I had another month of membership in my contract, I said that's fine, but let it be the final month. I wrote a length letter in person on a sheet of paper they provided me explicitly requesting cancellation. Well they charged me again in October 2014. That was supposed to be the final month. Fine. But then they charged me for November again. After I posted here they followed up with me on the phone and refunded me, saying it was ""according to the terms"" but that they were doing this super gracious favor. I don't recall my contract being 13 months!? Glad I got the refund though; updated from 1 star to 3 stars. If I get charged again in December, though, I'm reverting this review update.

Meanwhile this is the review I posted on Facebook a year ago:

Very affordable, nice clean place. I've been trained by other gyms before (on four different occasions) but a recent bout of career frustration, depression, and career track in software left me pretty far gone (obese and muscles pretty weak), and I know what I need to do, that's why I signed up, so I could put back into practice what I already know. I was extremely frustrated that I could not opt out of the introduction training. Besides the redundancy in head knowledge, the trainer pushed me way too hard for my first go in my current condition; I had every intention to ease back into lifestyle fitness, not overexert myself with muscle injury so severe I cannot stand nor walk 2 days later without screaming. I stopped my trainer two or three times after he had me overexert my legs. Even if extreme muscle injury is an ideal, not everyone who walks into a gym is mentally or logistically prepared to give fitness 100% priority. When asked, I said I am 60% committed. I meant it! I am between jobs and I embarrassed myself at a job interview yesterday as I waddled in with my knees locked. The pain was so excruciating as I left that I dropped my smartphone and it cracked. Smart Gym needs to learn to respect the limits and limited intentions of their customers! After I am restored I am looking forward to access to the gym, as I'm sure it must otherwise be a good gym. That said, I suddenly find myself way more interested in my home fitness routine.",2014-11-22 09:14:34

You sadden me , even with it being Sunday you could have done better,
My suggestions if you want to inspire and draw in new clientele:


1)Get rid of the Helga manager/ hostess, she looked like she was miserable, she  seemed to be pissed all these customers were  around 

2) Be prepared for the Sunday Crowd , when I see a empty unbused table right in front and you tell me it's going to be awhile , after already  messing up my groups table assignment ,I  would have left if my family wasn't  with me

3) Try a little seasoning in your food, it's this miracle substance that gives flavor to food 

4) Have food ready fast ...it's Sunday we waited for our table , we waited for server to take our order ...now we wait  25 minutes more for our food?

The food is really good here, I have eaten here about 10 times and I have not had a bad meal yet. The pizza here is New York style, hand-tossed and good thin crust. The best 2 things on the menu are the Italian Salads and the Chicken Fingers. 

The Chicken fingers are your standard fare restaurant fingers, nothing too special about them. What makes they really tasty is the buffalo sauce they use. Excellent.

The salads are really good, they remind me of some of the ones you find in high end Italian joints, but at a much more reasonable price point.

It seemed to be the only thing open in the shopping plaza at Dobson and the 202 at the time. We were impressed by Cinemark- everything was clean (it had better- it was so new), the prices were better than Harkins and AMC, the seats were comfortable and the AC was low. 

I went back for the first time since we moved to CenPho today with Julia T., and I was glad to see that almost nothing had changed from my first impression. It was still clean, the staff was super friendly, the AC was far better than in the last 2 theatres I attended, and the prices were still a little lower than the bigger chains around here. There were even kids in the theatre with us and we didn't hear a peep from them or get our chairs kicked- imagine! I went home and told Hubby that this is where we're headed as often as possible to see movies from now on.

Really, really hit the spot.  In a magazine in the hotel room, I saw a photo of their corned beef sandwich and had to have it.  So we hiked over to Treasure Island, and it was well worth the trip.

You can get a few of the sandwiches in a special with fries and a soda, or straight up for about $10.  They come with a crisp (but not tangy enough) pickle and a little cup of cole slaw (too sweet and bland).  I got the regular corned beef sandwich, and it was awesome.  Perfect, really.  They have three different types of mustard on the table--yellow, sweet/hot, and deli.  I got an order of onion rings also, and they were great too:  A-.  Big, thick-cut rings in a crispy, flaky batter.  I wanted to try the ""famous"" bean and barley soup, but that would have been pushing my luck.  I snagged a few fries from my friend, and those get a solid B+.

My friends all liked their various sandwiches too.  I tried to get a chocolate custard afterwards, but they were out (sad face).  I would have had a hot fudge sundae, but they were out of nuts too.  I can't eat just plain vanilla yogurt!  Bummer.

Beso's strawberry martini effectively hides the bite of Taurine by pairing it with complimentary flavors. The martini is not too sweet. It's absolutely delicious. I would return to Beso just for that drink.

The Chocolate Martini is the best I have ever had, and I typically don't enjoy chocolate martinis because they're too sweet, liquory, creamy or coffee-y. Beso manages to accomplish the tough balance among those flavors.

I was sharing these martinis with my BF, in case you're wondering why I ordered drinks with flavors I normally don't like.

Part of their cycle was showing upcoming concerts around the country. Unsurprisingly, Toronto had the most; and I always wondered what the Molson Amphitheatre was since it featured most prominently.

Finally made it here last night for a comedy show. It goes without saying that as an amphitheatre, the acoustics and sight lines are great. This is a true outdoor amphitheatre built in the classical shape and slope you'd hope for. I was on the extreme west side of the seating and still had a great view. Love the atmosphere of almost being out along the water and perfect venue for a summer evening. On that alone, I would give it a 5 star.

Negatives however being that since it's literally on an island, the other facilities are lacking. I think they said the sold-out attendance was over 16k, and there's only 2 male washrooms and 3 female for the whole venue. For seating barely less than a venue like the ACC, that's pretty bad. Food is just average and my wife was in line for a half hour to get food (again lack of facilities for demand). There's only one way in and out too, which gave it a little bit of a 'herded like cattle' feeling when leaving. Would be nice if there was an entrance on the westside too.

In spite of the critiques, they are still mostly secondary as you're still getting great atmosphere, great views and sound quality. Most of the comedians coming up remarked about how much they liked the venue and I doubt there's anything else like in the country.",2015-09-07 17:32:58

The atmosphere, service, and quality of the food is on point. 

We dug into a 3 course meal for an incredibly fair price of $35, and what's more is the portion sizes didn't appear to be scaled down in the least. During restaurant week, you'd expect restaurants to provide you with the same food items, at a cheaper price only because the amount of food is substantially less. This was not the case at Tempest. After a delicious appetizer, entree, and dessert, we left here stuffed.

While the namesake oysters were not on the restaurant week menu, we knew that was something we had to experience. We simply ordered one west coast and one east coast oyster and both were fresh and well worth the extra expense.

Then for my first course I chose the She Crab Soup with King Crab & flying fish roe. I am typically not a soup person, which makes this selection curious, but I had heard great things and having now tasted it, I am glad I did. The soup was very creamy and had a unique yet delicious flavor to boot.

The second course was the Blue Marlin, broiled with hazelnut pesto lime aioli & fried leeks. I loved this fish. It was a large filet and I polished off every last bite. The outer crust was perfection and the taste of the pesto and salty crunch from the leeks were great with this particular fish.

For dessert I chose the Chocolate Caramel Walnut Tart and boy was this a large slice of decadence. From the thick layer of hardened chocolate to the gooey caramel interior and interspersed walnuts, my mouth salivated with anticipation between bites. I don't recall putting my fork down until I had near cleaned my plate of this very rich, very indulgent dessert.

Campfire duck couldn't have been more amazing with a buttery foie gras and robust duck meat. The pork shoulder was succulent and tender.

The only letdown of the night were the udon noodles, which were slightly over cooked. A firmer, al dente noodles would've fared better against the rich lamb bolognese sauce. It was all too mushy and that texture muddled the taste as that became all too rich and decadent.

The price for the half fried chicken was about $17 + $2 for the hot option.  A bit pricey to me, $20 in total for half chicken with fries?  Hard to justify that.  The fries was actually not bad, it was nicely seasoned and cooked pretty good.  Thumbs up for that.

I have read other reviews and many have indicated that this was their signature dish (fried chicken) either with fries or with a waffel.  What can I say?  I think the fried chicken at Popeyes is pretty good.  Maybe is becasue of how I perfer salt over sweet.

As part of the sushi course, I also got a tuna hand roll. This is honestly the best hand roll I've ever had in my life. The seaweed was super crispy, and the diced up tuna was amazing. It was so good, that we just had to ordered another one on top of our set course. The set sushi didn't come with a squid sushi, which is one of my husband's favourite fish, so we ordered that too. Sooooo good. I love Japanese steamed egg, and was really glad that it was one of the appetizers that came with the set course. The steamed egg here was also the best I've ever had.

I've discovered pepper grass, a spicy kind of leafy green that is great in salads and on sandwiches, one vendor brings native plants that are really fun and will naturally do well in your garden, there are several meat vendors that offer sustainably raised products (beware though if you have a problem with kosher slaughtering practices, some vendors here do observe those). There is a French baker who also makes great patés and a guy who sells venus fly traps, which is a really fun thing to have and take care of. And the list goes ever on.

I em ever venture very far through Thai food menus because I am unfamiliar with most; two dishes I have had here are the pad Thai with chicken and the drunken noodles. The pad Thai is unique in that it has thinner rice noodles and not an overt peanut/peanut butter flavor. It avoids being heavy and greasy turning into something with a lot of flavor that is really lite. 

Drunk enough noodles have a strong spice and hearty flavor that is perfect for the 30 seconds of winter that Arizona will get per year.

There isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.

The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here! 

The food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 ""Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink"" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the ""Caliente Burger Combo"" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a ""Chili Tamale"" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied! 

Anybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories.

The folks here said:

(1) Timing was way off, and this caused the car to stall and not restart. (False. Timing was fine.)

(2) The spark plugs were ""bad."" When I pointed out that this doesn't happen to platinum plugs after 8k miles, they said one plug was destroyed--the tip had snapped off. (Also false. After inspecting my plugs I have them back in and am driving on them just fine.)

(3) They said it would be a $3,000 fix. After cranking on the engine for a day or so without running through reasonable diagnostics. No check for vacuum, just cranking the engine time and again. 

When I came to get the car. The estimated repair price had magically dropped by $1,000. This was the ""bait"" of the ""bait-and-switch."" They still couldn't explain what was wrong but said an engine swap would probably fix it. 

I then took it to a qualified mechanic, who confirmed the diagnosis I had made based on the symptoms: I had a dropped valve seat.

Omelet's are served with your choice of bread:cinnamon, seven grain, herbed focaccia, pumpernickel or country white toast. My choice both times was the cinnamon- which is amazing. Not too much cinnamon sugar with a pad of butter was the perfect combination. One the third occasion I ordered a freshly prepared (one can here the vitamix at work!) carrot orange ginger juice which was exuberantly fresh and tangy.

Joining trailblazer Thai Elephant and relative newcomers Viet Kitchen and Thai Basil in Downtown's Asian hot spot is Thai'd Up, an unsuspecting joint residing in the Central/Adams retail space formerly occupied by yawner eateries Cafe Roma and the gone-in-60-seconds CityScapes.

Thai'd Up exorcises the ghosts of crappy restaurants past and churns out some flavorful food at a decent price point.

Thumbs Down: Service was sluggish; starter soup was cold; Level 4 spice (1-5) tasted more like Level 2; music was awful, maybe even intentionally so.

Thumbs Up: The entree soup (coconut) was some of the best I've ever had;  egg roll was crisp and fresh; drunken noodles came out piping hot and were tasty; portions were generous; my colleague picked up the check.

When you walk in its more like a diner rather than a coffee shop that I had expected . They have a nice area on the patio to eat as well as two rooms inside filled with old pictures , reminiscent of it's past. You can pick your own seats as well. My seat seemed as if it was going to break which was a little uncomfortable so I switched seats with a table near by . I found that the interior part of the restaurant was uncomfortable so we opted for the patio. The patio area is a nice shaded area. 

I got the frozen white chocolate mocha frappe and the salmon lox. Delicious ! They were both very good and the waitress even gave me a few more capers cause I'm a caper freak. Anywho , service was awesome and you can tell that everyone that works there cares about their customers. A few regulars came in and they greeted them welcomingly asking them how they've been etc . Was nice to see this and they even treated me like I've been going there along time . 

It's cute if you want a nice low key breakfast dinner not so good as a coffee place , but I know now ! I'll be back , maybe I'll be a regular too .",2014-07-07 00:15:45

The food here has improved quite a bit, I first came to Wok of Fame during it's soft opening. I must admit, they have made a lot of changes - for the better. 

Hot food was good, I TRIED to get a little bit of everything, but there was just too much food for one person to even try a piece of each. 

The mashed potatoes were a little strange... The consistency seemed like it was the packaged mashed potato and it had this.... seafood after-taste to it. I even asked my family about what they thought, and they agreed. The sashimi was cut a little too small. I'm used to sashimi being cut in the length of a credit card. However it was HALF the size of that. I guess I shouldn't really be complaining, as it is AYCE.

On the high notes, the chicken wings were deliciously moist and not over-salted. They DO have crab legs, however they aren't pre-cut like the ones at Mandarin are. Oh yes, and my favourite, they have coconut, mango, green tea and red bean ice cream! (They had me at coconut)

As for the decor, it's nice. However I feel like it's just too much. All of the different themes mushed together. I guess they were trying to do themed areas like Mandarin (like the Fish room, Bird room and Garden Room), but it just didn't work for Wok of Fame, because they didn't have walls to divide the themed areas.

All in all, Wok of Fame has redeemed itself from the disaster it was when I first went. For those that are wondering, ""Which is better, Mandarin or Wok of Fame?"" I'd say they're both different in their own ways - I can't really choose :(


FYI:  Always call to make reservations - JUST in case.",2014-01-30 15:05:41

If I were to rate the food it would be 5/5 no doubt, this is my favorite fast food joint.

However, when visiting this East Flamingo location I was very disappointed and left upset by the rude ""customer service"" I had in the drive thru. I always go to the one near my workplace on St Rose and they treat their guest excellently. Well during my drive thru visit the lady helping us out had us repeat our order several times and then when we corrected her she would say ""that's what I said"" when she didn't... When we asked to substitute something she said ""no you can't do it"" in a snarky tone.. might I add that I've done it before at the other location. Then at the window she just came across as snobby and not wanting to assist us.

Nearly all the restaurants were closing their kitchens, but Glass Nickel's kitchen is open until midnite, AND (this is key) they deliver.  For a business traveler with no rental car and not wanting to risk driving in the snow and ice, this is a huge convenience!

I got a sandwich and salad, and even though they said it might take as long as 45 minutes, there was a knock on my door in more like 30 minutes.  The sandwich was still hot and the salad greens were still cool, so I give them props for getting the order right and even getting the food to me at a nice temperature.

I went in tonight with Kim T. to talk about the upcoming Great Cajun Cookoff and Food Fest.  Knowing the Southern influence of the menu, we figured it would be appropriate to have a drink and an appetizer while pouring over the details.
Ambience - Love this room!  Open but not loud, very communal and comfortable.  The devil is in the details - and BT didn't miss a step anywhere!
Service -  Was flawless - thank you, Court!  This man knows the food and was great with suggestions!
Drink - Kim and I each had a Miss Katie's Pimm's Cup.  While I love ginger and cucumber together, I rarely order a Pimm's Cup, as I am not a fan of gin.  Miss Katie's is made with vodka - problem solved!  The only issue with this cocktail is that it goes down WAY too easy.  This drink could get me into a whole lotta trouble!  (Bring it on!!)  I asked Miss Katie if they carried Abita Beer (one of our favorites, from southern Louisiana).  She wasn't sure off the top of her head if they had it in or not, but was going to check.  She came back a few minutes later with a bottle of Abita Amber and 2 frosty pint glasses - poured the bottle into the glasses for us to split and offered it to us, gratis!  Now - THAT is beyond service!  I've been to restaurants that offered an amuse bouche - but never one with an amuse beer! :) 
Food - Looking at the menu, we decided not to split an appetizer.  Instead, we'd split an appetizer, a side and a dessert!  
The bread basket came with 2 fresh rolls with cheese, and one dark wheat roll - side of honey butter.  While they were fresh and hot and tasty, I really can't comment on the butter, as we never touched it - or the bread on its own, as we used it to soak up the mustard jus from the grits and sausage appetizer....
I heard great things about the grits and andouille sausage  appetizer - but was not expecting this level of amazing flavor.  I've never really liked grits and couldn't understand why people did.  Now I do!  Turns out, I'd never had them made well.  As Kim put it, they should be so rich you can hardly eat them.  (And they were!)  Not just andouille sausuage, either - there was also hot Italian sausage and a southwest chicken sausage - all from Schreiner's.  (Yay for supporting other local businesses!)
While I wasn't completely sold, Kim was stuck on the bacon and cheddar biscuits.  But, what the heck.  I like biscuits, I like cheddar and I love bacon - hard to make a misstep on this one, right?  They're served with an apple butter, which Court strongly urged us to use.  He was right!  WOW!  I think I may start craving these on a very regular basis!
For dessert, I could not choose.  Brioche bread pudding is on the menu.  I LOVE bread pudding.  That's one of my all time weakness foods.  The fig and pecan pie sounded really good, as did Death By Chocolate.  I asked Kim to choose...and she made it easy - we should make the meal a pork trifecta and have the BACON S'mores!  (Yes, that's my picture of them..)YOWZA!  Chocolate covered bacon, housemade marshmallow, graham crackers and peanut butter cream.  The dish is so wrong on so many levels that it turns the corner and ends up being very, VERY right! 

While it's bad business to suggest skipping an entree - and there are SEVERAL I look forward to trying - the other reviewers comments about large portions are dead on.  Granted, we started late and neither of us were super hungry - but the shared appetizer, side and dessert really was plenty for us and we left feeling full.  Had an entree been involved, there would have been leftovers, or - worse - no dessert!

Amazing place...what a great add for top notch places in the Valley!  Casual enough for everyday meals, but quality and style to impress the out of towners, too!

Rolling in the place is very nice with a large spacious room, high celings and booths adorning the sides of the place we are seated in circular table for 8 of us and immediately it is too hot and ask for the air to be turned on.  It came on brieflly but for the rest of the night it was quite warm in here. Female servers are dressed in old Southern times complete with very authentic looking outfits.   wine list was over priced but we found a nice value and went through 6 bottles before we were one. 

Menu is very basic with each of your entrees coming with small side of Mashed Potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and a tossed house salad which is with egg, crouton, beets, in a french dressing.    If you wanted dressing other than the french than they gave you choices but it was not a hand spun salad just the lettuce with dressing poured over it. 

Obviously Prime rib is brought to table in large rolling heated thing where they cut your piece to order based on size temperture and preferance. 7 Went with the various cuts of prime rib while one person opted for the Rib Eye.  Start with the Rib Eye... It was OK... really nothing to write home about and certainly not with the price points.  

The 7 Prime Ribs of Various shapes, size and Cuts were in short TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING.  The Prince Lawry or King something cut was 16 Ounce bone in $57.00   while the Lawry cut was $44.00 for 10 Ozs.  Either way you slice it each cut was tough period.  I have had better at weddings where they are serving 100 pieces of prime rib at time.  No way about it not one good piece of meat in the bunch. 

Server kept pushing sides... small scoop of spinach which was terrible $3.00 while $3.00 got you a spoonful of creamed corn that was very good.  $10.00 for wild 'Sizzling Mushrooms well they werent sizzling and the shoe string onion rings $10.00 were ice cold if not tasty.

The burgers were prepared perfectly cooked Medium.  We also ordered the cheeseburger egg roll which was amazing. While we waited the same cashier came over and give us a sample of the BBQ chips.

Drinks - happy hour is pretty decent I had the Summer Smash at it was tasty!  Loved it.

Food - Terrible!  My friend and I just got off work at 5:30 and were planning to head over to the Herberger Theatre for a 7:30 show.  We were hungry and excited to try a new spot.  Out of the recommendation of our waiter, we decided to have a few starters and share an entree.  Our waiter highly recommended the Tater Tots & Sopes.  The Taters are deep fried tots mixed with bacon and chive.  They were a bit salty and not as good as they sounded.  The Sopes were just terrible.  Imagine rubbery silver dollar sized Sopes with the worst tasting pork.  One bite is all it took and I wanted to vomit.  Onto the entree.  We decided to share the Mussels which took about 40 minutes to arrive at our table (no the waiter didn't mention how long it would take even though he knew we were planning to catch a show).  They were ""ok"", not out of this world.  It came with what was once toasted bread but I think when the toast is black, it's beyond toast, right?  Not impressed.

We left hungry and barely made it to our show at the Herberger.  Good news is the Herberger was serving up the most divine brownies that saved the evening! 

The moral of this story is don't go hungry.  Food sucks but happy hour is pretty decent. It's perfect if you want to chill-lax with colleagues or friends.",2012-08-27 17:43:05

We had high expectations after seeing the other yelp reviews and drooling over the menu, but for me those quickly faded within 15 minutes of entering.

I ordered  the wagyu burger.  Being the incredibly picky eater I am, I asked the server what would come on the burger.  He didn't exactly tell me everything on the burger that when I got it, I had to remove some stuff that I didn't want.  So that in itself ruined my experience.   The end result was okay but left a bad taste in my mouth.

Another instance of what I feel was bad communication was that I wanted to order a side of fries.  I knew they had fries as there were other entrees that had fries listed.  However, the waiter looked at me like I was from Mars when I asked if I could order a side of fries.

They bring around the various types of meat and cut off a portion for you.  The meat is pretty good, but I really hated myself by the time I left.

It started out with our waitress introducing a second waitress who was in training, selling it that we'd have twice the help.  Truth is, we had less help than expected.  Service was pretty slow, but the bigger issue I had was with the ordinary food.  

I ordered the roasted turkey dinner.  It looked and tasted like an upgraded TV dinner, only larger.  The slices were perfect like them came from the frozen package that way.  The potatoes were ordinarily and all I could think about during the meal was ""Is this at all better than a TV dinner?""   It wasn't bad.  It wasn't good either.

I got a LivingSocial coupon the other day, and I think this is the fastest I have ever used my coupon.  I have been wanting to try this place, and there's no better way than to drag my girl friend with me on a random Tuesday night armed with an empty stomach and gift certificate!

The interior hasn't changed much since it was ARPA (and on that note, I miss ARPA and their sangria by the pitcher).  We got a table quickly.  Our server greeted us and informed me (since I'm the newbie) that this is a non-profit establishment.  I think it's a very great concept and admirable thing to do (bravo to Chef Noble).  

We decided to split our ""loots"" since it was getting late and she wasn't too hungry.  Somehow we still managed to polish 2 appetizers, 1 meat and three and a dessert (as you can guess, it was mostly my doing... taking a bow here).  Deviled eggs was tasty, the filling was a little more liquid than I am used to, but it was still good.  Braised pork belly was fabulous; perfect balance of fat and meat... I think it was served on a bed of sauerkraut, which was a bit too salty.  Skillet fried chicken was crispy.  The breading didn't take away from the meat.  The 3 sides we picked were mac & cheese (fabulous, moist, just enough cheese sauce), pan seared cabbage (looked undercooked but wasn't, it was amazingly flavorful), and butter beans (another good one, I'm sure there's bacon in it, just have to!)

We closed out the night with a slice of Coconut Chess Pie, which was topped with a fluffy (big) dash of whipped cream.  The pie was a little hard (both the crust and the filling) but I love coconut, and it tasted good... not too sweet.  I think the most disappointing part of the meal was the butter that was brought out with the cornbread... it was bland... but I am picky about my butter.

I had this on my list of places to visit for sometime now but finally made it. I'm President of a HOA in Cornelius and we're getting ready to do some renovations and one of the bidders just finished doing the same type of work less than a mile from here. I volunteered to come down and take some pictures and guess what, accomplished two things today.

As we walked up the door, the hostess on the inside opened the door from my wife and myself and invited us in. Good Start. Then she escorted us to our table and our server showed up a short time later with ice water and menus. We gave our beverage orders and when he returned we had decided on what we wanted for lunch and with this menu with so many choices, it was difficult.

My wife took a chance of ordered Scallops over Risotto. The reason I said took a chance is that she rarely orders Scallops because the tend to be either over cooked and hard and rubbery or under cooked and a bit on the slimy side.  These were perfect and she ate everything on her plate. She's on a diet and rarely eats an entire course. The Mushroom Risotto which was the base for the Scallops was excellent.

I had the Lamb Burger with a side of Fries.  I normally order Lamb cooked medium rare to medium because it's too easy to over cook. This burger came out great. Full of flavor, juicy and a taste treat.  It was accented with Feta Cheese as well. The Fries were not the Shoe String cut we normally get but rather sliced potatoes that were fried and they were delicious.

In the course of lunch, the manager came over and inquired if we were satisfied which is normally the hallmark of a well run restaurant. Good hands on touch by all of the staff.

Good Food, great service and a nice atmosphere and next time, I won't need an excuse to drop in just because I was in the neighborhoo.",2016-07-24 02:44:42
EggNzUWaICseaSS9i2sHUQ,TaVuQWmXAhxy_LvIXBs9sg,7gHdVSAz_Dm1wS1ZImJSiQ,1,1,9,0,"Unfortunately like the other Yelp Elite '17 reviews for this location, I too had a negative experience with this place.

Don't get me wrong: It's a novel idea, The Baked Bear, you choose your own ""sandwich breads"", you choose the ice cream, put some toppings on, all under a $10 price point, but man... The business offers so many options but offers so few TYPES of options.

What do you mean, you ask? Maybe it's the lack of advertised features that would cater to a more relevant audience amongst millenials. Where are the lactose-free options? Where are the almond/soy milk options? I get that these products typically require more process handling and paperwork in the food service industry, but if you're going to set up shop in a place like SCOTTSDALE of all places, why would you choose to alienate such a large portion of your potential customer base? Total business opportunity lost here.

For a business that advertises frozen desserts as their prime point of engagement (PPoE) with customers, I'm left scratching my head as to what the business lifecycle plans are for this place. The hype isn't real, it seems to lack visible foundation for business longevity.

Also: 
-Why is their email address over 25 characters long? I checked online, there were definitely shorter domains available that'd be less of a PITA to type out.
-Why are there multiple network SSID's for the Baked Bear and no obvious signage anywhere in the store that talks about wifi use for customers? If none for the customers, you need to re-label your SSID's accordingly so people are not thrown off by this.
-Why is the lighting in this place so poor? It's 2017, the lighting style TBB currently chose is horribly dated.

If your employees are so completely out of touch that they lack the fundamentals of social bargaining platforms and its integration with point-of-sale (POS) systems, I question why the owners even turned to the Groupon platform. Why, you wanted to garner more business? If that's the case, you need to understand the platform and ensure SOP training is disseminated to employees before biting off more than you can chew. Otherwise, you get justifiably clueless employees, and worse, you get customers that get frustrated. Lines build up, customers talk, and as we say in the tech industry, ""Nothing is ever truly deleted off the Internet.""

Speaking of chewing, when I came here, nothing on the menu indicates they have lactose-free options. So here I am, Groupons in hand, and I can't use any of them unless I want to land on a toilet all day. My date ended up using one of them, but I couldn't use any for myself nor my son; we are both lactose intolerant and the menu indicates no options that are lactose-free and their marketing is lacking at best.

All in all, unfortunately, some shoddy business implementation, poor marketing management, and lack of cohesive general business best practices makes me say ""Eek! Methinks not"" as Yelp labels one star reviews. The business just reeks of uninformed business decision after uninformed business decision.",2017-01-24 08:09:00

This means that quality of service, atmosphere, etc. are not necessarily going to sway my review much.  With that said, this place had GREAT service.  Even though I came in with a coupon for $25, I felt like a regular customer within minutes!  The atmosphere is very upscale, and easy jazz music fills the dining area.  Oh, and they do have good Thai tea.

Now on to the food!  I ordered the tom kha soup with chicken (khi), the papaya salad, and the green curry with beef.  None of these were very memorable or impressive, unfortunately.  I also think that they Americanize a few dishes to some degree, but not as much as some other Thai restaurants.

The Tom kha was sweet with no lemongrass or galanga root.  The over all flavor was quite Americanized, in my opinion, and there wasn't anything that really stood out here.  The papaya salad was vinegary in flavor, and otherwise not notable.  The papaya was very crunchy though.  The green curry was suggested by my waitress as her favorite curry, although she didn't seem very enthusiastic about her own choice.  The green curry was a bit thicker than a lot other places, however it was rather light in the flavor department.  It seemed more like a stew with coconut juice mixed in.  On the plus side, it wasn't overly sweet.  The beef was a little tough though. I asked the waitress if the sweet sticky rice with custard was extremely sweet, or just a little sweet... she said that it was too sweet for her, so I passed on the dessert.  

Overall, I would say that it would be very easy to fall in love with this place if I lived in the area, and I didn't have a particular taste when it comes to Thai food.  However, I can't say that I can squeeze in that extra star for Panna Thai due to my picky, snobby opinions.  Sorry, Panna!",2010-10-28 02:19:44

Although there are now many other dining establishments available if you want Chinese cuisine closer to home - Sang Ho is worth the idling on the DVP to reach downtown China Town.  Yes - the food here is THAT good.  

I brought a friend on a dining adventure to Sang Ho just to prove that the best Chinese food is NOT in his humble abode of Richmond Hill.  My personal opinion is that all the pretentious, so-called ""fine-dining"" Chinese restaurants are located in ""Rich""mond Hill.  If you want to get ripped off for mediocre food, then go ahead and eat up there!

I ordered:
Peppered Eggplant & Oysters - served in a sizzling pot with oyster sauce, scallions and ginger.  This is absolutely a divine dish.  And again I have to give kudos to my Uncle Ming for having introduced me to this heavenly dish.  Even fussy kids who don't eat vegetables will love this dish.  The oysters are deep fried, and the flavours of the sauce, scallions and ginger penetrate deeply into the dish to pack it with intense flavour.  If you order nothing else - order this dish!

Beef Brisket Chow Mein - Their beef brisket was not lacking in flavour.  You can tell they definitely pan-fry the beef brisket to seal in the juices and have the beef fuse with the sauce.  My dining companion practically licked the plate clean.  

Shiitake Mushrooms with Pea Shoots - I just can't have dinner sans a vegetable dish so I opted for pea shoots.  Again, it was packed with intense flavours stemming from the mushrooms and oyster sauce combo.

Verdict:

My dining companion is absolutely enamoured by this hidden gem in China Town.  He said he loved all 3 dishes, and the dessert was even more divine.  It was a taro, tapioca, red bean sweet soup.  We finished about 2 bowls each and it took every ounce of self control not to say yes when the server asked if we wanted seconds!  The bill with tax and tip came to under $50 for 2 people, with some leftovers for lunch.  I am kind of glad I live farther away from this restaurant, as if I lived within proximity, I would probably become obese!  

I think the variance in reviews for restaurants rests a lot on menu selection.  Sometimes, not knowing what to order, or ordering the wrong thing is what differentiates a 1 star review vs. a 5 star review.  I hope everyone who reads this review will give Sang Ho a try!",2011-07-21 13:28:07

Mentor Oh.

How can you not love a place that gives you a plate of house made pickles when you sit down. Yumm.

We have herd about the Manhattan Deli from numerous friends that live in Mentor, so when we were at Roma's last hair appointment, we thought we'd drop in since it is right down the street form L&G.

When you first walk in, you see the classic deli counter with meats and prepared foods for purchase to take home. Corn beef, pastrami, Latka, ext. along with baked good and pastries.

Our waitress, Rhonda was a very pleasant and polite mature woman who was very informative and insightful of the menu and specials. She also came to the table with the plate of delicious pickles, so in my book she's awesome!

Since this was our first time, naturally I had a little tasting of many things to truly give an accurate depiction of our dining experience.

For starters, we ordered a hummus plate, zucchini sticks, and a huge Greek salad. 

The hummus was almost inedible, I don't know if it was the tahini or the citrus, but it did not taste anything like hummus, and it came with pre-packaged squares of pita that were so dry they were almost rubbery. 

The zucchini stick were thick spears coated in a crunchy thin breading, these were probably some of the best I had ever had. I could eat these all day. 

Roma and I shared the Greek salad; small baby olives, oil and vinegar, cucumbers, red onions, and a pile of feta. Pretty tasty!

For the main course we ordered Beef Shawarma, Falafel, and Latka. 

The beef was thin strips, over cooked with old seasoning caked on each strip. Even with all the seasoning, they had very little if no flavor at all. Sitting on a pile of chopped iceberg lettuce with pickled beets and a side of tahini, Yikes that's alotta salad!

I was so looking forward to having the falafel, but man what a disappointment. Again, they were so dry, I almost had to dip them in my water just to ensure I could digest them. No flavor what so ever.

Then there was the Latka, another disappointment. Yes it was cooked fresh, and yes it looked delicious. But they were bitter and almost sour tasting. Even with some apples sauce, I couldn't eat them.

The saving grace for this experience was the desert. Roma had the lemon cheesecake, and I had the carrot cake. Both were absolutely delicious, but wouldn't you know, they weren't even made by the restaurant, they buy them from a local bakery. Surprise!

I guess this is all do to my willingness to be daring, and seeking some true ethnic cuisine. Everyone that suggested this place recommended the brisket, or the pastrami. I wish we would have stuck with that. I am not writing this place off yet. I will be going back and trying some of the more popular dishes. When I do I will hopefully be able to rewrite this review.",2013-10-20 18:30:45

I've been here twice now: once to try their sushi set, and another time to have a chef's choice $150 meal. Both times were fantastic. The chef's choice, if you ever get the chance, is great. You basically tell the sushi chef that you'd like the chef's choice and give a price point and the chef will prepare you a meal of whatever they want to fit into your budget. It's different from an omakase since those include already prepped food. This was purely just fish. I was floored with the selection I ended up getting - the use of scallops and uni and tuna were amazing. The chef took time to explain to us each time he brought a new item to our plate.

This is hands down my favorite location.  It's a little more spacious, has diner bar seating, and the employees just seem happier.  The food quality and plating seems better here too. I love the variety on Black Bear's menu and the ability to get breakfast food any time or the ""little less bear"" or what I call the ""small bear"" portions as the regular portions are hearty.

Make the turn onto Mariner where Buca di Beppo is, then look for Regatta and make a left. You'll be surprised to find such a beautiful wine store and restaurant overlooking their own lake, across from other beautiful houses and condominiums. 

They have a heated patio and outdoor seating. The hostess, Tina, really wants you to sit outside. I have an inkling it's because there's a different server for outdoor seating and she needs to help the server out, but we opted for indoor seating and ended up with Laurel as our server.

She was very professional, nice, prompt, and sweet. She knew her menu well and was even able to provide vegetarian options to someone from another table. 

The wine store is beautifully lit, has some of the awards they have received, and is a great deal for people who like to dine with wine, because normally wines are marked up 300% at a fine-dining establishment, but if you dine with Marché Bacchus and buy a bottle of wine and get it served there, the mark-up is generally only around 30%. 

I've been to Marché Bacchus twice, once last year and once yesterday. Both times, the food was solid, and the service was friendly and professional. 

This time around, I ordered the 

Escargot: sea snails with melted herb butter. ""Monte au beurre,"" right chef? You can never have too much butter. It was great for dipping the fresh bread they brought us as well.

Moules Frites: There aren't too many first bites where I wish I could have another first bite of that same exact bite. This was one of those rare moments. My palate was so lucky as to taste this mussel washed over with this great sauce. The taste of alcohol and butter and the freshness of the mussels really created a mezcla of bliss for a moment in time. Then I quickly went back for more. The fries are really crispy, not made in-house, probably come from a large brown bag, but the starch they battered the fries in really made the fries very crispy. Delectable! No ketchup for me!

Half-Pound Burger: Überly soft bread, perfect medium-temperature patty, melted cheese, fresh and slightly pickled rings of onions crowned the patty, and again the same delicious and crispy fries. How could I ever be a vegetarian?

Rum Bread Pudding: Order this 30 minutes in advance. Last year, my server forgot to order it as he was supposed to time the ordering. This year, Laurel made sure to remember and even let us know when she ordered it, right around before the entreés were going to come out. When the bread pudding came out, there was a side of cinnamon apple sauce that went quite well with the bread pudding. I must add that the bread pudding was not as moist as bread puddings should normally be. Bread pudding was traditionally made with left-over bread and needed to be moist because it was supposed to be drenched in custard as that would help the bread soften. Of course, it was still very yummy. 

Last year, I also had their charcuterie. From what I recall, the charcuterie had a very nice mix of pear, apple, candied walnuts, and different cheeses and thinly sliced meats. My eyes couldn't help but glance over to the 11-top next to me when the platters of fromage came to their table. There were apricots, pickles, cheeses, and slices of apples on their plates. Everything looked really delicious, even as I was ready to leave. 

I am excited about my next visit to Marché Bacchus and hope it won't be another year before I come back.",2011-12-23 19:51:49

The coffee is bad. It has been burnt both times I have visited in the early mornings, despite my hope that the first time was an isolated incident.

Also, the coffee only comes in small cups. I wanted a 20 oz. jar of rocket fuel, but settled for 12 oz. of undrinkable ash.

The pizzas are made to order and take at least fifteen minutes.  Surprisingly there are no stool at the tables if you are waiting or if you want to eat it there, which I did.

I love love love pizza and had never had a Chicago-style deep dish pizza before.  I ordered a personal Chicago Classic (pepperoni and Italian sausage).  The crust was really good.  There was a lot of tomato sauce ... too much, I thought.  The pizza and the abundant sauce wasn't overly hot, though.

When I started eating it, it got colder as I got to the inside and I noticed the cheese inside wasn't even melted.  So I took it back to the guy at the counter and asked to have it put back in the oven.  It came out five minutes later.  The cheese was melted, the pizza was hotter (but not piping hot) but they'd put more cold sauce on top.

All in all, it wasn't a bad pizza.  I did like it better once I scraped off a lot of the sauce.

I thought the Sunday Morning cupcake (pancake-flavored cake topped with maple cream cheese icing and 3 little squares of bacon) tasted good and was surprisingly balanced--the extreme sweetness of maple icing is offset by the size of the ""cake"" part of the cupcake.  The bacon on top is a nice touch both for taste and aesthetic.  The Snickerdoodle cupcake was warmly received but short of anything in the realm of extraordinary--a buttercream frosting would have been preferred over the cream cheese-based frosting used.  It's a tough crowd: a cupcake would have to go a long way to top current office favorites White Flower Cake Shoppe and Flour Girl.

So, no, Colossal Cupcakes are not the most amazing cupcakes in the Greater Cleveland area, but I think they are a solid go-to place to get some cupcakes for dessert before you head home or to take back to the office and sing that stirring little anthem of wellness: ""Get well.  Get well soon.  We want you to get well.""

I've been to Pho Tai Loi and Arigato before as well as the Lemon Grass and Pepper place and I have to say the prices for the quality of the food in here is really great value for reasonable prices all around.

Parking here tends to be a little crazy and the entire building just seems out of place.  For being east on Dixie (right on Dixie) and south of Eglinton, north of Burnhamthorpe this place technically has both the closest Japanese food (not just sushi) and Vietnamese from where I live.  

While I'm writing this I realize this place for me only really matters for the food court and it's a decent variety of places to pick from.  Being in close proximity to Central Etobicoke I'd recommend it for small groups that can't decide what kind of Asian food they want to eat  because you're pretty well covered here.

Most of the Metroparks are free to get into, but Holden is special in that it is very well maintained and has more to offer than just a visitors center and some bridal trails. There is the newer canopy walk and emergent tower ($4 extra for adults); several interactive stations for children to dig up earth, explore a log cabin, mini zip line, color/stamp (so great for kids); there are tons of scenic spots with benches to rest and take in the beauty of nature or pose for pictures (so great for the elderly or newly engaged couples); plants and trees are all labeled; there's a butterfly garden; they offer classes and tours (I saw a limo golf cart taking people around the trails); heck it's so nice you could even have a wedding here! 

If you're a family who values the outdoors they have a $75 membership that covers two adults, four children, and gets you into the Botanical Gardens as well. Seems like a pretty good deal!

My only issue is that I drove an hour from the west side to do the canopy walk and tower only to find out that they had sold out hours before (you cannot get advanced tickets, first come first served). Last ticket sales usually end at 4pm (to give people plenty of time to get through before the park closes at 5pm), but apparently it was an extra crazy busy day so there was a couple hour wait to do the walk and tower so they had stopped selling tickets around 2pm. 

The gentleman at the entrance could tell I was heartbroken so he let me in the park for free so that I could still enjoy the fall colors through my tears of disappointment. Seriously appreciate that kind gesture and will definitely make the long drive back to check out the canopy walk and tower before it closes for the season November 1st (but at like 9am to secure a ticket!).

The Parlour downstairs is a classy little lounge/bar.

Food wise, it's nothing special. I prefer burrito boys, but I'd take them over chipotle. Their rice was incredibly dry though, when it actually hurts to eat it already. I mean, not the entire rice on my burrito, but enough for me to notice. I'm talking about when you refrigerate the rice and did not cover it... It'll get crazy hard... Ya... That. I'm sure it was just a bad day for the rice as I didn't read any comment about it. 

I'd give them a four if it wasn't for that rice.

The not so good: The basil drink (I know people like it, I thought it had an odd flavor...not basil -y.....and it had weird jelly things in it and the texture was off putting), the bbq platter (we got two of these and they just weren't very good - they had sliced beef (which was cold and bland), chicken wings that had the entire wing (also not much flavor and difficult to eat), and a beef skewer, which was ok, but nothing special), all the fish dishes (the amok fish sounded amazing with a curry sauce, but I thought it was lacking flavor, the mango fish - just not a lot of mango flavor or maybe not enough for this non fishy fish eater, and the seafood plate which was just plain fish, shrimp, and squid....yikes), the springroll (was ok, nice and crispy, but the filling had an odd flavor).

I've heard good things about Diana's Oyster bar, so I decided to try.

My friend and I ordered the 12 malpeque oysters for $15, and I added 2 kumamoto and 2 kusshi oysters because I heard that they are good. The one that I think was kumamoto was good, but kinda pricy. At $4.20 an oyster, it was really fresh and tasty (it's like I could taste the ocean), but it was also very small (see pic). The kusshi (2.90 an oyster) were good too. The malpeque oysters were decent.

I also ordered the Oyster Rockefeller. That was basically a baked fanny bay oyster. 3 oysters for 13 bucks. I think I enjoyed this more than raw oysters. I really wish they had more cooked oyster varieties.

When he first received it, he thought ""that's it for 33 bucks?"" He enjoyed the halibut the most, but the rest were only okay.

One thing about service was that it was okay. When we almost finished our meal, we looked around and saw that other people got bread before their meal. My friend said ""we didn't get any bread?"" Lol we should have asked for the bread, because after spending 100 bucks on our meal for 2 people, I was still kinda hungry.

Service was quick, but friendliness were kinda meh, and we felt we were kinda being rushed.

So after today, I probably won't return here for more oyster adventures. Nothing wrong with the food, but I found that raw oysters is probably not for me. In general, prices were also a bit expensive and the cost exceeds value of the food. But that's the cost of going into unknown territories!

I'd rate this 8/10 for quality, 4.5/10 for value, 6.5/10 for service. 6.5 overall (not an average).",2014-11-04 03:07:09

There are lots of dishes to choose from off the menu (Chinese to colonial European-Chinese fusion) plus lunch & chef's specials posted on the walls.  I opted for the lunch special chicken & rice Macau style which comes with soup and coffee or tea ($1 extra to make it ice).  

The main itself didn't look that impressive when it arrived, very simple with a bowl shaped mound of rice and chicken & onions in a yellow sauce.  The sauce is coconut based with a hint of curry which was tasty and not spicy.  The chicken pieces were deep fried and tender but more bone than meat and the onions were pretty much raw.

Overall the meal wasn't the greatest but the efficient and attentive service made up for that which was a nice surprise in Chinatown.  I probably ordered the wrong thing but will return to try one of their popular baked dishes next time.",2017-07-15 16:54:22
FyUsqOCjl_mZ-ki3g-6HAg,zo2vscKNvDzXWj7YOrdJVA,Cyy95sS5r6MGzgEA4UZX5g,4,11,3,5,"It has taken me a while to figure out how to rate Parlour.

Parlour is not your regular salon.  It is a large room filled with artists.  If your experience with hair before has been stylists doing a fair to pretty good job, you will be impressed by Parlour.  The staff here take pride in their work and truly perform masterpieces.

A week ago I had my hair cut and coloured here, and really enjoyed it.  I wanted to wait a few days to see how the hair was working out and to sort out my ratings system.  Overall, 4 stars.  But, the breakdown is as such:

Decor: Okay.  The pictures on Yelp were taken a while back I think.  I guess I had high expectations as this place was top rated and raved about.  But, the couch could be replaced, there is paint chipped in the back and the green in the bathroom makes ya kinda dizzy.  There is however this amazing painting in the bathroom that I so love and want to have in my apartment!!!!  Decor rating: 3 stars

Hair cut:  I was fortunate enough to have Brionie cut my hair.  This girl is amazing!  Turns out, as I was waiting for Brionie to come into the salon, I was staring at this woman who looked so familiar but I couldn't place her.  Said woman sat next to me and had her hair coloured.  Turns out it was Brionie's mom and I had worked at the same law firm as her when I just got out of university.  Small effen world.

Brionie looked at my hair and decided to flat iron it first before cutting.  I was impressed.  I have very fine hair and by flat ironing it, she was able to give me va-va-voom layers that I have never been able to get my regular hair dresser to do.  *disclaimer - still love my regular hair dresser, Brionie is an artist and was able to sculpt my tresses into the ability to have Texan big hair opportunity if I so choose to do so*

I must also stress that Brionie has the touch of an angel.  Very, very gentle and relaxing!!  Highly, highly, highly recommend Brionie.  I will be back to have her cut my hair.  5+++++ stars!!!  Cost for hair cut - just over $60

Colour:  I noticed not many other people were getting their hair coloured (just Brionie's mom and I).  I thought this was kind of odd, but didn't pay too much attention to it.  Once Brionie gave me a kick ass hair cut, I was whisked off to get coloured by Francis (aka Franz).  Francis looked at my hair and listed to my thoughts.  I usually stick with a form of red and he found a colour that matched my skin tone PERFECTLY.  He highlighted in the right spots, and left other spots untouched.  The end result - a masterpiece that just ""highlighted"" my cut.  I was impressed.

I must also point out that when Francis washed my hair, I was in heaven.  My scalp and hair want to marry his fingers.  

When Francis styled my hair he even gave me some handy tips and did a great job!

Cost for hair colour - $145.  Yes, $145.  I wish I was lying or kidding here, alas I am not.  This is part of the reason that it took me so long to write this review.  I love the colour, but I cannot afford the price.  When I looked on Parlour's website, the costs were expensive, but within reason.  Had I known it was going to cost me that much to have my hair coloured by Francis, I wouldn't have done it.  That being said, again, I love the colour and have had tons of compliments.  I just can't justify the cost.  Overall colour - 5 stars, cost....1 star.

I will be back to Parlour, oh yes I will be back.  But, only for a cut.  I am also thinking with the prices they charge for colour that they could roll on some new paint and get a new couch and chair (the one you sit in to have your colour set is literally falling apart).

I was impressed that I was served coffee...which was awesome and greatly appreciated!!

A final note....check out Sergio.  There is something cute and different about him!!",2009-12-14 01:21:58

Their bar area is really nice and I often prefer to sit in the lounge than in the actual restaurant. The food is good and their drinks menu is extensive.

It's a steal if you catch them when they have a bulk-buying option.  Last time we went, we got to choose 5 different meats for $20 (any type of smokey, any flavor of chicken sausage, polish boys are Slovenians, thick or thin cut bacon, and smoked brats or raw brats).  They say that you get a pound of each, but you actually get over a pound.  It really is a steal.

The cajun smokies are HOT, but so good.  My favorite are the honey.  You should try them all to find your favorite.

We are not fans of their Polish Boys at all.  We thought they had a really odd flavor, and my boyfriend didn't even want to finish one because he was so turned off by it.  Next time, we'd get the Slovenians instead.

The brats were good, although not particularly memorable.

For bacon, the BF chose the thick cut, and I thought it was really gross.  Far too fatty.  Every time he cooked some up, he had to trim the fat off because it was inedible.  Get the thin cut instead.

We chose the Apple Chicken Sausage which was seriously out of this world.  Definitely my favorite from the sausage/brat grouping.

Word of caution- Make sure you store everything properly.  Our smokies got moldy in about a day and a half, and we had to toss them.  We weren't too pleased.  The Polish Boys went moldy in about 3 or 4 days.  Do yourself a favor, and keep things frozen until you plan to use them.  Otherwise, you're throwing money away.

My only wish is that I knew the practices of how they raise the animals they use.  I prefer grass-fed, pasture-raised animals.  When I asked the gentleman helping us last time, he said he didn't know how the animals were raised.  Bummer.",2011-03-19 16:39:07

Dinner is $18 and Lunch is $10.  Visit during typical lunch and dinner hours (so you know the food has just been put out).  It's usually busy during these hours, though the restaurant is quite large so you can usually still be seated.  

ASIAN DELICACIES
Lots of food you'd find at a typical asian buffet such as fried rice, chinese seafood.  
The have some sepcial food such as frog legs, squid, scallops, mussels, and raw oyster.  
The CRAB LEGS, probably the most expensive item there, were immensely popular and had a line of several people the entire night.  I think some people just go here for the crab legs.

SUSHI:
This is one of the highlights, as the sushi is quite good.  It's hand-rolled and there were two dedicated cooks there rolling sushi the entire time.  
There's lots of variety including california rolls, philadelphia rolls, rainbow rolls, and different sashimi.  

SALAD and FRUIT BAR:
Most of what you'd expect at a typical salad and fruit bar.

SOUP:
Wide variety of soup to choose from including sweet and sour, wonton, clam chowder, etc...

MONGOLIAN BBQ STATION:
I have to say this is a nice touch.  You have several things to pick from such as vegetables, pineapple, noodles, SHARK, and sauces, and the some guy will throw it on a teppanyaki grill for you.  

DESSERT area:

Walking in the decor was like any other chain restaurant, nothing special. I did like the bar area, had extra tables to eat at if you didn't feel like waiting in line and if you wanted to sit at the bar there weren't any video poker machines so you could actually sit at the bar and eat and drink without having the glare and screaming lights telling you that you too could get a royal flush.

The service was nothing short of excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly. Every server said hi, bye, smiled, quick, attentive, almost seemed like it was their first week and were trying to impress. Bartender even came around out of the bar to take more drink orders. Very strange but me likey.

Food? I see that they were voted Best of Las Vegas 2010, but I have to say I liked the barbecue at Lucille's better than the food here. Their signature wings were pretty good, definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings, meat wise anyways, the barbecue sauce was so so but still I will be going back for the wings.  As for everything else, I had the brisket, half a chicken, half a slab of ribs, the green beans, fires, baked beans, and garlic mashed potatoes.....don't judge me. The brisket was okay, I had to keep saucing it up, I would of rather had the tri tip at Lucille's. The chicken wasn't the half rotisserie chicken I was expecting, it was more like a pigeon leg but... it was decently flavored. The ribs were good, nothing to write home about but good enough. The sides though? I'd pass, nothing really stood out and I actually didn't finish them. The service was good but the food was just not as good as Lucille's or even close to the barbecue down South.

It's sectioned off, with a playground for the older kids and a separate one for the smaller toddlers. Then, there's a variety of water sprouts, fountains, even a small wading area. The cool thing is that the kids can turn these waters on themselves!

Mmmmm those pork meatball skewers were packed full of flavor with a drizzle of BBQ sauce on them. Yummy. I could sit and just eat a plate of those balls and be satisfied.

Tonight we went because we were feeling to lazy to make dinner. It was Mother's Day, but it was just me and my boyfriend. When we first entered there were 4 staff standing around the hostess stand talking. We walked up to them and literally stood there awkwardly for 5 minutes waiting for them to acknowledge us. Then the guy says to us before even ""welcome"" or anything was ""we're all out of ribs, steak and salmon tonight"". Ok, Hi to you too. 

There was a 30 minute wait for a table, which we were kind of expecting because it was mother's day and we assume it would be busy. But then when we walked through the restaurant to our seats there were empty tables. 

When we ordered they were out of the appetizer we requested (stuffed mushroom caps), and they were also out of croutons for the salad. Seriously did they not order enough food for mothers day weekend? I mean all of this food I'm sure is made off site and then reheated in the kitchen.  How can they run out of so many different things? This place desperately needs some retraining of staff and new management.

T1JhitOIUAQAOje1THVOBw,XfZ9TO6ZWJLp0vbUCm6g4w,iSjFKxNpMg750rOY-6wJbw,3,4,2,1,"Next time I see a review of something with only 3 stars and 22 reviews, I'll take notice. Ah Yelp, you've been my guide in my new city on many many, many many, maaaaaany, occasions. I used you to check out this event and did not take heed of any of the naysayers. 

You see, I was already biased. I lived in Cincinnati, OH where our Taste of Cincinnati, was a HUGEEEEE event every year. I figured you couldn't go wrong with an event like this. I'm not saying this event was all bad by any means, but I had pretty high standards to compare it to. 

1. Tokens? Ok I can see why they are possibly a better alternative, but did you have to make them so expensive??? Seriously! I think it ended up being almost a $1.50 per token and half the stuff there was 3 to 4 tokens. I could have just saved my cash and gone to the Chinese restaurant, New Zealand that I love so much and had a much better ENTIRE meal for waaaaay less than I paid for the morsels of food I got. I felt like I paid nearly 5 dollars for a sample. That really bummed me out. Being new here, I didn't realize they had a Living Social deal either, so I saved no money. 

2. Hooters? Really? No, I'm not some girl bashing the lovely ladies of Hooters either. I think it's a fun place myself, but not at an event like this. I hated seeing how many chain restaurants there were. At home it was almost ALL local eateries with huge portions and amazing food. 

3. The size was much smaller than ours at home too. For what I paid in tokens I just really expected more. I may go back next year, but only if I can find a deal like they were running this year. Like, for example I got a CAN of blue moon. It was 4 tokens... That means it was over $5 for a can of beer. I know compared to the sporting events that's not bad, but wow. Just. Wow. 

Now, there was some good stuff too, hence the 3 stars. 

1. I had a great time just seeing my new surroundings, but if I were a local, it'd be old news. 

2. I LOVED all the free samples of random stuff. 

3. The NBA park was cool, and the booth that trimmed the facial hair for men was pretty neat. 

4. Parking was MUCH easier than ours in Cincy. We paid about $4, and were just a couple blocks away. 

5. One bakery was selling tasty little cupcakes for one token. They were one of the few who even had anything to offer for a token. 

6. They had some unique booths and cooking demos, that looked sort of interesting although we didn't stop to partake in any of the demos. 

All in all, really I just expected much more though. If you're a newbie next year, like I was this year, I'd say go and check it out, but look for discounts online. It is extremely crowded, but I was used to that from ours so be prepared if you've never been to a Taste event.",2012-06-12 19:33:46

TkuBoCQB3gHcFUdMvfm0TA,-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,3,1,0,0,"Stayed at the Las Vegas this past weekend and I have to say it was pretty average.  It's definitely not shiny and new like the Aria, elegant like the Wynn or hip like every hotel on the strip but there are a few pros to the LVH and some cons too.

For this trip I decided I was tired of wasting my money on a baller hotel room that I barely used and decided to book cheap here as I've stayed here when I was 21 and broke.  The hotel has significantly changed since then.  When I booked the room, they had a wide variety of rooms to reserve and their respective price points which gave you an idea that you get what you pay for.  So I went very cheap, booked their lowest priced room, no view, no freebies, nothing.

The front desk experience well, they just want you in and out before the line grows and I can't blame them, that line does get long.  I'll skip the details of what went on.  Checked into the room and it was pretty standard for any Hilton.    The room itself was very inconsistent.  It had a flat screen TV, a newer credenza but the rest of the furniture in the room didn't match, like the nightstands were from 10-years ago, the lamps were from 5-years ago, the carpet must've been changed in 2-3 years, etc.  However, the bathroom, man...talk about blast from the past!  It had the Hollywood style lights, you know, the two strips of white bulbs.  A pink countertop and a huge soaking tub/shower which was that faux marble looking crap that had to be from the 70's.  It felt like I was in that movie, ""Hot Tub Time Machine.""  Just because it looked old, I questioned it's cleanliness but that's just me.  Overall though, the room was great and the bed was super comfy, as if I've never slept any better in my life!

Oh yeah, the room safe didn't work but got charged $3.00/day for it anyways.  What a rip off.  I didn't notice it until I got the e-mailed folio but, it's not worth fighting over.

The pool area is disappointing.  They had no umbrellas or trees, not to mention the pool was quite small.

The rest of the hotel/casino was okay, it's mostly a chill, older crowd, but an oasis if you want to get away from the bustling strip.  Speaking of which, it's a little bit of a ways from the strip so you'll need a car or, just jump on the Monorail or the Deuce to find your way there.

If you do self-parking, it can be pretty hard to find a spot, especially during the evenings but, why bother with the hassle when there's free valet parking?  And PLEASE, tip the valets, they haul ass running through that 100f+ parking lot to get your car.

Overall, had a nice stay at the LVH.  I'd stay again but I'd choose a ""Deluxe"" or ""Superior"" room the next time around.",2010-07-05 23:21:53

We sat outside on the patio in the bar area, and our server was friendly, but the overall atmosphere was not what we expected.  The bar area itself was pretty unkempt with used glasses and half-eaten baskets of chips strewn about, but our table itself was not that dirty.  The flatware and appetizer plates, however, matched the decor of the bar and we had to ask for new sets twice before settling on some that we could use.  

We both had a regular margarita made with Patron silver on the rocks, and while they were not overly sweet, the taste of tequila was pretty negligible.  Since it was hot out, they still tasted good, but not good enough to order more than one.  After getting our drinks, we tried an order of the Chips, Salsa & Guacamole from the appetizer menu, and an order of the ceviche.  The guac was pretty good (but lacked salt), and we liked the salsa, but the seafood in the ceviche was definitely not ""cooked"" all the way.  I would say stick to the easy to prepare items on the menu as far as food goes (the ceviche should be a hard pass), as the focus seems to be more on quantity and not quality.

Also worth noting is that when we asked for our check, our friendly server suddenly turned into our SLOW server, and it took more than 15 minutes for her to just run our card.  I would recommend paying with cash if you can, as it seemed like a few other tables around us were riding on the same train of frustration when it came time to pay.

Overall, there are better spots to grab a quick drink and a good bite to eat, but if you do stop in here, try the inside dining area for a more enjoyable dining experience.

First time here, not like anybody would ask us. 

Seated and greeted. Ordered some drinks, soda, coffee, cocktail. The coffee was awful, it was sitting for a few hours and kinda cold. The second cup, which I had to request since nobody was going to ask for refills on their own accord apparently...(wait..is this brunch?) Was *hotter* but still bad and tasteless. Seems like they use real cheap stuff. I had to get a real cup of coffee after we left.

One person in my party thought they cocktail tasted like ""cheap rail"" and was done really poorly. That person didn't order a second drink. Not worth the 10-13$ that i'm sure it as.

Food took over thirty mins to come to the table. Bacon was chewy and in my opinion, simply gross. Eggs were bland, the toast wasn't even toasted, and the potatoes were just okay. The other people in my party did not enjoy their meals and I'm not even sure if we were asked how it was overall.

Lots of checkout lanes with even some self checkout lanes.

Had to come here the other day to pick up a few things for a family BBQ. Scored a nice six pack of chicken breast, bottle of BBQ sauce, and a Carvel cake for a cousin's B-Day. Everything was on sale - bonus! Love the chocolate crunchies in that ice cream cake!

However, since there are so many different shoes on display the sizes are kept elsewhere.  You can feel free to browse through, but in order to try on shoes you need to wait for an associate to finish with another customer until you get to monopolize their time getting them to disappear into what I'm assuming is a giant shoe warehouse with boxes galore. 

So if you know what you're looking for and you know your size it might not take long.  If you are like me and happened to bring your five year old with a love of all things pretty, but dislike of all things uncomfortable good luck.  We were also sized professionally which helps tremendously.

The prices at the Shoebox are competitive and like I said there is a vast selection.  You can choose from steel toe work shoes to cowboy boots to hiking sandals to athletic styles and fashion tennis shoes.  Really, they've most likely got it.  And good quality name brands in a well laid out store.

But if you or someone you know has sensory issues this is not the store for you.  It is very crowded, colorful, since there are so many shoes it is overwhelming as well.  There's a lovely parrot that loves to talk but will bite for added entertainment.

My suggestion is to try across the street at their outlet first.  The shoes that are on clearance are all out and grouped by style.  You don't need to wait for assistance, but you can ask one of the associates.  The high quality shoes that may be discontinued are on sale and a few things are a steal.  

I highly recommend this shoe store for their assortment and quality, but again you will need a bit more patience here and it will take a bit longer than typical shoe stores.",2017-07-15 19:46:20

odUEbQ6sYUEuNKXDXgWC4g,-eRl2zFyQP5Hv7ZdCyN7YA,cicPsia8Wj-DNRkmLbD_xg,1,0,0,0,"We decided to celebrate Mother's Day a day early.  We arrived at The Keg at 5:30 pm and checked in at the hostess desk.  The lobby was pretty empty with only a few guests standing around.  For a party of 8 people (including a 6 year old child), we were told it would be a 1 to 1.5 hour wait for a table in the dining room.  We were also advised that we could have a beverage or eat in the lounge as an alternative (which we have quite happily done in many past visits).  I put our name down on the waiting list for a dining table, received a pager and said we would wait in the lounge/perhaps eat there if we could find a table.  

We entered the lounge and it was approximately half full.  So at this point, between the people in the lobby and the lounge, it did not appear that there were that many people waiting for the dining room.  It did not appear that there were any other parties of 8 ahead of us in the wait.  How the wait could be already 1 to 1.5 hours when the restaurant is a fair size with many tables that could accommodate 8 people is beyond comprehension (I had no idea it would get worse).

We walked through the entire lounge and could not find seating for 8 people.  There were many large tables that were being inefficiently used (i.e. there was table for 8 people but only 2 guests were sitting in the middle of the table).  There was also a table for 14 set up at the back of the lounge with only 2 guests sitting at it, waiting on the rest of their party to arrive.  The bottom line is there was nowhere to sit in the lounge for dinner for 8 people due to the very inefficient and inconsiderate manner in which guests had sat.

We sat at the bar and enjoyed a beverage thinking that the 1.5 hour ""upper end"" of the hostess' wait-time quote might be high since there didn't seem to be that many people waiting for dining tables.  By 6:30 pm, my 6 year old son, who is a very well behaved child, was beginning to fade so I decided to check in with the hostess on our timing.  The hostess was quite rude and confirmed that we were still waiting and that she quoted us 1.5 to 2 hours when we checked in (which is untrue - she said 1 to 1.5 hours).  

I returned to my family at the bar and updated them.  We thought we would try to keep waiting as it was getting late to try to go find another place to eat.  We ended up just sitting and drinking water at the bar for quite a while.  Several times, the bartender noted (with surprise) that we were STILL waiting to which we all confirmed (with despair).  It seemed completely ridiculous to everyone at this point.  The wait time was completely unreasonable given that we arrived at 5:30 pm to a basically empty lobby and a half-full lounge.  I also believe a party of 8 people is not that large or unreasonable - but apparently, The Keg cannot reasonably handle parties of 8.

After 2 hours and 15 minutes of waiting, at 7:45 pm, our pager finally lit up and we were seated in the dining room.  The manager spoke with us and I expressed our frustration at the situation.  He apologized for the wait and compensated us by offering to cover our beverages we had consumed while waiting and sent some appetizers to our table.  We ordered dinner promptly and finally, dinner arrived at 8:30 p.m.  

At this point, my 6 year old suddenly felt unwell due to being overtired and started crying.  This is very unlike him so he must have truly felt unwell.  We asked to speak to the manager again as we wanted him to see the outcome of this ordeal (i.e. not the happy ""here's your table with some free appetizers"" ending that he envisioned).  My husband is usually a very mild person who never complains... he was actually furious because of the distress our young son was experiencing and told the manager ""this is what happens when you have to wait for dinner for 3 hours!"".  The manager apologized once again to which I told him that we usually come to The Keg for special occasions but this evening was an awful turning point and that we were done with The Keg.  

My son felt so unwell that we ended up packing our food to go and left the restaurant.  We got home approximately 20 minutes later and nobody felt like eating their food as we were all so utterly disgusted, angry and tired.  

Over approximately 30 years, our family and friends have always gone to The Keg for celebrations and special meals.  The Keg has usually provided consistently high quality service and food and that is why I am so absolutely shocked by this experience.  The Keg failed miserably and completely ruined our Mother's Day dinner.  My opinion and impression of The Keg has changed monumentally from this visit to the point that I seriously never want to see the inside of a Keg restaurant again.  If Yelp had a ""ZERO"" rating, that is what I would have assigned to this review.",2017-05-16 19:41:32

They have a great deal after 8:00pm on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday that consists of a half-pitcher of wine and their noshing board for $25...GREAT value. We also had Brussels Sprouts and Chicken Meatballs both of which were great. The Chicken Meatballs are served with a spicy marinara that I swear has a touch of cumin that gives it a slight curry taste-DELICIOUS!!!
For my entree I had what is probably the BEST Shepherd's Pie I've ever had. The beef was so perfectly prepared that it was tender and delicious while the tips of the beef were so slightly crisped it really was blissful and euphoric to consume it. I was also able to try the short rib which was equally tender and flavorful as well as a damn good pork chop (which was their special) considering that I am not a fan of pork. This pork chop was tasty and moist, not dry the way pork chops can be. Their Macaroni and Cheese is good with little bits of bacon.
For dessert we had Death By Chocolate and Pumpkin Creme Brulee. the Creme Brulee tasted like silky pumpkin pie minus the crust. Death by Chocolate is a creamy chocolate pudding topped with whipped cream and a chocolate cookie.
Hearty is probably the best way I can describe my meal here and the entire evening was enjoyable. The service was attentive and enthusiastic-maybe a little too enthusiastic as I felt like I had ADD when the entrees with their amazing local ingredients were being described to me.

My dining mate had another made with sriracha (you read right) and he said it was good. Since I am not a sriracha fan, I passed. 

Tapas style food means best if shared. That way you get variety. We started with cobia (like tuna) and pork belly. Thank goodness cholesterol is no longer a nutrient of concern (Feb 2015) - the pork belly is very well done. Nothing was salty, each has its own unique taste. We also tried the pumpkin / kale vege plate and a large plate of prime rib. Both delicious. I would have cut the kale leaves up a tad smaller but otherwise it was great. We debated between prime rib and pheasant and opted for the first. That was both a good and bad choice. Good in that it was large (almost 14 oz) and plenty to share.

I am not going to tell you anything that the hundreds of other reviews have not already stated.  Bottom line?  This place is GOOD!
Celebrating the b/f's birthday weekend and having already eaten way too much, we walked from our staycation hotel to the Venetian early Sunday morning to beat the brunch rush.  Arriving at precisely 7:52am, there was no wait. We thought they opened at 8:00am, but they are actually open at 7:00am on Saturday and Sunday.  
This was our first time here and we may not be coming back for a while since it's such an indulgence for us, so we decided to just go for it.  We began with the pastry basket, where you can order four different pastries.  We chose a croissant, pain au chocolat, raspberry beignets, and the lemon and currant scone.  BUT, before that, our fantastic waiter, Aaron, brought us some Epi bread and butter; let's get this carb party started!  There were crumbs all over the table, but there's no elegant way to eat flaky croissants, not to mention the other delightful pastries in the basket.
For the main course, I had the Croque Madame, a dish I'd only read about and seen pictures of until this point.  It did not disappoint, with the ham, the cheese, and the egg. I even ate some of the frites, something I try to avoid in real life now. The b/f had the chicken and waffles and that was also so tasty, a wonderful combination of flavors with syrup.

I'm kind of glad I didn't review this place my first time through a year or so ago. I didn't quite put together the tastiest of salads that time through, but I decided I'd give them another try, I have been watching my figure the last few weeks and this was just the type of spot I wanted for lunch. I threw together a salad with spinach and mixed greens, popped on some jalepenos, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, sun dried tomatos, grilled chicken and topped (lightly) with their house dressing. My combination of veggies and dressing was good this time around and everything tasted fresh, just the way a salad should. No pre made mixtures sitting all day here.

Not exactly a build it yourself, but you tell em what you want, they throw it together, then they toss your salad and away you go. They've got some tasty (looking, all I was here for was a salad) Mediterranean food available too, dolma, falafel, etc. I was feening for some of that delicious looking grilled (or fried, not sure exactly) cauliflower, but I stuck to just a salad this time around. Oh grilled cauliflower, you will be mine, oh yes, you will be mine. I guess I'll have to update my review after I finally come back around for you.

They had a smoothie bar there too; I didn't partake, with a bunch of fresh fruits and juices at their disposal. I imagine it's kinda hard to mess up a smoothly too badly.

They're located in the ASU downtown campus building at Fillmore and Central avenue; no need to enter the building, find em on the Central ave side.

Not because i am some anti consumerist nerd, but because i can't handle the traffic. I don't even mind standing in lines at the store, but i loathe holiday traffic. So, I had to take the rapid to Tower City with a pal, and decided i could attempt to get all my Xmas purchases downtown. Close, but no cigar. Actually i didn't look for cigars. 

The Cleveland Only Store was weaker than the last time i went, the urban fashion stores offered pretty poor service, and some stores i remembered from a year ago were gone. I did find some items at the gaming/ learning store. The vibe of Christmas was definitely all around, and i defy anyone to not have fun just meandering about this place. Sipping coffee, rocking winter coats and reminiscing about childhood holiday fun was a welcome treat in the middle of the day while everyone else was at work. You can try to replicate the experience at Crocker or a mall, but it just rings false with me. This is the real deal, Miracle on 34th, bums asking for cigarettes, gritty, sludgy metropolitan downtown Xmas experience i savor.

I actually found some gifts out on the street level, so downtown overall gets better marks than in the past. E.4th eateries are good for gift cards, Erie Island has some nice gifts, and you could even get House of Blues swag for people you don't really like.

The chicken Nachos are the freaking best and my brother loves the beef nachos. I also am a huge fan of the enchiladas. They always have an event on cinco de mayo that's really fun to attend. My brother and I just happened to go over on this day early in the say like 1pm  on a Saturday and they have lunch specials everyday even on weekends. They had the nachos as one of those items its a little smaller plate size but its more than enough for your serving.  the dink specials were good too I love this place hands fown the rice and beans are also to die for I'm telling you its good.,2017-09-07 14:00:58

The patio is also a great place to people watch, especially towards the later hours of the evening on a weekend night. The crowd on Mill is always a good time. 

Location is also really great. Since it's on the Northern part of Mill you don't have to deal with the ""bros"" going into Cue Club or anything like that. Plenty of parking most of the time.

The restaurant is actually in an old one-story home complete with a grass lawn and porch!  I can't imagine this place seats more than 30 even with cramming people next to the walls.  For setting, this is something unlike anything in Vegas.

The meal started out well with fresh bread and moved onto a tasty Pasta Fagoli soup.  I decided to order the meat lasagna after hearing so many rave reviews about it.  The waiter put it in front of me and I immediately was disappointed in the portion size, as I was expecting something much bigger for $18.  After having a few bits it tasted very similar to Marinelli's at The M, where it doesn't appear to have a lot of layers of pasta, but just a lot of cheese.

I finished the dish in no time and eat more of the bread (granted I was hungry that night, but still).  A slightly humorous moment is when we asked the waiter to split the checks for our group and he dropped the F bomb while walking away from the table.  We personally thought it was funny, but still a little strange for a common request.

If I come back here it most likely would be on a date just because this place is so unique in it's setting.  However I would have to order something different.",2013-03-30 04:45:34

We were a relatively large group and on the plus side they were able to accommodate us rather quickly and I was happy to see that they now have booster seats for those with babies, last I remembered, Joey didn't have any kiddie seating for parents with little ones in tow, so kudos on that.

First off, I had been to the Barlow location a couple of months ago, and I noticed slight differences between these restaurants.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna sashimi big salad which I felt was priced a bit steep at over $18 but was delicious none the less.  As we sat I already knew that it was something I wanted to have as it was a hit at Barlow, my husband and I decided on sharing a rainbow roll to start and I felt like a Caesar to wet my whistle. The rainbow roll was great, for a restaurant chain sushi roll, I was pleasantly surprised. The Caesar was pretty bunk, like really watered down and overly spiced, and just not right, I barely got through a couple of sips and informed the waitress that is was not right.  Although she offered to fix it, we barely saw her till the food arrived and at that point, I was no longer interested in said Caesar.  I know its not her fault, and she was a very sweet girl but had it been taken care of immediately it wouldn't be an issue.  My husband ordered the salmon rice bowl which was delicious although it was on the smaller side, and the portion of salmon was quite small as well. 

My Ahi salad came and, sigh, it was much smaller than the Barlow Joeys.  I'm not a big eater but, really?  Like the tuna portion was so small, like maybe 3 oz of 1 inch squares of tuna sliced super thin.  Were they short on tuna? Also the Barlow location places a lovely fan of half an avocado on top which balances the flavor of the tuna in the salad, here it was a couple of tiny slices with mostly baby greens. I noticed two chunks of mango where Barlow slices theirs and they are abundant, the entire balance was off here and the only redeeming thing about this $18 salad was the delicious dressing.  So disappointed with the Caesar and Ahi salad, wish I would have ordered the salmon bowl, perfect char and flavor in that dish.

Our dining companion also thought her Caesar was underwhelming and their meals although very good, priced a little on the high side.  Also, we were all freezing, we sat at the large round family table in the back and the AC was blaring and it was pouring outside, I couldn't wait to eat and get out of there.  Our dining companion ordered a coffee before his meal and another one afterwards because he was so cold!

All in all, the potential is there, but quality/portion control with staying on par with Joey Barlow would have changed this two star review to a 4.  Being freezing cold for the duration of dinner, lacklustre cocktails, $200 for 5 adults and 3 kids was on the pricey side so I don't think as a family I would not come back to Joey Crow, I will stick to Joey Barlow for my Ahi salad fix.",2016-08-01 07:37:12

aWHMjSwYRdd_4AWDo7n3NQ,X2AiYF7z32_0Oitl4aYXwg,pGwfOqNEL8FbMUFspJdAMA,2,1,2,0,"This review is going to encompass a couple of visits over the years. More specifically the past 2 years of Cinco de Mayo visits. 

Patron is a local Mexican chain with 4 locations around Pittsburgh, the newest being the local I will be talking about in East Liberty on the corner of S. Highland and Center Ave.

PIttsburghers never miss a chance to indulge in lecherous behavior and Cinco de Mayo at a Mexican place is no different, even on a Tuesday. My girlfriend and I had made plans to attend Patron yesterday as we had last year right when it opened its doors and pretend to be stereotypical. We made plans for 7pm, which understandably is prime time and we expected a wait, so in anticipation of events I called to add my name to the list ahead of time to cut down on the wait. The hostess must have stepped away as on of the other staff took to the phone [first bad sign]. In broken English I was told of the 1-1.5 hour wait [hence calling 45 minutes early] and I said to add my name to the list. Upon arrival I went to check on where I was in line, just to discover that my name had never been added to anything and that we were back in the queue [1 star for that]. However, we had done this last year also and it was lovely outside so we decided to wait anyways. 

In anticipation of the wait, Patron had set up a front bar where you would be able to have house margaritas or beers while you wait [good redemption]. While we waited we observed the hostess staff where at one point 4 people were standing debating who to seat next. The process was fully manual and groups came and left in droves so crossing outs and addings were happening left and right. We thought this quite inefficient, the same remark we made in 2014. [however that was about a week after their grand opening so we let that slide]. The waiting area, similar to the rest of the restaurant is colorful and ethnic and airy. Very pleasant. After about an hour we were given a booth in the back.

Now the real wait began. For about 7-10 minutes we sat until a busser appeared to bring us salsa and a basket of chips. Our hungry selves immediately delved into these and soon found ourselves thirsting for water. However, no waiter was in sight. After about another 15 minutes rather than a waiter appearing we were greeted by the manager who brought us more chips and salsa and finally flagged down exhausted looking teen so take our beer orders. [Beer works for thirst too but water would have been nice too] Those finally arrived 10 minutes later with surprise! more chips. We observed the neighboring tables who were in similar pain. Nobody to help them along in the process of anything. We kept our eyes out for our frantic waitron who continuously disappeared into a black hole. When we did see him he was frazzled and sweating and busy... with... I actually couldn't tell you. We finally flagged him down to ask for food orders. One side of guac, one Fajita Chesadilla and an Enchilada Carnitas. 

Finally. Progress... until the waiter came back and asked if the Enchiladas would be with chicken or beef.... um... carnitas. ... Know you menu. 

Eventually waters appeared, which was fantastic at that point in time. While waiting for our food, the waitron checked on us apologizing profusely for a backed up kitchen. hm... They sat a table next to us who had eventually just abandoned the process because of no service. [Not the kitchen's fault]. In attempts of cleaning abandoned menu I finally understood how the service was slow. Waitron would do one thing then run back then come out do a single thing and then return to the waitron station... no dear... you made 3 trips for something that could have been 1. This is why you don't hire new meat right before you busy drinking days.... especially when they are 18 and don't know any better. [1 star for this]

To the actual food. It was good. 0 complaints there. By the end of the evening we had been there for 3 hours for an entire meal. [which was good and still decently warm when it arrived] Even the complimentary shot of tequila was not a good remedy for this. and $25 a person.... i guess that's $8 and hour... [1 star for this]

Understandably, we half knew what we were getting ourselves into for the wait outside which is why this doesn't have a single star rating. Also they had a live jazz[ish? band we couldn't figure out what the trumpet player was doing] band playing which was nice, just a little bit [very] loud.

We will be moving our Cinco de Mayo festivities somewhere else next year.",2015-05-06 14:48:54

We ordered the Firecracker Shrimp which was delish!!!!  About 15 shrimp very lightly breaded with Shiracha Mayo drizzled on top and a small bowl on the side. The mayo was so good we used it on everything after this course!  
Then we had the Jerk Chicken Pasta with a side Caesars salad and the Island Hopper appetizer as a meal. 
The pasta was loaded with asparagus and mushroom with some chicken all cooked well.  The light portion was huge, so no need for the regular portion.

That was immediately dashed when we walked inside. The build-out of this place felt really cheap, which is a turnoff for me, personally.The decor was really poorly executed and again felt cheap..like it was trying to be a 50's dinner with a modern twist, which would be fine, if it was done well. It was clean though.

Enough about the decor, I was there to eat, right?

I ordered the Mile High omlette with homefries.
It came out about 3-4 minutes after I ordered it, which was an immediate indicator that the quality might not be there. The server placed my plate before me. My omelette was slathered in what seemed like an entire stick of butter. It was shiny. It tasted okay, but it just made my skin feel greasy. Not cool. The homefries were soggy.. like they were frozen and microwaved or maybe were prepared hours ago and just sitting in a bowl waiting to be served.

Our server was really nice though.

In 2018, Downtown Phoenix will finally have an extra option for grocery shopping when Fry's opens a new location next to Cityscape.  Until then, Safeway is the one (and only) grocery chain within a short driving distance of Downtown residents.  

It's by no means the nicest store in the chain, but it carries most of the usual staples you'd expect from a Safeway.  Full bakery, deli, butcher, floral, pharmacy, and even a Starbucks and bank inside.  The big brand name products are all there just as you'd expect.  Perhaps in smaller quantities than a comparable suburban Safeway, but I've always gotten my usual staples here with no problem.

As for the other complaints, let's address those one by one shall we?  (1) Dirty parking lot.  Honestly I don't see it.  I've been in countless grocery store parking lots in my lifetime and even worked as a grocery bagger at an ABCO store when I was a teenager.  Safeway's McDowell parking lot area is no dirtier or more disorganized than any other grocery store parking lot I've been to.  And unlike most grocery stores I've been to, this one has always had plenty of parking spaces available.  (2) Homeless folk and junkies outside.  This is a mostly legit concern.  Pretty much every time I've been to this location there's homeless or questionable looking characters hanging out here.  Usually only one or two at a time, but yes they exist.  That said, my experience has been that they're mostly harmless.  Some will ask me for pocket change and I'll either give them some or won't.  Most of the time they just hang out by themselves and don't bother anyone.  I've never had a single confrontation or felt like my safety was I danger.  In part because this Safeway always staffs their store with one or two security guards at the entrance every time I'm here.  (3) Unkept store with shady customers.  Again, I don't see it.  As I mentioned earlier it's not nice the nicest store in the chain (in part because it's older than some of the others), but the interior signage, color scheme, technology and product placement is just like the other Safeways I've been to.  Do spills happen?  Yup, and they do at every grocery store.  Are there shady characters shopping there?  Define shady.  If we're talking people who smell like they haven't had a shower in awhile then sure, but I also experienced that plenty of times bagging groceries for the epically smelly at a super affluent ABCO during my teenage years.  Perhaps some people find the site of so many black and Latino folks shopping here along side them unsettling for some reason (in which case a little self examination needs to take place)?

In summary, Safeway on 5th & McDowell is adequate.  Not great, not terrible, but adequate.  They're clearly doing well at this location as the place is always pretty busy when I'm there.  If you want a more locally focused placed to shop, you can try the Downtown Saturday Public Market.  If you want a more socially responsible chain, Whole Foods is about a 15-20 minute drive up the 51 freeway.  But if you want a reliable, everyday grocery chain store in the Downtown vicinity, this Safeway is (for now) the only way to go.  I'm excited to get a second option when Fry's arrives next year.  But Safeway remains a comfortable goto for me and likely will be until then.  Keep calm and grocery shop on, folks.",2017-01-12 20:13:54

If you're ordering online, make double sure you have your order right:  I ordered a small pizza one time on accident and called to make it a medium, and they couldn't change it for me over the phone--told me to go online and change it, which online ordering sites don't let you do.

Hubby and I received a postcard in the mail for a special 3-night deal which worked out to be $52 a night for 2 double beds.  Wow...we jumped on that mutha right away.

Checking in was a breeze.  Our person was friendly and offered us upgrades when asked.  Nothing monumental but I upgraded us to a room with a fridge, pillowtop and a nicer view for $10 more a day.

Same thing I noticed in other nicer hotels - it's definitely smokier than before.  They must be cutting back on ventilation to save energy??  Also, we happened to be there during a very busy week - some sort of high school basketball tournament so there were kids everywhere.  

The rooms are clean, the beds are comfy, the shampoo/conditioner stuff is brand name and the maids do a great job.  You can't ask for more (other than to be ON the strip) but for $62 a night, who's complaining??

Currently, my gambling fixes have been best served by off-the-strip venues (Silverton, South Point, and Green Valley) so I've been putting aside at least one off-the-strip day per trip and allotting the rest to drunkenly roaming the strip. 

The tables are plentiful and it's usually not difficult to find a seat for blackjack or a spot to throw craps. There are plenty of slots and there's always a seat open (and, to biased, the machines here have been good to me). 

Also, the bingo's just too much fun. With games lasting about 45 minutes and a minimum bet of $4 required, this is a great place to spend some time on little money, with the chance of winning some cash. The bingo room is huge, but comfortable. It also has its own cocktail service with complimentary drinks (and donuts at the 9am game) so I loaded up. However, in retrospect, getting drunk while bingo-ing challenges one's ability to quickly stamp the boxes! 

The only thing I've noticed is that the cocktail service on the gaming floor is a bit slow- even sparse. In all my visits, I've only been able to get a drink once. 

It's definitely worth it to join their mailing list for updates. We lucked out this week and happened to show up on their 5-year anniversary, which they celebrated by all-days pour of champagne, slices of cake, and 5x points on machines!",2010-12-24 18:57:22

Good selection on veggie options too - aloo gobi, eggplant, paneer mutter masala and daal makhani, all of which looked good.

The omelet was just ok. I didn't think it was anything special. They were pretty stingy on the avocado. There wasn't enough sauce and the chicken was dried.

I'm a ""hard shell taco"" guy.  Just never have developed a liking for soft tacos.  I love tortillas, both corn and flour, but as a taco, I just don't dig that style.  If I want a soft tortilla, I'll order a burrito.

OK, enough about me.  On to the Los Taquitos review.

The Good:

The beans were very good.  Darker in color than your average re-fried beans, and had a ""fuller"" taste.  I and my 11-yr-old daughter both nommed the heck out of them.

The Carne Asada was very well-flavored and barely not too dry,  ""walking the line"" between moist and dry.

The salsa they provided in a plastic squirt bottle was VERY good - the right amount of heat (more than average) and with a good chile taste.  Had my daughter searching for watery relief.

The kids liked the chicken in the tacos.  Noticeably moist and flavorful. 

My daughter was a big fan of the cheese on the tacos.  Not sure what kind it was, but it was good.

The ""Not-So-Good"":

We had the hard shell tacos.  The shells were ""VERY"" hard.  Hard to the point that the whole taco collapsed after the first or second bite.  If they changed to a slightly better hard taco shell, these tacos would improve quite a bit.

The marinated pork was very dry, and neither of my kids liked the taste of the seasonings.

The meat portion of each taco was a little on the ""skimpy"" side.  We had massive amounts of shell left over with no meat remaining, after the tacos fell apart and we started eating the pile.

The ""Blah"":

The rice was standard, very bland.

So, all in all, this is a decent place.  I've been eating Mexican food in Texas, Arizona, and in a few other countries for most of the last 35 years.  This place is an above-average spot which could improve.

But anyone who says this is the ""best Mexican food"" has just not had enough of it to know better.",2010-10-01 17:40:33

They apparently just started opening for the weekends but I suppose they used to be more of a corporate lunch place, given their location in the middle of several office buildings. Given this somewhat out of the way location, the number of reviews and high stars is a testament to the quality of their food and drink.  We think the prices are reasonable, service is very friendly, food is excellent ( just wish their 'salad' was actually more than half a handful of lettuce w/ some dressing!).

When I first moved here it was my go to place for just about everything. We were literally going 3 to 5 times a week. After awhile we noticed that the service was just starting to lack and the food was going a little down hill. 

We went for a brunch once and whatever I got was horrible, and so was the service. Our server never even came back to check on us, and the bartender ended up being the one to give us our bill. I was pretty disappointed. The last 4 times we went I just felt it wasn't the same Jacks I fell in love with and bragged so much about. 

They recently changed their menu and they basically took off everything that I  went there for!! I guess that explains why the stuff I got tasted pretty crappy the last few times I'd gone... maybe they were just fazing it out? I don't know but honestly I can say I will not jump for joy to go eat there again. The only thing they have left that I'd even get slightly excited about is the black bean quesadilla. :(

I was actually part of a group that was invited to sample the food.  I had all kinds of good appetizers and entrees. I can't remember the name of all of it.

The dishes I remember and liked are the jerk chicken, jerk shrimp, curry goat, curry shrimp, some small fish, Mac and cheese, and brown stewed chicken.

The jerk shrimp had a nice punch of spiciness.  All the chicken and goat was very good.  The meat broke apart when I stuck my fork into it. You definitely can tell everything was well made.  I mention the Mac and cheese because the chef took the liberty to changing it up a bit.  He added some peppers to it. It came out real good. 

Out of all the dishes, I loved this small fish but I don't remember the name.  It was so flavorful and good. It was a whole fish, not a filet like most places.  The bone, head, tail was still on.  Many people were surprise to see it like that. But for me, that's how mom and a dad fry fish.  

We talk to the the chef, Ben, quite a bit.  He made it clear that his food is real food.  When he buys ingredients, he buys the good stuff. He grows his own peppers, he buys fresh meat locally, and he takes time to create recipes you won't find anywhere else.

I also noticed he was very vocal to his employees.  If something wasn't done right or if something was below average, he had no problem voicing his concern.  The food for the people already there before me definitely took a while to get there but I'm sure it was in great quality.  There was only one waitress and one manager there. They were super nice.

The place is small and it definitely not fancy. But if  you want good caribbean food and a personal touch from the chef, give this  place a try.",2011-09-14 02:46:57

More of a take out place than a regular restaurant.  They have a varied and large menu, including some sushi dishes.
The owner worked the front counter and was very friendly, pleasant and exacting.  I doubt that any of their take-out orders contain errors!  I ordered a Regular size Orange Chicken and a Regular size Mongolian Beef to get a feel for the size of their dishes.  They also offer what they call a Large size for about 50% more in price and I'm willing to guess that they would be double the quantity.  You get plenty to eat here folks, delicious and well prepared! The amount of food blew me away.  The chicken was in large deep fried chunks of breast meat in a very tasty orange based sauce.  I asked for it to be ""extra spicy"" as a previous reviewer said it was not spicy enough.  The spice level was perfect, not super strong at all.  All I can say is it was properly cooked and quite delicious.  It came with two very large portions of white rice, as did the Mongolian Beef.  The beef was not stringy or tough and very flavorful, mixed with plentiful scallions and onions in a spicy brown sauce.  Two excellent dishes.

The ""menu"" is classic cocktails that you shouldn't need a menu for. Worst of all, the service here only gets worse the longer they've been open.

Well my car was totaled in December when I was rear-ended in a bad accident and my Toyota kept me in one piece so I knew that I would purchase another. 

This time I wanted something a little bigger with even more airbags (hey, it can be scary driving a car with all of the trucks and SUVs on the road). I had a very specific idea of what I wanted (2012 Camry XLE V6 black with tan interior, see I told you) and a few other places that I visited weren't interested in what I wanted, but wanted to sell me what was on their lot. We contacted Earnhardt Toyota online and were immediately contacted by Jack Shen who was very friendly and professional. Although they did not have the specific car we wanted on their lot he offered to ship it in from Tucson or pull it off another train that would be passing through the valley. He got it for us at a great price and the Toyota financing department got us great loan through another bank for an even lower interest rate than what they were offering. We had a few accessories that we wanted and they promptly added them before we picked up the car.

The hotel offers a free happy hour from 5p-6p. They have 2 different kinds of wines and a margarita mix. 

We decided to go out on the town, and they offer a shuttle bus service. They're take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius. The bus is actually a red Escalade. (it's gratuity based) The guys are super nice/friendly and the desk staff all were professional & helpful.

At night, they have fire pits outside and get this! They offer free S'MORES too!! (That totally made my night!!)

I been to the Fresh on Bloor several of time and always have the best experiences there. This location of Fresh is near Trinity Bellwoods Park/Queen St. West, where I frequent for shopping and just casual walking around. I have stopped at this location in two occasions - the food is the same as the one on Bloor, the service is still great, but this location is quite tiny compared to the Bloor St. location. The wait here (around the busy hours of lunch and/or dinner) is usually around 20 minutes on both occasions. Since it's quite chilly outside, everyone is standing inside and it gets very, very crowded, along with people coming in and out for their take out orders. 

However, the wait might not be a problem during the summer since I believe they have outdoor seating. It's settled on the side street, so you can observe the busy streets, but not be completely disturbed with people walking so nearby ever so often. 

Since the seating is limited, I find it not that preferable for groups to come. The seating is usually setting two by twos. It best to come in pairs during the congested time, but if it's probably the middle of the day, it would be fine bringing a larger group.

Yes, the cajun fries can be shared between probably at least three people. Yes, the little hamburger isn't all that little and has a lot of free toppings. Yes, the drink is the fun Coke freestyle machine and you can drink as much as you want. Yes, there are free peanuts for some reason. But I just get very very annoyed at that price point. Even a hot dog with no sides is 4 dollars. So the only way it really makes sense to eat here, a fast food restaurant with great fries and reasonable burgers, is to bring two friends, split the fry, get a little burger, and eat 5 dollars worth of peanuts. I dunno, maybe I am not in the majority for what I expect a fast food burger to cost.

If you want to spend a lot on a burger, and feel like you are getting some kind of value, go to Smash burger or ANY local burger place. In Charlotte, there's Kickstand, Bang Bang, etc. Or go to JJ's Redhots for a killer hot dog.

This is a place not for every palate. The recipes here are for those that really have passion for food and are capable to distinguish different flavors in each bite they have.

The service is very attentive, cordial and knowledgeable and capable to guide you with what your guts feel to have at the moment.

The type of food serve I would consider it a sort of a fusion of Italian, French and Mediterranean.
The concept is very simple: you build your own wooden tray based on how famished you are.
You have three different type of items you will have to chose from: cold cut (salumi), cheese (formaggi) and olives. Now, you can choose how many different variety you want to add to your cut board: from one to three.
But if you don't want to get a wooden tray, you can always chose only one item or skip directly to the signature dishes cooked for you by Chef John Rosal.
If I'm not wrong the meats carefully chosen and brought in from Ontario and Europe.

Since it was late, I didn't feel to have a meat so I chose three light dishes that literally blew my mind. Tino (the owner) and Chef Rosal carefully chosen and paired different ingredients that once combined together, will give you an explosion of flavors once reached your taste buds. 
We had in the following sequence: 
- for appetizer: a taste of ""olive di Cerignola"" - Cerignol (olives from, indeed, Cerignola located in the region of Puglia, Italy)
- as main course: P.E.I Mussels steamed in white wine, with butter and poached leeks and a plate of Scallops on a bed of chestnuts squash, pancetta and brussels sprouts;
- as side dish: Roasted Broccoli & Cauliflower accompanied by garlic bread crumbs, pine nuts and pecorino cheese.

Needless to say that each of these plates was awesomely designed and cooked to perfection. The flavors never were too soft or too strong neither were overpowering each other.
A superb use of simple ingredients that once combined with each other, generated a crescendo that ended in one indescribable experience. 

But here's the icing on the cake or, like we always say in Italy.... the cherry on the cake: the DESSERT.

A mastermind cheesecake that would turn any Christian into a bad boy: the Parmesan Cheesecake.
This is a slice of heaven entering your mouth, erasing completely any memory of previous cheesecake you ever had. A ridiculous dessert created and made with the best cheese Tino can possible hold on to completed with balsamic glazed strawberries and Oreo cookie crumb.

Overall the food is superb and offered to the clientele at a very reasonable price.
The drink, even though I haven't had any, are wisely chosen but, ouch, have to admit, quite pricey.

The whole meal literally surpassed my expectation.
The way food here is conceived is like having an orchestra made by so many different instruments that thanks to a great conductor, play a superlative symphony that your ears can ever ear.

This is a place that worth a visit and your money. Located in an area that is crowed with ""fast food"" such as pizza and poutine, this gem is a great place to have some serious food until late at night. Yes, you heard me. Because while other restaurants close the kitchen around 10, Nuit Social keeps cooking for you until midnight.

The prices are rather steep for what you get, most toppings cost extra and the food really isn't all that great.  

I didn't have a single ""ring"" in any of my onion rings, only small, overcooked pieces (looked nothing like the pictures others have posted).  The staff seemed bothered to help anyone and simply rushed people through the line, even though it wasn't particularly busy.  

The hotdogs were decent, but certainly nothing special.  I had a jumbo beef chili cheese dog and a pseudo-Chicago dog (everything but the sport peppers and poppy seed bun, because they don't offer them) myself.  I also tried the white and polish sausages that other family members were eating.  Truth be told, the sausages were the best of the bunch.  

The chili was a generic beef-only sauce and the liquid cheese was very plain.  The french fries arrived dry and unsalted, but not particularly crispy.  They tasted ""ok"" once they were doctored up, but these aren't the type of fries you ""crave"" later.  The shakes are very expensive for the small size you get and the chocolate shake tasted just like powdered chocolate milk, which I found disappointing.  The Loganberry shake, however, was very good.  

Unfortunately, for what you end up paying for a pair of hot dogs and a soda, I can go to much nicer eateries and have a higher quality meal that actually tastes great.

When it comes down to it, there are so many hot dog joints popping up all over the valley that it's quite easy to find somewhere better than Ted's.  The only thing they really have going for them is a recognizable name and a great location in the busy area of Tempe.

I distinctly remember the broth on the pho being very peculiar. Not a good kind either. It had a really strong beefy taste that just overpower the entire dish.  I didn't request any beef fat on it, so it couldn't be that. The beef balls didn't help either. I like to call it the bacon wrapped in bacon effect. Having a strong beefy broth and beef balls doesn't add anything to the dish, you're just eating beef.

At least, the ingredients are good. Just execution didn't work on the Pho. The pho could have been served much hotter, but at least it wasn't lukewarm.

Looking for a healthier option in food choices, I first reviewed their menus online. I was pleased to see that they had a multitude of options available for various sensitivities and concerns.

Since it was only lunch, I was looking for something preferably under 400 calories and opted for the Grilled Chicken with Vegetables and Jasmine Rice from their sodium reduced menu.

I expected bland... what I got was delicious. The chicken was beautifully grilled and incredibly juicy, I was actually surprised. The Jasmine rice was flavourful as it usually is and there was an abundance of freshly steamed vegetables. A very healthy lunch and completely satisfying! I would definitely order this again.

Sure, I could have easily gone for something a tad more indulgent but right now, I need discipline and with the menu choices available, Milestones left me with no excuses.

Our waitress and (I believe) the Manager were friendly and attentive ensuring that everything was, not only to our satisfaction, but also theirs.

RESTAURANT

Even during the daytime, it's difficult to miss their skeleton monkey sign that entices your curiosity and draws you into the restaurant. The wooden tables with their long benches and the folding chairs give it a homey vibe. Day of the Dead elements and rosaries that hang on the walls add touches of Mexican culture throughout the dining room. 

FOOD

Complimentary bowls of tortilla chips with salsa are presented as a light appetizer. I say order the guacamole, too.

Appetizer - Queso Fundido: Cheesy, gooey goodness served on a hot plate. 

Entree - Sea Bass A La Baja: When our server explained how these are the only tacos on the menu that use flour tortillas instead of corn, I had doubts. After my meal, I can't imagine corn being used for these tacos. The tempura battered sea bass was crunchy, and the chipotle mayo added a tolerable spiciness. I would never have thought that pickled radishes to complement the other flavors. This didn't disappoint.

Dessert - Flan: This is one of the best flans that I've had. It's solid and doesn't jiggle much. Smooth, creamy, and not super sweet.

Dessert - Fried Plantains with ice cream: Sweeter than the flan, the fried plantains retained their crunchiness even as the ice cream started to melt and created a pool in the bowl. Decent, but I prefer the flan. 

SERVICE

No complaints. Everything ran smoothly.

Tasti:  adj.  definition: opposite of tasty.  synonyms: bland, flavorless, gross.

The caramel pecan I sampled had absolutely no flavor, so I went with the chocolate/vanilla twist, hoping it would resemble a typical chocolate/vanilla twist flavor.  I added mini m&ms, my usual go-to yogurt topping, for 75 cents.  WOW: 12 mini m&ms.  I'm not even kidding.  I guess that's one way to keep things low cal and maximize profits!  This so-called tasti treat tastes like whipped up air mixed with skim milk or chemicals or something.

The custom-made ""100s of flavors"" only come in pretty large sizes so I wasn't able to try them.  I guess if you add enough toppings maybe you could ignore the fact that the main ingredient (the frozen crap) doesn't taste anything like yogurt or ice cream or anything else for that matter.  

Oh, and customer service?  Forget it.  We got there 2 minutes after 9:00 and they still let us in (seemed nice at the time) and then proceeded to glare at us the whole time we were there.  The funny thing was, there were three people behind the counter (owner dad and his two kids?  manager and two high school workers?  maybe both) and the two that weren't helping us were just standing around, so it didn't look like we were really holding them up too much.

This location has one of the best interior designs I've seen at Chatime with floral patterns. Its nothing big but their seating area is relatively vast compared to other locations because the store shape is more squared.

The drinks were perfectly alright in taste - just like any other Chatime.

Why I wouldn't give them a high rating though?
(Note: I went after the BOGO offer ended)

- Cash only; credit card system under maintenance (thank goodness my coworker brought cash or else we would have commuted for nothing)
- Chatime Vicinity card machine is not set up yet = 4 points gone down the drain
- Staff wasn't as polite in taking orders especially when it was more complicated
- Slow service and still in training perhaps
- One milk tea drink was missing our requested pudding topping yet we still got charged for it

I won't be visiting awhile for now.

Can't recommend it enough.  The stuffing doesn't take the place of the lobster, and you get a lot of lobster meat.

The seafood platter is always excellent, as are the oysters.  But, the star here is the steak.  My groups usually get the steak for 2 or 4, depending on how many.  It's a very large cut and it's more than enough to feed 2 people with sides and sauces.  By the way, every side and every sauce I've had here is fantastic.  You can't go wrong at this joint.

We went first for brunch, and loved it so much that we asked to see the dinner menu, and tried out their dinner dishes a few days later.  Each time, we were able to make a reservation to avoid the lineups;  and service was friendly and prompt, despite how busy it was, especially at brunch.

For brunch, there were three of us and we had:  Prime Rib benny;  Chef's breakfast;  and Chicken and Waffles (with bacon).  All were fantastic.  The special that day was actually jerk chicken and waffles and it made for a really difficult decision for what to choose for brunch.  But knowing that I wanted to come back for their jerk chicken dinner, I went for the chicken and waffles.

Then for dinner a few days later, we ordered pirogies and fried pickles as appies;  then the Fried Chicken;  the Jerk Chicken dinner (swapped out jasmine rice for rice and peas) and the Curry pasta.  Everything was scrumptious, and we were especially impressed by the moistness of the jerk chicken (and boneless too!) and the absolutely lick-the-plate delicious curry cream sauce for the pasta.

For brunch, we had booked for 1030am on a Saturday, and there was already a line-up of people waiting outside.  Dinner was for 7pm and there were a few empty tables at arrival, but due to a number of walk-ins the place filled up by 8pm.

Walked in around 9:30pm. The place was super busy. There was some sort of large private party happening in the side room. We grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited for a table to open. Took only a few minutes.

One of the major reasons for my change in heart to add a star? The current staff. The bartenders, the servers, the manager... man, have they nailed it with a tremendous crew right now. A lot fun, super nice, they all genuinely look like they enjoy being there. When people can have that good of a time at work... you know it's a great place. On to the food....

Picante piña. House infused pineapple tequila muddled with fresh pineapple agave nectar, lime juice and a muddled Serrano pepper. Holy expletive. I love a spicy margarita and this is just fantastic. The muddled combo of pineapple and pepper give it such a great flavor. I usually only have one spicy margarita when I go to a Mexican restaurant. I had two here... and contemplated a third.

Guac: made table side. Fresh. Delicious. Perfection.

Chips n salsa: Solid. And the bowls never went empty. That's the way to my heart... keeping my snacks full.

Chicken Tortilla Soup: tastes like a giant hug. (I don't mean for that to sound weird) Great flavor. Big chunks of chicken. The cup is a pretty good size.

Pork Belly Taco Sliders: four little tacos of deliciousness. Perfect little bites.

Pig Wings Carnitas: GET THESE. NO, SERIOUSLY. GET THESE. I actually got them by accident. The kitchen sent out the wrong thing. Wow, am I glad they did. Make sure you eat them with all the side fixings. These won an award at one of the Charlotte food festivals.

Harlem Underground describes its food as Afro-American/Afro-Carribean with a modern twist.  That's a whole lot of a little somethings.

I had their lunch years ago.  From what I remembered it was flavourful.  I heard their chicken and waffles were delicious so I decided it was time I return.

I met up with Kitty and Aerie for a brunch date on a warm, but cloudy Saturday.  I have to say we three stuck out amongst the tattooed jeans-and-T hipsters, inasmuch as Kitty is more Chanel, Aerie is more X3 and me?  Well my jeans are Joe's and my T is Splendid.  Just sayin.  Hipster or not, the joint is casual and comfortable.  That is if you're not seated next to the LOUDEST four-some ever.  The table next to us was four hipsters yelling at the top of their lungs and laughing like mad cows on ebola milk; that much ruckus isn't meant for public on a Saturday afternoon.

So although our Saturday didn't start the way I would have hoped, the four-some left just as our food arrived.  

Kitty had the Crab Avocado Benny sans hollandaise.  We all agreed there was a serious lack of crab.  If you can't smell it, see it or taste it, is it really there?  Hipster waitress A insisted there was crab without even looking at the dish.  Her dismissiveness was balanced out by Hipster waitress B who agreed with us.  Only she came back from the kitchen saying the chef insisted there was crab but could ""give us more"" if we wanted.  Kitty declined.  

Aerie had the Harlem Benny - poached eggs served with chili-garlic greens, atop a sausage and grits, and a flap jack with cheesy hollandaise.  Good, although I didn't taste the sausage.

I of course had the chick-n-waff.  It came with scotch bonet-corriander lime syrup and gravy sauce.  The sauces were yum, but the chick-n-waffs didn't compare to Stockyards.  Not even close.  The chicken was small and the flavour was pretty bland.  The waffles were cute - fluffy round things - but nothing spectacular.

We've had dinner here twice, and ordered the Meat Lover's with an order of Japchae and Kabocha Tempura.  The cuts of the meat is superb, and we liked that all the meat was seasoned perfectly and quite tasty.  Japchae was solid as was the tempura.  Although it's not AYCE, we left super stuffed and satisfied.  Service was good, they worked as a team, so our glasses and banchan requests we're always attended to.  Wait times vary as our first time, we went on a Thursday at about 7:30pm and waited 30-minutes, and the last time was on a Saturday at 9pm with no wait.  I just wish they had better seating, than the wooden benches they have which are uncomfortable, then again, it's probably on purpose so people wouldn't linger.

Booked for a birthday party, eleven (11) of us were squeezed into the private wine cellar room at the rear of the restaurant. It was definitely tight to get out of your seat and move around the cellar, but once seated the table was more than spacious. This is a great little private space, and the noise concerns noted in other reviews don't apply here.

We ordered a number of antipasti, and asked for enough to share on platters family-style: 

bruschetta (toppings change weekly)
arancini - fried risotto balls
mozzarella and tomato w/ basil pesto
fig w/ prosciutto, gorgonzola & pistachio
scotty's meatball in ragu sauce
fritto misto - fried calamari and shrimp

They were all tremendous, and I can't say I was disappointed with any of them. The meatballs were amusingly large, and everything was well prepared and delicious. Plenty of bread (and at least three varieties) was provided.

I started with the crespelle (Italian crêpes) with roasted butternut squash & sage butter. I can't say I loved it; it could have used more salt or more parmesan, as I found it tasted fairly flat. Okay if you're looking for subtler flavours.

The ossobuco was much more impressive. I was surprised to see it priced so cheaply at $13.95, but this reflects the presence of only one hunk of bone (from whence the marrow flows). The meat was tender and well-seasoned.

My partner ordered the involtini (shredded pork wrapped with rib eye), and it was a very pathetic looking dish - three little sad lumps of meat. The flavour was okay with assistance from the goat cheese, but I found the texture of the meat made the dish even less appetizing.

None of the secondi come with sides, but again we ordered platters to share. The coleslaw and new potatoes were the standouts.

No dessert as we brought our own cake, and they served it up without any hassle. Plenty of chianti kept us well lubricated throughout the evening.

Overall a fantastic meal!",2011-11-08 19:30:41

I found out about this place after having most of the people at the climbing gym say that the coffee was really good there, so I had to go give it a whirl.

Upon entering, you'll notice that there isn't really very much space, I mean, there are maybe a total of 6 chairs and 4 stools.  I guess they don't have a lot of chill space (pity).  The decor is probably one of the coolest things there.  Most of their furniture is made out of 2x6's glued together with wood glue.  

The highlight piece they have right over the bar is actually a painting of the god of thunder himself thor, wielding his mighty... espresso tamper.  LOL amazing painting (check out the picture).

One thing I really appreciate about this place is that they do latte art for their coffees.  I got a macchiato (2 shots of espresso and a little bit of milk) and it came up with a nice leaf design on top.  Being a barista at starbucks for a while, I had the opportunity to try making latte art on our downtime (I was pretty determined to learn how to do it on starbucks' dime).  Trust me, it's a pretty refined art to do it consistently very well.  It's a nice little touch to have with your coffee.

The coffee tastes just about right.  I've had people pull bad shots from machines and know what espresso does if you leave it too long (again... testing on starbucks' dime... ps i was an awesome employee or ""partner"").  

They do have fresh pastries that they serve, but I didn't really have any and can't really comment.

All in all, definately a nice place.  The only thing I don't really like about it is the lack of space.  I came in here with two other people and ended up sitting on the window sill.  It was ""padded"" but it was quite cold on my backside.

Last note... the name of their espresso machine is called the Slayer... How can you go wrong with that?  I mean whoever came up with this machine knew what he was doing.  ""I'm going to make the most kick-ass machine out there, and then to top it all off I'm going to call it the Slayer"".  Oh, and it's only $18,000 dollars.  Maybe that's why they don't have seating space... =/

It is, in all senses of the word, an old fashioned diner. The wood paneling of the interior is from another error and not a design you would see from a place that has been remodeled, I would think, in the last 20+ years but that adds to the rustic charm. The menu is a mix of traditional breakfast foods, many from before the time we worried too much about heart disease (includes me, I'm a huge fan of the Tom Mix, which is corned beef hash, eggs, country fried potatoes and toast) and they have some great Southwest based breakfast items.

From the discussion between patrons and waiters I got the sense that the place has A LOT of regulars and the discussions provide a homey feel that I found enjoyable. I actually live fairly close so surprised that I have not come here more often (oh wait, not a big fan of breakfast food, that would explain it). I would probably do breakfast here on a Sunday morning and then maybe head over to Cartel Coffee Lab, just down the street for a more high-end coffee drink and a chance to read the Sunday paper of your choice. I feel bad about doing that in Harlow's because it is one of those places that the waitresses make more money via the turnover so I don't think extended lingering would be appreciated but Cartel can fulfill that part of your Sunday morning experience if a little Sunday paper downtime is part of your preferred weekend experience. :-)",2012-01-16 16:41:12

It is also very convenient.

Off the 202, down Val Vista (about a couple of blocks) and you're there.

For one time use, just drive up to the gate, select wash type, pay with cash or plastic, and proceed to the wash.  An attendant is there to guide you so the tire aligns into their wash tunnel.  Put it in neutral, sit back and enjoy the wash and dryer until signaled to drive away.

With the membership, just drive up to the gate, wait until their sensors read your RFID chip in the sticker they give you (under a minute wait).  Gate opens and follow through.

Once out, they have many stalls with free vacuum and free air hose to blow away leftover water and debris.

for appetizer, we had scotty's meatball which i thought was okay and my bf absolutely LOVED . he kept on saying this is how a meatball should be . i also got to try their grilled calamari, grilled to perfection ! not too chewy, but not raw, & flavorful . now this, was exactly how it should be . 
for pasta, i had the crespelle w roasted butternut squash . YUM ! the butternut squash filling was sweet, smooth & sooo good ! but the portion was tiny . boooo .
for main entree, i had the shredded pork wrapped w ribeye & goat cheese which was interesting, but again, i thought it was pretty mediocre yet my bf LOVED . however, the portion was tiny . 3 of them, about 1 1/2 thumb size each . the bf had the braised beef ribs . portion was a LOT bigger and it was ... omg heavenly . the meat was so tender, it just fell off the bone . so flavorful . as for the side dishes, we had sweet potato mash & asparagus . nothing to write home about .

The colors in here are bright and attractive, and there's so much to look through that it will be difficult to leave here without dropping $20+.

The only weird thing here is parking.  You need to maneuver around the back parking lot where the entrance is in order to get into the place--not very intuitive, but once you get there, the extra effort is worth it.

So Ethiopian food... basically you eat everything with this spongy, swiss cheese like bread called ""injera"" that kinda tastes like a crepe. You usually have a couple of sides that are cooked in a stew type thing called ""wat"". I just realized that I made it sound a bit unappetizing, but it's good stuff--especially because it's out of the norm and the sides vary from simple and vegetarian to very rich meats.

I like bringing friends here because you can all split one of their combinations. They'll give you a huuuuuge plate that has like a dozen different sides on a bed of injera. You also get extra injera on the side. From there, take a sip of your tea and dig in! The plate will be in front of everyone so you can kind of just eat at it together until it's gone or you're full.

This place is not for everyone, but you have to kind of go into knowing that it's going to be a different meal experience.

Part steakhouse, part charcuterier: the oh-so meat-centric decor includes a huge windowed meat locker and the mural on the opposing wall spans most of the dining room to the back where the open kitchen let's you peak at celeb cheff Rob Rossi's team at work.

We started with bacon wrapped dates (Devils of Horseback) and then proceeded to order a number of small plates in an attempt to try as much as possible without committing to a steak dinner. Everything was beyond amazing; the house-made charcuterie was perhaps the best I've sampled since the whole trend started. The steak tartare was served with a fried quail egg and salty olives (good combo) and the ravioli filled with ricotta and runny egg was rich and decadent.

We had a great night. Everything exceeded our expectations: the food, the service, the music we're suberb. They even made me an exceptionally good Amaretto Sour.",2012-04-16 12:38:43

So Scottish that it tried to be, it had a Rangers Club sandwich and a Celtic Club sandwich where the only difference was the name and the supporter who ordered them.  Cute.  But the years of folks forgetting about this place took their toll and ran this place into the ground somewhat.

Now, since going through an episode of Restaurant Makeover, it has retained its warm pub-by feel, but has been cleaned up and brings an inviting menu and list of taps that will satisfy even the purist.  My new introduction since the makeover came after a particularly gruelling night of soccer and a need for a thirst-quencher and late-night bite.  My fellow teammates and I descended for pitchers of beer and not knowing anything about the menu since the renovation, opted for the sports platter of perogies, wings, beef ribs, bruschetta, and fries.  Though somewhat scattered in its range, the menu holds up on the more gastro-pub side of pub fare.

They even have their own club if you feel like this is a place to get to frequently.  Apparently membership provides discounts and invites to special members-only events.  It's a bit far afield for me, but if you live in the area, you may wish to give it a look.  Definitely a place to try out or retry if you've been in the previous messy days of sectarian sandwiches.",2008-10-17 15:08:37

Served on a crusty baguette, cherry tomatoes, olives, and boiled egg. Very tasty for a mid day lunch, or even a light dinner. Also was able to have the pain Au Chocolat which was light, airy, with a slightly buttery flaky outter shell complimented with the lucious chocolate center.... yum!

I think that ShowStoppers appeals to a certain type of audience. As I looked around the theater, most members of the audience were grey-haired elderly folks, and that's okay! Alls I'm saying is that a Broadway show doesn't cater to the same type of broad audience as say, a Cirque show.  

There's about 6 core singers supported by at least two dozen dancers and a full orchestra. I will say that the performers are talented, but I have to admit I was bored for most of the show. The acts that had my full attention were ""Willkomen"" from Cabaret, ""Cell Block Tango"" from Chicago, and ""Anything You Can Do"" from Annie Get Your Gun. I recognized some classic Broadway songs, but again, the majority of songs were unfamiliar and really dated. At the end of the show, the audience gave the performers of ShowStoppers a standing ovation.

ShowStoppers is a Vegas show that is all about the talent of the performers. The intimate size of the theater is well suited to this type of show. The performers switch out costumes for each act and there are minimal stage changes. Compared to most shows, ShowStoppers is pretty modest and I guess you could say old school.

Worth a Return Visit?
I had the opportunity to see ShowStoppers for free. I doubt I would have bought tickets to this show because I have zero interest in Broadway. ShowStoppers is a good show for what it is, but one viewing is enough for me.

(I love when restaurants go the extra step and take care of your drinks for you. Failing that, I love when my date carries my drink for me.)

At our table, we were faced with a terrible decision: order off the $60 special prix-fixe menu or select from one of the many prime cuts of steak on offer. The horror! Fortunately for us, the items on the prix-fixe menu were also available a la carte. We decided to splurge and get the most romantic dish on the menu: the 40 oz. Porterhouse for two, plus a roasted beet salad starter from the prix-fixe menu and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. Last of all we selected Roquefort and Bearnaise from the list of sauces. Honestly, there were so many choices in each category and everything sounded so great that it took us about half an hour before we could place our order. Our server was patient with us throughout and never made us feel rushed.

Sometime in between ordering our entrees and receiving the complimentary gigantic popovers for which BLT is famous (and rightly so), we were approached by the sommelier who offered recommendations, such as a bottle of DeLille Cellars D2 2007.

Our Porterhouse was a massive two inches thick, cooked to the requested medium-rare, topped with a thyme compound butter, and served sliced on the bone with a roasted head of garlic alongside. My first bite of steak practically melted in my mouth, and though they didn't need it, the remainder of my bites were topped with either sauce. Some of the steak seemed to be a bit more done, but that's to be expected when trying to cook such a thick, bone-in cut. I found that I preferred the Roquefort with the more well-done pieces, and the Bearnaise with the rare.

The sides arrived in adorable individual Staub casseroles and were also mouth-watering. The gratin was a perfectly arranged layer of potato coins bathed in a rich, creamy, cheesy sauce with a hint of roasted garlic. And the creamed spinach was the best I've had: not too saucy and with the perfect amount of nutmeg.

Throughout the meal, the wine paired well and really opened up as the evening progressed. At the conclusion of the meal, however, I realized that the full-bodied wine's flavor had changed to something more, well, saline. In fact, the only note I could taste was salt--and my boyfriend agreed. When Scott came by to check on us, we invited him to taste some of the wine. He declined politely, but when we explained that the flavor of the wine was now off, he poured a small taste off the floor. When he returned he conceded that he could see how we felt it was now salty, and said that perhaps it would have benefited from being decanted. Did we want it taken off our bill? Just then, although we'd declined dessert, our server placed a complimentary plate of brownie-like bites on the table. As Scott was talking, I took a bite and then a sip of the wine. Again, the wine's flavor changed and really enhanced the toffee flavor of the little cake. My boyfriend told Scott that the wine had been fine up until the end--and was again perfect. Still, Scott insisted that we have two glasses of dessert wine, especially since we'd received yet another complimentary dessert plate, this time of chocolate mousse-filled cornets.

As we sipped the late harvest Zinfandel and the Hungarian Tokaji, we chatted with Scott and learned that he is originally from Napa. We mentioned that we are from the Bay Area and enjoy going up to wine country. But next time we'll be well armed with his suggestions of wineries to try.

My sweetie and I ended up closing down the restaurant, with full bellies and fond memories. Even though there had been some minor imperfections with our meal, the personal attention we received from Scott Larson and the gracious service ensured this five-star review.",2010-02-21 19:21:34

My date and I decided to share a large pizza which was plenty of food for the both of us. It took a long time to come out and was the worst pizza I had ever had. The dough was not cooked and the cheese was covering all the toppings-we got pineapple and bacon. It was like they knew it was a terrible pizza and thought a bunch of cheese on top to cover it up. The tomato sauce was running everywhere and watery. I was glad I also ordered a side Cesar salad to go with the pizza as it was almost inedible. It was Tuesday Trivia night (the last of the season) so we decided to stay and keep drinking. We had a blast and the host was fantastic.  Overall a fun night but very disappointed in the pizza.

It was a Sunday (don't judge me) and part deux of the Yelp Elite/my birthday after parties. I dragged along my hubby and friend Chris to participate in the debauchery.

Let's start with the things I do remember...
I remember this place being small, dark and random (similarities to my OWN description are purely coincidental at this time). It looked like a cozy dive bar for regulars and Queen Street West-ers alike. The funny thing is I have probably passed this place a million times and never knew it was a bar!

The patio is sick! The foosball table was convenient, and the bathrooms were certifiably scary ass hell!

Now for the parts I don't remember... I found the most amazing earth shattering cider in the world. The type of cider that if in the wrong hands could spell the end of civilization it self. The name of this cider you ask?! No F***ing clue :-(

Last time I went, I got ""adventurous"" and tried the tikka masala.  YUM!  I also love those little balls soaked in syrup.

It has a lot of seating that can be good for small parties and a few areas great for larger parties. The music wasn't overbearing like it can be in some places that are trying for the trendy or modern feel. 

The issue was the food. It was spectacularly bland. I had to douse my food in teriyaki sauce to even get an inkling of flavor. I will say that it did not make me sick, though, which was nice. They are good about not cross contaminating the food. We had both ordered the tofu dishes, so I could not say if the meat dishes are different from what we experienced. 

Overall, I would not say this place is a strict ""no"" to the public. Try it, maybe it will be better for the next person or for those who do not share my diet.

The decor is modern and chic, and I definitely like the design of the chairs surrounding the bar.  The lunch options were plentiful, all served with your choice of fried rice or lo mein, and of course your meat option.  It was less than 10 bucks - and it was a good helping, for sure.  I happened to be particularly hungry this afternoon and ate each bite, but many have been known to take leftovers.

You can start with soup or salad, let me not forget.  I chose the salad and what a tasty salad it was - a ginger dressing you can literally DRINK the remains of.  Seriously - people do it.  ;)

I had the chicken teriyaki which I must say, was jam packed in flavor more than many teriyakis I've had in the past.  It hit a nice little spot with me - not spicy, but not bland, and not that overly salty flavor you can occasionally encounter.  The vegetables were on point in texture and in variety, providing carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, onions, and the every now and again bite of zucchini.  The rice's texture was splendid as well - and flavor certainly on point.

My friends call this place NO BOOTAY - which is cute - but for someone who certainly has a bootay, I'll just say, they did not discriminate... har dee har har.

I would most certainly recommend this eatery for lunch in Solon.  It has been known to be hit or miss for service sometimes, but I know it's because they usually don't have too many working and probably get a nice steady crowd during those peak times.  If you let them know all the things you'll need ahead of time though, you should be set.  By this I mean silverware if you require it, lemons for your water, you know - certain people's staples.

The crust was thin and chewy and very light. The toppings were delicious and  extra seasoning wasn't needed. The spinach was actually fresh spinach and you could tell it wasn't from frozen.

I still get mind-blown by Dale Chihuly's glass art deco at the Bellagio that hangs above the hotel lobby's ceiling upon entrance, an extravagant welcome (and topper) after any experience at the fountains that still leaves me smiling today. And to actually step foot in one of his galleries felt almost surreal.

As we got in, my friends and I were greeted with a nice, warm welcome by art consultants, Terri and Bravo, who were both very accomodating and ready to answer any questions we might've had. Terri introduced us to the acrylic lithographs that started at about $2000 and were considered the cheapest art pieces in the gallery while the cheapest glass sculpture was priced at about $4500. Shaped to perfection and precise geometry, I would argue that despite the price, it's well worth it. 

Besides the utterly expensive professional pieces, be mindful that there are other products available for purchase such as books, DVDs and even Chihuly art kits for souvenirs that are within the 2-digit price range so be sure to look into those as well.

My water must have been re-filled about 4 times, I kid you not. Especially when the place is not super busy, the wait staff is very attentive, even if they aren't your assigned server. 

ONE PLUS...THEY HAVE HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY!!!! They have $2 drafts of Coors Lite, Miller Lite and one other I think. They also have a good amount of appetizers for $4.95 during happy hour.

However, after many rave reviews from foodie friends, we decided to check the place out and it totally lived up to its hype.  

The list of beers on tap (I don't do bottles in a gastropub, bottles are for drinking at home) was nice - my husband could get his cherished Guinness and I could pick something flavored to my taste.  For those complaining about the food menu being small, I would rather a place do one page of dishes really well than have everything and the kitchen sink on there and do half of it badly.  I went for the chicken and waffles and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Nice n' moist and with a lot of savory touches that balanced the sweetness of the syrup.  They came on a bed of brussels sprouts, which are one of my least favorite vegetables - let's just say I feel about brussels sprouts the way George Bush Sr. felt about broccoli - but they even managed to make the sprouts taste good!  If you can make me clean brussels sprouts off my plate and go mm mm good, you deserve at least four stars right there.  Husband was happy with his steak as well.  

I'll confess to being mildly disappointed in the cheese and meat board appetizer because it (a) contained some sort of cracker jack popcorn as one of the ingredients that didn't fit with the other items very well and (b) we ordered a cheese, prosciutto and duck and while there were reasonable dollops of the cheese and prosciutto, we got ONE little slice of duck - not even enough to share between two people - and hidden under piles of the other stuff so we had to search for it on the plate.  Not acceptable - I expect there to be enough of each meat and cheese that each person can have 2 crackers' worth.  However, everything else was so good I decided not to take off a star for lack of duck.  

The servers are more hipster bar types than trained pros, but they were enthusiastic, and our main table server checked on us a lot.  Food was delivered quickly despite the restaurant being very full, and we were done in an hour.  I also really appreciate that Deagan's has wood paneling and upholstery that absorbs a lot of the noise when the restaurant is full, especially since this is a kid-friendly establishment and there were people sitting near us with toddlers.  You could still hear the buzz of people but I did not have to shout at my husband to converse.  I wish more restaurants would take a lesson from this.

I do know my tastebuds though and this place simply did not win them over. My companion and I shared a wonton soup for an appetizer and this was the best part of the meal by far. A good spice and a far cry from the blandness that is often experienced at every americanized chinese restaurant in the US. 

The problem was with the main course. I ordered the green curry (what the waitress recommended as it was her favorite) with the fake duck. The portion was large but it lacked depth. It was mostly potato, curry sauce, and fake duck meat. I was a vegetarian for 15 years and occasionally still crave the replica of the real deal...not in the sense of a substitution, I actually like it! Sadly, this stuff was not good...maybe a 3 on a ten scale, 1 being that watery tofu that turned everyone off tofu. 

Okay so the protein wasn't that great...but most people I know will tolerate an overcooked fish as long as it's served with lots of butter. The curry should of been the saving grace of this meal, but that too fell flat. The green curry seemed to hit one note and when I think curry I think it must of been invented by an overworked spice rack giving up and everything just falling into the pot below and with a chef, simply having had enough, served this dish with every spice in the kitchen included and bam! Curry! The dish I experienced here did not fit that description, it was bland and simply lacking in tatebud stimulus. 

The waitress was wonderful (my water glass was never even close to 1/2 empty and the palce was packed!), the spice level was spot on with what we ordered, but ultimately it was not to my liking. 

Unfortunately this place reminded me of those americanized chinese restaurants in that the people running it have toned down the flavors in order to suit americans better.

The decor is very hip and modern and you might want to wear something a bit nicer than shorts and a t-shirt for dinner lest you feel under dressed.

The sushi prices are fair and the rolls are a decent size. The rolls weren't really anything special for me and I can't really recall what they tasted like. Though I recall having a roll slathered in mayo and even with my love of mayo it was too much for me. Forgetting what the rolls taste like might be a side effect of their drink specials though. Super cheap and extremely strong well drinks are offered on the cheap on Wednesday nights, and they have different drink specials every night of the week but I've only been on Wednesdays.

The servers and hostesses are super friendly, they even gave me some free drinks and a few free rolls my second time there! The location, atmosphere, and cheap drinks are nice, however since I can't really call the sushi here very special or even remember it So I'd probably choose other options closer to home given the chance.",2011-05-25 00:00:30

Me and my co-workers head here for lunch whenever we are wanting some Mexican food. The restaurant is located in a run down plaza which can turn some people off. In fact, I was prejudiced against it when I first visited it because of that, but we've been back many times.

All I've ever gotten is the ground beef tacos. They are some of the best. It is hard to find a place that does ground beef in their tacos. Most of the time restaurants do shredded beef which I hate.  The burritos that everybody else gets look good but I haven't ever tried one. Cervantes isn't one of those Mexican restaurants that flood the plates in beans or cheese. You can tell that they care how the food is prepared.

The service is good. The owner guy and his wife are amiable. You pay up at the front before you sit down and eat which makes check splitting for large groups easy. They bring you chips and salsa. Not a big fan of the chips, but they are free. 

If you are looking for a Mexican restaurant in Tempe you should try Cervantes. Some people like it and some people don't. But I like it, it is good for lunch.",2011-01-07 20:12:41

My tech was nice but sadly I didnt notice that there are bits and pieces of the previous blue shooting through my newly applied nude polish on almost every finger. Also I felt really bad for the techs because there were 2 very very picky difficult customers they were dealing with and a lady who seemed to be the manager was a bit rough with the girls at the front desk although they were nice.

This is a fairly high-end chocolate store, but it's nice.  While I don't see myself lounging around on the couches they provide, I did try some of their samples, like the chocolate seasoned with the New Orleans chicory coffee (quite good).  Around the place they have signs asking people to be respectful and understand that all items may not to be to everyone's tastes.  This is pretty good chocolate.  I couldn't foresee anyone screaming in horror and spitting out their sample in disgust.  Have they had instances in the past?

Regardless of said unsolved mystery, the staff present was very nice and helpful, and helped me select the bacon chocolate treat I wanted to try.  And it was good.  Weird-good, a little salty, but strangely, compellingly good.  Not a regular choice, but something I could easily try again as a treat.

But here's the thing, I didn't seem to have any sales tax when I checked out.  I even checked my receipt, and everything matched up.  Do they make the tax inclusive to the overall price?  Is this a tax exempt food item?  Whatever the reason, I'm not arguing it.  It was just a little surprising.

This is very classy, quality chocolate with a nice staff running the place, and not a bad pricing for the level of taste that you get.  I'll have to try their ""drinking chocolate"".  My, they have a fancy name for everything these days, don't they?

I brought this to the attention of the Dominoes employee when I opened the box in the store and it was like she didn't even care. I asked her why the cheese is non existent and she said the cheese is shredded. I don't even know how you can shred feta cheese since its a crumbly cheese.

When I complained, I couldn't even tell if she was listening since she was not looking at me or the pizza. I had to say ""hello are you even listening?"".

The waffles were ready within a few minutes, and we dug in. I wish my waffle were crisper on the outside and not as soft inside (it seemed a little undercooked). However, I loved the combination of the ice cream with the waffle. The ice cream itself had great flavor, and it was a generous scoop. The temperature contrast between the cold ice cream and hot waffle was great, and I loved how the ice cream melted into the holes on the waffle.

As we were one block away from Olive & Gourmando on Thursday morning, we could smell something delicious. By the time we reached the corner of Saint Pierre and Saint Paul, there were already a few people patiently waiting for the restaurant to open. The moment the clock struck 8, we were welcomed with smiling faces as the door swung open. With a comfy, rustic vibe and a counter filled with freshly baked goods, stepping into Olive and Gourmando first thing in the morning was delightful.

My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Poached Egg On Your Face"" Panini. Sriracha in a breakfast sandwich? Yes, please! It was a bit greasy, but delicious -- deliciously crunchy and cheesy with a bit of a kick.

I am a chocoholic, and I couldn't leave Olive & Gourmando without trying a brioche, the Brioche au Chocolat Valrhona in particular. The moment I took my first bite, I died and went to chocolate heaven... The brioche was nice and warm, soft, and VERY chocolatey! I LOVE chocolate but even I think it may be a bit too chocolatey sweet for breakfast. It worked out nicely that my boyfriend and I shared something savoury and something sweet.

Before heading back home, we stopped by Olive & Gourmando again. This time, it was right around noon and there was a bit of a line, filled with both tourists and locals, waiting to be seated. We decided to just order take-out and ended up getting five Chocolate and Banana & Chocolate brioches to bring back home.

The menu is a bit limited, at least in my opinion, for a thai restaurant. The pricing and limited menu didnt look like it would play well with conventional asian family style communitive dinner.

The beef salad was by far the best tasting item we ordered during this meal. It was nicely seasoned and grilled to order so it had that fresh off the grill smokey, concentrated, burnt taste. 

Krung Siam platter is...quite...insulting to be honest. 13 hard earned dollars for two of everything: 

Two satays one chicken one beef both lacking the fresh off the grill smokey flavor, seems more like broiled, chicken was overly dry. Sauces were there obviously to cover up this fact.

Spring rolls: more like miniature egg rolls with bland tasteless filling. Another excuse to show off the sauces or serve something deep fried, or both.

Fried Battered Shrimp: tasteless with more deep fried flavor then shrimp flavor. Might as well deep fry presoaked and reshapened cardboard if you have a deep fry fetish be a lot cheaper too

Thai Dumplings: Best thing on the plate but seriously not thai. Not even close unless Dim Sum started in Thailand and the Chinese came, knocked out the Thai, stole their food and the Thai woke up and completely forgot about it.

Crab Ragoons: Again i have a problem with this. Crab implies fresh crab, a little guy with two pinchers, a bunch of claws and sweet sweet meat. Krab is a biproduct of liquefied, reshapened, reseasoned and food colored crap (yes crap not krap). Anyway no surprise here it had a heavily deep fried taste, very little texture from the Krab, lots and lots of cream cheese. Here's an idea why not just bread and deep fry cream cheese?

Okay enough of that lets move on to the main courses:
Panang Curry
Quite nice. Ordered mild and everything was nice, flavorful, and mellow until i started fishing pieces off the bottom. Diced up chilis were waiting for me leaving my mouth burning and attempting to chill the flames with the coconut/peanut sauce from the sampler.

Beef Fried Rice
Yeah we can call epic fail on this one. Your basic very very dry not seasoned very well, wth is wrong with this beef it's colorless and tasteless fried rice.

The last complaint is the insulting price to food ratio. the sampler was 13.99 with only 7.99 worth of food. Both the rice and the curry were a decent size for one person but not filling.

Overall i can only give this place three stars. It's just too much money for too little food. This would be a place to take a date but not a place for serious eating",2010-09-10 00:15:40

7eUUEowtxxgN_Iw6vHr16Q,i3VsUMh9164wRh6EFYc9QA,XPLSNGSClW8gR5BTcvyOhQ,3,1,1,1,"So I decided to give this place a try even though I knew it had mediocre Yelp reviews. And honestly, I had a gift card so I kinda had to go to get rid of it.
So we walk in, and there is no host. After a few minutes, someone appears and takes us to our table. She tells us we are the 3rd table of the day. They walk you through the ""kitchen"" which I find to be odd and quite frankly, a little disturbing. I don't know if this is a real kitchen or just for show. I don't really like the idea of guests walking through a food prep area. I don't see how that can be sanitary, not to mention dangerous. 
The dining room is very large and cutely decorated. Looks just like Grandma's place back in Jersey. Must be authentic, right? More on that later. We sat in a booth and let me tell you, I've never felt so many 2 x 4's underneath me! The seat was not comfortable.
So there is one couple eating quietly, now us, and a party of about 12 not too far from where we are sitting. I guess they think they have the whole place to themselves because they were so loud and obnoxious.
This place requires you to order ""family style"" which basically means if you don't want to take out a second mortgage, you better agree upon what to order because it's expensive! The small portion says it feeds 1-3 people, but that's not entirely accurate. 
Oh, and everything here is a la carte, meaning you are paying for everything separately.  So we decide on the chopped anti pasta salad, spaghetti and meatballs, and garlic bread. 
Took forever to get our drinks and we were only the 3rd table. Finally, the salad arrives. It's plenty for 3 people. Good flavor. I didn't like that everything was so tiny, hence, chopped. Looked like they put everything in a food processor. It would've been better with more salami and olives, but not bad.
I need to mention that the dishes here look well past their prime. Even though I'm sure they were clean, they look like they've been around for 100 years. Time to donate to the shelter and get some clean dishes. What are supposed to be white plates look dingy and grey with black marks. Yuck. Kinda sets the tone.
Ok folks, the spaghetti and meatballs come out. TWO meatballs. This is supposed to feed up to three people. So the third person doesn't get a meatball? Strange.  Anyway, the ""marinara"" sauce was awful. It was basically just stewed tomatoes with runny liquid. Even the waitress commented that she was going to bring us a bowl of extra sauce. More of the same. Probably would've been better with a bowl of chips and labeled salsa. It was nothing  like  marinara sauce.  The meatballs were very bland. Could've used some onion or garlic or any seasoning!
The garlic bread was plentiful, but again, no flavor. The only good thing about it was that it had what appeared to be garlic chunks on it, but it needed salt or seasoning and more butter, oil or whatever was supposed to be on there.
The server was nice enough to comp the spaghetti and meatballs after she asked us if we liked it and we said no.
Unexpected, but a nice gesture on her part. The overall service was slow and drinks were not refilled in a timely manner.
Overall, the ambience is great. It looks Italian. The food, not so great. Be prepared to drop some serious coin. If I were you, I'd choose one of the nearby mom and pop Italian joints for a fraction of the price. Unless of course you were cursed with a gift card also.",2018-09-02 03:25:56

4vqDJ9aeZa1FMqiCe80kvg,zHObp0JAXWNKXFvbz3zxeQ,lsHmnOZNlsKnEDsNmT-5_Q,5,1,0,0,"I had a Kinetico system in my last home and an RO system under the sink. I sold my home and purchased a new home that did not have a water system. The Kinetico system at the last home worked fine but service was poor and expensive along with the prohibitive cost of the soft water system (Kinetico Premier Series) and K5 RO Drinking Water System. Kinetico did not bother to install the RO system to the refrigerator saying they 'couldn't' do it. I always had floating ice particles (for those that know what I mean it is really gross to see them). 

American Home Water and Air offers good products at reasonable prices. I met with Tom who called me back immediately. It is scary how fast he responds and how fast they installed once I told them I wanted to proceed. They don't mess around. There were no games and he was very straightforward and to the point. The installation is top notch. Indeed, they connected the RO system to my refrigerator in the kitchen from under the kitchen sink and installed a line all the way downstairs in my basement wet bar. They then installed another RO line to my refrigerator in the basement and now that refrigerator has RO ice and water as well. Nice! Tom told me this could be done with the single RO unit upstairs (saving me another unit price and RO install downstairs). They were at my home for 8 hours and had to cut drywall to run lines and drill through the concrete foundation upstairs. They had to run a line through my attic too. Everything was repaired just fine and the only thing I have to do is paint some spots (but they actually matched it pretty well already).  Tom suggested all of this to dial us in right and it is fantastic.  I love the can-do attitude and looking out for customer needs.  

I will say that the pressure of the RO system from Kinetico is better and the water tastes great but for the price point and expensive filters it was crazy to buy it. From the refrigerators the flow of water is rather slow. With the RO ice however I'm not sure I really care about this or feel it is a big issue. The RO water produced from the system tastes good and seems to work just fine so far (two months). 

For the 'can do' installation, fair pricing, and not dealing with a cheesy sales pitch, I would wholeheartedly recommend American Home Water and Air. If I would have known about them at my old house I would have just gone with them. Can't recommend them enough.",2016-04-05 23:29:34

Of course before arriving I read a number of Yelp reviews and did my research online with regards to a lot of the dishes on the menu that I may not have understood being put on the spot at the time of ordering.  I can honestly say that early preparation made a big difference, even our waiter Brian was impressed as he was prepared to give us a 5 minute instructional run down of the menu.

So....drinks...ahhh....Alison (pregnant) really wanted a sip of wine so I ordered a Cab blend that was recommended by Brian.  The wine was great with everything that we ate, even though we didn't properly pair it, both the dishes and the wine held their own so intertwining the flavors was not even on my mind.

Our strategy going into the dinner was to not overeat as we were heading to a hockey game afterward and needed to make room for some arena-fare.  I thought that getting an appetizer, small pasta to share, and two dinner entrees would suffice, Brian whole-fully agreed.  So...here is the breakdown.

App - Supplì al telefono $7.00 - Yelp recommendation and a terrific one!!  We both absolutely loved these risotto balls.  Already planning to come back just to sit at the bar and get these.  Risotto, seemed tomato basil based, rolled, deep fried, and rolled again in what I believe was Parmesan dust.

Pasta - Linguine with baby clams, calamari and scallions $9.00 - This was just OK.  I thought the calamari was overcooked and a little rubbery, but the tentacles were fine.  I also believe the noodles were al dente, could have used a little more time on the skillet.  Broth was butter, lemon, wine, clam sauce? based but was good with the bread that is continually brought to your table.  I will get a different pasta next time.

Dinner (Jeff) - Chicken Legs ""saltimbocca"" style $17.00 - Phenomenal comfort dish!  I absolutely devoured this thing.  It's basically two seasoned chicken legs slow roasted, bone removed, stuffed with cheese, and flash fried to crisp the skin.  These legs were then placed on a bed of kale, polenta, and some sort of sauce / gravy that went perfectly with the dish.  All this topped with another green that I couldn't remember, too much dinner bliss at this point. 

Dinner (Alison) - Stuffed Swordfish with olive paste $20.00 - Alison and I both really enjoyed this dish.  It was more of a stack then a stuff.  Bottom layer was deep fried polenta, next layer was grilled swordfish, then arugula, olive paste with kalamatas, another sword filet, and then topped with a little drizzle of a sauce, balsamic it seemed, and some greens.  This dish went beautifully when tasted together or separate.  I really loved the flavor the grill gave the sword, nicely seasoned.  Would definitely get again.  The olive paste doesn't make it too salty, just know that its there before you order.

Desert - None Needed

Overall - Great dinner, period.  Service (Brian) was always attentive but never annoying, waters always full, dishes cleared properly (time and fashion), the atmosphere was comforting / fun, and all in all I thought the bill fit the dinner perfectly.  Under $100 for what we both agreed were totally fantabulous meals, those that deserve a made up word like fantabulous.  So stop hesitating, its not as dressy appropriate as you might think.  There is always the bar area with tables that seem a little more laid back.   Not at all what either of us expected but in a very good way.",2011-03-07 20:53:20

Markham is home to many dim sum restaurants. Unfortunately this place doesn't rank high in my books. 

This place is pricey when compared to other places in the area. This would be okay if they we're better but I think they fall short. Typical dishes are compariable and there special dishes like charcoal infused buns are dry and tough. They do look good so if Instagram is life it may be for you. 

The staff is rather rude to younger groups. Don't expect to have your tea pot filled without asking or your order to placed nicely on the table. I know it's not that's typical for dim sum but the decor and price leads you to expect otherwise.

I usually just do hot pot with family or friends at someone's house. After coming here I realized I would much rather prefer DIY hotpot over going out to eat it.

My party was seated when we got there and they gave us a list of appetizers to choose from with a limit of 3 per person. After checking what you want, you basically walk over to their fridge and it's a free for all. To be honest, I was kind of disgusted by the fridge because it just had plates of exposed meat lying inside for god knows how long. I stuck to a lot of the vegetables.

The hot pot itself had two sides, a spicy side, and a non-spicy side that was divided, like most hot pots. The meat, as I expected, was not very tasty. But, it wasn't horrible. I stuck with the beef, the lamb was too gross. Halfway through our meal we got all of our appetizers, and at that point I didn't even feel like eating them, I was too into cooking in the hot pot.

I would say the highlight of the meal was drinking the soup broth after cooking a lot of vegetables and seafood in it the whole night. It was flavorful and satisfying.

Our server was very attentive and refilled our water constantly while taking away all our used plates every time there was a small pile. He also left us a teapot of water to refill our soups when we needed it.

If this place was closer to my house, I would consider coming back sometime. But I think for me, hot pot is better left at home.",2014-02-03 18:55:51

I went in around 8:00 pm and they only had 5 people at the bar with 2 sushi chefs and 1 server.  they had all this open table but the server only gave me the smallest table they could find since i was only 1 person.  it was my first time there so i did not know if the service would be fast or slow? so I ordered as much as i could at that particular time..  

First I started with the apps which was:
fried oysters which was too much panko and the oyster its self was small so all I could taste was the breading and not the oyster.

Poki Salad: I thought it tasted like salsa and not poki.. but then again Poke means cubed in hawaiian so I let that go.  I did however think that they did skimp on the tuna coz I couldn't even taste any tuna in there.

for sushi I ordered:
Tuna - it was the frozen kind

Yellow tail which was good since they served me the belly part.

Salmon - It was good 

Red Snapper - It wasn't snapper.  It was Talapia.  I asked the server if it was Snapper or Talapia and he told me that it was snapper.  so I ordered it.  then came out Talapia. 

Unagi (Eel) - it was bad to the point that it was spoiled. I put it in my mouth and then I spit it out.  I told the server that it was spoiled and all he said was "" so you didn't like it"".  No one even came to me to appologize.

Octopus - Chewy and warm

Squid - good but not great

Tamago - sold out which says that the chefs are lazy at that restaurant. since egg is the cheapest and one of the more important netta at a sushi bar since that determines the quality of the restaurant.

Tekka maki - no flavor.

Natto - warm and no taste.

the one bright spot for the meal was the sushi rice was made very good.  not too mushy and not too hard.  Since the rice is the most important  ingredient to sushi.  because Sushi means "" Vinegared Rice"".  

I'm sorry but I do not think I will be back to this restaurant every again.  Also I only spoke english in there but I also speak Japanese and I could over hear the conversation that the chef and server was saying and I can hear that they were bad mouthing me..

Their location is primo, settled into another side-street of the arts district. By virtue of that, Vesta (though new) already attracts a steady stream of the ilk who flock to First Fridays or who are permanent residents of the neglected and oft forgotten Las Vegas arts scene. That's right: Vesta is a good fit for anyone wanting a quick cup, but especially those young 20/30-somethings who are in search of a ""coffee hangout"" in this part of town more than they are a ""coffee experience.""

I had a macchiato, which though somewhat petit, was well-crafted, not bitter. Accompanying was a bowl of their soup of the day, a carrot ginger, just what my congested sinuses needed. Due to the latter, I can't comment much on the taste, but the texture and temperature were right on, ready for dipping the included bread sides. 
On said bread, the melted cheese was somewhat unappealing, its bright orange hue overpowering the muted color of the soup. If I souped here again, I'd ask for toast plain. 

There are no creature comforts or unique styles here that make Vesta remarkable, but the prices are right, the location key, the interior sparse but clean, and the taste of the things is fine. They make an effort to remember your name on the first visit which is neighborly, but you must collect your own food and drink when it's ready. There's no pastry display, so if you want a plain croissant, for example, you must order a croissant-meal from the menu. Thankfully, you can get one for $4.

Is this Jennifer?"" Um, ok really?! Can you please be sort of professional?  Anyway, we started chatting about the details of the gig, like how long I would play, what I charged and so on.

-Our water looked disgusting! It wasn't clear, it was pretty cloudy and had little white things floating in it. Needless to say I didn't dare touch it. I ordered a juice instead and didn't bother pouring it into the cups provided because of all the flies that were flying in the kitchen area.

The food:
-I ordered the spinach and feta cheese omelette with home fries and toast. My home fries was a bit on the cool side and didn't taste fresh. My omelette was average. My mom definitely makes wayyy better omelettes.

Well, my friends were promoting this place, so the djs, the dancers and so forth was all from LA. I'm a crazy hip hopper and I love majority of our djs. So when the music is consistently good, I have a good time too.

I seriously admit that I didn't expect much from this place. But once I walked in I really like the TVs all around the dance floor. Instead of strobe-lights they had tv with lights..The dance floor was a little too small. I think they should have taken out the middle go go dancer section. That took up unnecessary space. They already had space for the hot dancers up on stage.

My favorite part of the place was their outside. It had nice comfy white sofa like couches to lounge in and their own bar. Although it was cold and I'm glad no one reserve the tables outside because we got to sit down and relax a little. My favorite DJ played outside and of course he was badass. The music was so good people were dancing and having fun in the freaking cold. 

I like the bartender who was at the outside patio because the ones inside was just too freaking slow. The restrooms was not properly designed. I like the Co-ed Style but they had equal amount of stalls for guys and girls..hmmm.. whats wrong with that? Everyone knows girls freaking take forever! So the lines were always ridiculously long and looking at the guy side I wanted to go in their stalls but of course the people attending the restrooms didn't allow it. 

Overall this place has potential. It's a great club. However based on their own dj and go go dancers versus the promotion groups that night, They need a little bit more work. The place was crowded and I believe that's due to the promoters from LA, not in Vegas. Based on previous reviews the place seemed like it was slow, but hey after this event people would frequent ROK!

McKenzie is promoted so my go to person was Jason.  Quite a rock star Bud tender. 



Went in again today. Jason Is the  Man. The only thing that bugs me is the impersonal way they call you into the weed room.

Maybe I don't want my name heard all over the dispensary. Maybe you guys need to practice up on that. A little goes a long way.",2018-04-12 23:46:42

Is it authentic Mexican? No, but who cares. It's good and possibly healthy. But the main point is it's good.
The line always moves pretty good. Although it can get loud in there so you might have to yell your choices. It is a little pricey but so much better the dollar burritos from some other place so it is worth it.
Good for lunch or dinner. So get some steak or carnitas and enjoy.
Extra point because they have Coke Zero on tap. Every place gets an extra point if they have Coke Zero on tap.

We came on a Saturday evening and waited for several minutes for a table to be cleaned.  We perused through the menu and ordered the following:

- Vegan corn cakes w/sweet and sour dipping sauce - actual corn mixed in the flour...not a huge fan as the corn kernels kept getting stuck on my teeth
- chicken wings and sticky rice - rice was bluish, but my daughter loved it.  The wings were sweet and salty and the meat had a nice chew to it.
- Pad See Ew Beef - not as pan fried as I would have liked, but still good.
- Panang Pork Curry - the curry is not as thick as I would have liked either, but the flavor profile was there.

We wanted to order the crispy duck panang but they ran out.  We also ordered the thai iced tea and thai iced coffee, but they had to brew a new batch so we only got it half way through our meals...so that became dessert instead.

If you were to never touch it and leave it on the night stand then it would last days probably. ""How much does it last in a day?"" Like she said, If you are to put it on but don't check up on it and have Bluetooth off etc it will last you a whole day at least.

I see. Why do I want an Apple Watch that can last a day or days if I cannot use its functions?

I had to go twice because the day before when I went to see if I could change the battery on my iPhone they were too busy. Plenty of watches on the floor but all were out of power. Seriously? Maybe you should put back the charging stations instead of just placing the watches there. Who made that decision??????????

I'm furious and disappointed at their Service Dept!  I've been coming here for many years because I own a Nissan, and I thought I could trust these guys. After I had my oil changed last week, Sam one of their service advisors assisted me and suggested that I get my transmission fluid serviced, and tire sensor light replaced.  Well, I took my Nissan Cube here yesterday to get them done, but as soon as I got home, the sensor light turned on again! I had this strange feeling that they didn't replace it, and instead just reset it (which by the way can be reset for free!)  How did I know? I took it to one of my old mechanic where I got an old quote. He told me Nissan never replaced it but charged me $234.03 anyway. My former mechanic had reset this sensor  before for free and had quoted me $199 if I wanted to get it replaced there; however, I went to this Nissan Dealership Service Department even though it cost more because they have all my records in their computer system, 
 I've been coming here to get my oil change and other repairs, but now I think I'm going to look for an honest, and reputable shop that I can trust, and build a relationship with. I'm not sure I could trust these people again, I'm also going to invest in a Car Diagnostic Device & App that can monitor my vehicle's health, decode my check engine light, and get maintenance alerts. I refuse to be taken for a ride.

I'll be speaking to their manager for sure, and reporting them to the Better Business Bureau. This is not acceptable!


UPDATE: So I took time off (which cost me money!) to get my car repaired again, and reencountered Sam. Even though he was apologetic, and understood my situation, I was still not happy. According to him, their mechanic forgot to reprogram the system. So basically, their mechanic did a half-ass job! What else did this mechanic forgot to do I wonder? He assured me that they did replace the sensor, and I could even have it double checked by the former mechanic where I got my second opinion. I was still feeling very wary, and honestly, the only thing that could make me believe it is if they had shown me the brand new sensor package and if they have given me the old one so I could dispose of it myself. But whatever! 
After they fixed the issue, I left the dealership dissatisfied and skeptical. My next oil change appointment will be in 3 months, and it will take some time if I decide to come back here. I had been a loyal customer of this dealership, but this experience made me suspicious about their service.",2018-08-01 07:00:36

It's a huge bowl of soft, moist rice topped with cucumber salad, tomatoes, lettuce, feta, tzatziki, garbanzo beans, and the perfectly grilled shrimp. It's basically a Greek salad on steroids, with some rice. That shrimp is the bomb dot com, no lie. Grilled and seasoned to herby, lemony perfection. A light but filling meal.

The GREAT GREEK GYRO is also a tasty option- pillowy pita with a good portion of beef-lamb topped with red onion, tomato, feta, and more tzatziki. It's a good gyro, dont get me wrong, but the bowl is a bit more unique.
The AVGOLMONO SOUP is a flavorful lemony broth filled with chicken and rice. The version here is tastier than many other places ice tried it, and as a side, the portion is quite large.

I don't think they enjoyed it as much as they could've if they had seen Romeo+Juliet at least.  Also, sometimes it was hard to make out what they actors were saying/singing, possibly because it was too loud? Kind of made it sound muffled or something, not super clear.  Maybe it would be nice if they had a screen with the words of the songs.. I doubt they would put that in but I think it would be nice!

Personally, I have seen all 3 movies, but I wasn't as into Gatsby as I was the other 2 movies. I really enjoyed the music from Romeo and Moulin, so overall the show was a success to me. Whenever they did Gatsby stuff it was ok, but I just wasn't as familiar with the music.  The tango dancers were great, they looked like they came from Dancing with the Stars. I also liked the voice of the woman who played Juliet, and another blond woman who I think sang a solo (""will you still love me when I'm not longer young and beautiful"" song)... 

I heard that the woman who played Satin was Briana Cuoco, Kaley Cuoco's sister. I saw her on The Voice so it was fun to know that she was singing and dancing in this show, she looked and sounded great!

We sat in the center, sort of near the back, and the seats were pretty good. I read that some people thought their seats were good and close, but then ended up being hard to tell what was going on. The stage was cut up in the middle of the theater, so I could see that sitting up closer could be difficult to see everything that was going on.

Every Wednesday evening and Saturday morning downtown Phoenix gets it's very own local marketplace with displays from some of Phoenix best food vendors, farmers, local artists and crafters, and food trucks. 

You likely won't find a dog taking a cat or a cat taking a mouse, but you can grab your groceries. From items like eggs, fresh produce, dairy, grass fed beef, fruits, and nuts. Hopefully you can take the cheese before the mouse does.

Stop by one of the many food  and truck vendors for one of the best German chocolate cakes you'll have this side of Germany, coffees and teas, locally canned and pickled veggies, home made pastas, and home grown cheeses. If your hungry order yourself a taco, quesadilla, gourmet hot dog, fruit smoothie, salad, or lumpia.

Don't forget to grab your bar of soap, bottle of lotion, local jewelry, hat, or scarf. If you forgot your purse, don't worry they have those here too; they're hand knit. Check out the glass art and bronze creations on your way out and you'll have spent a good 1 - 2 hours in local heaven.

Don't be like the cheese and end up standing alone. Bring your family and bring your friends, there's usually some sort of entertainment going on from one of the many musicians on their way through Phoenix providing quality listening.

Happy yelping! Who knows, you may just find me eating at one of the numerous venders here or buying a loaf of my favorite home baked blueberry bread.",2012-07-14 20:38:00

I ordered the Mentai noodles and the boyfie order the #1. Both were really, really good flavor wise, but the noodles were a bit too soft. Fresh udon noodles should be a little chewy like Oodle Noodle's! Still, it was really good. The shrimp and squid tempura were amongst the best I've ever had (including Japan).

They're a department store that stands alone, which means that it's significantly easier to navigate through as opposed to an ""anchor"" found within a mall. Additionally, their return policy is top notch, with no worries about being hassled if you only recently realized that the running shirts you purchased many moons ago appear to be showing your nipples.

While I'm not really a fan of their male dress clothes, they keep a good stock of active wear and casual tees that fit just fine into my wardrobe. My girlfriend, however, whose clothing requires a separate bedroom for storage/hoarding, strikes gold far more regularly than I do.

I'll even let you in on a little secret:

I loathe public restrooms and have been known to risk internal damage in order to avoid them. However, Kohls' restrooms are well-hidden, clean, and relatively low-traffic. And yes, if you're wondering, I have indeed stopped at Kohl's for the sole purpose of taking full advantage of this.

Unfortunately, this particular Kohl's location can get somewhat congested during busier times of the week/year. Especially the cashier lines. There are nicer Kohl's stores with considerably less customers, but there are only so many secrets I'm willing to reveal in a single Yelp review. The area itself is somewhat rough, but not enough to deter me from paying them a visit every now and again.

I ordered the Turkey bacon mushroom crepe that I subsituted the Turkey for ham because I just love salty pork substances for breakfast lol...the crepe was fantastic! The only critique I have is the huge slab of cheese on top, a crepe should be light and dainty perhaps shred the cheese and sprinkle it on top it makes for a better presentation 

Being from NY, My husband always judges a restaurant on how good or bad their coffee is; and he actually enjoyed their brew, he also tried their banana foster waffles and it was a slam dunk!

Our waitress Felicia was very sweet and knowledge of the contents of the menu she even made great suggestions for me prior to ordering and I love that! We left with some complimentary muffins that look scrumptious can't wait to devour those bad boys.

The cocktail menu is impeccable. There's always such a good selection and my personal favourite is either the Bubbly or Beauty Elixir. Both are must tries when you go. 

As a tapas place, the portions are quite sizable and great for sharing in groups of 3! However, you can always ask them to prepare a 4th portion on the plate if you're a group of 4. We were a group of 3 so it was perfect and shared 5 dishes (they recommended 6-8 plates). 

To start we had the Apple Kale Salad -- my personal fav! There was enough for us to get 2 portions each or 1 full plate each. Then we got the Brussels sprouts (delectable) side with the ravioli, the spaghettini and the mushroom pizza (3 pieces each). All of them were so good and I would highly recommend each of them. Also, the mac and cheese and TO DIE FOR. We didn't get it this time around but I've had it in the past and I would say it's a must-get.

It wasn't planned to visit Bannock for Summerlicious but I was shopping on the weekend and I was nearby during their Summerlicious menu. 

USUALLY, when my food arrives at my table ordering from a Summerlicious menu, I get really excited because the food looks a lot better than the menu description. However, that was not the case for Bannock. It was the opposite. The first thing I noticed was how horrible the presentation was...isn't Summerlicious your chance to market your restaurant? The overall presentation of every dish was very simple, it looked rush, and it seemed like Bannock cared too much about efficiency for Summerlicious that they didn't care much about how it was presented to customers.

Onto the food, everything was mediocre. Best dishes that me and my friend had were the desserts probably.

Appetizer: We both ordered the tomato & fruit, it was alright, nothing special. I would suggest more leaves though.

Entree: The chicken that my friend ordered was mediocre, lacking in flavor, looks like it was buffet food. The burger I got was alright.

Desserts: The best dish out of the entire meal, I mean how can you go wrong with desserts! We got cinnamon donut with ice cream and fruit with whipped cream.

I enjoy Bannock for their main meal and their to-go sandwiches. But the Summerlicious offerings really let me down.",2017-07-16 20:47:17

We sat at the bar in front of the cooking action so we had a chance to get a little insight on the menu, ingredients, recommendations, etc.  We started out with the Peking duck bun.  Think Chinese taco.  It was seriously tasty, stuffed with succulent duck with a little bit of crisp on the edges and a tasty, bright dipping sauce.  Next we ordered the pig face  dumplings (cheek).  They were served on a little kimchi with their house made sriracha (they should bottle and sell the stuff).  The dumplings were tender and delicous.  The stand-out dish of the night for me was the wood grilled octopus.  I will return specifically for this dish.  As the name indicates, the pieces of octopus are wood grilled and have a slight char on them and are pile atop the crispy rice cake and surrounded by a beautiful, rich, bright and absolutely delicious broth.  This was hands down the best preparation of octopus I've ever had and it made me wonder why I'd never thought of grilling it.  It was super tender and the combo of flavors and textures - smokey, crispy, creamy, citrus, spice....superb.  Entrees did not disappoint.  We had the Kung Pao brisket with brown rice and the roasted pork ramen.  I can't say a bad thing about either dish.  From the super tender brisket in the Kung Pao and the perfectly cooked egg in the ramen, it was pure yumminess!

It was a favourite because the owner always gave large portions of food and often treated us with little snacks that were ""on the house"". About a year or two ago, the quality (and quantity) of the food went spiraling downhill so we stopped coming. The food was being made with significantly less care and it became especially evident in the maki rolls where the rice would fall apart and the pieces were inconsistent in size. 

Tonight my family decided to come back and give them another try and I'm glad we did. I love that after all this time, they still provide an assortment of complimentary dishes such as: congee, salad, edamame beans, tempura salmon, cold tofu, miso soup, and handrolls. Perhaps because it wasn't a busy night, the complimentary congee, miso soup, and udon all came steamy hot which was fantastic. Warning to first-timers though: the quality of the sushi/sashimi here is definitely on the lower end. Don't come expecting quality sushi because that's not what you're going to get and you're essentially setting yourself up for disappointment. In terms of variety, this store really only offers salmon. Not that salmon isn't delicious but even if you order ""chirashi"" which the menu photo depicts as an assortment of sashimi, you'll likely just get salmon sashimi.

It is edible. The hash browns are actually pretty well prepared but the omelet i have had the last two times just wasn't good. I have had better omelets in buffets at the Omelet station.

Still, if you want an inexpensive breakfast that will satisfy your hunger if not your thirst for flavor, this is a good place.  The benefit of a chain is you know what you are getting no matter the location.  The drawback, well creativity and flavor.

I love the ""local"" flair...Did you know  that you can call them up before you head over and ask if they have what you need?  For example, I forgot to pick up Avocado's at Fryes and didn't want to drive back.  I called Del Monte and asked them if they had Avocados and they said yes.  Very Convenient.

There is also a mailbox on the corner -a convenience considering that the Laveen post office is a nightmare to get in and out of.

If you have visitors who are coming to town, take them to Mystery Castle (near South Mountain) and then drive them down to the Del Monte for an ice cream out of the cooler.  It's fun to see the local cowboys hitch their horse to the hitching post and walk in to get a cool drink - your friends will get a big kick out of the local folklore.

Lola is a good solid coffee house and provides a backdrop for women to converse over projects and upcoming events and for men to fiddle with gadgets. I almost always converse and fiddle while thriving on a beautiful quad espresso but love to read the old fashion way too with a newspaper in my hand which Lola buys or at least a patron leaves.

I didn't try the BBQ on my visit, I was craving Dolsot BibimBop  (Hot clay pot Bibimbop)

When my bowl came out I noticed a few things that caught my attention.  There was a crisp, black leaf on the top of it.  I'm not sure what it was, but I don't think it was edible.  The rice was purple, which I've never seen before. 

Once I added the right amount of GochuJang, (Red Pepper Paste) it tasted similar to many other Dolsot Bibimbops I've had in the past.  The best part of this dish is of course the crispy rice at the bottom of the bowl.

I had the smallest cup with two flavors, key lime pie and berried mango.  The portion size was quite good for a small and they densely packed the gelato into the cup.  The texture of the gelato kind of reminded me of regular store bought ice cream, meaning that the gelato here was less rich and less creamy compared to gelato that I've had at other places.  Of the two flavors that I had, I liked the key lime pie better.  It had a slight bitter taste, which suggests to me that real lime juice was used to make the gelato.  The berried mango was okay, but I was expecting it to pack a little more punch.

There were two workers behind the counter when we came in and both were very patient and friendly as we selected our flavors.  The shop is located in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket which also houses a Vietnamese restaurant and a Chinese restaurant, so Gelato 64 is a convenient place to drop in for dessert after dining at one of those restaurants.",2012-11-27 11:04:12

Checked out the website before and found out they where BYOB so grabbed a bottle of red and headed out. 

There was a wait for tables and I felt like there wasn't really a system yet for taking down names and making sure everyone got a table, but the time they quoted us was pretty accurate.

What we sampled:
Hot mixed appetizers: It was good and a nice amount for four to share. I was most impressed by the borek filled with feta cheese which was delicious! 
Humus: Outstanding.  The pita bread was not all heated through, but the humus was so delicious!
I had the shish kebab. It was delicious! I was really happy with the flavor and paired with the rice, salad, cabbage, and yogurt sauce it made for delicious wraps with the pita.
Others at the table sampled the kofte (so good!), gyro (delicious!), and the iskender kebab (I loved this! The yogurt it was served with was incredible!)
We also ordered Turkish Coffee and Tea as well as the baklava to end the meal.  I wasn't a fan of either the coffee or tea, but the baklava was some of the best I have ever had!

Unfortunately, our decent expectations were somewhat let down. We ordered edamame, crab rangoons, and summer rolls for appetizers. The edamame was...well...edamame. Not much to comment on there, and the crab rangoons were good. My wife and I were divided on the summer rolls, though. I felt that they had way too much lettuce, which took away from the basil flavor, and also made them huge for summer/fresh spring rolls. The wife liked them because of her love of lettuce. They also came with a peanut dipping sauce, which was good, but also seemed too heavy for the lightness of a summer roll. It was a juxtaposition that I'm not sure that I liked.

Neither of our meals really did anything for us. She ordered the chicken pad thai - spicy level 3 -  but definitely received a meal in the 5-7 range. She could barely eat it as she's not a spicy foods person, but tried to soldier through anyway. The flavors were decent, but no where near the best pad thai that we've had in Pittsburgh. The first thing i noticed was that but the noodles were undercooked, too...NOT a great first impression for a NOODLE dish.

I tried the spicy basil with chicken. I ordered a spice level of 5, but we're thinking they mixed up our two spice levels, as my meal was as mild as you could ever want. The flavors were good, but the most noticeable thing missing, aside from the lack of heat, was the lack of basil flavor that I love in Thai basil dishes. I essentially had a normal chicken vegetable stir fry that I could've made at home. Tastes were decent, but far from what we were hoping for.

The service was great, though, and I'm a sucker for little dive-y places, but I don't see myself traveling to Dormont to eat there again. If I'm in the area, sure, but it's hardly worth going out of your way for.",2012-03-16 18:18:44

The staff (especially Rachel) are so incredibly friendly. I love how passionate their are with their jobs, it's just makes the experience so much more lively. 


Definitely try their bubble teas! It's more of a soda, and it's soooooo good. 

I have been here a few times and ordered:

* Passion Fruit Bubble Tea w/ passion fruit popping bubbles- SERIOUSLY DELISH I COULD LIVE OFF THIS STUFF.

* Rainbow Bubble Tea (comes with dragon fruit and all kinds of fresh cut fruit/ awesomeness)- so very good! They put it in the cutest to go cup, and they are definitely not stingy with the size of the slices of fruit inside.

* Creme Brûlée milk tea w/ boba- I got it with half sweet since most of the reviews say it's pretty sweet. It wasn't what I anticipated, just tasted like any other milk tea for me. I feel like they overcooked the boba since it was pretty hard, so i didn't really like that.

* Uji Matcha with cheese foam- sooooo good. don't get weirded out by the cheese foam, it doesn't taste like straight up cheese lol. This place makes it good too! 

We've been here plenty of times, never had a disapointed moment. per every 100 stars you get a free drink (each drink is around 10-20 stars) So not bad! We love this cute little place. The drinks are on the pricer side, but the quality is so great, so I definitely don't mind putting my money towards this small business. Maybe just avoid the milk teas and go for the bubbles and slushes!

I saw them as a south side restaurant that had fresh local food. Since then, my opinions have changed. Although I still do enjoy going to local, I see them more as a bar now. This place is packed on the weekends, expect a line out of the door on Fridays and Saturdays. 

They are famous for their yinseritas, (if I am spelling that right) which is a margarita with a beer in it upside down. Super good! Their menu ranges from pizza, to wings to sandwiches. Everything I ever had to eat there was decently good, but I enjoyed their pizza the most. 

Most recently, I visited with a friend for happy hour. Local has a pretty awesome happy hour...1/2 off drafts and some 1/2 priced appetizers. I ordered southern tier's creme brûlée , normally $7.50 and only $3.75 during happy hour! Sooo good! 

We also ordered their nachos as an appetizer. The portion was HUGE! And they were awesome- pork, tons of cheese, pico and jalapeños with scallions to top it all off... Super good! I did fine the pork to be really salty though.

There are only a few complaints.

First off, there is a ""weight limit' if you weight over 240 you have to purchase the video and pictures which is a cool extra $130. OK so my boyfriend weighed himself the night before at 232. (hes a big tall guy [ : ) When he arrives and steps on their scales his weight magically went up to 242. Whattt? So it was his birthday and he was a sucker so he paid the extra $130. The old man ringing him (which may have been the owner or management) up actually says in a rude manner ""well most places charge only $10 every extra pound you go over, so this is a deal."" My boy friend says "" i would much rather pay $20 than $130 extra"". Like really?  He also had a voucher for a free T-shirt with the purchase or video and pictures, which they told him he could not use.

He waited 45 minutes to get the video, after asking what the hell was taking them so long. The guy actually argued with him telling him he only waited 15 minutes. Basically my boyfriend wanted to punch everyone in their faces, it takes alot to piss him off.

But after my visit to this Sushi Restaurant, I feel deceived and annoyed.

1. The servers forgot my orders more than 3 times. We had to reorder and remind them which sushi we did not receive.

2. I asked for lots of ginger since I eat A LOT, and the guy didnt know how to speak English and he gave me a tiny bit which was already prepared with the wasabi on the sauce plate.

3. Servers dont know how to work. They are very distracted and disorganized. They keep coming to our table saying, 'did you guys order _______?' I mean why are you keep
coming to my table asking me if I ordered this and that. You should know. The thing is, I didnt order anything they asked me. They went to the table behind me asking the same thing. So unprofessional.

Sushi? It was OK. Not as good as what everyone said in the reviews. Not worth $25-$26 with crappy service. They were only quick when I asked for a check and taking my check to the register. Horrible.

There are many stations including an omelette station; a bread toast station; a pastry table; a cold salad area that included caprese salad, cheese, salami, and fruit; a yogurt parfait station that had at least six different toppings including granola and coconut pumpkin seeds; and juices. They also had eggs to order and I got two poached eggs; they were perfect.  The cheese on the cold food table was exceptional and I probably ate too much of it! 
If lunch is an unknown this is a great way to start the day. I was full a long time.
As luck would have it, my meeting attendees decided to go for lunch here. I got the miners salad with spinach added and no pick de Gallo. It came as ordered and was light. Thank God! I was still full from breakfast. 3 of 4 of us got salads and everyone finished them. The potsticker salad came with a reputation and my friend said it lived up to it.

The food for the most part was OK, nothing special but not horrible with a couple of exceptions.  The decor is nice and recently updated.  The problem is the service.  5 of us arrived together and 2 more shortly after.  They took orders from the first 5 but took forever to come and ask the next 2 what they wanted.  Then when we tried to order something, they said everyone else had already ordered so share with them.  Huh?!?  When it came there were 4 tempura shrimp to share between 7 people...  Every time we tried to get a large quantity of something so everyone could have some, we would only get a small portion.  We had a few things we ordered that took forever to arrive and several never came at all.  Their tempura was only average, not that hot and not crispy like it should be.  The sashimi was OK, but cut a bit thin.  They had something called ""golden scallops"" which was disgusting: a dollop of mashed sweet potato with a tiny bean sized piece of scallop hidden inside.  Yuck!  On the good side, their sirloin steak was quite good and cooked just right, not over done.  Their grilled shrimps were also quite good.  At the end when we were ordering desserts, it took forever to get someone to take our order.  Then we ordered a bunch of ice cream with various kinds and numbers of scoops.  What came was nothing like what we ordered.  I had asked for 2 scoops of red bean and a couple of others asked for red bean along with green tea and only one scoop of red bean was brought out. We had to chase down a server again to get what was missing.  

Over all, I would say I wouldn't really care to go back.  Their menu is identical to Ten Ichi to the point I wondered if they are owned by the same people, but the service is so bad it would keep them off my list.",2015-10-22 03:29:28

I have yet to try the infamous Charcut but I'm sure I will eventually. Sad, that they only offer their lunch Big Taste menu on weekdays - whyyyyyy. Oh well, Charbar's menu looked just as enticing so we decided to give them a try. 

Located in the remodeled/reclaimed Simmons Building, it also houses Phil & Sebastian's Coffee and Sidewalk Citizen. All three places were packed when we went on a Saturday afternoon (around 1:30pm) and Sidewalk Citizen had a mini lineup even when we were leaving. Wow, I'll have to check them out next time I'm in town. I also really liked how there is a mini patio in the back that can fit about a dozen people - a few people were definitely taking advantage of the gorgeous Saturday weather.

Service is solid as there was a constant flow of staff topping off our water and checking in on us. We were seated near the kitchen - my poor friend, she could feel heat waves coming along one side of her face. So if you don't want that, maybe request to be seated further away. I didn't think it was a big deal but others may not like that. 

I like how all the dishes come out on Le Creuset dishware. I must just be a sucker for their wares. Nothing like expensive cookware to spruce things up a notch. The building/layout itself is very spacious and has that Southern American flair of roasted meats and hot, open parilla kitchens.

- Avocado toast ($13.00) - crushed whole avocado on toasted sourdough with scrambled egg. It normally comes with a fried egg but my friend wanted it scrambled - hence why it doesn't look as pretty. Flavours were still there as the avocado was fresh and creamy. For $13, it's definitely on the pricey side. A side of potatoes or some brunchy side would go a long ways to not feeling ripped off...

- Breakfast sandwich with parilla beef fat fries ($15.00) - the Big Taste special. Didn't realize that their menu is limited to the one option on weekends (rather than the $15 and $25 lunch options during the weekday) and it was annoying that you had to specifically ask for it. Isn't the whole point of Big Taste to promote it? Alas, the breakfast sandwich was tasty. I can't remember what exactly was in it but the meat was juicy and topped with pickles and a fried egg. One of the better sandwiches I've had in a long time. You get to pick one side and obviously we had to try the beef fat fries (regularly $8.00). These were money - crispy, beefy, wholesome goodness. 

- Warm crazy chocolate brownie - there was also the option of having a cup of Fiasco soft serve but we opted for the brownie. The brownie was better than we expected - slightly gooey and nicely warmed up. Enough for a couple bites each.

I feel like Charbar's mixed reviews is based on what dishes you order so it might be wise to see what's best bang for your buck (unless you've got one of those company expense accounts). I thought the Big Taste lunch deal was worth it and I'm looking forward to coming back to try their regular menu. Hopefully, next visit will be on their summertime rooftop patio!",2016-03-16 15:05:08

Food: Food was good but pretty basic. I got the big cheesy melt and two tacos.

Service: First when we walked up there was no host. I think the person that sat us was technically off-shift at the time. Kind of odd. Our server checked in about the right amount. Table over from us got upset that they weren't getting their check fast enough. Someone at the host desk (some guy) later came over and started brow-beating the bar staff from the host table. Meaning - yelling over to them from about 20 feet away about how they weren't working. Super unprofessional and awkward and I honestly was waiting for Jon Taffer of Bar Rescue to pop out of a corner and start yelling at people about how unprofessional they were being and how uncomfortable they were making their guests.

Drinks: Fiance ordered the frozen margarita flight and I ordered the La Casuela signature margarita that was said to be served in a special bowl and made table-side. Her flight was good. She said it was too strong but I liked them a lot. She still drank them all. LOL. My margarita was sub-par. My fiance also pointed out that it said on the menu that they made it at your table - they did not do that. Flavor of this margarita was very muted and certainly nothing special. For being the most expensive margarita on their menu... it was a huge disappointment.

I had always been meaning to try the Baguette Cafe for months, but finally made it up here after running random errands around the city. The hype, unlike most places, is well-deserved.

Right when I walked in, the place was full to capacity - tables occupied inside and out, a line forming all the way to the door. Luckily, this allowed me to sort out my indecisions, and decided upon a tea and the Eggplant panini. Not only are the other fellow patrons incredibly nice (as found out through enduring a line together), but Olivier is perhaps one of the sweetest, most charming men. Joking around, offering suggestions, and making small talk even when there are five people behind me, he makes you feel right at home, and treats you as a patron rather than another order. 

Sitting outside, I was brought my tea by Oliver and panini accompanied by a small salad later on by another staff member. The panini was so simple, yet so immensely satisfying. Eggplant, mozzarella, and marinara sauce on bread - even though I could count the ingredients on one hand, it tasted phenomenal. You could taste the love that went into such a simple sandwich The salad was a nice sidekick, playing the role of added nutrition to all the carbs I was about to ingest. 

After my meal, Olivier really showed his gregariousness. Wrapping up my leftovers, he asked how the meal went and other various questions. But what impressed me the most was adding in another packet of the green tea I had ordered as well as being so friendly and relaxed despite being in the midst of a rush. 

Honestly, Baguette Cafe is the sort of place I could sit at for hours, staring at the nearby mountain range - throw in some more delicious food and a cup of tea, and I'd be perfectly content. The savory side of the menu was impressive, and only leaves me with an excuse to visit again to try all of the sweeter goods.",2012-01-19 18:38:10

I had the fish and chips early bird special, pretty much the only thing that sounded half appetizing to me.

He could not stop raving about it and insisted on taking me there. I'm sure glad he did! The shakes are what did it for me. I'm not much of a burger girl, but let me tell you, the meat they use is so tasty and it's always made to perfection how you request. We have never ordered anything off of the actual menu (aside from shakes), and always get our burgers made to order. In my opinion, that's the best way to go since there are SO MANY combinations you can try. If you don't have the caramel pretzel shake on your way out, you're truly missing out on dessert. My husband goes on Saturdays when there is game meat. He's tried antelope, alligator, and probably others in the past, but sorry to say that's just not my thing. He used to get the burger of the day mailed to him......complete fanatic, but unfortunately, I will say we have not been there for a while. I think too much of a good thing killed it for us a little. Every now and again I will still crave a shake. There fries are nothing spectacular, though (although the chips are tasty)--I'm a fan of beer battered and these fries just don't cut it for me. They remind me of primanti's fries. Check this place out for sure...it's a great place to stop for happy hour too, if you're not trying to gorge yourself :)

My wife and I both went for the first time last year celebrating our birthdays, which are three days apart. We both were thrilled to have a $30 gift certificate, which Benihana offers for birthdays when you signup. This was an amazing deal, but it seems like they have changed the rules and now require you to buy an entree to be able to use the certificate. 

I have found that Japanese restaurants in general seem to treat their customers really well, but the service here in Scottsdale was even better than I expected. We were really impressed with our waiter. He was on top of everything and made sure that we had fresh soda for the length of our whole meal. I really appreciated that he kept bringing us refills without even having to be asked. That seems to be a rarity when we go out to restaurants, so I have to applaud this Benihana location for their outstanding service!

The staff are all very helpful in giving you clear instructions and explanations on all the procedures to make your bubble tea. They're very friendly so don't be afraid to ask questions!
Despite being a custom bubble tea shop, I actually found the lack of options quite surprising. Their tapioca and jelly choices are pretty abundant, but I didn't see any grass jelly or custard options, which was disappointing. Their flavour options were surprisingly limited--I found myself having to change my idea after finding out there was no mango option for milk tea. The selection is quite small and combinations are few. 
The good thing is that the ending price doesn't come out to anything too outrageous--it's priced pretty similar to any other bubble tea shop.
The bubble tea taste itself wasn't anything spectacular either, it was very average. It may largely depend on whether you chose a good flavour combination or not. 

I probably would not visit again because my go to bubble tea flavours can be found at other shops for a bit cheaper of a price. In some places, such as Green Grotto, you can actually ask for combinations of drinks as long as it's in the same drink family (ie. a combination of different flavoured milk teas). I find the concept of this place quite good but the execution is quite lacking.

There's a long line and it took me a while to figure out that it was for the coffee/tea counter (you can get a drink to sip on while  you wait). I was confused if it was only a take-out line or not. I stood there for a while, then someone took my name down and added it to a list. We had to awkwardly hang around the boutique section at the front of the restaurant while we waited (mmm, everything there looks so tasty... fancy olive oils, Kusmi teas, pre-made salads...). 

I can see why it's popular -- the decor is very understated-chic and the communal tables are nice. Food-wise, I expected more and price-wise, I wouldn't say they offer great value (brunch plates $15-16). I had the brunch Cartet which was huge. I liked that it came with a big salad. The croissant with ham and goat cheese was yummy. The scrambled eggs were kind of cold and the salmon was just ok.

Unfortunately, it confirmed my general feeling that the quality of the food at these restaurants has declined in recent years. 

The first impression arrived in the form of brown, overcooked tortilla chips. I ate two. Next, I was in the mood for a lighter lunch, so I ordered the tortilla soup. The dish arrived topped with oily tortilla strips and big, dense chunks of cheese that reminded me of paneer and really did nothing to enhance the dish. After a cursory taste, I removed the toppings. The broth was okay but not great, and the vegetables were overcooked. My dining partners were similarly unimpressed.

This is sad, because Laredo's was my favorite Mexican place when I first moved to Madison. The last several visits have netted sub-par food. Not to mention that I live in DeFo now, and Aranda's is just around the corner. (If you want really good Mexican food at a friendly, family-owned place, I'd suggest going there.)",2016-03-15 00:13:36

I'm not sure what has caused the noticeable change, but the service has been pretty bad the last two times I've been there in recent months. And the food? Not what it used to be. This was one of my fave, go-to places in Charlotte (I'd recommended it a dozen times to friends, uptown coworkers, & out-of-towners), but no more. Even 3-stars seems generous at this point.

Food took forever to order & receive both times. Orders were wrong. We never got any corn bread (despite asking for it twice!). Water refills were non-existent. Dessert was not impressive. It could just be me, but it appears they don't offer the same amount of side items anymore (or they've changed their variety to less healthy options that no longer appeal to me). And did their portions get smaller while their prices got bigger? Again, it could just be me. Or perhaps I'm more sensitive to the prices when the food & service are so disappointing.

My husband had visited a few other times for lunch and warned me, but I tried to stay optimistic and hoped he was wrong about the changes. Alas, he was right (as usual!), and I'm left searching for a new, favorite dinner spot.",2012-10-26 01:27:46

Certainly a decent burger. The best part about it was probably the soft bun. The burger tasted like a buger and the fixins were what you'd expect. Nothing special in anyway.

My favorite were the spicy cucumbers, but there was also kimchi and about 4 others.  They ranged from being mild to extremely spicy.  It was a good way to try new things.  When I asked for extra cucumbers because I loved them so much, the obliged.  They even brought me two small containers, free of charge at the end of the meal and the ingredient list!

The food here is wonderful. A little pricey, but delicious, and a huge menu. Maybe we could have ate more of our entrees if the bread hadn't been so delicious and warm.

The only downside - once we tried to make a reservation for 6 people, and the girl practically cried because she wasn't sure how to do it, however I was glad when we came back (with just two people) because it was well worth it.

I thought I already reviewed this place!? Well, better late than never!
If you're familiar with BA-LE Sandwiches in Hawaii, this location ain't anything like it.
I came here opening week a few months back and a lot of things I saw looked delicious.

Out came a familiar face from up the street(the owner of Dakao) so I knew the sandwich was gonna be good as I am(now was) a fan of Dakao. I ordered the #1 (Dac Biet) and a few other things, so when it was time to pay, The owner said the machine was broken(on opening week? Luckily, I had a Lincoln, so I just got the sandwich which was good.

A recent clip on Action 13 News' Dirty Dining series featured Cathay House and Ba Le and went over various violations they had which caused both these businesses to shut down temporarily to ""clean up"" their act. Simple things like employees not washing their hands,  mold from not maintaining a clean kitchen, storing baguettes uncovered in cardboard boxes and food thawing outside with no refrigeration. These shortcuts that foodhandlers take is Sanitation 101. I just hate the thought of wondering about  other spots in Chinatown and other free standing ethnic eateries around town. You know a lot of these places continue the same practices. Its only a matter of time if and when they get caught. ALOHA!!!

The old Nello's was a family favorite dating back to the 90's. I thought I'd be more skeptical, but I was just hungry and had a craving for pizza. To start the pizza was very good, and the deep dish crust was even Nello's-esque. In fact the ""pizza sticks"" appetizer we got was nothing short of a direct replica of the old ""pizza crust"" app. Although the new app can be ordered in three sizes which couldn't be done with the old app. If it sounds like I'm comparing the two heavily, it's probably because the restaurant is still nearly identical to the old one. Most of the same sports memorabilia is still hanging exactly where it was, all the tables and booths are the same billiards green tables left behind. You can't help feel like you're in the twilight zone, everything looks and feels the exact same, but it's not, it's Happy Joes now. So if you can get over that strange feeling of being somewhere the same but different then you'll have a tasty pizza, prepared well with quality toppings, friendly service, and a yummy sundae to top it all off. The only negative I noticed was the servers didn't seem to clear the table until after you left, so at the end of the meal, we had a messy table that we had to maneuver around when boxing up leftovers and signing the check.

We ordered the following:
Hotaru ika - Very good considering the presentation looked awful.
Tamago yaki - Good
Agedashi mochi - Good
Marinated beef tongue - OK
Octopus balls (tacoyaki) - Disappointing considering I've tried tacoyaki from many different places.
Conch shell clam - Very good
Grilled mackerel - Very good
Garlic beef fried rice - Too much pepper
Octopus fried rice - Very good
Duck soba - OK
Yakitori combo - Very unique selection of chicken
Sesame ice cream - Excellent! Highly recommended
Green tea pudding - Very good
Rich custard pudding - Excellent!

Had a party of 8 coming here to enjoy random food choices to try things out.  Normally this would've been pricey, but considering we had 8 people at just over $120 with tip, I would say it was a good deal.

Most of the food we liked.  Some like the chicken knuckles were just too exotic for my tastes.

The Ox Tongue donburi was excellent in terms of meat quality.  However, the sauce is no match for what my friend's dad makes.  The meat was tender and you don't get the cheap aftertaste that you get from Chinese Cafes.  

The Chicken Donburi was especially good.  It had a sweet taste and I would really like to try it again once I am off my diet, because the rice they use was well fluffed.

The Beef Gyu Don, wasn't as good.  It had too much onion and little beef.  It was also very salty.  So I won't order that one again.

I ordered takoyaki like I did before.  And like before, I know this isn't Japan, and I am pretty sure Japan has better, but this is one of the better takoyakis I had in North America.

My daughter enjoys this place, and when we are in the neighborhood, we will lunch here.  Prices are obviously posted, so you know going in this is not a $1.00 burger.  But you get what you pay for, and Five Guys is no exception. Expect a simple starter burger around $4.5, big old bacon cheeseburger checks in at under $8.

EVERY time, the order is accurate.  The fries are made of REAL potatoes, served  very hot, fresh, super yum. One regular order easily  covers two people. 

I love how you can choose any number of add-ons and condiments and there's no extra charge- this includes extra cheese, grilled onions, grilled jalapenos, etc. And there's a huge assortment of condiments to choose from.  You can also get your burger wrapped in lettuce or as a bowl if you don't want a bun. The burger itself is made of high quality beef.

Casual environment, music playing when we've been there.  It's clean, employees are very friendly.",2014-01-31 16:41:55

Tucked away in an odd strip mall, the space has a bar and a dining room with a dance floor, live music and dance lessons, and some seriously bomb food.

HOUSE BREAD & SPREAD: Rolls are freshly oven-warmed and crisp, yogurt-eggplant spread is like a light version of babaghanoush, really tasty.
HOUSE MADE CHORIZO: Nicely seasoned with a little bit of spice, you gotta get this for the presentation: served flaming and cut tableside from a pig-shaped plate that is equal parts cute and tasty. Almost didn't get this but glad we did.
GRILLED HALLOUMI: Squeaky cheese with a spicy-zesty dipping sauce. I can't say I'm too familiar with this kind of cheese, and it seems best eaten before it cools too much, but I enjoyed trying this.
SNAILS: Different preparation than usual, served in a cream sauce with cheese and toast, but still quite a tasty way to enjoy these critters. Ask for extra bread, portion is larger than expected and very saucy. I'm a sucker for the more common garlic-wine sauce preparation but was pleased with this version!
GRILLED SARDINES: BF's pick. he loved them, I would have rather opted for the calamari. Served with grilled peppers, onions, and garlic, a quartet of petite grilled fish were served in a sea of olive oil. Add some of the table balsamic to brighten up the flavors a bit.
SEAFOOD PAELLA: Sharable $30 portion with three large shrimp, a few mussels, squid, chorizo, and chicken, with a soft saffron rice with only a slight bit of spice. Great version of a favorite dish, would get again.
CHOCOLATE CAKE: BF insisted on dessert, this cake had a nicely balanced flavor that wasn't too sugary. Unfortunately this seems to be kept refrigerated (and perhaps at too low of a temperature), resulting in an odd dryness throughout. This is served with fresh whipped cream.

Food was delightful, service was incredibly personable- one lovely lady was handling all four dinnertime tables, assisted by two staff. Meal was a leisurely pace, dishes were appropriately coursed, and by the end of our meal we were making notes for our selections for our next visit and hugging the owner as we walked out the door. A neighborhood gem.

The place was 50% full when we went there round 8pm. However, I think this place draws a late crowd as it is open until 2 am. Attractive staff and modern style furnished the space. 

Be aware when sitting down. Check for water from the exhaust hood above. As Korean BBQ gets hot and the ac runs cold to keep it cool, condensation builds and can drip on to the table or seat. The underside of my shorts got wet when I slid into the bench style seat. (-1 star).

This place is good for 2-4, and larger tables of 8 are in the back. Super fast service! Don't be shy to flag the servers down. 3 people ran the front of the house. All 3 were at out table at some point.

We ordered a set combination of things and every bit was great. They prepared bibimbap table side and opened our mushroom foil pouch too. The grill didn't get too hot but would try this place in the winter time.

Aca6XBlfXmjkAy-1NIFKAQ,ctXFXk9-m6PCMoI-Nz2_XQ,a1KXovXPdeDurOrER4ST6A,1,2,1,1,"Did I eat at the correct Akaihana? Because based off the reviews, it seems like I had a completely different experience here that was hardly passable in my book.

Akaihana advertised a happy hour and had deals for apps, sushi rolls and alcohol, plus it was cheap, but I guess some things are too good to be true. I stepped into Akaihana and was greeted by the sushi chef in some kind of indistinct Asian language, I'm used to the ""Irasshaimase"" greeting as I used to serve at a Japanese restaurant in the past. However, I could not make out what language he was speaking. Regardless, I was seated in the corner of the restaurant and was given 3 menus.

Since I was sharing dinner, the items that were ordered were: Tootsie Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, Tropicana Roll

-Tootsie Roll: deep fried salmon surrounding imitation crab meat, big roll and served with a soy-based sauce
-Spicy Salmon Roll: chopped up salmon mixed with spicy sauce in a roll, this is nothing special. Spicy salmon does not work in my book, spicy tuna does though. 
- Tropicana Roll: Salmon with mango, each piece topped with spicy mayo and sriracha and more soy-based sauce

This place masks the quality of their fish with sauces, deep frying and rice portion. The portion of rice was overwhelming in comparison to the rest of the fish in the rolls and wasn't seasoned well and hard, the sauces overtake your tastebuds not allowing you to taste the fish. The ginger was very sweet and I didn't even dare try the wasabi.

Cheap prices are reflected in their quality of rolls,: over sauced, too much rice and lacking in quality of fish. Interior is a bit crazy with variety of menu choices and service is decent at most. Also upon leaving, the sushi chef greeted me once again in some indistinct (made up sounding) language which I found to be a bit offensive. Because I know for a fact he was not speaking Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or Filipino because I've worked and frequent Japanese and Korean restaurants/have friends who are and that I am both Vietnamese and Filipino.

Overall, stay was great for me. Nice big room, comfy bed, great smelling Bliss products in the bathroom, good yummy food. I liked having a dvd player for the times that I attempted to watch the movies I brought with. Sad that the iPod hookup wouldn't charge my gen 4 iPod while it played. 

Didn't go to the pool but once, a little too cold for my tastes. No jacuzzi, really?! 

Do I like the new elevators? Yes, I liked going up more than down though, red is such an ""angry"" color... And the floor mats that change through out the day to reflect the time. Its the details that make this place I think.

We started with the fresh sashimi selection , and all the fish was super fresh and we didn't need much condiments to accentuate it as well as a hamachi roll that was heavenly.

For entrees we tried the Korean style hot bowls, and the ginger soy glazed black cod. The last time I had black cod this delicious was at NOBU, when they first opened in town. We shared a side dish of the duck Confit fried rice, and duck egg . 

Service was a little slower than what we would have liked, but it was a Saturday and a concert was in house so it was to be expected .  The decor was clean, and open , with a nice view of the kitchen, grill stations , and open view of the walkway in restaurant row to people watch. The restaurant filled up very quickly .

The menu is quite extensive , and although the varying options are appreciated , it made it a little more difficult to narrow down things.

My friend ordered a bbq chicken and tortilla soup which could be a meal on its own. There was generous amounts of chicken and the soup was almost sauce consistency like.

The pickerel taco was mediocre in my opinion (it's tasty but I would try something else off the menu).

Ya ready? 

1. I asked for corn tortillas and the reply was simply ""no"" followed by silence.....ooooookaaaay awkward, moving on, forget I ever asked.

3. Black bean soup = double yuck. Pureed black beans. Dark black soup is not appealing, lol. Even worse when it's bland. 

4. White Fish Tacos = Okay, not bad. Lightly battered, but fairly crispy. 
a. But they sprinkled parsley on the taco. Parsley??? Parsley is NOT a substitute for cilantro. 

5. Baja rice. Really? It was rice pilaf with a mango salsa puree on top. Pilaf, and baja rice are two very different flavors. Plus the rice was crunchy and kinda bland. It was called Baja, so I expected some type of Spanish rice, lol.

I went again with my brother and husband on a Saturday for lunch, and the food and prices were great again. The chaat for starters was also very enjoyable.

Not having a huge crowd was also quite disappointing, but this might be just me, 'cause I love cramped places-- it MAKES a summer festival! Besides, the general feel and layout of the venue seemed like a glorified high-school event, tbh. The underwhelming-ness mixed with my zeal for summer festivals strikes this at par score.

Service 3/5 (15% of final grade)

Well, it IS a half-indoors-half-outdoors festival, so obviously don't expect any OMG service available, but most of the companies' employees were very happy and enthusiastic to introduce their dishes, which was refreshing to see.

Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)

Pricier than a normal casual dinner out, but nothing over-the-top for a summer festival. Besides, (not sure if it was an end-of-event sale or something, but) there was a very nice deal of a pulled pork vietnamese taco for $4. That would be enough to feed a small eater very well! Bring at $20-$35 if you actually want to try a nice variety of foods and feel full at the end of your venture though.

Other 5/5 (10% of final grade)

Brownie points round. I love summer festivals in general. Enough said!

Final Grade = 66.5/100 = 3 Stars!

Summary: There are better summer festivals, but summer festivals are all nice, so drop in if you are within a 15 minutes drive. Otherwise, visit something else ;)",2016-07-11 04:00:25

The new place is closer to where I live so when asked for a suggestion for a place to eat on a Friday night I suggested we go here.  I was a HUGE fan of Eddies Place (RIP) and never went to Brig's.

We made a 6:30 reservation and was seated right away to a booth for 4.  They did a nice job on the décor which is modern, a bit dark but trendy.  Our waiter Juan Carlos took very good care to explain the menu and make some great suggestions.  We started out with the mussels, and shrimp which both item has some extremely flavorful broth for dipping.  We had to keep asking poor Juan Carlos to bring us more bread since we kept running our because of all the sopping going on.  I come from a long line of soppers and Miros provided the perfect dishes to continue my family tradition.

Anyhoo, I ordered the lamb because, I love lamb and most restaurants in Charlotte don't offer it.  It was served with some carrots and mashed potatoes which didn't get paid much attention to because the lamb was so delicious.  Slowly braised. tender and seasoned well I went full on Fred Flintstone on it when I first apologized to the other patrons when I picked the bone up and ate every last morsel of lamby goodness.

For dessert we had what else, but the Tres Leche.  Just as wonderful as I remembered it.

It is closer to the back, a few shops from near the entrance of the parking garage. (You'll understand when you go there.) We went in and was seated in a booth. The inside was very small, but the booth made it feel spacious. The yellow walls and rustic photos made it feel very cozy and charming. The music was very nice too. It felt like I was in Italy, but not quite. But it made the ambiance a lot warmer.

Our server was very nice and was quite speedy. He had our waters out to us and our bread to us quite fast, but it was okay with me because I was thirsty. I read some of the other yelp reviews, and decided that I wanted to get the calamari. Calamari is probably one of my favorite appetizers. It was a huge portion. The calamari was so crispy and it was just delicious. It wasn't too salty and it had a tomato based dipping sauce which complimented the calamari perfectly. The added lemon juice made it extra delicious for me. This calamari dish was one of the best I've had. My boyfriend and I devoured that, hehe. The bread was wonderful too. 

For our main dishes he had the chicken parmigiana with the spaghetti. It was a good sized portion, if I would've known better I would have just shared with him! You could really taste the tomatoes in the sauce. I had a lemon dish with chicken, I forget the name. Sorry! I won't lie though it was a little too lemony for me, and I am a big lemon fan.

Yeah.. that's exactly what happened and how we ended up here. This place is a bit hidden as I had to call and ask them exactly where they were located. When I walked across the street I just had to look and see the sign.. silly me. But no they are low key ducked off. Next to California Pizza kitchen I finally found them! 

When we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server who ended up actually being somebody who performs in the live shows that they do. Kind of cool right it was funny watching her take our orders and then run to go do all this dancing on the stage. Multi-tasker much? Yes.. That was pretty dope to say the least. The service here was actually pretty damn good because of all the attention you get and the fact that they really do a good job insisting that you have a great time. My best friend let the MC Drag Queen know that it was her birthday and she did a wonderful job making sure that it was actually celebrated. They even went a step above by putting her name on the projector camera in big letters wishing her a Happy Birthday. 

The food and drinks were okay here...actually the only reason I didn't give them 3 stars was because of the service. Balanced out. I wasn't extremely hungry so I went with the wagyu beef sliders. They were okay and my friends ordered a bunch of other items. We all just shared each others plates because well sharing is caring right? RIGHT! The best dish of them all probably had to be the pork chop dish. I'm not huge on pork and only eat it every blue moon. One of our friends is vegan so she had a separate menu to order off of. The tofu dish that she ordered was a bit bland and it was just missing something... The prices here are high but expected because you are on the strip.

Bottom line is if you are up for a place that you can eat and enjoy some interesting entertainment then this is your place. If you love Sake Bombs then you will have a blast here because they do these random times throughout the night where they have people order Sake Bombs and chug them in sync... Follow those Sake bombs by Backstreet Boys and super loud music.. Have fun!",2017-06-24 00:37:28

Unfortunately, many places close early or at 3 (I don't like going to a restaurant right before they close). Fortunately we found this little place on yelp. 
The decor has a cute little cabin feel with wooden bears greeting you at the entrance. Upon entering, there is a slight musty smell but nothing that'll make you walk out. 
Once seated, i ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns, and ham steak with a sweet tea. The fiancé ordered French toast, scrambled eggs, and a slice of ham. 
The food came out quite quickly, maybe about 10 min or less. 
My sweet tea tasted like pure honey! I had to order water on the side to dilute it a bit, but tasted good. 
Scrambled eggs and hash browns were good as well as the decent sized ham steak, with the exception of the ham being a touch salty. 
My fiancées French toast was yummy but his plate portion seemed small, especially since he finished his food 10 min before me.

A lot of places I have been to have been trashed by then having been open all day. The store was fairly busy but I was able to maneuver around the aisles with ease. Close to the frozen food section there was an employee working on the freezers, perhaps cleaning them as there was a fairly thick hose stretched from one of the aisles to the backroom doors. They had ""watch your step"" signs out with was great but there was an older lady who couldn't get past it with her cart.  She was too weak to lift the wheels over the hose so other customers came to assist her.  What if this was a walker or wheelchair?  I would recommend to management to get a cover for the hose that lays over the top of a section of it making a ramp up over and then down so that this could be prevented in the future.

I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. 

Well I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. 

Part of this is my fault...I always order ""healthy"" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  

I started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. 

My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.

Pros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door

Cons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.

I do like the saffron rice, grilled chicken kabob and the little pickles a lot.

Update: I am amending my review and changing my rating to 4 stars after the owner reached out to me to understand what happened. I had originally included a note that the greek salad is a joke because it doesn't have feta cheese on it. I have since removed that from my review as we figured out that the salad that comes with the chicken kabob entrée is NOT a greek salad, and that's why it didn't have feta cheese on it (my misunderstanding). The owner also explained that the pita that comes with the take out meal is different from what is served when you dine in and that I can ask for a fresh thick pita with my take out order next time (which are made in-house and sound delicious).

Price to portion and taste ratio poor. Prices for lunches started at $7.99 (curry pork cutlet with rice, terriyaki chicken with rice. both come with miso soup only). Bentos are $10+.

Had the curry pork cutlet with rice and the grilled eggplant appetizer. 
Miso soup: nothing special. 
Pork cutlet: crispy but bland. 
Curry: NOT Japanese curry. Japanese curry tends to be mild, spice wise, and slightly sweet. This was strong, spice-wise and not at all sweet. 
Eggplant: I have no idea whether it was grilled or not. They peeled the skin off of it. All that was left was the insides, which were cooked to mush. The dipping sauce that usually accompanies grilled eggplant is sticky and sweet. This was just soy sauce.

I tried to hit up bluefin AYCE for what I knew was going to be a disappointing meal, but as it turns out they are closed for renos, so off I went trekking to Asian Buffet, which involved hiking across the entirety of McLeod. 

With this being an Asian buffet, the service is supposed to be crappy. Surprisingly I found the waitstaff to be relatively attentive at clearing plates and refilling water - nice. 

The Buffet selection was also pretty good. I found the sushi to be surprisingly good - good ratio of fish to rice and not at all dry. It was being restocked fairly regularly and was reasonably fresh. (Great selection of sushi too!) 

They also had some dim sum stuff, which was actually really good. The Shrimp Dumplings were particularly good, as they were actually filled with shrimp and didn't fall apart when you tried to pick them up. Other than that they had some pretty generic ""chinese buffet"" fare which was not too bad either. They also have a ""mongolian grill"", which I didn't try.

Having said that...Harris Grill left a taste in my mouth that wasn't the pink urinal puck...it was of the fine Belgian Ale on tap (a clean tap with ample choices from Troeg to Belgian seasonals) and the half-price wings that were keeping me sweaty on the chilly September Pittsburgh patio. Harris Grill goes down as the first place I fully enjoyed a wing sauce that wasn't Buffalo...their Jamaican Jerk made me boogie.

They have several types of pedicures to choose from and I chose one in the middle range that included a sugar scrub as well as a hot stone rub. It was very relaxing and I felt that they did a good job on both my manicure and my pedicure. The only reason I am knocking them down a notch is because they are more expensive than the place I normally go to and they also do not massage you for as long of a time either (and that's my favorite part!).

The FOOD:  Lunch is served as a $14 prix fixe option according to the menu.  This is a fancy way of saying you're paying too much for a soup & sandwich.  They're served simultaneously.  I had the carrot soup which had a weird off flavor as well as the lamb sloppy joe.  Presentation was terrible.  The texture of the sloppy joe was weird...maybe one should stick to beef and the sauce was sickly sweet.

My friend's Brie and Peameal sandwich looked rather unappetizing.  It also had the thickest slice of peameal bacon I've ever seen...not nice.  The neighboring table had ordered fish & chips, which was sent back for being raw on the inside.  Guess we weren't the only disappointed patrons.
** 2 stars for food. (that's being generous).  

The SERVICE: Well it appeared our server must have had a very wild weekend, as he was clearly on another planet during our service.  He forgot items, didn't really check on us, and just altogether was possibly the most unenthusiastic server since my junior high cafeteria lunch lady.  
*/ 1.5 stars for service.

The ATMOSPHERE:  It could be a nice wood-paneled place.  Seems odd they still have Christmas decorations up.

We ordered the Brioche French Toast & Chicken and Waffles.  Both were good, but they could've been great.  The french toast was soaked in a sweet carmelized syrup.  Had I known it would make everything soggy, I would have asked for it on the side.  Also, the bananas were sliced into thin (sorta sad) slivers.  I feel like they could've garnished the thing with at least a whole banana - it would make the taste less one note.  B-a-n-a-n-a-s are like 19 cents at Trader Joes, right?!

Chicken and waffles were good, but you need to eat them together in every bite.  Otherwise, it's just an okay waffle and an okay piece of fried chicken.  Orange juice seemed pretty fresh and tasty, but the iced coffee seemed a little weak.  They also didn't fill the cup all the way so it looked stingy.

3koIDm6KvEWeKm4RSEX_fw,1Nkuhh-HOUB7XUfgImWxmw,RoGeo_pQ1TQc6Lyk4CSDgw,3,1,0,2,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, so last Saturday night as my bff and I searched for a restaurant close to home, we decided to give it a try. 

We called at around 6 for 7:30 reservations and were told that it wouldn't be a problem but that we might have to wait 10-15mins for our table. It was full when we got there but after the promised 10mins we were seated. 

The decor feels like upscale chain restaurant for lack of a better desciption - everything is nice, modern and ""chic"" but the place is too big to have a really upscale restaurant feel to it. 

The menu is 1 page but with plenty of options and intriguing choices - we had a hard time deciding what we were in the mood for! In the end, we decided the appetizers all looked too good to pass up and decided to share a few of those. 

We had heard great things about the LIL BIG MAKS  which were supposed to be mini burgers with the elusive McD's big mac sauce. They were adorable, 3 mini burgers  served with a mini container of spiced matchstick fries, and delicious with very fresh ingredients and a generous piece of meat. The sauce wasn't exactly big mac sauce but it was definitely good! 

We also couldn't resist the LOBSTER POGOS (I have a weakness for all things pogo!) They were 3 very generously-sized pogos served with lemon dill aioli. They were delicious - with slightly sweet batter that went very well with the lemon dill aioli dipping sauce. The lobster flavour wasn't very pronounced but very fresh. 

Our last choice was the BACON CHEDDER CROQUETTES which were a bit of a miss after the other 2 dishes. They were overly crispy and overly heavy and the bacon was a bit too smoky and overpowering. The serving was very generous - about 6 decently sized croquettes. 

We were sadly too full for dessert but their options looked tasty and we have to go back to try the deep fried oreos!

Prices were moderate - 3 shared appetizers and 2 glasses of wine came to about 85$ with tax and tip - but the portions and glasses were very generous and filling. 

Our waiter was adorable - very plesant and helpful. 

If you're in Laval, give it a try....its definitely better than a lot of the other chain restaurants in the area!",2011-12-26 22:19:17

My sister and I came in for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and the place was pretty quiet.  Only about 1/3 of the restaurant was full in a stretch of Yonge st surrounded by office towers.  Hmmm.... I wasn't sure if that was a sign of things to come but I kept an open mind.  

We chose the original don katsu and the curry katsu for our lunch, one with fried rice option and the other with plain white rice.  Ordered some Jasmine tea to go with our meal as well which they charge additional $1.50 each.  

The pumpkin/squash soup with corn came out first and I didn't particularly enjoy this soup.  The texture of the soup was too thick for my liking and it was too sweet I didn't think that type of soup complimented such a heavy fried cutlet meal that was follow.  Should have asked for miso soup and pay additional $1.50 again.  

They brought out a small dish of assorted veg pickles and kimchi as banchan.  The pickles were much better than their kimchi which was possibly the worst kimchi I've ever had in my entire life.  I was happy that I didn't opt for any of their menu offerings where that kimchi would have been used as a main ingredient (like the kimchi fried rice, kimchi udon...etc). 

Finally, they brought out my curry don katsu first and the curry sauce that a large-ish cutlet was sitting on was cold.  Uh oh...  The don katsu was the usual variety you can expect at any other Japanese restaurant and it, too, was lukewarm.  

My sister's original don katsu came out shortly after, steaming hot!  Where is the consistency here?  I sampled her katsu just for comparison and you could tell that her dish was made fresh to order whereas mine just kind of sat there getting cold for whatever reason.  The ketchupy sauce that accompanied the original don katsu was also too sweet and off putting for my taste.  

I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to eat here again especially with so many other good lunch options in the area.",2016-05-27 22:23:03

PROS:
Everything in the room is stunning.
Bathrooms were clean and well stocked with supplies.
Housekeeping is fast and efficient.
Fridge/Freezer is half decent (which is honestly a luxury in a hotel room).
The view (if you get one) is nice if you look past the parking lot.

CONS:
Resort fee includes WiFi that is essentially worthless.
Last time, valet broke my key out of the shaft and I'm still bitter about that even after they reimbursed me for the replacement. 
Towels were awful. Possible the worst I've ever touched.

During our staycations, we don't like the hustle and bustle of staying on the strip- usually, getting to the car (even at valet) is a hassle, but here once you take the elevator down, you're 30 steps to the valet stand. When I got to the room, I noticed the shower hook was broken and had my guy let them know when he checked in and it was fixed by the time we got back from dinner- I was impressed. The only thing that really gets me here are the towels (all the other linens are fine) but somehow they've managed to pick out the smallest, scratchiest, awful towels in the world and buy all of them because I've never experienced towels that bad in all of my hotel stays, ever.

There's one thing that stood out from our meal here. The nigiri rice wasn't that great and the fish was very big pieces. Although it was very good i dont feel like its traditional. The sauces that they used were good. I rank this as maybe my second or third favorite sushi place in town because the experience was a happy one. The one thing I hate the most about going to an AYCE sushi spot is when your service messes up the food experience. Like for example when a server asks if you're sure you will finish what you order but here you don't get that these guys running the show are very nice and they give you suggestions and they accommodate you with a smile.

MccRqadBstsCbkWRKwamjA,Jt1zgNmwz_jheOSmEsljPQ,h_4dPV9M9aYaBliH1Eoeeg,3,4,0,3,"I generally don't like sausages, with the exception of gourmet ones.WVRST is a newly opened gourmet sausage and beer eatery on King West, a fairly new concept in the city. Although I'm not crazy about beer, I was quite excited to try it out.

The menu was very simple, and the sausage are served two ways: currywvrst style and on a bun. Of course I had to try both! For the bun, I opted for turkey/chicken sausage with sautéed jalapeños and caramelized onion. I modified my concoction into a hot dog by adding ketchup and grainy mustard. However, I wasn't overly impressed by the sausage. It had decent flavours, but the texture was too dry. The toppings were very tasty though, but I wanted more on my bun.  

For the currywvrst, we chose spicy Italian with pork and chili flakes. For me, I preferred the sausage on a bun, and again I found the sausage here overly dry. It was served with two pieces of rye bread, which I didn't enjoy nearly as much as the bun. The overall texture was tough and chewy. 

In addition to the two sausage dishes, we also got a small order of plain fry Belgian-style fries with maple rosemary dip. The fries were actually my favouite part of the meal and the maple rosemary dip was quite addictive. That said, I think it is pretty hard to mess up fries too badly. 

Overall, I think WVRST didn't live up to the hype. I was intrigued by the sausage/beer hall concept, but I wasn't overly impressed by the gourmet sausages. Both of my selections were overly dry and didn't wow me with flavours. Perhaps I should have ventured out to try one of the game sausages, but nevertheless, it wasn't remarkable enough for me to come back.",2011-07-15 13:27:26

I am a beverage snob, and definite foodie. I hadn't had their food until recently, so I didn't feel I could have written an adequate review. ;) The service is prompt and the baristas are usually friendly and helpful!

But... Holy biscotti, batman!

I tried the Honey Smoked Salmon Salad and have tried chocolate-orange, and lemon-lavender biscotti. Pastry aside, the food was delightfully healthy, with a touch into decadence, if you so desire.

 Each dip of the biscotti in my ""Kiss"" (Chocolate & Caramel) iced latte was stellar. The biscotti was even moist enough to eat without dipping it into the latte. 

The Honey Smoked Salmon Salad was stellar! It wasn't raw salmon, like I expected (I LOVE salmon). The texture with homemade croutons and the crisp, cool greens were a perfect compliment. I don't recall what the dressing was, but it appeared to have dijon mustard grains in it. I would eat this probably about 300 more times... Today. Right now.

My S.O. had a Turkey and Brie sandwich, which he enjoyed... It was wonderful... Cuz I had to steal a bite, myself! ;) It was healthy and served with fresh fruit! I could be biased, however, as turkey sandwiches are my absolute favorite. 

The bathrooms are CLEAN and unisex. The patio is lovely in the cooler months, and breezy! Th interior is delightfully vintage, yet urban, in appeal, and clean & comfortable for co-working, or just screwing around online, like co-working tends to lead with me. 

My usual order for coffee has become the iced coffee with sugar-free mocha. I cream it to my taste, and carry on. I, admittedly, hadn't had good coffee for awhile, and remembered why I started turning my nose up at bad coffee, upon first sip of their lattes and iced coffee.

Another thing that stands out to me is their array of LOCAL goods!! I'm very pro-local shopping when it's doable, and they bring it right to you with too-tempting popcorn, jellies, oils, teas, and jellies... Just to name a few!

All in all... I can see myself walking here in the cooler months, to enjoy a local, tasty lunch... And doing this quite often! Or even dropping by for my morning coffee fix. ;)",2010-09-19 21:19:13

Every other Chipotle I've been to in Cleveland, Akron, Kent, NYC, Philadelphia, wherever has been the same 4-5 star experience: fast service, upbeat staff with fresh, tasty food and clean seating area. I appreciate that it's ""fast food"" but not fried and they're into sustainability, community building, yadda yadda yadda. For a chain burrito, it's by far the best.

The Lakewood location is another story. At first I thought it was just me or I went on an off day or something. Now I've been to this Chipotle probably five times since 2010 so it's time to face the facts: unlike other Chipotle locations, this one is consistently just slightly grimy and the staff is slightly cranky/disinterested and the food is more so-so than fab. I realize this doesn't make any sense when talking about a national fast food chain located in suburban America so the only answer is: bad management.

Le Cartet fits more into the first category with a bit of the price factor of the latter. Located in a nice part of the area, it has an open and aesthetically pleasing layout to go along with the food served, a plus that never hurts.

I ordered the ""Le Nordique"" platter and a maple latte to go along with it. The maple latte, while it didn't have too much of a coffee taste to it, tasted delightful in regards to the quality of the maple flavoring without being overbearingly sweet. The Nordique platter consisted of a smoked salmon Eggs Benedict on a base of some type of black bread, a side salad, and some roasted potatoes. Raw onions garnished the Eggs Benedict, which I picked out since I absolutely detest them, but other than that they it was a really yummy dish. The bread base was also quite amazing and tasted more wholesome than your generic English muffin/white bread. The potatoes were perfectly crisp and seasoned so that they didn't taste bland like how potatoes often become, and the salad had a nice, light dressing to go along with it. The only issue that I had with the dish was that for $15.50, it seemed a bit pricey for how much food they gave, even though it was presented nicely. 

Le Cartet is definitely a great place if you want to enjoy a nice brunch in a chic environment. I would save it for occasions that lean more toward the special side, however, unless you have enough dough to spend on a regular basis (which as a university student I do not have, unfortunately).",2016-08-11 22:57:54

 You also know that realization that you haven't eaten anything yet, and maybe, just maybe, that's why you're so friggen hungry?!? That was also me at the Kingsland Farmer's Market today. Someone told me Kaffir Lime was good, so I went there. That's all I knew...

What did I discover? Flavour, texture, and fresh ingredients!!!  I was so disinterested when I ordered, but then I took one bite and immediately went back up and had to thank him, and find out just what the heck this was? This place knocked my socks off and I didn't even know what I was eating. The chef's description didn't sell me the flavour - The flavour made me demand a description.

Well, what was I eating?? It's name is Rendang Daging, and we are in love. Organic beef slow simmered in coconut milk, with galangal cayenne cinnamon and spices. It's melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the cayenne give you a swift yet not overbearing kick to the heat sensors. So good.

Along side the beef is mixed fresh (very fresh) greens covered in a sweet, tangy and not overwhelming dressing, and that fantastic yellow coloured rice that I know absolutely nothing about are also on the plate. This was enough food to eat to of me. Even being super hungry and the food being so darn tasty I still can't believe I ate it all.  Total price - $12.50.

On Saturday, and I understand establishments were busy because of the Festival, what we experienced indicated a total disregard of a business to its customers. And that's why I'm writing this. 

First of all the upstairs bar seemed to be short staffed and the bartenders not experienced nor motivated enough to keep up with the flow. People at the high tops were told that if they wanted a beer, they would have to wait for it at the bar. I saw $30 tabs being rung, and $2 tips. I wanted to jump in and return to my college day's job. Let me jump in. I'd have been thrilled to pour my customers beers. And I would not have had a $2 tip. I'd have made money!  I mean, what an opportunity to rock and roll. Totally lost.

Second, many of the beers had kicked and the excuse was ""we're too busy to put new ones on.""  Hel-lo management!?!  Step up to the plate and help the staff to do what you want your bartenders to do. SELL Beer. Not to say, kicked, kicked and oh, that's kicked too. See where this is going?

Third and also disappointing. The bathroom at the bottom of the steps was deplorable, ladies room on the main floor has been out of service for what? A year? Mentioned to the one bartender about the disgusting bathroom and she said, ""do you mean from last night? Oh, we're too busy to take care of that.""  And walked away!

Last but not least. There is a huge sign stating best happy hour in town. I agree that when its not ""all kicked"" there is a great selection of beers which I've enjoyed during happy hour as well as other times of the day. However, your competitors, and I know you know who they are, use 12-0z pours for the high octanes not 10-oz pours. The price is comparable but you get less. 

Calienti's really missed a great opportunity to shine over this weekend. Those of us who go there will continue to do so, but for those people who may have stopped in for the first time?  As they say, you can only get one chance at a good first impression......",2016-08-21 15:14:48

-The steak swarma is packed with flavor and is cut to a very generous portion. 
-The babaganoush is smokey and overflowing with rich characteristics.
-The salad is a mix of dark greens, chickpeas, tomatoes, purple cabbage, cucumbers and pickled carrot sticks.

The bad:
-The falafels and salad are heavy on the oil. The fried chickpea patties tend to absorb too much of the frying oil. The taste was magnificent though. I like that they serve it with hummus for dipping. The salad needed more acid instead of base.
-Peanuts are used in the baklava and overpowers the walnuts. Instead of pistachios, Parsley uses peanuts and that is all you can taste. Honey is not a big component of the dessert and it comes out kind of dry. It just reminds me of the peanut toffees you get at the Asian markets.

While not the biggest mall....it is fairly large......stores on three levels that are connected to both the subway and PATH (Toronto's huge subterranean system).

Just across Queen St (to the South) is the Bay.....with its iconic window displays at Christmas...not to be missed. 

During peak hours (Monday - Friday -  11:00am - 2:00pm) it is busy with local workers shopping for deals. It can get very crowded and the food court line ups ridiculously long. Ditto for after work (4:30pm - 7pm). After that is quiets down. Avoid at all costs on Boxing Day and any day that there's a parade downtown or an event at Nathan Phillips Square.

This bothers me cause when I go to a fast food type place I'm usually by myself and I need fries for one not fries for 2. Now your $5 burger turns into $10 when adding a drink and fries. So unless your someone that goes here to get a burger and a burger only you will never spend just $5 here. The sad thing is all the fries they are waisting when your forcing one Person to by enough fries for 2. Aside from that the burger is great but unfortunately for $10 burgers these days i can go to so many places like fez and or grinders.

I'm from WA state, so my mom would always take me up north to downtown Seattle for school clothes shopping, etc. We would always have lunch at Nordstrom Cafe. It was pretty much mother-daughter tradition. :)

I became a Nordy's card-holder in 1996, while I was still in college. NOTE: I REALLY had no business/means to have this coveted CC, as I had a measly, part-time janitor/sandwich maker job. But still...

You can find a rather wide variety of brands/designers but thank GOD for the sales (i.e. Semi-Annual Sale) as well as Clearance sections. This is a true gold mine.

I hate buying stuff full price. I mean, even if I were a very wealthy woman, I would hate to pay full retail. It's the principle, I guess. But, if you do have some time on your hands and don't mind checking multiple departments, go for it.

Besides that - I have never been mistreated in a Nordy's. Ever. Their customer service is very high and associates truly go above and beyond for shoppers - and that's in pretty much every department.

I can remember returning Birkenstocks during the HUGE fad in 1993 to them. I was never questioned, drilled, etc on why the soles ""shrunk"" up due to me abusing my poor sandals and leaving them in my sun-scorched car. Associate took my deformed shoes and gave me replacement pair. Done.

I knew there would be a wait, since people mention that in all the reviews, but I figured it was one of those things where they say it's a 90 minute wait, but really it's 45 minutes, you know?  Yeah, not so.  They said 75-90 minutes, and I believe it truly was 90.  Wowza.  The place was packed with people waiting.  If it wasn't so cold out, we'd have gone for a walk or something - they have a great text message alert system so they text you when your table is ready.  We just got some beers at the bar - they had Strongbow cider on tap! - and jealously watched everyone else sitting down to eat.

After forever, we got to sit down.  Service moved pretty quickly after that.  We all did the build-your-own burger option, feeling slightly overwhelmed by the decisions.  All their beef is hormone-free, which is nice, so I had no qualms about getting the regular beef burger.  I got a whole wheat bun, cracked peppercorn rub, farmhouse cheddar cheese, roasted garlic mayo, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, and caramelized onion marmalade on mine.  Also ordered fries instead of the usual potato chips that come with, but since I was so hungry and had consumed 2 beers, I can't say whether there was an extra charge for that or not.  Probably.  But I wasn't paying attention.

I did pay attention when I took my first bite of the burger - wow.  Juicy and flavorful, perfect medium rare, leaps and bounds above any burger we've tried yet in Pittsburgh.  The roasted garlic mayo was great, the avocado was fresh, and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  There was a generous side of small, crispy fries which were the perfect accompaniment.  Everyone loved their meals - I know my cohorts got fried eggs on theirs, which they enjoyed - and we all agreed it was a meal worth the wait.

I'd love to come back here - it reminds me of The Counter in Chicago, another great custom burger joint - but that wait is seriously killer.  If I return, it'll have to be on a day when I'm really in no hurry at all.  90 minutes is a long time to stand around, watching delicious food go past.  But there's a reason this place is so popular - whoever is cooking the burgers and sourcing their ingredients really knows what they are doing.",2011-10-18 14:22:48

I ordered the matcha icecream with lychee cotton candy. The matcha icecream did not taste like matcha at all. The lychee candy tasted decent by itself but does not pair well with the icecream. The cotton candy kept falling down and made it extremely difficult to eat the dessert altogether. You pretty much have to finish all the cotton candy before you can get to the icecream - which did not taste good to me either.

Anyone remember that place?  Remember the breadsticks?  Ya, they were stale, dry, and overly absorbent of the saliva inside my mouth.  They were not, however, rock hard, so I consider the breadsticks a wash.  
The salad was heavy on the onions, easy on the ANYTHING ELSE.  I've never seen an onion salad before but I would imagine that Olive Garden could make one without much extra effort.  I don't understand why they don't do dressing either.  Maybe they do and there was just too little on it, but the salad was dry.  So the salad was a fail.  
For the soup, I went with the Chicken & Gnocchi.  By chicken they mean ""chicken broth"" and by gnocchi they mean ""ball of flour dough"".  This was more like wanton soup than anything else.  It didn't taste horrible, just cheap...so only a minor fail.  
I'm still alive, so I did better than I expected.  I figured the worst thing that could happen would be if I got horribly sick and had to take paid time off for a week...that didn't happen either...so another fail.

The whole experience is what got me.  We show up to GhettroCentre with 6 people and there are at least 20 waiting around for tables.  That's fine, it is lunch time.  We got a table and our waitress was decent enough.  Group ordered some sort of appetizers (that I did not partake of).  They brought our drinks.  We ordered our meals.  They brought our salads and breadsticks.  Then they brought us one of the apps.  About 10 minutes later she comes by to check on us...and we tell her we still don't have the other app.  She disappears for a while and comes back and says ""we ran out of chicken so it's going to be a while""... wait what?  You ran out...but you will...what?  Clone some more?  Sub something else?  What are you doing to make more chicken appear?  We decline the app since our meals are arriving any minute.  Food arrives, everything is normal, whatever.  I was only mildly distracted by the weird outdoor christmas light strings they have draped throughout the dining room.  I survived.

My question is, my soup/salad/breadstick combo was like $6.99.  Everyone else's meals come with salad and breadsticks, right?  So I could have just ordered the $5.34 soup (seriously, that is expensive soup) and noshed on salad and breadsticks without paying for them?  Right?  What is up with that?",2009-04-23 15:02:11

Just finishing eating here for my boyfriend's birthday with some close friends!

I was pretty excited about the lobster pot pie.  It was ""ok"".  I honestly took off the top crust sprinkled some salt and pepper and mixed it around.  It didn't have much taste.  My bf is a cook and he too said there's no taste.  So it surely wasn't just me!

The ahi tuna nachos were pretty good.  I really liked the chips even if they were a little small. The ahi was mixed with avocados, onions, tomato, siracha creme?   

My friend had the TRUFFLE TATTER TOtS.  The truffle was in the dipping sauce.  I would rather have it on the tots.

Now on to the desserts.  This place might be the spot just to swing by for late nite desserts.

The fried PB & J sandwiches was just my favorite.  It was soft and moist.  

The croissant french toast was very tasty, but they accidently burnt the botom.

The nutty monkey shake came in a very tall glass!  Now that is something I would get ""to go""

So far it was ""ok"" There's more to try so maybe I'll add another star.

It took me a minute to navigate the shower head which was pointing in the direction of the shower curtain. To give me more room I decided to lift the shower seat. To my dismay there was scum/dirt/black mold under the seat.

For one thing, they don't provide free car washes. At a time when most luxury dealerships provide complimentary car washes in which you can drop your car off, it is unfortunate that Chandler MB is still behind the times. They have never offered to pick up or drop off my car. I get you can't have a standing policy for that but I've never been offered this service...not even once. For the amount of money I've spent on Service here, I feel that I should have been offered this service at least once. I know Cadillac owners whose cars are picked up and dropped off; how is it that Mercedes can't offer a similar service? Another big problem is they don't have many loaner cars. If you fail to drop off your car in the early morning, you will be forced to renting a car from Enterprise as all their Mercedes loaners will be given out. 

Regarding the service managers. Nate Rogers is an amazing service manager but outside of him, I don't know if I could recommend another one. Nate treats all of his customers with respect and does his best to accomodate them. My experience with the other managers was not positive.

Bad choice.  I should have listened to all you Yelpers.  Hell, it's why we all Yelp.  I won't make the mistake again, I'll tell you that.  

I'd give Pisces 2 1/2 stars because they're not ""A-OK"" to me, but our waitress, Nicole, garnered an extra half star for the restaurant because she was so kind and helpful.  I could give a quarter star for the booths because they make you feel like you're eating sushi in a cave.  That's pretty cool.  The rest of the uber-modern decor made me yawn.  It's becoming so passe.  

The food is waaaaay overpriced.  They're charging Nikko prices for Sushi 101 quality.  We chose to order no rolls because they all seem to include cream cheese, something fried, mayo or whatever the hell Screaming O sauce is.  The sashimi certainly wasn't as bad as some strip mall sashimi that I've had, but it certainly wasn't worth the price tag they attached to it.  But here's the reason why I'll never return to Pisces......

We ordered the sushi-sashimi combo, which comes 9 pieces of sashimi, 8 nigiri and a California roll.  California rolls suck, and therefore we did not want to eat the California roll.  We asked to replace the California roll with a spicy salmon roll and be charged the extra dollar that the spicy salmon roll costs.  Makes sense, right?  Not to Pisces ownership, it doesn't.  So...we ordered the combo, minus the California roll (so no food was wasted) and ordered the spicy salmon roll ala carte for $6.  Now here's a word to all you business majors and future restauranteurs from your Uncle Todd:  don't give up future business for something as silly as a simple substitution.  It's a bad business move.  And so I say to you, Pisces ownership:  seriously?  You're willing to lose potential long-term business over something as simple as substituting one simply made roll for another simply made (yet not as tasty) roll?  Silly.  Just silly.",2011-09-08 19:42:06

The place is easy to find and plenty of parking spaces around. 

They have lunch special M-F with great prices lunch combo starts at $9. Alsobhave soju, beers and other alcoholic drinks from the bar. I decided to order the Beef Bimbimbap on hot stone $11. My husband ordered the combo Kalbi and Tofu Soup $14. Our dishes were presented beautifully, great details and of course, they were all delicious. They also gave 12 different side dishes with the meal! How generous. Fresh kimchi, fish cake, some vegetables, spicy octopus, seaweed salad, mashed potatoes, shredded marinated beef and Korean omelete. 

The server took good care of us right from the beginning and recommended some dishes to us to try. He also made sure our water and tea were always topped up! 

Prices for lunch are very reasonable for the amount of food you are getting. I do wish they have lunch special available on Saturday and Sunday since this is a 24 hours city and many people here work on the weekends; I am sure they will appreciate Lunch Special. 

They offered to pack my leftover for me to take home along with the additional side dishes. Overall, a wonderful experience we had here. 

Food was a 5 stars quality and definitely one on our list to keep coming back to.

Update 10/7/2017: we tried their package beef combo and it was worth it! It comes with: Beef Brisket, Prime ribe with bone in, tofu soup, steam egg in hot pot, salad, veggies, couple side dishes including kimchi and rice.

I had frequented this place to the point of exhaustion back when I lived in Henderson. Now, living over 20 miles away, I crave it almost every month and MUST make the trip over. The variety of rolls makes it easy to find something that combines every kind of sushi you enjoy (i.e. Mistake Roll). The service is always the right mix of attentiveness and consideration. Most of all the prices are a value for the quality (but not on the lowest end of the spectrum).

I ordered the scallops and my boyfriend ordered the swordfish. The sauce the scallops come in is the best sauce I've had on any seafood. It's not light and citrusy so if that's what you're going for, don't order it. It's more cheesy, rich and filling.

The swordfish was also delicious. It came without any dressing or vegetables or anything but it didn't need it! The fish speaks for itself.

Also, if you're willing to splurge a little more, get some sides! The mushrooms, the potatoes and the asparagus are worth it. Take home the leftovers.

Nonetheless, not having been to the real thing in a few years due to border violence, my wife and I decided to check it out.

As far as the decor and look of the place, they did about as good a job as can be expected.  It has a lot of the touches of the original...albeit with a lack of the grit and wear of years.

The service was pretty good...a young lady named Yolanda was attentive, and friendly, as was the hostess who seated us.  In fact, Yolanda recommended an excellent tequila (although it would be much better if they had a printed list from which to choose).

The food was another story.  (I've eaten in restaurants all over Mexico from resorts to baja joints to Mexico City).The salsas were pretty good, but everything else, the beans, rice, lobster tacos, and carne asada were  bland, and the presentation was weak.  Speaking of presentatioin, the ""toreados"" (jalapenos stuffed with cheese) were sitting on a plate with some mysteriouis brown liquid swishing around the bottom...not very appetizing for an appetizer.  also, the jalapenos should have been deveined and seeded better...as a result they were inedibly hot.

Based on our experience, it was a typical case of another Las Vegas restaurant that knows they don't have to rely on repeat business, because there's a new load of customers coming into town every day.
Overall a big disappointment, but I have to give credit to the designers who did a fairly credible job of recreating the look of Hussong's, and the wait staff who were friendlier than a lot of LV restaurant staff.

I seriously doubt we'll go back unless I hear that there have been dramatic changes in the food.",2010-04-08 16:51:34

Typical bar food fare and also some daily specials that just can't be beat.  For instance, Wednesday is $3.00 pint night....YES PLEASE!  I like it!  

We had a table of about 7-8 people and the server kept up really well considering the amount of ordering going on so kudos for that.  The interiors are a little ho-hum for my taste with typical oak cabinetry and millwork trim.

We took one home with us to try, because we were sold when they said it does not make hair flakey and the ingredients used were a lot better.

Usually the first time I try any thai restaurant I feel an obligation to get chicken pad thai and spring rolls. I can admit the pad thai was a bit bland but once adding an entire container of hot sauce to it, was enjoyable. Spring rolls were quite tasty and an order is $5.95 and comes with 4 decent sized rolls and dipping sauce.
I'd still probably be sitting on a 3 star review if it was based on that alone... However everyone else was super impressed with their selections (Garlic Chicken, Spicy Chicken, and a Spicy Shrimp Noodle dish of sorts), and one person had the Ginger Salmon which he said was ""the best salmon he's probably ever had"" and ""very tender"". So given there were no unhappy diners and I looked like a champ for suggesting this place, 4 stars it is!

Then throw in that I ordered about an hour and a half in advance and asked them to deliver for 1:15pm. Sure enough, literally 1:15 on the dot he was calling at our door and was quite friendly on the goods for payment exchange.

We have all read about musicians and movie stars that have made a Las Vegas comeback. Now it is time to read about a different movie star that has made a comeback. This movie star is a popular movie theater where the Las Vegas Strip meets New Orleans in the Orleans hotel. It is the Century Orleans 18 Movie Theater (shortened to Century Orleans from here on forward). 

The canon of reviews pertaining to the Century Orleans business listing tell a cumulative story about an outdated movie theater complex that was headed on a downward spiral. This was a convenient movie complex for Orleans guests where the sole purpose was to see a movie and grab some grub. By 2012 this was a movie theater providing substandard seats and movie experience. Fast forward to 2017, the reviews including this one speak of a state-of-the-art movie theater complex where the act of seeing the movies is just as enjoyable as the movie. This canon of reviews is a reflection of my personal experiences at the Century Orleans that go all the way back to the year 2000. 

We have stayed at the Orleans at least a half dozen times since 2000. During some of those nights that we were more up to hanging around New Orleans than the Las Vegas Strip, we rode the escalator upstairs to the Century Orleans. Regardless that the movie we saw up the escalator was entertaining, the movie theater experience was ordinary. In the following paragraph you will read about a new and improved Century Orleans movie theater experience. 

On our first night of last weeks staycation at the Orleans we were up to seeing ""American Made."" Near TGI Fridays we returned to the familiar escalator that delivered us to the Century Orleans. In contrast to previous visits there were noticeable changes. There is assigned seating in place of simply buying a ticket. As expected, the prices had gone up. On a Friday night, one adult ticket cost $11.50. Another change I saw at the entrance were references to the Cenimark brand. 

Walking towards the theater, we passed a large snack bar that filled the air with the fragrance of buttery popcorn. On account of the fact that we had filled up downstairs in the Copper Whisk Cafe led us astray from this temptation of munching on popcorn. 

Beyond the large snack bar, we stepped inside a state-of-the-art theater. The first thing I noticed was that plush luxurious reclining seats had replaced the cramped rows of auditorium seats. The narrow rows that I recall were gone. In their place were wide rows of stadium seating. In my opinion stadium seating with the plush reclining seats have saved the movie theater business from a downward spiral towards extinction. The seats were extraordinary comfortable. From the moment I pushed the button to recline the seat back, I was hesitant to leave. Even with the 20 minutes of coming attractions. When the movie ended it was hard to get up. As a side note, it is nice to know that if somebody I am with wants to see a movie that I am disinterested in that I can recline the seat back and take a nap. The best thing about the reclining seats is that everybody in the theater has an uninterrupted view of the silver screen. Thanks to stadium seating, the individual that would have been in front of you is practically below you now. 

When the lights dimmed and the action came on the screen, it was an academy winning movie theater experience. The images on the screen were crystal clear. The crystal clear imagery with the state of the art surround sound elevated the movie experience to a whole new level. During the action scenes of ""American Made"" I felt that Tom Cruise was right here flying the airplane above me. 

The movie theater industry has reversed a downward spiral towards extinction. Century Orleans is one of several movie theaters that have gotten their acts together. Century Orleans is now a movie theater complex where the experience of seeing the movie is just as entertaining as the movie itself.",2017-10-22 06:13:00

It does get a bit loud and the view is of a shopping mall.. a high-end shopping mall, but still. Not my ideal view for a such an awesome spot. It is what it is though!

The room itself is very nice, lots of seating, lively atmosphere, great looking staff. I have been a couple of times now and the service is always great when I have gone and the food spectacular. 

I have ben to Ocean Club a couple of times, but this most recent visit was a dinner of 'Dungeoness Crab Cocktail', 'Ribeye' and '10 oz Ahi Sashimi' . We shared everything with a side of sauteed spinach .. and a few martinis. :) I loved was the personal style serving from the individual pans that the food items were seemingly prepared in. The service staff has always been very pleasant and makes the experience very comfortable. 

The Ahi was fantastic with a really beautiful presentation laid out on a long plate with a finish of a really tasty sauce. The ribeye was prepared expertly, perfect medium rare with still  a beautiful grill flavor. The spinach was .. spinach, sauteed.. but was excellent nonetheless! haha.. I was having such a great time and enjoying the vibe of the place overall. 

There was a piano player in the corner of the room playing standards and old-school vegas tunes.. Sinatra and the like. It gave a beautiful feel to an elegant style dinner. My friends and I aren't the most refined diners, but we know how to have a good time, and Maestro's made us feel welcome within that setting.

Now don't get me wrong... this ain't your downtown steakhouse with a $4.99 steak special.. you WILL drop a pretty penny to have some seriously tasty grub.. but I do believe it's worth it.  At over $150 a head when we dined there last, it was worth the money but definitely be ready for a big bill. It's nearly unavoidable. 

Have a great time, and happy eating!",2011-09-10 20:20:55

I thought this would be a convenient place to eat for our later House of Blues concert, but not so much.  Practically speaking, it was no closer than any of the dozen other restaurants in Mandalay Bay, so proximity to House of Blues is irrelevant.

While the menu looked interesting, the dishes served were truly awful low-grade bar food.  Two of the four things we ordered were delivered cold and flavorless, the other two were hastily assembled salads with cheap ingredients.

As bad as the food was, the service was even worse.  Mind you, we arrived at 7:00pm on a Saturday night, but they were so understaffed that it took 15 minutes for someone to say hello, another 15 to take our order, 45 for the food to show up and all the while never received a single refill of our drinks or water.  I should also note, the place was not that crowded as you might suspect...I think the word has gotten out.

In short, I'd never go back here because there are so many good alternatives in Mandalay Bay.  If I wanted to grossly overpay for cheap bar food and bad service, there is no shortage of places where I could accomplish that :-)",2016-05-02 21:17:00

If you're searching for a fancy restraunt to dine then Maria's isn't for you.  However,  if what you're looking for is hot, crispy, and delicious Frybread, then look no further, Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food is calling your name. 

Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food is a real gem. The decor is not fancy by any means however, the restraunt is comfortable, clean, and the staff is accomadating. The menu at Maria's has something to satisfy everyones taste, from the sweet to the savory. I wasn't sure what I should order on my first visit to Maria's. However, the owner took the time to explain the menu, gave samples and helped me decide what kind of frybread to order. 

On this visit I opted for savory rather than sweet and settled on the red chili beef Taco, made with refried beans, red chili beef, onions, shredded cheese, and lettuce. My lunch companion went with the green chili. 

As we were waitng for our fry bread we were given a complimentary basket of hot tortilla chips and salsa.  The tortilla chips at Maria's were absolutely delicious and were everything a torilla chip should be, fresh, hot, crispy, and lightly salted. I could have ate the entire basket myself.

After our chips it was time for our frybread. Although, the fry bread is made to order, our frybread was served quickly.  The frybread portions at Maria's are big (larger than the plate) and are delicious. The frybread was light, airy, served hot, and so flavorful and the red chili meat was lean and delicious.  I can't recall a time when I had better tasting frybread. 

Just when I thought my meal couldn't get any better the owner came out with a hot basket of complementary sopaipillas with honey, cinnamon, and powdered sugar, and the sopaipillas were fantastic. I couldnt beleive how much delicious food we devoured at Maria's but it was worth every calorie.

I had driven by it a bunch of times when we first moved in but just thought it was yet another convenience/liquor store until I read Kristin C's awesome review. I had no idea that that little place had so much history! I sent Kristin a compliment for her review and said that I was planning to stop by, but she wrote back saying that the place was under new ownership and that I might not find the market to be the same as when she went to it back in March of 2007. She was right. 

On the way home the other night, we decided to stop to get some soda water and limes. We found it to be a fairly well-stocked market (they had limes but not soda water, although that seems to fairly common around here, since neither Fresh & Easy nor CVS carries it) with a good selection of wine and refrigerated goods (including tortillas). The woman working was extremely friendly and suggested a Mexican sparkling mineral water instead of the soda water they didn't carry. However, I didn't see all of the amazing homemade goods or antiques/collectibles that Kristin described.

Morimoto Service:  Our server Prince was on point throughout the evening for our party of 10.  He asked if we wanted to go family style or individual orders and he made suggestions to ensure the best experience.  We went family style and everything he suggested worked out great.  Drinks kept flowing parallel to the conversation all night, top notch.

Morimoto Cuisine:  I sampled a lot, here are my faves.  The hamachi tacos was my favorite appetizer as the Yuzu Kosho and avocado worked so well together.  The ishi yaki buri bop/yellowtail on rice was cooked in a hot stone bowl at the table.  Fun to watch and Snap, but even more fun to eat.  The Braised Black Cod was prepped perfectly and delicious.  The Fiery Salty Caramel Chocolate Tarte is the flagship dessert for a good reason.  Aesthetically pleasing but more importantly, very tasty and I'm not really a chocolate dessert guy.

Morimoto Ambiance: Beautifully designed with classy Japanese decor throughout the restaurant.  The lighted wall behind the sushi chefs had murals of Japanese pics in black and white and really made the main dining room. It's definitely a restaurant that can be used for special occasions and date nights.  Very attractive and elegant.

All the dishes I tried were prepped well and high quality ingredients were used.  The service was top notch and enhanced the experience.    This is a great place for business dinners if the expense account is getting debited.  For non-business dinners, get ready to rack up a bill if you're hungry as the food is tasty but the portions small.  Either way, you're in for a good experience at Morimoto.

uiW2lVQMKV3QtIsq2-qJPg,NgSpXzlEm4soUWQbqykUzw,1pXyaPUXMqZyxW1Ew7BLUg,3,2,0,0,"Restaurants along the harbourfront are surprisingly limited for a tourist area. With options such as Shoeless Joes and Swiss Chalet I would say that Guirei is one of the better selections in the harbourfront neighbourhood. 

Guirei's appearance is like any average sushi restaurant I've been to in Toronto. Unexpectedly large on the inside, the restaurant is dimly lit with very simple décor, creating a casual dining atmosphere. The noise level of the restaurant is also quiet but that was probably due to the fact that there were only a few customers eating there.

The food was OK. They had a vast amount of items on their menu offering a few ""dishes"" that veered from the typical sushi menu but mostly all were staples. Portion sizes of the food were decent and the overall taste was not mind blowing but not bad. 

To start, I was craving something deep fried. I decided to try their ""Soft Shell Crab"" and the ""Agedashi Tofu"".  The Soft Shell Crab was exactly what I expected it to be - battered, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce. In terms of taste, there wasn't anything spectacular about it. The crab was subtle in texture and the meat was juicy...and tasted like crab (surprise!). The Agedashi Tofu consisted of fairly large tofu cubes, also deep fried, and topped with bonito flakes. On the first bite, the tofu is crispy but the middle is soft. The sauce it was served in wasn't too salty but was flavourful enough to complement the tofu. 

For the main, the ""storm roll"" caught my eye on the menu. It consisted of deep fried salmon with avocado, lettuce, and green onion all rolled into a very big fat sushi roll. It had a predominant salmon taste with a hint of spice. I didn't think the lettuce belonged in the roll as it didn't really add anything to it. It was an unnecessary, soggy ingredient that would not have been missed.

Overall, the food and the service were very good. The waitress was friendly and we didn't wait very long for the food. The prices were pretty standard for sushi dining. It wasn't the best in Toronto but definitely worth a try if you are in the neighbourhood.",2013-02-12 17:50:01

I've been thoroughly impressed with VAS's personal service, their ability to squeeze you in on relatively short notice, the ease in making an appointment, and their communication on what the deal is with your car.  They also have a free ride service to drop you off and pick you up, which is highly convenient!

I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed all the meat options - the Meat Jun unexpectedly becoming my favorite. Egg battered beef, it was tender and bursting with flavor. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and kalbi is always good. But my cold buckwheat noodles - they were perfection. The balance of spice and acidity warming me up perfectly on a ""Seattle"" day.

Either eating in, or taking it to go, the food and service is stellar. I've had a couple different appetizers and entrees and I've narrowed it down to two favorites. The Siamese Kisses app is fricken delicious and the Pad Thai is :drool: amazing. 

They do their spice level from 1 to 5. 1 being no spice at all and 5 being Thai hot. Ive ordered the Pad Thai at a 3 and a 4 and I think I prefer the 3. Level 4 is definitely manageable but it kind of burns the tummy afterward.. Which is just slightly unpleasant.

Driving by it is not obvious this place is here.  It looks like  motel from the outside.  Inside there is a shop and this restaurant.  The menu is a large board above the counter.  It's a dive.  But the ratings were really good, and a dive isn't necessarily bad.  So we got in line.

The three of us ordered different things.  I got the signature dish (ahogadas Guadalajara), my wife got the caldo de res (soup), and our guest got a chicken burrito.  Plus a side of rice (me).  My wife says her soup was good.  Our guest says her burrito was good.  I didn't notice any great enthusiasm, but they apparently were content.  My dish is essentially a smothered sandwich.  They take the meat they would normally wrap in a tortilla and put it on a bolillo bread.  I see why there wasn't enthusiasm from my dining partners.  My ahogadas was fine.  Not great, but fine.  The sauce tasted a lot like chili powder.  Reminded me of a sauce I made years ago in college that was basically tomato soup and chili powder.  Really underwhelming.  And the rice was REALLY underwhelming.  Very weak flavor.

I've had authentic Mexican food, both in Mexico and here in Phoenix (I still mourn the loss of La Tolteca to fire).  This really isn't it.  If the other reviewers here like it, that's their prerogative.  But I most definitely don't agree that this is particularly authentic or good.  It's not bad.  If I were in high school I could see coming here to get away from school food (as we noticed:  about 15 minutes after we got there the line got VERY long full of high school kids from Chandler High).  But otherwise, no.  I could come here again, but I wouldn't make a point of it.

The sandwiches are hit-or-miss. A BLT had pretty low-quality turkey meat and weird bacon. A Tuna Melt was fine, but had pretty standard canned tuna.  

Baked goods are equally a mixed bag. Sometimes banana bread or a scone will be awesome. Sometimes a gluten free muffin will make me want to spit it out immediately.

Myself and two others came in about a month ago on a Monday night at 7pm. Walked in my first impression was this place is really pretty the white chairs are brave but very nice and then my second thought was we are pretty much the only people in here excluding the 3 women at the bar. Ok no big deal its Monday! why should this place be packed we sit and get a nice booth by the window and order a bottle of wine. Jennifer was our server and was really nice and did a great job!

We started our first course which was the Scotch Eggs and Crab dip...neither blew me away but if I had to choose I choose the Chips for the dip! They were great! Other than that the Crab dip was blah it needed something else to it and the Scotch Eggs were just not good they were overcooked and dry with no flavor...move on to the next

I had the French Onion soup along with my sister and my friend had the salad with Candied Walnuts....Soup was good perfect temp and not too big of a serving. Salad was served with 1 Walnut, she asked if she could have more, but really you only put 1 on the salad in the first place! I tried the candied walnuts and wish I hadn't they reminded me of Sour Patch Kids-Nut flavored they were gross, she liked them I did not!

Ok 3rd course I had the Surf and Turf- Short Ribs over Lobster Risotto- Sounds great right! It was but it was lukewarm and I wasn't really sure why but whatever I ate about half of it and boxed up the rest!

We then ordered the Ice cream of the day which is to be served with Chocolate covered Pretzels- Obviously our reason for ordering it! Well we get it and its just a scoop of ice cream so we ask for the pretzels and she comes back empty handed and tells us they didn't tell her but they don't have any.....Soooo mad at that chef!! 

2 bottles of wine and another round of wine later we ask for our check so Jennifer can go home since it was obvious that no one else was coming in! My sister had printed off a coupon for $50 off $100 worth of food well we definitely hit that! So we hand it to her and she comes back with it taken off and then we all just threw our card in and asked her to just to split it evenly on each card please...she comes back and tells us she can't do that because they're system wont let her do so...Wrong answer Ive worked, along with my friend on the same system they have (micros) that thing can do anything!!! That's why people buy them! Well then D-bag owner/Manager/ Bartender walk over and tells us he can't do it so we say that's not even possible for you to not be able to do it. He then says that it only allows one card to be swiped since he had discounted the bill already...Weird and stupid, oh and not TRUE!! It became apparent that he either didn't want us to use our coupon or he didn't want to pay the credit card companies for our 3 charges because other than those 2 reasons I'm not really sure what else his excuse was! In the end they figured something out and it worked out but my friend and I both explained to our server that there is a way of doing it and told her that if we were anybody else we would have just left her a shitty tip because of her bosses stupidity and that he completely ruined our night out by his arrogance...He should either go take the class on how to use his Micros like I had to in the past or go back to England!!",2011-04-06 16:36:30

The room seemed nice.  View of the Las Vegas Strip I mentioned earlier?  Yeah.  I guess the hotel thinks looking down on the parking garage is a view of the Strip.  After unpacking, we noticed it was super hot in the bedroom.  The A/C was broken or something.  I closed the vent in the living room to re-direct all the air into the room.  Still nothing.  Put down the window shutter and that didn't help.  Mind you, it's a good 105 degrees outside with the sun beaming in.  We called and they said they'd said an engineer would come in.  Waited an hour and got fed up.  Went downstairs.  Had to wait in the long line.  Front desk just said they'll send up an engineer.  We go back up and we got a message about an engineer being there.  We called again and they'd send the engineer up again.  This took another 30 minutes.

Engineer tinkered with something.  The room was still hot.  We called the front desk for a new room and they said they don't have any vacancies.  Oh really?  While waiting in the line to talk to the front desk, I checked the website and there were vacancies for all the rooms.  Hmm.  And cell phone service only exists downstairs.  Good luck trying to make a phone call or getting any important calls in your room.  Not happening at all.  Front desk said they can hook up the Internet manually since it's not showing up on the devices we wanted to connect to.  We just said forget about it.  What if we decided to pay $10/day or $20 for 3-days of Internet and it doesn't even work.  Then what?

The fridge was horrible.  It was not cooling anything at all.  Engineer said he'll see what he can do.  Never heard from him again.

The dishes in the cupboard?  Dirty.  The dish I pulled out was probably the only dirty one right?  Nope.  Few of them were.  Even the cups.  Yuck.  I'll post pictures of that.  It makes you want to rethink why they have checkout at 10AM to ensure that they clean everything thoroughly when it's just dirty.

Also, there was some person banging on our door at 7 in the evening.

Horrible customer service.  Probably the first and last time staying here.  Heard good things about this hotel and that is why we stayed here.  Otherwise, after a horrible experience, will just go elsewhere.",2014-06-09 04:42:25

We arrived around 10 and probably had to stand in line for about 10 minutes, which was totally fine because it wasn't that cold out. The dress code at this place is really strict so if you are planning on showing up in anything remotely obnoxious, don't bother because they won't let you in. The more I think about it the more I think that the dress code is a little ridiculous. I saw two people that were denied entrance. The first had a silver chain around his neck and the second was wearing True Religion jeans. I don't think either of those things make you more likely to start a fight. Once we entered we had to pay $8 for cover which annoyed me because as a girl I don't think I've paid cover for a couple years... I honestly thought it was a thing of the past. The drinks seemed a bit pricy and they won't take credit card unless you have a minimum of $40 on your tab.

On my most recent visit, I tried a few items from the menu incuding avocado tempura, tamago nigiri, inari nigiri, and a kimino roll.

The avocado tempura was awesome with firm avocado and a light batter. It's often hard to find good vegetarian rolls at sushi places as many just default to the standard avocado/cucumber/carrot sticks so I was happy to experience something a touch more flavourful with the kimino roll. This roll includes fried tofu, shitaki mushrooms, avocado, asparagus, cucumber and carrot.

I thought oh okay that's odd and went inside. 

There seemed to be six-seven TVs Inside and one is black, the TV in the center is busted and playing an intermittent signal, and only
Two have the baseball game on. The rest are playing a weight loss infomercial. I thought to myself, no wonder why this place is no longer packed on a Saturday night. The people wanting to grab a beer and watch a few games went to Blue32, Gordon, or even Thirsty Lion now. What a waste! There was maybe five Cuba fans crowded by the working TVs. Don't you guy realize we are in a Mecca for baseball fans with spring training and etc? Maybe you'd capitalize on all of us if you actually played the games in an entertaining atmosphere? I'd be shocked to see this continue this way come NHL/NBA/NFL season. 

They were also playing sad 90s alternative music which was a downer on the entire Saturday night mood. I was so disappointed.

$48 for two same-day go-kart races for two people ($214 value)
Two go-kart races per person
Helmet
Race suit and shoes
Head sock and sticker
Autographed poster
Bottled water
We didn't even end up using the race suit, shoes, nor the autographed poster. But the Groupon is worth it because for one person to race one time,  it's $25. For a second time time I think they charge $20. So for two people for two races that would be like $90 total.
The place is outside,  so don't expect any a/c. So it was a good thing we came at night. There was only two guys working, so we had to wait a little bit for somebody to check us in at the front desk. I showed the Groupon and we got our tickets. 
You have to watch a safely video before you get behind the wheel. They also give you a head sock to put on before you put on your helmet, and you get a neck brace! We got our water bottles after the first race.
 
These are not bumper cars, so no bumping!

I can definitely appreciate the history behind this casino. It opened in 1941 and at one time was even owned by Bugsy Siegel! (Yes, THAT Bugsy Siegel!) before settling in the hands of Jackie Gaughan.

When you step into the place it is definitely a throwback. With plenty of coin-in machines left you can still hear the ching ching ching of coins hitting the metal tray. Not too many places left in this town where you'll find that these days!  The El Cortez is a great place to park for free if you want to be in close walking distance to Neonopolis, Le Thai, Insert Coins, Commonwealth, and the like. The sportsbook (run by son Michael of South Point) is a suprisingly good book for what you might expect.

Plus, suprisingly, I've had a fair share of luck with the machines here and have won a little bit! So I don't think the machines are wound up too tight.

On the other hand, the place isn't the cleanest place around. The smell of smoke does permeate the place, which as a non-smoker is quite off-putting. Than you have some of the homeless and interesting Fremont clientele, in general, congregating around. They do try to keep the place safer by always having security posted in and outside the doors.

I've never stayed in the rooms, so I can't comment as far as that goes. They say Jackie still lives on property, but I haven't run into him yet.

For the appetizer, I went with the Mexican Street Corn Salad (faro, tomato, feta, avocado, lime vinaigrette). This was an impressively large portion and it's a good dish, but I can't say I loved it. Though the very ingredients were used very well and were of high quality, I was expecting something a little more flavorful to reflect the ""Mexican"" part of the dish (ie it could've used some South-of-the-border inspired seasonings and spices).

The main was the 24hr Brined Fried Chicken Burger (jalapeno slaw, adobo mayo, brioche bun). I'll admit that I was disappointed by the first bite, as it seemed to consist entirely of deep-fried crispiness.

(Gotta love a good shoestring french fry.)

I finished off the meal with the  Chocolate Tart (peanut butter sauce, chocolate whipped cream), which was much, much better than I might've anticipated. The tart itself was unbelivably chocolately and rich, while the peanut butter sauce was a perfect accompaniment.",2016-07-13 18:44:47

Small mom n pop coffee and pastry shop. Like others have said, it's very relaxed here. Hang out, sip coffee, watch soccer (which they had on tv). Still it was maybe a little too relaxed. There was a table inside full of dirty dishes and trash when I ordered. I chose to sit outside for maybe about 30 or so minutes, and when I came back in, it still hadn't been cleaned up. The only other customers besides me was just one couple, who had already finished their food and were just chatting. Not a huge deal, I guess, but a little offputting.

The Cafe Americano was good, tasty. I'd say I prefer it over a chain like Starbucks. 

I had a slice of layer cake, with chocolate and vanilla layers. The frosting was a little too sweet for me (but wasn't too bad when paired with my black coffee), and the cake was dry. 

I took a pistachio croissant to go. Having finished with my cake, I took the dish inside. I don't know if the employee (barista?) forgot I had ordered the croissant, but he rushed to pack it up.  He shoved the pastry into a paper bag as he was walking to me, getting hella crumbs all over the floor haha.

The facility as a whole and the employees were nice.  They have the art of moving people through the lines down to a science.  To get a license and registration done for my husband and I (with two small children in tow) it took about 45 minutes.  We showed up at 7:50am (they open at 8am) and there was already a line of 20 people waiting.  Be prepared to wait.  But the employees do work hard to move people quickly.  

If you have moved from out of state like we did, a few tips...

1.  Make sure that you have all of your documents ready to go.  You can start the application process for a license online and print it out to take it with you.  Your started application will be valid for 30 days from the date you completed it.  Also take your current license, proof of insurance, and a second form of ID (like a passport).  When your number is called, they will take your photo for your license first, then you will wait, and then you will be called to complete the process of getting your license. 

2.  Pending that you also want to knock out your vehicle registration, take with you your registration, lien/loan information (if applicable), and the above documents.

3. If you are registering your car and getting plates in the same visit - GET READY TO HAVE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT ASSAULTED! Back in the midwest, the cost to register your car and get plates was somewhere in the $50-$100 range.  As I was sitting there waiting on the woman to give me a number for the plates, she said that ""Arizona will really get you when it comes to registering your car.""  I kind of thought she was kidding.  Then she told me it was going to cost $367.00 to register my 2012 Toyota Highlander. I almost fell out of my chair.  Apparently, to register a car in AZ, they take a small percentage of the original purchase price of your car? Maybe they do this in other states too, but I had not heard of it before.  I thought that I had done my research regarding this whole process, but apparently I didn't dig deep enough and that info isn't offered up on the website loud and clear.  So between my husband and I, it cost us $900 to register two cars today.  Not like you can avoid it.  Just be prepared. 

*******UPDATE:  After having some time to search, I did find this info from the ADOT website. 
Fees
The cost to title and register your vehicle varies depending on the vehicle. There is a $4 title fee, an $8 registration fee, an air-quality research fee of $1.50 and a vehicle license tax (VLT) assessed in place of a personal property tax charged by other states. There may also be a weight fee and commercial registration fee if the vehicle is registered as commercial.
The VLT is based on an assessed value of 60 percent of the manufacturer's base retail price reduced by 16.25 percent for each year since the vehicle was first registered (15 percent before Aug. 1, 1998). Then, as of the Dec. 1, 2000, reduction, the rate is calculated for each $100 of the assessed value as $2.80 for new vehicles and $2.89 for used vehicles. For example, for a new vehicle that costs $25,000, the first-year assessed value would be $15,000 and the VLT would be $420. The second year the assessed value would be $12,562.50 and the VLT would be $363.06.
For a mobile home, the title fee is $7 per section or unit. No other mobile home fees are payable to MVD.***************

Doing some shopping at Toy R Us across from Concord Mills today and decided to give Fosters a try.  Had heard several good comments on the specialty which is a Charburger and wanted to try it.

I will give them credit. The Charburger is an excellent burger with great taste and flavor much like Burger King had in the early 80's when they were CharBroiled. A little heavy on the condiments meaning everything wants to slid off but other than than, an excellent tasteful choice.

Going back to the beginning, you walk in and go to the counter and they have menu pads where you circle what you want and pay. They give you your beverage cups and a number you place at your table. I ordered had squeeze lemonade so I had to wait a minute but joined my wife shortly at a table over to the side.

My wife ordered a Philly Cheese steak and a side of fruit.along with tea. The rest of my order in addition to the burger described above was a half order of fries.

Service is very slow and it took almost 15 minutes for our order to arrive. As I pointed out, the Charburger lives up to it's reputation but the fries were limp and oily.  Very little lemon in the lemonade so it ended up tasting like slight tart sugar water

 My wife did not like her Philly Cheese Steak because it had been made with a poor quality meat and no peppers and little onions on the sandwich. The side of fruit was a prepackaged container of Dole Mixed Fruit still in the original container.

Staff was friendly and the restaurant clean and they have a lot of other activities during the week to appeal to families with small children but that did not do much for us.

Luckily we were passing by on their first day of business so we decided to give it a try! I was originally just looking for some appetizers to snack on but the all you can eat dinner for 28.00 seemed pretty reasonable so I went with the all you can eat. 

I started with the Kobe beef sushi roll. It had Kobe beef, avocado and a sweet type of sauce drizzled on the top. It was delicious! 

The crispy buffalo shrimp was tangy . They were bite sized shrimp with buffalo flavoring. 

The 007 was like a California roll but with big pieces of shrimp and avocado draped over the rolls. I enjoyed these as well!

Bacon and scallop skewers were mostly bacon with tiny pieces of scallops inside. They had different skewers available . I would like to try the bacon and mushroom skewers next time. 

Chicken Katsu wraps were good especially for people like my husband who don't eat sushi. He was happy with the wrap and his cucumber salad .

We ended the meal with some honey toast. It reminded me of hawaiian rolls with ice cream and honey on the top. It  was my first time having this dessert be prepared for sweetness overload!

The Thick Sicilian is properly thick, and will filled up your stomach with delicious carbs. The crust is just normal flavored.

Reservations for 12 were made 3 weeks ago, confirmed 3 times, including earlier that morning for 8:30p on Saturday night. After waiting 30 minutes, 2 within our party had separately asked the hostess when we would be seated and received different excuses.  

With time to kill, I wanted to explore the other levels. The 2nd floor was closed. 3rd floor had the hookah lounge, and I sat down at the bar up there with louder house music in the background. I had a drink up there, a pretty weak gin and tonic for $5, with good service from the bartender. Came back down, we were still waiting. Finally seated at our 2 adjacent hibachi grills, 60+ minutes after our scheduled reservations. 

Hoped things would be better ? No. 
We waited several minutes for our server to arrive, received water and asked for drink orders. We ordered a $50 bottle of red wine, a couple mixed drinks, and sodas for the 6 at our table. 10 minutes pass and don't see our server. She arrived, sheepishly apologized, said couldn't find the bottle, we ordered another. At that point, I overhear a different server profusely apologizing  about the service to an adjacent table on the other side of us, stating he was working tables across 3 floors. I look over at the brewing conversion, make eye contact with one of the patrons at that table, and replies back ""you'll be screwed"".  

Waited again for 10 more minutes with no sight of our server (at least the other server filled our water glasses as we grew restless), we had enough. 3 of us, 2 each with 5+ years in the industry went to speak to a manager. She apologized, and promised to bring one of the ordered bottles and to comp us a round of drinks. 

Highlight of the night: Incredulous, I ended up going to the Map Room, betting myself that I could finish a drink there before I'd receive mine at Tomo. I arrived at map room just in time to watch Kyrie win the final round of the 3point all-star contest, have a drink, receive great service, all within 10 minutes. 

I arrived back at Tomo, with my drink waiting for me for about a minute or 2; the other table still hadn't received their drinks yet (!) as the hibachi chefs arrive for each of our tables. 

Our chef itself was engaging and a nice, great guy, one of the only bright spots of the night. The food wasn't bad either, standard hibachi fare from what I've experienced going to hibachis once or twice a year. $20-$30 for a hibachi order of veggies, scallops, chicken, or salmon along with miso soup. Our other table didn't even receive their miso soup until their hibachi was already ! 

A hibachi along in 5 floors in a beautiful building would have been excellent addition to the Warehouse District. Unfortunately, this place just failed and gives Cleveland downtown dining a bad reputation.",2013-02-20 18:49:05

Ok.....I like about 8 country songs, so getting dragged to a country bar was not my plan, but last Friday (4/13) I obliged, and found myself in the epicenter of silliness and random nonsense.  

Before arriving, I was asked by a friend if I could ""two-step?""  My response:  ""Like, my drink and my two-step?""  Then I was told that two-stepping is what they do at country bars, it's like hillbilly ballroom dancing.  This bar has that. 

Here's a bunch of other random stuff I noticed on my visit:

Lots of dirty old cowboys doing inappropriate things (spitting beer all over their wives for example).
A mechanical bull with an operator that knew what he was doing.
A very authentic country band (very talented, I forget the name, sorry)
In a well-lit, country bar, the stereotypes about white people being bad dancers are hilariously true.  I think copious levels of alcohol had something to do with all the bad moves.  
If you learn the electric slide, you never need to learn another line dance again, they do it to every song.  



This bar reminds me of a lot of college bars around the country:  Same level of intoxication, but more tourists, and less lacrosse hats.

We were seated immediately - no surprise because the place was almost empty. Our drinks came quick, and our order was taken in a timely fashion. It took nearly an hour or us to get our food, which was mainly soups, salads, and sandwiches.

I ordered a turkey, avocado and bacon sandwich. The bread on my sandwich was completely charred, as was my coworkers. Instead of replacing the bread once burnt, they lightly toast the other side so you don't notice initially. Nearly everyone at my table had something wrong with their order.

After they delivered the food, they vanished. They didn't refill our drinks or check on us. We actually had to stand near the kitchen, and wait for someone to request the bill.

 I think every meal I saw had Beef Tongue in it. I was more than prepared just to set it aside and not eat it. I'm always pestering  my husband to try something new so he turned the tables on me about trying the tongue.  I had to bite my tongue and literally eat one. He kept cooking it for me and I was getting nauseous. The tongue didn't taste bad it tasted like beef but I couldn't help but picture a big tongue with taste buds. My mom would always take me to the market with her and I would see this huge tongue in the meat case. It would gross me out and scare me! That was why I couldn't fully enjoy this experience. 

Even though I did dwell on eating a beef tongue for the first time there were other items that came with our meal which was delicious! It came with Kalbi (my favorite), Kobe beef, Chicken ( I let my husband eat all of that), Shrimp. It also came with salad, Miso Soup ,  rice, Kim Chee , Kim Chee radishes, spicy crab rolls , and spicy Tuna rolls. It was more than enough for two people! I enjoyed the coziness of the booth because you have your privacy so you can talk freely. My husband really enjoyed their ice cold beer. I wish they could do that with soda for the non beer drinker.

I have been going to the Market Outlet (though I affectionately call it the Produce Stand) for years...  It was one of my best finds when I first started working Dahn-tahn.  I mean their prices are out of this world!  I can say that I almost exclusively stick with produce here (hence my nickname).  So why is it so good...

Well for starters, if you are like me you try to incorporate lots of fresh fruit and veggies into your diet.  In season, and sometimes out of season you can come here and buy a basket of bell peppers (and I am talking about the yellow/red/and orange kind) for $3.00.   That is a BASKET! That could be anywhere from 6-10 depending on their size.  At the Eagle you are lucky to get one pepper for that price!  Actually it would probably be more than that...

Moving on I have purchased a 5lb bag of chopped broccoli for $2.00, a LB of Strawberries and blueberries for $1.00, a 5LB bag of carrots for $2.00, and so many other great deals!   

It's great to come here and find all these bargains.  Only bummer is, it is not sold year around.  So for instance those peppers may be there one day and the next week you are SOL.  Buyer be warned, you also must look over your items (produce or whatever) before purchase.  I have at some times found mold in strawberry containers or broccoli buckets ECT.  Don't let this deter you, just keep looking.  Now there are those times that you may not find anything good, but that is much more reserved to the coldest months (again just addressing produce).  

Finally, they do accept CC, but there is a $5.00 minimum, and that isn't usually hard to meet and still leave with two heaping bags of produce that would have cost one $30.00 at the Eagle.  Just a great value.  Give it a try and you will see just be selective and look it over, it is totally worth the savings!",2014-01-27 18:45:29

My first impression was, wow, this is going to be excellent. The space is open and inviting. It reminded me a bit of Southern Rail, a restaurant in Chapel Hill, modeled after a railroad car. The wood, ceiling, lighting--are all very sleek without being overly modern. 

The two of us began with the Low County Crab Dip and the Tomato Bruschetta. Let me tell you that the crab dip was out of this world. It has a crunchy Parmesan crust on top served with those thick hand-cut style potato chips. SOLD. So good that we could not stop eating it. The bruschetta was also great. The bread was a bit thinner than what I am used to and you could really taste the flavors. Definitely some dill in there. 

I had the Vegetable Lasagna, which is noodle-less. It was INSANELY good. They must put some kind addictive substance  in there, and I am OK with that. I also tasted the NC trout. It was good, but it couldn't quite compare to the lasagna. I want to try the Chicken 3 Ways next time. 

We were so pleased with our meals so far that we each got our own dessert! I had the bread pudding. It wasn't so much of a traditional bread pudding. It was a cross between a scone and banana bread slice type of thing. It was really good, but not what I typically would call bread pudding. The caramel sauce was excellent. We also ordered the apple turnovers. I couldn't even snag a bite, so they must have been that good! 

Our service was great. The drink I ordered could have been a bit stronger. I am not a fan of weak drinks, especially for what you pay. That's the only thing I can really say that disappointed me about the whole experience. I can't wait to go back!",2011-04-04 15:41:55

I opted to try out the lunch first because I was very intrigued by the grilled cheese and tomato soup I had read about in other reviews.  

Sure enough, both were mighty fab!  There wasn't a thing I would change about the grilled cheese.  The bread (wheat or grain) was awesome and it was toasted perfectly.  Tomatoes inside were an added bonus.  But the real winner of was the cheese.  Oh Cheddar, oh cheddar, how I love thee!  It was sharp as could be and absolute melty goodness.  I was in cheesy heaven!

The soup was definitely good, but not great.  I think it could have done with a little more pepper and a tad more cream to add to the bisque name.  It tasted just a tad too runny for bisque.  If I'm going to calorie overload on my bisque, you better commit with my heavy cream!  

Service left a little bit to be desired.  She just seemed very unenthusiastic about everything.  I really enjoy asking the server about different menu items, to get their take on what they enjoy.  Maybe I'm too trusting, but I assume they've tried mostly everything and have opinions about them.  I mean, I wouldn't work in a place I hated their food (that's maybe why I stuffed myself with one too many EnP Superburgers back in my day).  She didn't really offer much....oh well, you can't always have a peppy server (Lord knows I wasn't all the time!).

Lucky for me, I found a deal that included flight and hotel for $500 for 4 nights.  Yay!

I have stayed at the W Hotel in Montreal before, another boutique hotel but I just can't afford their prices without an expense account.

The Hotel Chez Swann is located on Drummond Street which is a hop, jump and skip away from downtown.  Peel metro station is located within a 2 minute walk and when Bixi bikes are in season (they stash them away in November), there is a Bixi stand right outside the hotel.  We pretty much walked everywhere and downtown was about a 20 minute walk away.  Not a bad way to work off the calories from all the yummy food to be had in Montreal.

The hotel itself has all the elements of a boutique hotel.  Dim lighting, funky decor, a peekaboo shower and even a plush seating area right in front of the window that looks out onto the street.  I couldn't help but feel I had walked into some sort of modeling shoot. 

Prior to arriving I had requested a room on the third floor because I didn't want there to be too much noise coming from the street.  However, being a factory-converted hotel, with only 3 floors, you could still hear the noise from the street at night.  But I slept through it all anyways.  We had a room with a great view of the street, thank goodness as I know one side of the hotel faces a parking lot!

The staff are all very friendly although on the first night of our stay, we noticed the sheets hadn't been changed and our toiletries hadn't been replenished - but they took our $2 tip anyways.  The next day I left a note requesting the said changes, and for the rest of our stay, these requests were met.  A nice thing that the cleaning lady did was stock our room with bottles of Eska water.  I guess she saw the insane stash of water we had in our room and saw us working out in the spin room!

We also requested a late checkout as our flight didn't leave until 8:30PM, and they extended it until 2PM without additional charges.  However, we didn't want to be wandering around town, so we just forked over the $80 to extend it until about 6:30PM.  

Breakfast is served daily from 7AM - 10AM in the restaurant adjoining the hotel, Le Pois Penché.  The breakfast selection is heavy - all pastries (pain au chocolat, almond croissants, plain croissants, cheese croissants, muffins, danishes, french baguette with butter, fig jam, and strawberry jam).  There is also a selection of juices and milk.  But the Espresso machine was a nice extra touch.  It was a Nespresso machine, and I was wired for hours!  They have about 8 different kinds of espresso, along with the standard coffee and tea.  You absolutely HAVE to try the cheese croissants as they not only had cheese on the outside, but also on the inside.  I found the sweet pastries to be TOO sweet to eat first thing in the morning.  The plain croissants were also good.

If you don't want to be eating croissants every morning you can also visit Q Nutrition House which is located at the very front of the hotel and serves up protein shakes, and healthy fruit smoothies of all kinds - but it isn't free. 

For those of you who are keeners, you can use the spin room.  It is equipped with a television, towels and complimentary bottles of Eska water.  I used it all 4 days I was there.  Complimentary phone calls anywhere in North America and free wi-fi (password provided upon check-in). 

There was only one night where we could hear rowdy teens coming in from a night on the town (around 3AM).  But other than that I have no complaints!  I would definitely recommend Hotel Chez Swann and would definitely stay here again.",2011-11-23 13:42:15

Con's

Price reasonable but $14 resort fee per day is somewhat deceiving. So if you have stayed here before you always had use of the pool- but now they will give you spotty wi fi--which is way slow since everyone is on it- use of a gym, and use of the pool. Basically just another way to make extra cash.

So good time overall however, watch your nightly rate and add $14 plus tax when budgeting or comparing. They give you a fun book so look thru it -- may offset a bit of that $14 tacky fee",2016-08-21 20:07:29

Tons of space, with a nice separated living area, dining area, full kitchen, master bath and guest bath...lots and lots of space.

Everything was nice with dark ebony wood, stainless appliances, washer and dryer, and overall contemporary trendy setup.

We also had a party here, and were not bothered once.  No one was overly rowdy, but everything went smoothly, and we all had a great time.

We also got into ghostbar and moon for free, just showing the room key on a Saturday night.  Ghostbar was pretty quiet though, but moon was cool.  Another perk for staying here!

The food was still on point when it came out and I love their new (or at least new to me) buffalo mac and cheese.

So this is a final review, as I won't be coming back again.

THE FOOD

This being a gelato place, the criteria are simple: good choice of flavors and have gelato taste like gelato. 

I've been coming to this place for about 3 years and the variety has been dwindling overtime, taking a major hit in the past 6 months. There are now a good third less choices than there were initially. The fruit/berry flavors took the main hit and there are now very few pure flavors left, the rest are some sort of ""mixes"". The pear flavor I loved is long gone. One of the formerly gelato displays now houses ice cream cakes. I imagine they have a good profit margin, but may be the place should rename itself into Gelato-ish 32.

Fine, selection has to cater to the customer base and there's little that can be done about poor and unimaginative tasting pallet of other regulars. But that's not an excuse for having stale waffle cones that lack any sort of crunchiness. My last waffle cone actually required some deliberate chewing and had the distinct left-too-long-in-the-back-of-the-cupboard aftertaste.

As for the gelato itself, I could, of course, point to my street cred of having eaten gelato in Italy and it being much better, but there's no need for that. I've eaten much better gelato at this store not all that long ago. This appears to be nothing more than glorified, sometimes freezer burned, ice cream.

Another thing that detracts from the gelato is the large amount of drying/dying fruits and berries put on top of each of the flavors for ""display"" purposes. Not appetizing in anyway whatsoever.

SETTING

Nothing has changed in this regard, thankfully. The place is easy to get to and you have a choice of sitting inside or out. The displays are conveniently placed and moving around is not a problem. Bathrooms are clean.

SERVICE

Another area where this store has gone downhill. Getting a sample now is like watching nano-technological exhibition where the server-bot takes off the tiniest sliver of gelato possible so you have a chance at (maybe) figuring out its taste. The scooping is inconsistent as well, which is pretty impressive considering that ice cream scoops by nature are a consistent measuring tool .

OTHER

The frequent ""eater"" cards have disappeared with the new owners, so there is one less reason to come back here. They do seem to have Wifi now, which should help you log online and find a different gelato place to go to.",2011-07-17 20:56:56

We took the walk and couldn't resist. Adorable front window and seating inside. We split the Red Velvet cupcake this afternoon. We got back to work and before I could turn around she had a knife down the middle.

I started eating it...could not get enough of the frosting...and then, only after making sure no one was looking, licked the leftover frosting off the wrapper once finished. Awful but sooo worth it.

They charged 50 cents for a tiny tin of pico de gallo (""the kitchen makes us charge for anything that comes out"").  Tacos were nothing to write home about. La Condesa is similar concept but much better execution...and they love their grouponers...or at least they don't give people a hard time.  I paid $14 for two tacos with rice and beans. My LA friends would shoot me.  

We had trouble redeeming expired groupons. Waitress made it seem like she was doing us a favor to remove the paid value (3 whole dollars), which never expires and must be honored by the merchant per the fine print. They wouldn't let us subtract the paid value from a 2nd expired groupon ($3).  Anyone, please correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is that expired vouchers become treated like cash. Fine print says PROMOTIONAL value can't be combined with other offers, nothing about expired PAID values.  Manager (Missy) said she didn't have any written groupon contract in the restaurant (why not?) so I showed her the fine print on my phone.  Acknowledges what she reads but still insists the owner (who's not around, supposedly his name is Joe) says they can't do anything else. She said I can send him a message. I ask how do I do that if he's not here and she says ""on yelp"" so here I am!

If you're going to partner with groupon, then honor the groupon rules...or have the rules on hand to show a customer he's wrong if he is misunderstanding something! 

Missy tried to make things right with a VIP voucher for future visits saying it was a better deal than the $3 groupon.  Actually, it's not because I'd have to buy two drinks and an entree to get a free entree instead of spending just $3 to get $10 worth of food. Regardless, it's the principle of the matter not a lousy $3. Just be happy we tipped well on the original bill.

We ran to the theater and sat down to an empty house. The seats are comfortable and the arm rests do move. This made it easy for me to lean on Chris without an armrest digging into my side.

Vegas kind of lacks in Portuguese restaurants so when I noticed that Vila Algarve was opening up I had to go. It's located in the old Sushi Factory spot in a plaza on the NW corner of Tropicana and Jones. It's a very spacious place. They've been open for only a couple weeks but I don't think many people know since the 2 times I've been there no one was there, for lunch and dinner.

Opening up the menu you can either read the very delicious sounding descriptions or look at the very delicious looking pictures.  You can even ask the very friendly staff if they had any recommendations. I wanted everything and just started ordering, my eyes and my stomach were not on the same page. They have Portuguese chicken livers and giblets, Portuguese sausages, snails and frog legs, various pastas, curries, skewered meats, steaks, seafood, wraps, and desserts. I was told they use less seasoning in some of their food than usual to appeal to the people but they'll make it spicier if you wanted.

The Trinchado, from their menu were ""Cubes of meat marinated in red wine, grilled to perfection, cooked with trinchado creamy sauce and olives with pits, served with toasted bread."" How do you not order it. It was good. I liked the creamy sauce and meat was perfect. Be aware that the olives are with pits and the pits are no joke when your teeth whack it. I'd order it again. There's an appetizer version and a full meal version.

The Halloumi Cheese, from their menu was ""cyrpus grilled goat cheese, served with sweet and sour or peri peri sauce."" It was really salty and pretty good. Seems like it would be good with some beer. Eat it right away and don't let it cool down to much cause it gets hard. 

The Dobrada Portuguesa was ""slow cooked ox tripe and broiled with mixed cheese."" It was my favorite of the 3 items I've ordered. You either like tripe or dislike tripe and I like tripe covering it with cheese makes it even better. The smell is strong.

The interior is nice and clean with a big screen TV. The staff is very friendly and did everything right.

What to expect after I write this review beside my multiple check-ins and picture posting? They're in the process of getting their liquor license. They already have a nice bar area setup as soon as they get to fill it with liquor and serve it up the better. They have what looked like a setup for live music. They have a lot of potential.

The ER visits varied between 5-7 hours, both of which are actually UNDER the wait times you'll experience at many hospitals throughout Ontario. That doesn't make the wait any easier, but they seem to be doing better than some of the others. I constantly see cleaning staff working throughout the hospital and there are hand sanitizer pumps everywhere, which is a good sign that the NYGH has priorities in the right place.

The chemo unit is very busy and it's important to ask as many questions to help prepare for treatment. That being said, staff here are very quick to follow up questions and they are thorough. Of course there are unexpected delays, but I think that they are providing a pretty high standard of care considering the circumstances. Everything is clean and there are large windows with plenty of natural light. There are volunteers who make regular rounds and offer patients juice, cookies, or a pillow to make their treatment a bit more bearable. This probably makes a difference for chemo patients, who have to sit there for 3-5 hours for most treatment.

I think it's critical to point out that any discrepancies in service don't reflect on the hospital. There are hundreds of people working here and they have very stressful jobs for the most part. Based on that consideration, I think they are very professional and provide quality care for the most part. There are anomalies - some personnel display an infuriating lack of any sense of urgency at times, but I think that's common to most hospital environments in Ontario. I'd rather they were cautious than rushing through diagnostics and treatments. Overall, I'm glad I live in the area and that this is the hospital closest to me.

I'm not a cigar smoker, but a few of my friends are up told them about the place and all of them had rave reviews with regards to cigars. I would definitely make this a stop for gifting cigars as well,

At checkout, you have the option of having your tickets delivered electronically to your smart phone, or to will call.  There is no option to print at home.  I chose to have my tickets delivered to my phone, so I could show my phone upon arrival for entrance.  The show is located on an upper level of the new Linq hotel, in an area which has not been renovated yet.  The lobby is pretty small, so a line had formed to get into the theater because they make you take a picture with one the performers before you enter -- like a step and repeat.  Once we got through that process we proceeded to the door and I showed the person my electronic tickets.  I was told that I had to go to the ticket desk to have them printed. HUH?  What is the point of offering electronic ticketing if it doesn't even work?  Why not just have all the tickets at will call?  Okay, so I go to the counter and the people there bumbled around because NEITHER one could print the tickets. SMH.  This is becoming a cluster.  Allegedly their system froze.

Shakshoka skillet: comes with chorizo, avocado, marinara sauce, 2 eggs (I got over easy eggs), and 2 prices of bread.

Think it was a bad night for the fish & chips.  It was a small portion size (2 pc) and the fish came out kind of soggy.   We think it sat on the line too long, giving the moist fish too much time to steam the beer batter.

At that point we received a huge apology because now they could not find my name in their system. We were seated promptly. 

Twyla had gluten free waffles and a side of bacon (it was very salty). She loved her waffles and said that they were awesome! I had this corn tortilla stack with green chili sauce, cheese and an egg on top. Mine was quite good! 

Our server Belle was the highlight of the day. She kept the service levels high and ensured that we had what we needed when we needed it. Thank you much. You helped take the edge off.

The patio is quaint and pleasant aspect to the restaurant. However, you get a great view of the parking lot (good people watching). There are some cool stores nearby and Costco is just up the road. Would I come back? The answer is yes. However, I want to see my name on the list prior to heading to the waiting area.

Soup dumplings 5/5. They had great flavor and were made fresh right in front of our eyes at their open kitchen window. They were not quite as large as other restaurants I had tried soup dumplings though. Would definitely order them again. 

Braised Beef noodle soup 3/5. The braised beef portion was generous and cooked to perfection. The soup on the other hand didn't have much flavor and tasted pretty bland which was disappointing and why I'm giving the soup 3 stars.

Dan Dan noodles Szechuan style 3/5. These were just OK. I also felt they lacked flavor and the portion was on the small side.

Yasu knows his fish and truly took my dinner party on a flavor adventure.

The restaurant seats under 50, so the atmosphere is very cozy and warm. We took our seats and prepared our palettes for the freshest and most savory fish I have tasted in Arizona. 

I don't know where to begin... I'll highlight my favorites

Bacon wrapped scallops, cooked to perfection. The bacon was crispy and they achieved this without overcooking the scallops. 

Red snapper carpaccio pounded paper thin - yum, melted in my mouth

Red miso eggplant (This eggplant has a much thinner skin, a more delicate flavor, and very little seeds that tend to make other American eggplants bitter) this dish was amazing, so full of flavor (It was even a hit with my little sis who normally hates eggplant).

Garlic miso clams - Our server suggested picking them up like cups and slurping the clams out so you get the full experience and do not miss any of the miso. Excellent idea.

Wagyu sashimi (Kobe beef comes from a breed of cattle called Wagyu, learned this that evening). It was served with a sliver of fried garlic and a wonderful dipping sauce, but I didn't use it because the quality of the meat was so that I did not want to cover up the flavor.

Kampachi (This yellowtail must be extremely high in fat, it tasted like butter. (I didn't want to share).

We ended the meal with Foie gras sushi and a chilled tiny Peach.  I had to give my taste buds a moment to recover from the Foie gras, just let that flavor marinate my taste buds... Wow!

This meal was excellent and our server was well educated. He recommended options we would not have been so bold to try without his prompting.

1. The food was full of flavour and filling.
2. They made me something that wasn't on the menu because what I asked for isn't being offered in both locations just yet. I was told they will offer the full menu at both locations soon. They're just working the kinks out. On a side note, the spring rolls tasted a little like frozen pizza crust. It was odd as hell.

I don't often find myself in vegan places these days because my vegan days were firmly placed behind me a long time ago. I like meat. Meat likes me. We're a good team. Having said that, I do enjoy a good vegan meal but don't know many vegans these days and the ones I do know do not eat well at all. Needless to say, I've had a difficult time finding the desire for good vegan vittles. When they fall in my lap, I'd be a fool to ignore them.

Loving Hut has an original location at 953 Eglington Ave and from my understanding they've been there for a while now. This location is brand spankin' new (I mean days old as I write this) and it looks it. Everything is bright and shiny including the staff. I swear I saw one of their smiles sparkle.

If they hadn't been so quick to help me out with a custom order this place would still be a solid 3.5/3. I think the restaurant falls down in a few places, the first of which being giant TVs glued to the walls. I find it kind of off putting when restaurants put TV in the dining space because it's a great way to kill conversation, even if you don't know what you're watching. The second odd bit is a small display of books and pamphlets about living well. I didn't have time to ask but I'll have to next time I'm there because one of them was called, ""The birds in my life"" or something to that effect. It just seemed out of place but I'm sure there's a reason for it.

Salads, burgers, pasta, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, meatloaf, Indian inspired... pretty much anyone should be able to find something here. A lite menu that is extensive and vegetarian options. I love the ""bang bang chicken and shrimp"" (chicken, shrimp and veggies in a delicious peanut sauce topped with rice and toasted coconut), their burgers and ceasar salad with grilled salmon. They have a salad with a wide variety of julienne cut veggies that is really good. I've had chicken tacos and have been pleased. I can't think that I've ever been unhappy with my meal there. My kids and husband are always happy too. To drink, I like the iced green tea with mint leaves.

Ok, the important part... CHEESECAKE! My personal favorites are the Oreo cheesecake and the Adam's Favorite (a delicious peanut butter and chocolate fudge cheesecake). I've also had the pumpkin pecan cheesecake  (the crust is too hard, we got this on our last visit and weren't impressed), red velvet cheesecake, carrot cake cheesecake, white chocolate raspberry... probably others too. I mean, it's cheesecake, how bad can it be? Usually the cheesecake does not disappoint. 

The service can be hit or miss. We are usually happy, but last night our server just really didn't seem like he wanted to be there and we didn't get great service because of it. Also, I don't like when we are seated at a small table adjacent to other tables (one side shares a long booth type bench), I feel that it lacks privacy because we can hear everything that is being discussed by the parties on either side of us.

Summer 08 I spent a weekend at the resort to hang out at their pool and walk around downtown sampling the new businesses. I am not into sushi so I have nothing to compare this place to. I will say this, they excel at turning a $50 tab into a $150 tab. Those little plates stack up fast!!! 

Your hunger never seems to feel satisfied and the owner is quick to suggest items from the conveyor belt. So you just kind of keep sampling the things passing right in front of you without considering the consequences. I honestly went back the very next night to eat here just to analyse what happened the previous night. Why my tab was $150 for so little sustenance. 

Same thing almost happened. Super friendly greeting, remembered my name. I had exhausted the import beer selection the night before so I started on their exotic drink menu. A couple of blue Hawaiians later and we began plucking plates off the conveyor like they were giving them away!!! 

I saw where this was heading and decided cash out to the tune of $70 for a couple of fu-fu drinks and some snack size portions of white rice and fish.  Sushi Eye is a fun place to eat but if you are new to the ""sushi on a conveyor belt"" game you are more likely to lose your appetite by paying the bill than by eating the food.",2009-01-20 21:39:00

The Clark County Museum is one such place.  It's an incredibly plucky museum on the outskirts of Las Vegas that is very clearly operating on a shoestring budget.  Don't let that dissuade you from visiting, though, because this museum does a better job of painting a long gone Las Vegas than casino moguls do constructing their modern faux kingdoms.

There is an assemblage of old buildings, machinery, artifacts, and other memorabilia with a heavy sprinkling of mannequins.  Oh, yes, mannequins.  This penny-pinching museum has mannequins of various eras (and many bad wigs and hairpieces) that are used to help tell the stories.  It's sincere and all very quaint but it's also quirky and notches up the entertainment value.

The Mayberry-like tree-lined main street is lined with old houses, a park, a camping trailer, print shop, and a marriage chapel.  If Las Vegas ever looked this good, what went wrong when time moved forward?  Urban planners could take a lesson from this street.

Enter the various buildings and you'll see the museum's handiwork at creating tableaus to take you back in time.  It's all wonderful because there are period details at every turn.  (It must be fun to play house here.)  While most of the mannequins will elicit giggles, there is one in the Goumond house that's a bit dramatic: a man is sitting in the living room.  His facial expression looks like he has received some devastating news.  It's like a scene from a film noir movie.

The craziest building is definitely the groovy chapel.  It's campy inside: mannequins are attending a wedding.  If this represents vintage Las Vegas then I can conclude that the locals had many bad toupees.  Who knew?  (At least the wedding couple looks good.  Whew!)

There's much more on display in the main museum building and it's just as worthwhile and entertaining.  If the Clark County Museum can do this well on a $2.00 admission charge and skimpy funding, I can only imagine what they could do if they were endowed like a normal museum.",2013-06-14 05:24:43

I promise I'll go back to Dante sometime in the next few weeks and give it the glowing five star review that it deserves.

Ginko was very disappointing, for the following reasons.

1) Cramped.  A typical sized bar, but it basically takes up the entire restaurant.  Aside from the bar, there are two bar tables that seat 2, and two regular tables that seat 4.  Ginko is not the place for large parties.  Also the chairs don't have backs, so there is no place to put your jackets and bags.
 
2) Too spicy.  They spike wasabi into every one of their rolls, even their regular maki rolls.  So, ALL OF THE SUSHI IS SPICY, whether you like it or not.  My girlfriend can't take spicy foods, so she ended up spitting most of it out.  

3) Expensive.  Even miso soup costs $3 (it's usually free).  Regular salmon roll was $6 (at Pacific East it's $4.50 and has tobiko as well).  We tried the Ginko roll, which is basically salmon, tuna and some veggies - it was $12.  At Pacific East or at Ariyoshi on Lee you can get something comparable for about $8.

Okay.  Phew.   That being said, the sushi was fresh, the waitresses were very nice, and the fried banana we had for dessert was delicious.  The miyazaki film that they were showing on the TV next to the bar was a nice touch.  But unfortunately, we might not be coming back  :(",2012-02-18 07:02:15

The food was bland in my opinion, nothing really stood out to me from the wrap, my friend ordered the chicken tenders they were hard and crunchy....which in this instance was not  good thing, because most of the tenders were left on the plate.

When the wheel on my mighty hybrid got bent by my asian driving abilities, I called every junk yard and wrecking yard in town fully knowing that it would be rare to find salvage parts for my car. Following the suggestion from one of the shops, I called Hub Cap Annie (possibly also known as ""Annie's Hubcaps"") and found out they might be able to fix the dent for $80 flat, which would be a HUGE difference from the ~$600 quote I got from the dealership. 

Located in the almost-downtown are of Charleston and Eastern, I walked in without an appointment and was helped right away. James--who I believe is the 'guy in the back'--helped to guide me through what I needed to do. He took my wheel to the back and when he came back out after 5 minutes or so, he told me he had fixed it and all I needed to do was buy a replacement tire down the street at Galey's Tires (Bonanza and Eastern)  for cheap. At this point, I felt a little bit like I was being played because my dad had warned me about being swindled by car repair shops. But I did it anyway, and after fumbling through my poor spanish with the really nice and incredibly helpful guy at Galey's (who also offered a verbal warranty and to put my wheel back on free of charge if Hub Cap Annie tried to charge me) and buying a used replacement tire for a mere $35, I was heading back to Hub Cap Annie within 15 minutes. 

When I got back to Hub Cap Annie, James took the new-old tire, placed it back on the now-circular-again wheel, and put it back on my car for no extra cost. He was very helpful and always straight with me in explaining what was going on with my wheel. In fact, everyone at Hub Cap Annie was courteous and of great help to me. I highly recommend giving these guys a call if you have any wheel problems.",2011-02-02 00:55:03

The waiter then told me I had to pay extra for the ginger root. I found that to be quite cheap. Aside from that, the the experience was really good!

Sometimes the smell of fresh hot waffles draws me in to this place, but other times I am simply craving waffles and ice-cream. I fell in love with the waffles and ice-cream combo ever since I tried it a couple of years back in London and now I am hooked - I need my fix every so often. 

Waffallonia makes the waffles to order (i.e. hot) and they have a decent assortment of ice-creams and fruits (vanilla ice-cream ans strawberries with a sugar waffle is the best combination IMO). They also have Nutella, chocolate sauce and some other toppings available. 

The reason for the 4 stars is that the place is tiny (hardly any seating space inside), staffed with usually 2 people (waffles take long to make especially since they are to order) and that parking is always a pain (street parking). I usually go at night (around 9:30pm), which is when I can find parking easily and the rush is also less.

It's definitely a grab-n-go place, with only four two-person tables inside the cramped room, which looks more like your mom's kitchen than a restaurant.

The sandwiches are painfully simple, on store-bought bread. There are two dozen types, though, ranging from the T.J. ($6.75), with honey-cured ham, cheddar, jalapeños and sprouts, to the Pinky ($5.75), with turkey salad, pineapple and walnuts.

I got the Veggie Deluxe ($5.75), with avocado, onion, tomato, lettuce, sprouts and cucumber. I opted for a juicy pickle instead of the chips the meals usually come with.

The sandwich was nothing fancy, but I received it in less than a minute.

First, the menu has reverted back to what I know to be normal so I'm happy about that. Unfortunately, the mac & cheese is now made with rigatoni & little cheese.  That the pasta was undercooked & arrived cold made it worse.  Our amazing server quickly removed it from our table and bill and brought au gratin instead. Sadly, this dish too had problems: the potatoes were hard. Rock hard. Au gratin & mac & cheese should both me creamy, soft, scrumptious carb goodness.  Both of these were huge failures. Another order of mac & cheese arrived as well & while warmer than cold, it was still bad. 

The tater tots were okay.  They reminded me of mini hush puppies on the outside. But inside, where was the potato?  I couldn't find find it. ANOTHER fail. 

Prime rib sliders. Not bad.  Not great either. No where on the bar menu did it say horseradish (or they would not have been ordered due to an allergy), and after being told the white stuff covering them was cheese, we were immediately corrected & told it was in fact horseradish. 3 sliders immediately sent back & returned without the smelly white stuff. 

The only two things that made our time here enjoyable was 1) catching up with a friend I've not seen in ages, and 2) our server. She was fantastic! Super sweet & attentive. I wish I knew her name.

After much consideration, and a coin flip, we decided on coming to Panna Thai for dinner last night.  The interior was clean and inviting.  I loved the giant golden elephant paintings on the wall and their Christmas tree made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  

The service was fine as well.  The food is what deems Panna a 2 star joint.  We ordered the fried calamari and the pad thai with tofu.

Fried Calamari - Large rings of calamari were a bit tough and quite dry.  The breading had an interesting flavor that wasn't offensive, just not something I was eager to eat.  It was served on a plate of shredded lettuce, but much of the breading fell off, creating a swamp like pile of dusty breading, very unpleasing to the eye.

Pad Thai w/ tofu - The Pad Thai here uses a tamarind sauce, which tasted like Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) and not much else.  This was like boiling spaghetti noodles, adding ketchup and calling it Italian.  The sauce was heavy, and slumped on my palate long after dinner.

Panna falls short of being good Americanized Thai food.  I prefer the authentic flavors found at other restaurants (where's the kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, galanga, etc...??) 

Bottom Line: Panna Thai is clean and inviting with good service, but the food leaves a lot to be desired.",2010-12-19 16:34:59

The baguette with sour cherry preserves is a great way to start out a meal.  The bread is crusty, yet soft and yeasty inside.  The sour cherry preserves acts almost like an aperitif; it gets your taste buds and juices flowing.

The Chicken & Waffles is an upscale take on the southern favorite.  Instead of the fried chicken, the chicken is roasted and comes with sauce chasseur, which gives the dish a deeper, richer flavor because of the demi glace, herbs and mushrooms.  The waffle is also upscale, as there are bacon bits and chives imbedded in the waffle.  Nice and crunchy on the outside, the waffle is soft and fluffy inside.  Along with the pure maple syrup, the sweetness doesn't overpower the dish, but adds another layer of flavor.  When eaten altogether in one bite, there is an explosion of textures and tastes going on.  Oh yeah, the thing that puts this dish over the top is the Tahitian vanilla butter!  This dish in unbelievable.

The Creme Caramel is so soft and silky, that it tastes like you are eating a sweet cloud.  The best version of this dish I have ever had!

I made reservations for Sunday night on Queens Week. When we arrived the customers there were finishing dinner and leaving ... at 7 pm !! Life in the big city! In fact only 3 more couples showed up that night, in spite of that the help did seem rushed for some reason. 

But we weren't rushed: I ordered a bottle of Sula Chenin Blanc from India -which gets my endorphins flowing because I always associate it with dinner at Copper :)

For starters we had the chicken w/star anise, chili and a poori cracker (yes) it was a absolutely delicious with the right amount of heat. The same could be said about the tiny, tiny Chutney prawn appetizer, did I mention it was tiny?

For main plates we chose  Crab & prawn with figs, coconut milk and mango. It tasted Burmese rather than Indian but who cares? Excellent! However the other dish was well done chunks of leg of lamb with a very flat tasting sauce and a couple of slices of squash on the side. Boring as hell, in fact I heard another patron comment to his date that he was sure ""there must be flavor in his lamb dish ... somewhere"".  I should have sent it back, but I didn't want to spoil my companion's dinner. 

Bread or Nam was not included, I ordered a la carte ""mushroom and green peas kulcha"" - think vegetarian pie- delicious, a roti and a side of very unusual vegetable bhaji, this one seemed to be a smoke flavored  Chinese stir fry (?).

The choice of deserts was an insult, a slap in the face! 
Generic Vanilla or Chocolate sponge cakes, that's it !!  And they tasted no better than it sounded the sort of cake I'd expect from Starbucks, not from a restaurant.

The Red Shed is a remarkable blend of Dive and Douche.  It's only Douche because it's around the corner from Wando's, so said people trickle in for cheap drinks high in alcohol content.  If this bar were located anywhere else, it would be a backwoods, ""everyone's packin' heat""-kind of bar.

hCTZ_gIsOx_GtEztj4SUUA,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g,3,2,0,0,"I love me some pizza, and Las Vegas has no shortage of pizza joints.  Everywhere you go here, you're not far away from some Italian pie.  Pizza Hut on the left...pizza!  Little Caesar's on the right...pizza, pizza!  Grimaldi's down the street...pizza, pizza, pizza!  CPK across the street along with Sammy's next to it...pizzzzaaaaa.  Yes, we in America are infatuated with anything on baked dough.  Other countries only dream about having so much bread around!  

When Custom Built Pizza came to be, I thought of it as a great concept.  It's like Subway, for pizza!  Build it how I want it!  My way!  Execution, ah, good but not great for me.

For us, Custom Built Pizza is a bit out of our way since we live darn near across town from where this place is in the SW.  We made the trek because I purchased a few Groupons back then for what basically was a buy one get one free deal.  Value for sure.  

Place is nice enough, room for small families, and can handle a nice lunch rush crowd.  We ended up going for dinner.  Each pizza averages about $9 each for an 8-inch personal pizza.  And each pizza can be loaded with any of the toppings that are available on the fixings line.  Wish I knew about their lunch special for $7, might have got more bang-for-the-buck on our Groupons.  Oh well.

Custom Built Pizza starts just like a Subway or Chipotle type factory line restaurant.  So don't go in and just sit down waiting for a menu!  It's not like a regular pizza joint.  You choose your dough - usually regular, whole wheat, or gluten-free.  You choose your sauce - marinara, alfredo, pesto, BBQ, or their spicy diavolo.  They you choose your toppings - there's lots available; pepperoni, chicken, sausage, ham, lots of veggie, and different cheeses.  Last I remember the toppings were very fresh, veggies looked fresh sliced and cut.  After that, it's off to the oven for a quick cook!  Seriously, your pizza will be done usually in under 10 minutes since they are of the thin crust style.  Which I happen to like very much.

Our family of four was on the table eating in less than 20 minutes.  The kids liked their pizzas, but who knows what they really tasted like because they threw almost half the list of ingredients on their pies!  Kids.  I thinks the entire process of building something of their own creation appealed to the Frankenstein in them.

I on the other hand wasn't totally convinced.  My pizza was pretty good, and the toppings were excellent.  What I wasn't fond of was the crust.  As we all know, a great pizza is built on a foundation of crust.  Bad crust = Bad pizza.  I won't go so far as saying the crust was bad, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  It was a bit bland.  I'm thinking a bit of salt would have helped?  The crust on my pizza just didn't have much taste.  And I wished it was a bit more done too, I like seeing the little black parts on the bottom of my crust.  Totally adds to the taste and texture.  Good pizza, but for what you pay it should be a tad more refined I think.  Nothing that can't be adjusted.

Another reason why I'm in the 3-star zone on Custom Built Pizza?  No Coca-Cola!  Pepsi!  Really, Coca-Cola just sounds better saying it in Italian!  But I understand with the soda wars now, getting a restaurant to choose a side comes down to what is a better deal.  

Friendly folks working, and couldn't be more accommodating.  I even asked for arugula to be placed on my pizza AFTER baking and was met with no resistance.  I'm sure this place is very popular for the lunch crowd, and for the gym-goers at the LVAC right across the way for a post-workout meal.

More so recently I've been really obessed with making Japanese fusion Spaghetti at home. These recipes usually consist of some type of meat or seafood, Japanese mayo or soy sauce.. let your imagination go wild!
You probably tried something similar to this at various Izakayas- for example, Guu serves Carbonara Udon with bacon, onions and poached egg on top.

So I've heard of good things about Shiso Tree Cafe at J Town and decided to check it out for lunch with my family on the weekend.

Parking is pretty easy here, you just find a spot inside the plaza and you are good to go.

Restaurant itself isn't that big so if you don't want to wait, I would suggest arriving a little early.
Thankfully, we got the last table that was avail and then line-ups started around the door.

Shiso Tree Cafe served other appetizers but Japanese fusion pasta is what they specialize in so you want to get that for sure. 
The price varies from $10~22 and they all come with salad and garlic bread on the side.

Ordered: Uni Tagliolini 4/5

* Cream sauce using fresh Vancouver sea urchin roe (uni) with house made fresh pasta for $22
* Keep in mind that this is seasonal as long as uni is in season
* My mom loves uni so she decided to get this, note that this is probably the most expensive pasta off their menu
* I was expecting more of a creamy sauce, but you can def taste uni in the sauce
* This did take a while to come so be patient

Ordered: Shiso Clam Vongole 3.5/5

* White wine, olive oil, garlic, bacon, tomato, fresh manila clams and shiso for $15
* This was just like your ordinary clam vongole that can be found at Italian restaurants
* There weren't that many clams and the ones that did exist were quite small 
* I found it to be a litle too bland and didn't think it was anything special

Ordered: Shrimp Okonomiyaki 5/5

* Spaghetti sauteed with bacon, onions and garlic dressed with shrimp, homemade steak sauce, Japanese mayo and bonito fish flakes for $14
* This was the dish I ordered and I really enjoyed every bit of this
* It is somewhat on the heavier side of spaghetti with mayo and steak sauce 
* Every component of this pasta worked well with each other
* I would def get this again or recommend it to others

Summary: Nice quick lunch spot in J-Town if you love Japanese fusion dishes or want to try something new. They have specials that change throughout season so check it out!",2014-04-09 22:27:04

The restaurant was rather empty when we arrived so we were able to order right away. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is located on Blue Diamond Road right by I15 which makes it easy to access. The restaurant also offers a large parking lot which means that you won't have any problem to park.

The star of Bowl of Heaven, the acai bowl, features a layer of crunchy stuff on the bottom, with sweet purple acai whip in the middle, and then more crunchy stuff and fruits or other toppings to complete.  I realize this is quite generic, but all of the bowls are structured in this way. The regular bowls are really quite large and can be split between two people. The Seasider bowl features 4 different fruits, granola, coconut shavings, nondairy milk, and some sort of powdered subsance which is supposed to be healthy (MAQ7). I can't really imagine making a meal out of a bowl frequently--I would consider it a hearty snack, but to me a smoothie is just not a meal.  I had a smoothie on another occasion, but I missed the texture contrast of the bowl.

The store is small, but very clean and welcoming, and has outlets and wi-fi, as well as a restroom (Hilldale really doesn't have many restrooms now that I think about it.) For vegan and nondairy customers, you'll find plenty of options.

When you walk in, you're VERY warmly greeted by the staff because they shout something in Japanese hahah. I absolutely love the loud and friendly atmosphere of the kinka chains because it really reinforces their vibe! 

First thing I noticed was that there was a lot more lighting in this location as opposed to the original one on Church. There also seemed to be more seating? (Not sure if this is just me though). Moving on, the service we got was absolutely phenomenal... to a scary degree. Every time we opened a menu and were looking for more than a couple of mins, a waiter would come over and be ready to take our order. They were also very friendly! 

FOOD: I love kinka's food!!!! In keeping with the izakaya style, we ordered a bunch of dishes and split them all. Honestly, everything was really good with the beef carpaccio being one of my favourite. There's a tinge of wasabi taste to it that really hits the spot! The only disappointing thing we had were the nachos that were a special for the day. I don't remember the exact name of them but they're wonton chips with shrimp and nacho ingredients. When it came, we immediately noticed that the nachos were severely lacking in toppings. The cheese was unevenly spread (literally just melted in the middle) and there was definitely a lack of shrimp. The toppings to chip ratio was horrible. On the plus side though, good thing we washed it down with all those sake bombs!! 

$5 sake bombs, $15 samurai bombs. Samurai bomb I would def do again, it's basically a three tiered sake bomb. Unfortunately I wasn't able to bang the last level into the bucket but they help you out with that!

Ordered a 5"" with oven roasted chicken on wheat with no cheese and lots of veggies. My friend got an 8"" something on sour dough. We added chips and a drink to both. The sandwiches were big with a fair amount of meat and cheese. Plenty of veggies. Everything was fresh and tasty. The downside was the limited choice of condiments. Nothing lite or low calorie other than plain yellow mustard. I went with the mustard. Ended up with way too much, and it was very strong. The other thing is there was just way too much bread. I took the top bun off and solved both problems.

We got there at the tail end of lunch. There was a small line, but it moved quickly. Service was good. Everything looked clean.

Further back, it's a Moroccan salon, through a circular opening in the wall, into a cosy den with low seating, where Moroccan lamps throw faceted light shadows on the ceiling, and Middle Eastern rugs add comfort.

Apparently they sometimes have live music, with a piano and a double bass player. I didn't see that, but the music was good - Latin dance music: salsa, cha cha, rumba etc., which wasn't too loud.

I made a reservation on Opentable, but there wasn't really anyone there when we got there (I still love the Opentable points though). The brunch menu had a lot of variety, and I ended up getting the chicken and waffles, and a side of hashbrowns (which were really potatoes). The food was amazing. Way too much though. I also liked that the chicken did not have any bones in it. It one of my pet peeves when I order chicken and waffles, and the chicken has bones in it.

It has been probably 10 years since my last visit and I remember thinking it was just ok, nothing great. And, after returning this year, I can clearly say I am not missing out on anything. Cabo Fish Taco is just okay...just don't get what all the hype is about.
We arrived shortly after 7 on a Monday night and did not have a wait, which was great. We were seated in the new addition of the restaurant (which may not be so new, but since the last time I was there). It is definitely a great addition to the location, very open with a full bar and multiple tables.
Monday nights they offer a Margaritaville Margarita for $5.00 so we started with those and were brought chips and salsa, which is corn and tomatoes.  This is the one thing I remember people love about Cabo, not me. It is okay, but no flavor. Needs a little salt. And the chips, they are chips. Not hot, don't seem fresh and need salt.

I ordered the Chicken Quesadillas with a side a refried beans. The quesadillas were good, grilled perfectly with melted cheese, chicken and peppers and onions. The peppers and onions definitely could have been cooked more. As for the beans, blah. Wouldn't bother with those again. My friend ordered the Tavarua Tacos and was not impressed. He also ordered the jalepeno mashed potatoes which sounded really good but said they were nothing great.

So, I remember why I hadn't rushed back and don't anticipate going back anytime soon. However, I thought our server was very sweet and definitely thought her service and the timing of drinks/food service deserved three stars.",2017-03-21 19:58:00

I was actually really excited to try this place. I had heard pretty good things from friends and fellow Yelpers, but Johnny Smalls fell flat for me.

The food and service were just blah. I came with a party of seven on a Friday evening and we were all shocked to see how empty the place was. This was already not boding well in my mind. We were seated and I quite enjoyed the seating situation. Comfortable, with plenty of space and lighting to chat amongst the group. It took quite a bit of time before our waiter even approached us. He took our drink order and there was yet another long gap in time until he returned to take our food order. Our drinks took some time to come out and he forgot our requested lemons even after being asked three separate times by us. We finally just gave up.

I started with the pineapple mojito, while my fella got a draft. My friends all ordered cocktails as well. We were pleased with our cocktails and unfortunately, this was probably the highlight of our whole meal. 

With our group as big as it was, we were able to sample just about everything off the menu, or at least a lot of it. Most of the dishes were completely unmemorable, but there were some good, some bad and some ugly of what I tried.

The Good (no standouts, but just ok to edible menu items):

Pineapple Mojito - A little over carbonated, but tasty.
Phillyish - Best of the sandwiches. Wish it was a little meltier.
PB&J Sandwiches - Highlight of the meal. Sad, huh?
Chicken LIttle - NIce spicy kick. Too much bun. 
Shorty - Tasty, but needed more flavor.
Jack & Coke - Overly sweet and gritty, but ok.
The FInger - Perfect chicken finger. Blue Cheese chip had a terrible flavor. Don't try it.

The Bad (just not good):

Bruschetta - Oily and bland.
Meat Lovers Flat Bread - Bland and doughy. Toppings and flavors didn't go together well.
Octapussy - Batter was bland and dried out.
Nuttin' Honey - Overly sweet and overall just not a good dish.

The Ugly (horrible):

Poona Tuna - EW! Bland, flavorless, horrible texture.
Asada - Totally inedible. One bite, worst thing here.

We tried ordering the tater tots and the corn dogs, but they were out of these two items. Other notables from my friends were that they felt the Cow Pie was bland and just overall a horrible burger and that the hummus was an almost inedible and thick consistency. I heard from another friend at my table that the meaty balls and the surf & turf were just ""ok,"" nothing they'd recommend, but not horrible.

The service would have to go in ""The Ugly"" category as well. We were roped into an 18% gratuity since we were a party of 7, but our waiter was very inattentive and hard to track down for long periods of time, so he definitely deserved less.. When we would request refills he would take forever to come by and when he did he would only refill a few glasses and leave half of them empty and wander away. When he did stick around, he was constantly pressuring us to order beverages. I understand attempting to sell us on drinks, but it was excessive and a little annoying.  

Overall, this place was a big disappointment after looking forward to it all week. Save your money and try a buffet in town, like the M or Wicked Spoon, and if you're really in the mood for tapas, just head straight to Firefly. 

This place is really not worth your time.",2011-04-09 09:30:46

The duck confit hash was delicious. One poached egg deep fried with a heaping portion of duck and what's supposed to be ham but looks like bacon! It also has this pickled thing that I guess is celeriac, taste delicious. The hash itself was like a potato hash pancake but it was a bit chewy instead of crispy. That for me could have been better.

The eggs benny had ham but tasted a bit like bacon. That was also a great taste in my mouth. The lemon in the hollandaise was quite clear in taste profile.

I ordered 4 tacos because I love to eat. Was it necessary? Absolutely. I got carne asada, pollo asado, carnitas and cabeza (i.e. Brain). I also ordered a Jamaica cuz it's my fave. They had horchata and another fruit agua fresca. 

Once you order you take a seat where ever. They will bring you a red and green salsa, a pasty looking red salsa in a baby molcajete (danger zone heat in that sucker), and then sliced cucumbers, radishes and lemon wedges in a bigger molcajete. 

Then the moment I was waiting for arrived...taco time! The corn tortillas look homemade. Not sure if they are but they were delish.

The thing that separates them from other music stores is that they have the most extensive music library.  Every category known to mankind is here and if you get your rocks off from collecting records then look no more; you will be exhausted by the rows and rows of record titles in their huge back room.

Tiny portions at high prices were also seen with the admittedly yummy garlic cheese bread that was basically four half slices of an Italian loaf.  It did have a lot of cheese on it, and was great when dipped in marinara.

Refills were provided when needed.  My mint chip shake was garnished with mint chocolate cookies (looked like thin mints) and was very tasty.

I'd say it was fine, but I wasn't as blown away as others. Being touted as the best patty ever and all that, maybe it set the bar too high. I enjoyed it, though. The crust was flaky and nice, and the fillings had good flavour.

First I got a curry goat patty, since I'd never had a jamaican patty with goat in it. I thought it was interesting and definitely brought something new to the table. It was spicier than I expected, and overall satisfying.

Then after some shopping nearby, I went back and ordered combo 2. I got a mild beef patty, a coco bun, and a peanut punch ($2.75). The value was good. I liked the softness of their coco bun, but I felt it didn't add much to the equation. I live quite close to Allwyn's (another well known jamaican patty institution) and I don't think Allan's did enough for me to warrant the trip, at least not often.

If anything, the big omission was coleslaw. My favourite item to get at Allwyn's is a ""patty on a bun with slaw""... he puts the patty in the bun for you, then throws in a nice helping of delicious coleslaw. It pairs so well. In my eyes, the slaw is the star of the meal, and it's what elevates it from good to great. To me, that's the point of the coco bun -- to act as a housing so the coleslaw doesn't go anywhere. Having just gotten the patty and a bun today, it felt empty -- the patty is already wrapped in its own high-carb breading... what's the point of wrapping it in even more empty filler? Essentially, it was missing that satisfying creamy yet crunchy slaw I love so dear.

Would I go back? I would, if only because of the extra variety. Allwyn's generally only has mild and spicy beef, and rarely has chicken/veggie. Allan's seems to keep all 5 on hand at all times. The goat was worth it since it's unique and has a nice taste.

If I went back, I'd get just patties on their own (either fresh or a dozen to go) but I don't see myself making a trip to Peanut Plaza just for this. Overall, I found it good enough to get 4 stars.

P.S. Service was fast and quite friendly. Cash only.",2014-08-09 01:36:26

Duck Fried Rice: I think they used a brown grain rice or some fatter type of steamed rice that was cloaked in their saute oil/soy sauce or whatever they used to cook it?.. The duck  strips and shreds were sparringly spread but just enough to satisfy. Another nice portion and quite tasty as well.

After seeing it on the list of best BYOB places in Pittsburgh, I thought it was time to act. After pulling a couple bottles of red wine from my wine cellar and making reservations for a friday night, we drove to Shadyside (actually, I consider it more like borderline East Liberty). We got a table near the window and settled in. The chalkboard menu was a great supplement to the standard menu and listed specials on appetizers, salads, entrees, desserts. As we read each selection, we were convinced that there wasn't a bad choice among them. We all ordered from the chalkboard menu and started with some great apps including some spectacular tuna served three ways. Entree selections included center cut bone in pork chop and monkfish and sea scallops. Everything was PERFECTLY cooked and fresh. Incredible flavors and complementary blends of purees, capers and veggies were so well thought out and done to perfection. The monk fish may have been the best I've ever had. The scallops were so flavorful and prepared by a master. The pork chop was so tender and juicy - it tasted like you could only HOPE a good chop would taste.

No disappointments at all - not even one. Corkage fee was only $2.50 a bottle. Service was outstanding and attentive without being annoying. The atmosphere is great and has a rustic feel, although a bit small. Tables are not too close together so you don't feel cramped. Once you sit down, you just feel like you're gonna have a good meal. It's that kind of place. Prices are quite  reasonable for the quality of food you get. I've paid far more and gotten far less. I can't think of any area that wasn't satisfactory hear.

**UPDATE!!!**

 I went to use my gift card from back when I returned some unworn clothes.  Tried on a nice pink top and loved it.  The only problem was it had a stain right in the middle of the front.  I asked the girl if there was a shirt in the same size without a stain.  She brought it to me and I immediately bought it without even looking..  stupid I know.. 

This new shirt has a RIP on the front middle.. exactly where the stain was.  A rip!!  I can't even wear it.  The horrible part is that I kept the shirt in the bag for about 3 weeks in my closet and forgot about it.  Their limit to return items is 2 weeks.

This sales chick knowingly gave me a ripped shirt and it all went according to plan.. I'm now stuck with a $60 useless ripped top.  Thanks, girl!!

**  old review **

I spent about $1000 on work out clothes and was expecting high quality...  boy was I wrong!  

Each top I bought was around $60 and I can barely even hold one of them long enough to put it on without something getting on it and staining it.  I've never had that kind of issue with any other piece of clothing except maybe white jeans.  The clothes I bought ranged in colors from black to baby pinks and neon.  I even had to exchange one top because I realized it was stained before I even got to wear it and it still had the tags on it.

I've washed one of my baby blue tops about 4 times now and it already looks dingy and old.  

The store is great and the staff is nice but I recommend only buying dark colors or skipping this place completely.",2013-03-09 01:56:04

$5 for a Stein of Sapporo Draft beer?! This might be the best deal in town if you are into Sapporo beer. 

Here at Kintori Yakitori, not only you get the beer special but you can drink and eat some delicious skewers.

Sitting right at the open kitchen area and watching how the kitchen prepares the food is kind of fun. Here might not be the real Izakaya experience (quiet and zen) but it is great just to catch up with your friends.

Sake Sample ($14) is decent with good pour and of course I really enjoyed my Sapporo

In general: I found most of the ""meat"" skewer lack flavour but the braising sauce match much better with their seafood and vegetables

The aforementioned oysters were outstanding, followed by   delicious crispy cuttlefish. From there, it was hit-and-miss on the entrees...lobster ravioli was delish, but the giant prawns were just meh -- a little overdone and not real flavorful. The seafood risotto was a bust -- flavor-wise, it was one-note and all of the seafood was over-cooked...plus, they served us dead clams -- really bad form for a seafood restaurant, but again they were  very gracious about replacing them.

So after a night at a fund raiser in the city, I was feeling a bit dull and needed some ol' school breakfast to right my ship...so-to-speak.  Note:  this location only serves breakfast M-F.

This Showmars serves breakfast until 11am and is only a short walk from my place.  I headed down the street and was there in no time.  At 10:30am the place was very quiet as I assume the breakfast crowd had come and gone and the lunch crowd wasn't quiet there.

They have plenty of seating...lots of booths if you like that sort of thing and a small counter to the right when you walk in.

I decided to sit at the counter and was served coffee and water quickly.  The breakfast menu is extensive, albeit simple in offerings.

I ordered 2 eggs scrambled, country ham, hash browns and wheat toast.  The food came out quickly and was hot.  The most interesting thing was the size of the food and plates.........they were H U G E!

So I walk in and look over my options. Their theme here is Chinese/Thai fusion. I see that they have lunch specials which is always good for peeps like me who appreciates decent food at decent prices. If you refer to my pic, the lunch specials are from open to 4 pm everyday. Choose an item from the list along with either Lo Mein, Steamed Rice, or Fried Rice. You also have an extra side option from a Vegetable Egg Roll, Cream Cheese Won Tons, or Soup (Egg Drop, Hot n Sour or Won Ton).

I went with the Orange Chicken (typical right?), Fried Rice, and Hot n Sour Soup from the 5.75 list. Keep in mind a drink is not included but I got water and it was definitely from their tap.

First off, I gotta say that the Hot n Sour Soup was excellent! Not too salty or bland and enough ingredients to round out the taste. It was steaming hot!

As for the entree, the Orange Chicken was crispy and the orange tang to it was good. Only thing I noticed was that some of contents could of been more consistent meat portion instead of extra batter.

Now for the Fried Rice. Wow. No, not the good kind of wow. The what the heck just happened wow. The Fried Rice was not the typical fried rice I was used to. There was like nothing in it. You know like peas, carrots, onions, etc. It seemed like they put a couple drops of soy sauce and mixed in a quarter of an egg. It didnt have much flavor to it. 

Total I paid was $6.20 including tax. I left a dollar tip on the table for the service was ok.   If it wasnt for the Hot n Sour Soup being so good, this would of easily been 2 stars. At least the the above mentioned was edible. Maybe next time I will just go with a large bowl of soup. Either that or risk trying another entree in hopes that the cook was just having a bad day at the time. Either way, I will update accordingly.

So good we ended up ordering one to go after we were done with our lunch!!! I must add this was the best part of my meal!!!! 
My daughter order from the kids menu a quesadilla; she asked to replace carne asada with chorizo; which by the way came with beans and rice as side dishes.  Her beans were great and rice was ok.  I'm guessing her quesadilla was great cause I didn't get to try it as fast as she ate it.  
I order a corn quesadilla with chicharron El King style.  The corn tortilla is handmade and super delicious. I didn't like the chicharron so much but maybe cause I'm not used to that type of flavor. It was a bit too strong.  So almost half way I decided to take the chicharron out and eat the corn tortilla with the extra toppings (sour cream, queso fresco, onions and cilantro). My quesadilla came along with ice berg salad which by the way looked so old I didn't even attempted to eat it.  

I gave them three stars because the place look clean, waitresses were kind and very efficient and I didn't have to wait too long for my drinks or food. But everything we ate including the three different kind of salsas they brought to the table needed lots of salt. I must add that I usually don't add extra salt to my meals but this time I just had to or my food wouldn't had taste like anything.  
 I'll definitely go back and give it another try. Most of all because the the Aguas Frescas!!!",2014-03-12 23:16:55

surprisingly this staple in east chinatown has survived... while the neighborhood seems to be declining in new successful restaurants.  

Their food is good.  Any chow mein you get will taste the same but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Since they use to thicker noodles to make the crispy chow mein, this makes it taste very good.  Every single time i go i would have to order their fried beancurd roll with carrots and mushrooms in the middle.  It is simple the best here.  

Unfortunately a huge downfall for this place is the serving size of the food.. Portions have shrank in size significantly over the years while the prices have gone up slightly.

I never expect a bargain when eating vegetarian Chinese food however, the serving size is almost to the point where i question if i will be full after leaving the restaurant.

Went in for my first salon coloring!  (2009 was the first time I had my hair lightened.)  Parking lot was empty, but it was raining hard, so I wasn't surprised... Besides me, I think there may have been only one other client, back in the coffee/tea room.  Again, not a big deal, since I don't like crowds.  After checking in for my appointment, I was invited to sit down in the waiting area.  I found the wait pleasant- the area was tidy and cozy, and the music peaceful.  If you like to rummage through books and magazines, or look at hair and body products (and whatever else you may find for sale at salons), you won't have to look very hard here!  You'll find something to keep your mind busy, but I like to take the time to de-stress.  The receptionist offered something to drink, which is always nice!

After meeting up w/ my hairstylist/colorist, she showed me where to dress down to my comfort level and put on a robe.  Yes, it wasn't a plush robe, and it made me feel uncomfortable, as it wasn't very flattering, but no one was around to see me, anyway, so I didn't care :)  After finding my way back to my colorist, we discussed about the results I wanted to see and feel, and she then told me what procedures she would take me through and how long each phase would take.  I found her a good listener and felt comfortable that she knew what she was doing.  I'm not much for talking while at salons, and I sensed that she knew this, but when I would speak up and ask her questions, professionally and personally, she was open to talking, as well.   I found this refreshing, bec. I've met quite a few stylists throughout the years that act slighted or mad when I'd rather not talk...
 
The results were fantastic!  My stylist didn't lie- the products she used made my hair very shiny and silky to the touch (some things that were lost due to the color-stripping), and the fact that it took awhile (from a few hours to a few days!) for others to realize that I had colored my hair back to brunette (I had caramel, blonde, and red high- and low- lights) is testimony that the coloring looks natural!  (Actually, the color she gave me is the darkest I've ever had my hair- darker than my natural haircolor.)  Many people did comment on how much weight I've lost, which isn't fact, so I attribute all the compliments to my darker hair :)

Easier to access than Tempe's Moodswings (free parking!) and none of the snobbery one can find at other salons.  Less expensive than comparative salons, too!!  Friendly and knowledgeable staff, comforting and welcoming ambience... Give Spa Lamar a try!

BTW, every first Wednesday of the month, Spa Lamar holds ""Live at Lamar,"" a ""happy hour"" of sorts, from 6p to 9p there's live music, light apps (nothing fancy, just something from the grocery, I'm told), and perhaps cocktails.  MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, if you bring a friend who's never been to Spa Lamar, services are BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!  That's right, you read correctly!  What are you doing this coming First Wednesday?  Hmm... I'm not sure, but I think something quite special is on the calendar...  Guess I'll catch this Spa Lamar special NEXT month!",2010-02-24 06:09:20

I had the wings which were not that great and tasted like they were frozen many times.
My wife had the seafood dip which was more like seafood soup with cheese melted over it. It comes with garlic bread that was also straight from the freezer.

The staff are friendlier too, though sometimes too much so. Especially when they first opened - I couldn't walked more than a few feet without someone asking if I needed help. 

They do have a good International section with a variety of options from different countries. The sushi is a very good quick lunch option, and they have some well-priced pre-packaged sandwiches if you are trying to get back to your desk.  

The wine organization irritates me so I have only purchased one bottle from them and I probably couldn't find it again if I tried. They organize their wine by ""flavor profile"" instead of white / red and subcategories or even region. I know what type of wine I like and it is much easier when a store places all the pinots in one section and the cabs in another. I miss the Bi Lo organization and discount on wine. I will mention that Publix does wine and snack tastings, though I am not sure of the schedule. 

The clerks are friendly and even wait at the end of their register when they are open and not currently serving a customer. They will take your cart to the parking lot and give you a coupon for free applesauce once they have loaded your groceries into your vehicle.

The food is also really quite good as well. They take ordinary Irish fare and simply make it better and then throw a few less conventional items (like some great signature salads) onto the menu as well. The chicken pot pie might be the best in the city and they know how to pour a Guinness. During the summer the Joyce has a highly underrated patio that is great for people watching. 
Regrettably the service is often a bit on the slow side and if you aren't drinking alcohol there is a chance they will forget to bring you your water or pop. And they are defiantly not the cheapest pub to grab a bite in. Overall I really like the Joyce -just not all the time.

First, know that you are NOT going to meet up with your friends back in the wet end after even though you said you would because The Opera House is so far and a 30+ cab ride after won't seem worth it. So go, knowing that this is all your doing that night.

Make sure the band you're going to see if one of your favourites so that you don't mind the strict door policies, the lineups for the bathrooms and the fact that you can't seem to bring your drink anywhere cause there are so many stairs.

Finally, when you're finished seeing said mind-blowing concert, go tot he strip club across the street, I believe it's Gillies. The beer prices are decent, they don't mind groups and the strippers are actually pretty friendly and outgoing in a conversation way, but most of them are not hot.

I knew there would be many children, so I went in with that expectation. In reality, the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with. Two forty-something year old women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and they shouted as if they were at a concert. They would not shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other people's conversations. Long story short...these kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life. So brace yourself for an airport-like experience.

The entire event was rather boring and full of long lines. It focused on the Avengers characters; but for political correctness, they threw in the Black Panther and the ""strong woman type"" She-Hulk. 

None of the registration kiosks were open. So it seems they never fixed their IT issues. The technology is a bit dated, and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of same quality as DisneyQuest in Chicago (closed since 2001). Seeing the Cox logo on a screen was in bad taste.

They changed the menu - drastically - and it sucks. No French dip, no salmon salad, no chicken Caesar. Had to settle.

I used to love their chicken noodle soup. Figured I'd drown my sorrows in a nice big bowl. I got a big bowl, alright. A big empty bowl - barely 1/4 full. I paid for the bowl, but I bet the cup actually had more soup in it.

Got the steak cobb. Lots off lettuce. Lots and lots and lots of lettuce. If you look at the picture, do you see the steak? Me either. After digging through the first layer, I found another layer of lettuce. The piece of steak I did mine in all that lettuce was so salty it was nearly inedible.

It's sad that Dennys has actually managed to go downhill - I guess the hill was bigger than I thought.

Oh, yeah, the service. Pretty typical Dennys. If the server asks if you need a moment SAY NO! Even if you have no idea what you want, don't let him leave or you will never see him again. Refills?

It is a local brand gourmet frozen dessert bar :)  They claim that there's no artificial flavors on their products and they use only natural ingredients like organic sugar, all different kind of real fruits & water.  After talking with Lisa R. (she was the one who recommended this product), I really wanted to check it out.  One day, I was at the local Whole Foods Market & carefully looked through the frozen food section... It wasn't hard to find at all.  I grabbed four different ice cream bars (passion fruit, pumpkin pie, apple pie & carrot cake).
I noticed on the back of the ice cream package that they contained more than 250 calories per bar.  They all looked so delicious, but I decided to not eat them until the next day since it was already 9:30pm. I didn't want to ruin my diet :-(
After trying out the four different flavored Sasapops, the winner goes to the ""Passion Fruit"" and ""Apple Pie"". The other 2 bars were too rich in flavor for my liking.

*Passion Fruit: tasted a real fruit.
                            You might like it if you love any fruit in general.
                            Sweet & Sour(exotic taste).

*All the Pie Flavored Sasapops: tasted just like a real pie!!
                                                          Enjoyed the real pie crust chunks!
                                                          Watch out for the high calories.  As I mentioned  
                                                          earlier, it can be more than 250 in calories... Ouch

In this month, there is an event called, ""Yelp Presents Love Local Nevada"" on every Wednesday from 4pm to 6pm at the local Whole Foods Market.  I'm pretty sure that  you can try out some of the Sasapops at the event :P  Because of my work schedule, I can't attend :-(.  Last week, I spoke with Paolo D. and he said he tasted a ""minipops"" at the first event. I guess it is a new product(much smaller in size & low in calories) and definitely I'll try them out.

In conclusion, I would recommend to try this gourmet dessert bar at least once. They are very rich in flavor and worth to try. The price was about $3.49 per bar at Whole Foods. It seems a bit pricey.",2012-06-19 05:58:30

I love chicken chow fun. Its one of my favorite dishes, period. I ordered it again tonight with my heart and my stomach set on those delicious chewy noodles. My first bite I knew something was amiss. I kept chewing the chicken and it did not break down. I spit out that piece and tried another thinking I just got a gristly piece the first time. Nope. The next piece was even worse. I tried to break apart a third piece with my hand and that help firm. I don't know what they did to this poor chicken but it was very cruel. I ended up seeking and removing all the chicken from my chow fun and ate the noodles only. They were actually quite good. I've got to give them that.

I also ordered another favorite treat tonight, Spam musubi. I was less than pleased with this too. There was far too much rice. So much I could hardly bite into it. The Spam was good as was the nori and sauce. But the rice in all its bulk was not great. There was a strange minerally or rancid taste. I removed the excess and ate just the Spam and nori.

You can eat in the traditional Brazilian steakhouse way where you use a card to basically control how fast different meats are being served to you and your table.

Or, you can order off of a menu.

My most recent visit I was served in the traditional style and the meat was very hot and very delicious. It was a new cultural experience
for me ( which I enjoyed)  , so I had to ask a lot of questions , but the service team were very good at answering them. They were truly exceptional, top notch waitstaff who knew their stuff and knew how to give good service. 

Some of the meats you will enjoy are filet mignon , steak, pork, and other forms of bacon wrapped goodness. There will be a VERY tasty smoked turkey spread available at your table, which is meant to be enjoyed with this super light and delicious cheese bread roll. Prior to all of this, you are welcomed to the Buffett which includes several kinds of salads , vegetables, smoked meats, rice, beans  and soup.

Not being a 'Ron Swanson' myself, the MOST exciting thing for me was trying my first caipirinha ( yes, I don't get out much), however this drink was amazing.

I knew it was bad, because nobody in my party elected to take a box home (and we almost always take leftovers back) even though all of us had only eaten about half of our plates.

This location did not disappoint and is comparable from a food perspective. 

For group of 4, the mixed chicken kebab dinner is plenty! for $30.95 you get tandoori chicken, half roast chicken, chicken korma and chicken breast kebab. This also includes two naan, rice and salad. For an extra $2 the rice can be upgraded with almonds and raisins. Let me tell you, the extra cost is so worth it as the raisins and almonds are so delicious!

I'd really like to know how they get the chicken breast so tender cause I cannot reproduce it at home. My favorite is the tandoori chicken and then the chicken kebab! The Afghani Naan is not as soft as Indian naan, but it's still got some chewy texture.

This location is really for walkers. Driving here is a bit difficult cause there is no stopping in front. Walking in there aren't many people and the staff didn't appear to be doing much as my order was all ready by the time I got there.

Then I found out that they are going to serve soupy dumplings (xiao long bao; henceforth, XLB for short), which is my absolute favorite comfort food. When I go back to LA or Taiwan, I always make multiple pilgrimages to the mecca of XLBs: Ding Tai Fun (http://www.yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fung-arcadia-5). 

A good XLB should have a delicately thin but al dente skin; it should be dainty enough that it fits in one bite; and it should, above all, be piping hot (to the point of mouth burning) and bursting with juicy broth. I thought that if Everyday Noodles' XLB is anywhere near half as good as Ding Tai Fun's, I'd be thrilled. 

Everyday Noodles's XLB is more than half as good as Ding Tai Fun's. I'm willing to bet that in a blind taste test, we'd find Everday and DTF in a statistical tie with 95% confidence.

Everyday runs on the same formula as DTF: a glass box kitchen that showcases the chefs making the dumplings in the front; pencils/paper order forms and efficient service, bright and cheerful decor, and sadly, a long long looooooong wait line. DTF is so famous in California that people drive up from San Diego and down from the North to eat there. Waiting for an hour or two (even if you showed up at 5pm on a week night) was just the rite of passage to XLB nirvana. At Everyday Noodles, we waited for 50 minutes, after showing up at 6:45 on a Friday night.  By Pittsburgh standard, this is a bit on the long side, but DTF has trained me to wait it out. In the end, I'm glad our patience was rewarded.

Other than the XLBs (both pork and crabmeat&pork), there are also regular dumplings, several noodle dishes, and a few standard Chinese restaurant stuff (stir fry veggies, etc.). Of the two types of XLBs, we liked the pork-only a bit better than the crab/pork mix. The veggie dumplings are also excellent, though not quite at the level of DTF's. For the noodle dishes, we tried both the dan-dan (cold) and the pork sauce (hot). Both are very good (fresh pasta just tastes better), but I'd rather save more room for various dumplings.  We also ordered some Chinese watercress in oyster sauce and an eggplant appetizer (cold); they are fine, but they are common place. Desserts are surprisingly good. Again, eat everything while it's hot!

All in all, this is a wonderful new addition to Pittsburgh. It is easily the best Chinese noodle shop this side of the continental US. If not for the (likely to grow) long lines, I really just might go see them everyday.",2013-03-09 04:04:24

The pizza I ordered on the first occassion was oddly juicy, soggy, and cardboard-like (pesto, cheese, onion, tomato).

The pasta I ordered on the second visit had NO TASTE AT ALL. It was like that stuff in a can from Chef Boyardee. Bland and crappy. Luckily I ordered it via take-out and was able to season it myself at home with organo, garlic salt, and onion powder to make it edible. 

You'd think I'd give up after two terrible experiences, but I'm no quitter!

Glad to come back to try another escape room and hang out with friends. Escape room was $25 a person since we did it on the weekend, after the escape room we decided to wait for a table. This is where the negatives I have about this place comes in, there should be a waiting list set up because I understand there is no time limit to stay and play. HOWEVER, there is no way to distinguish who was waiting first for a table. For fairness there either should be more little chairs/tables OR a waiting list and some little chairs set up for those that are waiting. Instead of us hovering and walking to people who looked like they were leaving but actually just getting more food. 

Also, there was the owner? (he did work there that was for sure) I assume, was in a booth that had just his laptop and a plate of cookies. He was out of the booth most of the time too, left his stuff there. Not to be rude, but if you see there are customers standing around waiting for a long time it would be considerate to give up the booth which is able to seat 4 people plus extra chairs too (paying customers because you can't play for free). There were chairs and little tables and the counter he could have used. But like I said it wasn't to offend it was just something we noticed. We waited for over 30 mins and others came in to wait too and they left. That was a bit of a turn off.

There can be some rowdiness as the night goes on, some people were drunk playing board games were really into it and LOUD.

The food here is good, I love their snacks and lattes/drinks. Definitely my top spot for favourite places to hang out. I really like the staff here though, their super nice and courteous. Can get pricey as escape rooms for each person is $20 for weekdays and $25 for weekends along with drinks/food.

- Good sound system
- Drinks were reasonably priced and I found ordering quick
- Stepping outside is possible to have a smoke and see the amazing city skyline
- Affordable entrance fees

CONS:

(She should have been put out of her misery long before that, to say the least.) I was used to going in to mechanics and coming out with a $2500 estimate. One garage employee once told me, ""...Basically, after looking at your car, what we suggest...well, this car just shouldn't be on the road."" I now have a new (well, new to me) vehicle, that was given pristine love and attention, probably by some dear old woman who maybe drove it 20 miles a week. I'm not the best at car maintenance (every boyfriend I have ends up chewing me out over letting a chip slowly destroy my windshield or the fact that my tires are balder than Mr. Clean), but I've taken decent care of this one. However, my brakes started sounding bad, I took my car in last July somewhere in Tempe, and it turned out there was a bigger issue was going on and I couldn't afford to get both my brakes and said issue fixed at once. Brakes were at 40% and could wait, the mechanic said.

I called Meineke on Thursday, after seeing some good reviews here on Yelp and finally having reached the terrified point regarding the sounds my brakes were making. Yes, at the time I was wishing I could have gone to one of the independent places reviewed on here (there were several nearby with great reviews re: service quality and price), but none of them were open Saturdays and my brakes (along with an oil change) drastically needed to be taken care of. Friendly guy answered the phone and I was surprised to find out they accepted appointments on Saturdays for brakes. A lot of bigger places don't do that, it's just a ""show up and hope we can get you in with all these other poor unfortunate souls"". I made an appointment for first thing in the morning. 

Showed up today, and Mary was at their front desk. SUPER nice, SUPER friendly, and definitely more of a morning person than me. I explained that I needed my brakes done and an oil change, dropped my car off, and my ride and I headed back to my apartment. I got a call 30 minutes later, and my heart instantly began pounding. In my past Jeep days, this has always been the time when the service advisor tells me, ever so nicely, that my car is a gigantic piece of crap, and why do I still own it, and how has it not lit on fire on the freeway yet and tell you what, I know a guy who can make sure it disappears and is found torched in Mexico a month later. Mary said the brakes obviously needed work, and my front rotors DID need to be replaced (the car is at 103,000 miles and the rotors had not been replaced in quite some time so I was not entirely shocked), however the back brakes were just fine. Of course, my air filter was dirty (I know this is usually something car places usually tell everyone, but I am pretty sure mine has not been changed since I bought the car so I'll take her word for it), and there were some other minor issues she recommended getting taken care of soon, but not necessarily today (mostly my fluids needing to be flushed). She was not pushy in the LEAST about the other issues and gave me the quote for the brakes, oil change, filter replacement and fluid replacement. It was half as much as what I had put aside for the repairs. Granted, I did expect both front and rear would need to be done, and I also made a paranoid transfer to my savings account prior, expecting the worst, but still. I looked online for the average cost of front brake work and rotor replacement for my car model, and the price I was given was just under what most websites had estimated. I breathed a huge sigh of relief and Mary said she'd call me when my car was finished. They ended up getting the job done in about an HOUR total. I was pretty amazed. I know brake work is relatively simple in comparison to bigger jobs, but still, most places still make you wait around for three hours or so regardless. Paid for the repairs, and drove my car home, sans horrific attention-whore brake noises and grinding. I'll see how my car feels over the next few days, but so far I am way more impressed by this place than I had anticipated!",2013-02-16 18:36:23

She then came to our table and told us it would be 5 more mins if we wanted salads while we waited. At this time it's been over an hour. Thinking it would be 5 mins we said no 10 mins go by still no food. She comes to tell us that he burnt our first pizza and is making us a 2nd and that they are really sorry.

I was lucky enough to be invited here by a friend who's date was very food knowledgeable.... he's been in the industry for years.  So he took the liberty of ordering for us which I don't mind at all.  

For starters we had the cornbread... Delicious.  It was so crusty and yummy on top and tender with a nice crumb in the middle... it had cheese corn and peppers in it and I thought it was great... def try it!

Next we had the deviled eggs... FRESH and delicious, and I'm not a huge fan of these unless my mom or gram makes them.  These had celery in them just like my mom/grams and they were perfect.  I would order this again.

Finally we had the guacamole, also very fresh.  This had corn kernels in it as well and I just loved the texture it brought to it.  The chips were house made, and NOT GREASY AT ALL... YUM!  you should have seen the chunks of avacado in this!  Beautiful.

I ordered the filet with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Our friend recommended I order it Philly style (at least I think that's what he said) which is charred on the outside and I always order my meat rare... LOL and of course the other girls at the table had to let out their ""EEEEEEEW""'s!  I'm not sorry, that's how I LOVE my meat, RAW :)  This was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had... Just perfectly cooked, almost purple in the middle.  Apparently their meat in the best of the best, Prime Prime, not just one Prime but TWO!  Not a drop of blood on the plate, which means they rested it.  The mash was delicious as well... and the broccoli was wonderful and buttery.

My friend ordered the ribs and they were tender and sweet and just mmmmm... if you love ribs you shouldn't pass these up!  She is not a big eater and she finished the whole slab!    

I almost ate all of it I'm such a pig.  I just couldn't stop eating!  But I did save room for one or two bites of the banana cream pie (my favorite!) the table shared... and it was great... I would've eaten more but I was STUFFED to the gills!  They also ordered this oreo ice cream dessert but I simply couldn't fit in another bite.

I almost forgot... I had two (the second one was ordered for me against my will) lemon drop martini's and they were very delicious but VERY strong... jeez I didn't know what hit me!  I tasted my friends' Cosmo and it was very good as well... apparently they are famous for these two cocktails.

I would go back here every week if I could!!!  Its just that good.  I'll be thinking about this meal for a while!",2010-12-13 16:32:21

A couple things we tried were 2 star worthy while other things were 3 star worthy.  It is definitely not one of those places where you can walk in, close your eyes, point to any item on the menu and expect satisfaction.

They were pretty packed on Friday night and for take out they were quoting a 35 minute wait so I actually thought that was a good sign.  I was quickly reminded that I am off of Idlewild road in Matthews, heading towards Indian Trail so I may need to get my expectations in check.  They were easily packed because there are only about 5 restaurants in the whole area but I was still excited to give it a try.

Anyway, here's the deal:  The girl at the counter deterred us from trying a pizza or a stromboli because she said that would nearly double our wait time and we were just looking to carry out so we went in a different direction.  NOTE:  The pizza's looked awesome so that may be the route to go if we ever return.

We ordered the meatball sub, the buffalo chicken salad and a side of meatballs.  

The Buffalo chicken salad was pretty much gross.  The ""buffalo"" chicken that was smacked on top was breaded with some type of oil-drenched breading, appeared to be plastic and the chicken itself didn't even resemble real meat.  It was disgusting in all honesty.  It was slapped on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce and I don't' think there was anything else in the salad.  I think I saw a strand or two of onions and it had some cheddar cheese along with about 4 fatty pieces of bacon.  It was served with ranch dressing.  

The meatballs were OK but the marinara sauce was tangy and didn't taste homemade in my opinion.  The meatballs had the right consistency but not a ton of flavor.  They could have used more garlic or maybe some basil.  They were definitely edible but just not amazing.

The meatball sub was everything I stated above except on a toasted hoagie.  Nothing special, rather soggy (we did take it to go) and just a little above average.  


Moral of the story?  I would call ahead next time and I would stick to the pizza and/or stromboli because they looked fresh and they seemed to be the most popular items on the menu.  I wouldn't stray too far from those items.",2013-09-16 13:56:58

- The prices at Novanta are a little cheaper (About $2 a pizza)
- Pizza Brutta has a couple more pizza varieties to choose from
- Pizza Brutta has more of a local ingredient emphasis, but that isn't to say that they both don't use high quality ingredients. Brutta just brands that more as part of their image, and i'm a sucker for that sort of thing.

After such a long delay to their opening, I finally got to try Meet Fresh in Toronto. When I got there in the afternoon, I was told they ran out of taro balls. So that means half their menu is not available. I went with the hot herbal jelly signature which comes with red beans, tapioca, and taro balls. Since they are out of taro balls, they substituted with rice balls (tang yuan - chewy balls with softer texture and no filling). When I got home (I got takeout) I saw that my herbal jelly was actually herbal jelly soup as the jelly haven't set yet. Serious....  then there was 4 rice balls... mostly just herbal soup with tapioca and red bean. Lame. 
Okay so I was grumpy because it has been such a long wait and I was disappointed, BUT when my jelly did set, it was pretty good, and the rice balls were very soft and chewy and very fresh.

The AGO is huge and there is something for everyone.  It's nice that it has everything but at the same time, its a lot of walking so make sure you wear comfy shoes!  I find the visitor's map a bit hard to follow so we never know if we're missing something.  Also, because the collection is so big, everything starts to look the same in the end and then nothing really stood out.  We checked out the Surreal Things exhibit and that was the best part of our visit.  My boyfriend was fascinated by Thomson Collection of Ship Models.  They were so intricate and incredibly well made. 

The AGO has a great espresso bar upstairs with an amazing view of the city so make sure you stop by for some coffee or tea.  I am in love with those floor to ceiling windows and shutters!  On the street level, they have a fabulously chic restaurant and there is also cafeteria type place on the concourse level.

If you plan on making regular trips there, look into getting a membership.  There are lots of perks and definitely worth the money.

Oh, and before you leave, don't forget to check out their gift shop!  They have an amazing selection of prints, jewelry, house ware and souvenirs.",2009-09-05 13:36:01

You could thank that the only place that has one grocery item that I needed to cook something was Whole Foods across the parking lot.

Soma Cafe is HUGE. Compared to its Express version, anyway. Three separate seating areas, with the middle one including sofa chairs where you could lean back and watch college football on the flatscreen, which is what I did while waiting for my food.

Given that I went to LoLo's last night, I decided that a spinach salad with grilled chicken is pretty much all I should have for lunch. I'm old and gotta watch the cholesterol, mind you. Price of the salad was $7.95, which is a little steep considering. When they finally called my name, they told me that A) they ran out of utensils and B) they ran out of bags. Which is fine. I could put the salad in my Whole Foods bag. But had I not shopped beforehand and wasn't going home right afterwards, this little shortcoming would have been a lot more annoying. Come on, folks. Be a little more prepared here.

One of the servers explained everything on the menu as this was our first time at sweet note. She gave us a heads up about how long each item would take to make, which was great! 

Like other reviewers said, you definitely need to wait for your dessert so only go if you have minimum of 1 hour to spare. 

We ordered:

Strawberry meringue: we liked this the best. The meringue was very fluffy and melted in my mouth. Not too sweet. Delicious! About $6 

Chocolate lava cake: really liked this pairing with the sorbet. The cake was moist and hot. My second fave thing that we ordered. A little smaller than we thought because the picture on the menu looked bigger. About $8

Vanilla soufflé with mango dressing: the soufflé was light and fluffy. You can really taste the freshness. I found that this was a bit hyped up as our waiter told us it was the most popular item on the menu. I found it just okay. I recommend not pouring the mango or another liquid on it as it kills the taste and makes the soufflé soggy. Natural is way better. About $8

I also ordered a caracinno. This is a latte with miso paste (to make it salty), caramel (to make it sweet), and an expresso shot. It tasted salty and sweet, but not too sweet. Kind of like a salted caramel drink, but it tasted more salty than sweet. I liked it. Definitely a bit different from normal speciality coffees. It may be an acquired taste so try if you dare! 

Food, I give a 3.5, but with the great service, sweet note gets a 4 outta me! I can also see lots of potential with this place!

A little farther from my home than other locations but it had the cargo van I needed. I just needed the van for a few hours for a quick moving project. I've never rented a U-Haul before so I wasn't sure what to expect. The male that assisted me, James, was less than friendly. However, he was very fast so I concluded he's been doing this awhile. What concerned me the most was James never asked if I had driven a cargo van before. He didn't give me a quick walk-thru. He didn't ask if I had any questions. He literally pulled the van up, jumped out and said, ""there you go"" then walked away. I took a second to familiarize myself, although it was pretty simple. Again, I wasn't making a long trip in this vehicle. Use of the vehicle was uneventful, which is good! When I dropped the van off, another young male greeted me. He had a bit more of a personality. I was on my way in less than one minute. Bottom line, their fleet seemed plentiful so getting the vehicle you want is likely. It appeared they had a lot of moving supplies inside. However, customer service is completely missing. If I were the business owner, I would be very concerned of this.

Granted I've only been 2x but both times had me already thinking about the next time I come back and who next I wanna bring with me to experience the yummy delicious-ness that was devoured and all at the price of under $10. 

Establishment is in a great location and easily seen from the street when driving by. Plaza isn't fully occupied but this place is definitely the star of the show in this plaza.  Rainbow is really becoming a second Chinatown, just a lot cleaner lol. Anyway, all these pokè places kinda have this similar to subway, but for sushi burritos or bowls, they have things you can order so you don't have to think about the ingredients you wanna add, or what I go with, the create your own. 

What I can say that really stands out to me about Sweet Pokè is a couple of things I'm gonna list out:
1. super healthy (I mean it's raw fish)
2. lots of options (at no extra charges i.e. no extra charge for seaweed salad!)
3. ability to mix & match the options to your heart's content
4. I walk away actually full but not feeling heavy & guilty for my food addictions
5. Service has been spot on every time with friendly & helpful staff

Here's my experience and breakdown of the place: 

I've always gone with the bowl (personally I feel you just get waaaaay more outta it that way) which I do the Regular Serving which is 2 scoops of your choice of protein which options include: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, freshwater eel, shrimp tempura, tofu just to name a few. But get this, you can mix your scoops; 1 scoop of one protein and 1 scoop of something different. But also before you choose your protein, they will ask you rice or salad & for rice they have brown or white (I'm brown rice for the healthier option) and even that you can get half/half. With their salad options they have spinach, romaine lettuce, &/or spring mix which again you can mix all that at no extra charge. So once you pick your base of the bowl and picked your scoops of protein out, they will ask you types of sauces, and there's no limitations. they mix your protein and your sauces in a separate bowl then add that to your base bowl. because I get half brown rice and half salad mix, I even ask for sauce of my choice in the bowl drizzled on my salad. Okay so now you have your bowl base with your 2scoops added to the mix. Then the fun part, the toppings and extra yummy goodness to make your create your own exactly that! What I really like as a unique feature is you then get your choice of 1scoop of either shredded ahi tuna, crab, or spicy crab.. no extra charge, so it's like I have 3 scoops of protein which is alright by me!! So with the toppings, I always add tempura crunch, seaweed salad (which is not extra charge here & I normally pay extra for it) edamame, & fruit (dude, don't bash it till you try it! mango & pineapple pieces actually go amazing with the combo) but they have corn, tortilla chips, pico de gallo, jalapeño, all kinds of other stuff.. so combine and mix away! And there you have it! the Sweet Pokè experience! 

And real talk I walk out feeling fully satisfied. The poke is delicious, the serving size is definitely worth the bucks you pay, & honestly for the price and availability of options, I'd pick this place over some other popular sushi burrito/bowl locations. So why only 4 stars? It's missing decor and ambiance for me. It's pretty plain jane simple in there and first time I came, it as a smell of hardwood kinda similar to what you smell in home depot lol and I'm not sure if it's because of the table furnishing they went with, or the construction next door, but it just lacks in even just wall decor, set up, & presence. Definitely it's a quick eats place for sure, but I think they could warm up the ambiance of the place just a bit  so it's not so blah. But otherwise yeh, no, solid place for me. If I could it'd be 4.5 stars!",2016-08-02 15:40:17

This is more of a food place, not much of a dog accessories or supply store. If you don't feed your dog any fancy stuff like human-grade food or canned squid, just go to your local Petsmart, but for natural food this is a convenient place to go. Could you find some dog treats on Amazon for cheaper? 90% of the time, yes, but if you need the food ASAP and are willing to pay $1-3 more than it usually would so you don't have to wait for it to ship out, this is a great local place to support.

I don't like that hotel and I don't like malls. However I will endure a lot for good food. As predicted walking through the Grand Canal Shops in search of Trattoria Reggiano was beyond unpleasant. Vendors and merchants were harassing us and when we paused to consult the directory/map an employee dressed like a Carabinieri offered to show us where the restaurant was. He walked us back towards the direction we had come from and pointed to the WRONG restaurant. Major fail. We ended up walking in a giant circle before Trattoria Reggiano nestled off in a side enclave near a Coffee Bean and the Houdini Shop.

We had:

Green onion pancake - their green onion pancake used to be a lot better. Now, it's lacking in the green onion department, and it's fairly bland. It needs salt and more green onions. On the upside, it wasn't oily.

Chinese sauerkraut and shredded pork stomach - this was steaming hot when it came, so that's good. The sauerkraut was not sour enough. Grandpa quite enjoyed it though.

Sweet and sour sliced fish - this wasn't sliced fish as much as it was fish chunks. It was sweet and sour pork, but with fish. Not particularly crispy. It wasn't amazing, but we found ourselves eating more pieces than we thought we would.

Steamed pork and leek dumplings - this one made me sad. The majority of their dumplings used to be $4.99 for 15 dumplings. It's now $5.60. I wouldn't have a problem with this if their dumplings were the same size and quality as before, but they aren't. The dumplings aren't filled to the brim with meat anymore. They're almost half-filled. They looked limp and sad in the steamer. Taste-wise, this also means they weren't as juicy or as flavorful. 

Singapore fried rice noodles - for $5.99, this one was not bad. It's a pretty decent portion. My mom thought it was a tad dry, but the rest of us thought it was pretty good. Unfortunately, Singapore noodles aren't enough of a pull factor to make me come back to a dumpling place.

Pan fried sliced beef shank in pancake - first off, this menu item is a misnomer. The beef shank is not pan fried. It's supposed to be soy sauce braised. It most certainly didn't taste it. It was bland and tasted like it had been boiled in minimally salted water. It wasn't moist either. It was slightly on the tough and chewy side of things. It comes with green onions, hoisin sauce, and fried (I suppose that if the menu says it's pan fried, it must be that) pancake. One is to open up the pancake and fill it with the sauce, the green onions and the beef shank. The onions were fresh. The pancake was hot, but it too was not seasoned enough and had an almost flour-y texture on the outside.

The restaurant smells amazing and the prices are really good! All of the food is cooked fresh each day so you are always getting high-quality product. 

I ordered the chicken kabob salad and the chicken was so tender. The chicken was scrumptious and it was marinated perfectly. The salad was also really good. I used the spicy salsa that they provided as my salad dressing and decided to use it as a dip for my chicken. It was delicious.  It reminded me of is a pico de gallo sauce (it might be spicy for some) and the flavours mixed with my meal perfectly. 

My friend added an order or rice to his chicken meal combo and the rice was really good as well. I tried it and it had a great flavoured. 

We also ordered tea to drink with our meal and it was really good. We both ordered green tea and it had a very unique taste. The restaurant had added cardamom, which made the tea have a special je ne sais quoi.

Three or four TVs are always on, usually playing a Juve game or the afternoon Formula races. The patrons are a cool mix of Italian young families out for an early lunch, the odd couple sharing a pizza, a few friends sipping espresso and philosophizing, and two or three goons in track suits and Scuderia Ferrari hats glued to the TV while playing with their Honda or Chevy car keys. 

The menu is pretty impressive for what looks like a dedicated coffee-shop. Everything from pizza to pasta dishes to even fish is served, all of it quite good.

We all started off with drinks, and all of the cocktails I tasted were delicious and high end (causing the prices to be high).  Their Dark and Stormy was amazing, and something totally unique.  

The food was also amazing, I had the jerked pork quesadillas, and not only were they delicious, but they were huge!  Often times, when you order quesadillas at a restaurant, you have to get an appetizer to supplement your meal, but this was definitely not the case at Kaya.  On a side note, their chips are heavenly, and while probably not the healthiest, they really didn't seem all that greasy and gross.  

We were all too full to get dessert, but I would love to go back and try some sometime.

Dining: 2 stars

I had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. 

When my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.

The food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.

Bar: 1 Star

Drinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.

Arcade: 4 Stars

There are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.


Overall: 3 Stars

If you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.",2012-09-29 18:03:20

Me: ""Do you have happy hour prices for tacos?""

Me: ""We'd like two orders of the happy hour tacos"" :points to tacos on menu:

We received our trio of tacos tacos, asada, pastor, and pollo.  The pastor was more citrusy than many other tacos al pastor in Madison, although it veered a little close to tasting like BBQ sauce.  Overall, the tacos were good but I'm not quite convinced of best tacos in town.

Chips are excellent, fried in house and not overly oily, and the salsa is great too (some sort of tomatillo and red salsa)

Margaritas are pre-mixed, happy hour prices, but definitely not best margaritas in town.


Next, we had the chicken mole avocados. I would have appreciated refried beans as the standard side instead of the iceberg lettuce. The enchiladas are pretty good but more pricey than other enchiladas in town by a fair margin.

When we received the bill, we were charged full price for the tacos, despite specifically asking if they were a happy hour price.  We pointed it out to the server, and she said that we were charged full price because we received a steak taco, but she said she would talk to her manager.  She returned and said that the manager would not allow the happy hour price. I was displeased because I asked in detail about the taco price, and she never said that I would be charged full price!

Upon leaving, I spied a tiny printed sign near the entryway about happy hour.  And it said ""trio de tacos"", which is exactly what we ordered!

When it came down to it, it was still one of the best things Phoenix had to offer it's counter-cultural artsy citizens. The former Willow House may not have been as spruced up as a place Hob Nobs is today, but the food was better, the service was more genuine, and the events there were fantastic. Poets had their own night, Musicians had their own open mic that drew in some of the best local talent Phoenix has today, and so on...Now...it's all just a fading memory. 

Simply put, Hob Nobs has inferior baristas, the art is disgustingly main-stream/mass-market looking, and the live music they have there is so bad, Starbucks wouldn't even play it. Their prices are too high for mediocre food, and don't even get me started on their baked goods.

They have huge tables for a large crowd with a round serving tray in the middle that spins so people can take a bit of everything and share their meals conveniently.  

I ordered the Cumin crusted lamb, and spicy green beans.  I really was not impressed.  The beans were super salty, and the lamb dried up with the overwhelmingly Cumin flavor.

My fiancee and I went there this morning for the first time and were blown away. We ordered a quiche, a loaf of rye bread, a butter croissant, a pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant), and  a pain au raisin, (a pastry with raisins...my favorite). Each was delicious. The quiche was light and fluffy (like it should be). The croissants were filled with enough butter to make them melt in your mouth. And the bread (which we tried at home) was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and delicious all around.

When we got there, they took a minute to figure out where we would sit even though it appeared that they were empty. However,  1/2 way through dinner it seemed like they were seating those with reservations inside and walk ins outside. 

The place is set up with what would be the patio, enclosed. There are big heaters on the ceilings that are directed straight at the tables. I will say that it was a little too warm and even though the host said he would turn them down, I don't think that was done. 

The waitress came and told us about the menu, took our drink orders and brought us some bread with a yogurt spread and salted butter. I did ask her if the $10 off entrée coupon could be used on the pasta entrées and I think at that point she began to think that we were poor young kids. But back to that later. . . 

To start we shared the crispy calamari ($11) with capers, lemons, chili and parsley which was probably some of the best calamari ever. It was not chewy and it had the best sauce ever! We also ordered the grilled chickpea flatbread appetizer ($9) which I expected to be a flatbread but actually came as grilled pita with three separate dips - baba ghanoush, hummus and red pepper muhummara. 

For dinner, I ordered the short rib ravioli ($24) which came with swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots and gremolata. This was the more decadent dish ever! When it first came, it had about 6 raviolis and didn't appear to be enough but it was more than enough!

My husband ordered the Casbah Double Cut Pork Chop ($27) which came with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream and a sage jus. The pork was very moist and the risotto was cooked perfectly. There were no left overs!

After this huge meal, we decided on taking a dessert to go. We both agreed upon the Dark Chocolate Rasberry Bread Pudding ($8). So I asked the waitress if it would travel well since we wanted to take it to go. At that time, she looked at me and asked if we had a toaster oven where we lived. . . Um yes lady we do, in fact we have an oven also AND we own our own home. Despite the comment, we took the dessert home and put it in the oven later that night and we were not disappointed.

The Hawaiian plate lunch.  Double carbs (two scoops rice, one scoop mac salad), loads of protein doused in gravy or coated in sticky, sweet teriyaki sauce.  2,000+ kcal, and two days of saturated fat.

I know I'm gonna catch heat from da bruddahs back home, but plate lunch here is better than almost any in Hawaii if you excuse the strange ""mainland"" menu items ie French fries or sautéed veg sub for rice.

Eater Vegas calls it Hawaiian BBQ.  Deeply marinated untrimmed, fatty, shortribs in a soy, sugar, ginger concoction, grilled and served on the bone.   Sweet, juicy, fatty; the burnt bits adding character, pulling the uber flavorful membrane from the bone and chewing it like a dog chews a rawhide, an added bonus.

Their furikake chicken, deep fried nuggets of chicken, heavily coated in flour and doused in a sticky sweet teriyaki sauce with laver and sesame seeds good eats.  Some overcooked, dry and chewy (da sauce taste better on those), larger nuggets moist and juicy.

Solid loco moco and hamburger steak with pan gravy.  Good beef stew made with fatty chunks of well braised beef (not dry and stringy). Huge spam musubi.

Pass  on the katsu, poke (previously frozen fish), fried shrimp, and teriyaki chicken (doused in sauce after being cooked).

We went there this summer with the family in tow.. lots of kiddos and lots of adults.  The line on a Saturday wasn't bad and the staff there are very quick and friendly.

The facilites are very well kept and in order and there are plenty of staff around the park to help you or to keep an eye on things.  The kiddos always have a blast here and get to burn some of that energy swimming, running, and being wild kids.

Downers are: no alcohol allowed (you can sneak it if you're good at it.. but be careful), no grilling available ( you have to bring your food already made or just eat before or just bring snacks).  If you get there even a bit late, good luck finding decent seating (for those adults wanting to sit and chit-chat in the shade while their kids run off to play in the water).

If you like fancy drinks they have you covered. If you're a beer lover they don't really hold a candle to all of the places in Charlotte to get fine beer. One of my favorite drinks is the ""You talkin' to me?"" jalapeno margarita (better than Paco's). 

Food-wise they have a pretty nice menu, a little short on veg options but it always tastes great and that's what matters. I usually get the ""That's not snowflake"" tacos with chipotle vinaigrette instead of the chipotle sauce (the sauce has cream in it).

The quality of food has been slowly deteriorating (not that it was good to be begin with!) and I noticed they increased the prices on certain items. Despite this, I still feel like they're competitive with their breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea menus. The service is like any another HK style cafe which means they're going for fast efficient service, not politeness. I have never had any problems with their service from the 30 or so times I've visited except for one time when they forgot my lobster order and I had to wait over 20 minutes for it to come. If you're having trouble getting a waiter to notice you, the call button that is on every table may come in handy. 

The breakfast has always been decent at a reasonable price. No complaints there.

There are some lunch items which are terrible but if you stick with the basics like any dishes that comes with rice or spaghetti and the fusilli then you're good. Items to avoid are the vermicelli and the steak. The soup that comes with your meal is not the best but I like the bread they give you. They're usually warm and satisfying with the soup. Don't order fancy drinks and stay with the drinks you don't have to pay extra for. The portions are quite large and definitely bigger than average so they have that going for them.

For afternoon tea, I would highly recommend the honey and garlic wings. They have lots of flavour and come steaming hot. If you compare the wings here to a Western restaurant that serves them, you'll find that the price of the wings at Firefly is very reasonable. Avoid the red bean ice cream drink unless you don't like sweet things. They don't put enough ice cream in it so it tastes very watery and not creamy at all. The red beans are bad quality and hard to chew. 

I would avoid coming here for dinner because they don't serve anything good (that I've tried) at night. The prices for dinner are significantly higher than lunch. The quality and quantity of the meat and lobster are bad so don't think you're going to get a good deal because the prices seem reasonable for them. The lobster bisque and salad aren't very good either.

I've been here when it was a frozen yogurt shop and I like the decor and what they've done with the place, very cute and inviting. The workers were friendly but I believe I saw the owner and he did not say a word. I was hoping he would give me some information considering he heard it's my first time.

I really wanted to like it, and I did when I was given a sample. 

When it was made it was then blended with premade apple juice and within 2 minutes it was cold soup like and melted not making it very appetizing. But I did enjoy it for the first 2 minutes, then it started melting. Again I wouldn't know if this is common practice to blend with apple juice but I do try to stay away from juices unless they are freshly squeezed and this was not. 

I would like to try other acai bowls and so I would have something to compare it to. Others seem to give it great reviews which is what brought me in.",2014-12-31 12:58:08

We were expecting great food but were pleasantly surprised by the entertainment we were also provided, in the form of two attention-seeking girls who apparently came back after dining there earlier in the evening (""Yeah, we got our Christmas tree but got home and didn't feel like dealing with it so we came back here!""). They were attractive (and on the prowl) so definitely garnered the attention of the bartender and chef. I *think* I eyerolled at everything they said. Really?  Fireball shots?  Sorry, eyeroll.

On to the food.  Great food.  It's sushi/sashimi and share plates done with nary a Japanese chef in sight.  However, that was no problemo since Dan, the chef and proprietor did a bang-up job.  Sounds like he's had gobs of experience including training in Japan.

Favorites:  
- Caviar on French Toast
- Live Clam and Live Scallop: Both very fresh but the scallop was a little anemic.
- Uni: Also very fresh; we got two orders and received two pieces total...so 1 order, 1 piece.
- Oysters on a half shell, 1/2 dz with 3 types:  We left the sauces up to Dan and they were pretty delicious though I don't remember what they were.
- Drinks:  The bartender was very attentive (until the girls came in ha ha).  His drinks were delicious but I really enjoyed the Agnes.

The ""Ok's"":
- Oysters Foie Rockafeller:  I thought these were ok for roasted oysters.  The foie melted and you didn't really taste much of it.  Also, they were brinier than usual.  I still ate 3 of them.  Mom had one and wasn't a fan.
- Kauai Shrimp with kimchi fried rice add-on:  I actually liked the kimchi fried rice.  Shrimp was ok.  Mom ate a little of this since she was already stuffed.

All in all, a great meal with the aforementioned entertainment.  I would return, likely with more people so we can try more things.",2015-12-30 19:20:51

But Pho Real seemed like a safe bet for tasting Vietnamese food based on the recommendations of co-workers.  I've been twice in the past 3 weeks and I'm equally impressed with the service and food.

On both occasions, I ordered the delicious lemongrass chicken.  It's a sweet and spicy dish with grilled chicken, onions (and lots of 'em), zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  This heaping dish is served with clumpy white rice.  The flavor is out of this world!  On the first trip, I ordered a Jasmine tea and on my last trip, a mango-flavored bubble tea.  The bubble tea is more like a smoothie/slushie with tapioca balls at the bottom...yum yum!  I felt like a kid again.  

On both trips, I was promptly seated.  The server was proactive in asking if I had any questions about the dishes and regularly checked on me.  My parents, who had not eaten Vietnamese food previously, joined me for the second visit.  I explained to Hannah, the owner, and she was very gracious in explaining the menu options.  After they decided on pho, she brought out the ""fixings"" (lime, mint leaves, bean sprouts) and suggested how they should enjoy an authentic pho.  No condescension or impatience on Hannah's part, I'm really impressed by that.  

The interior is pretty awesome...green walls and velvet seats. Definitely, a night lounge vibe but none of the pretension.  If you've never eaten Vietnamese food, Pho Real is a nice on-ramp to fulfilling meal...for real. (Ha ha, real pun-ny!!!)",2011-01-30 23:08:54

My date and I were walking by and, rather than taking the extra 10 minutes to get to the Ossington strip (in the chill), I suggested we pop in, just to see what the table situation was like.  We were greeted warmly, and after checking their reservation list, we were treated to a seat by the large front window.  The hostess was quick with providing us some water while we looked over the menus, and it wasn't long until our server - who, may I say, almost made the evening! - came by to answer questions, give recommendations, and the like. 

The first standout feature of the evening was the food.  We shared the burreta cheese on toasted bread with grapes, though had I known how incredibly delicious it would be, I may not have agreed to share!  Both our dinners were pastas, which I couldn't even pretend to be able to spell, and both were exceptional.  Just filling and rich enough that neither I nor Date were overly stuffed, but satisfied.  We finished with a caramel ...thing for desert.  I say ""thing"" solely because I don't recall in the slightest how to spell it.  Our partnering wine was also lovely; I'm a red girl, so there was certainly no lack of options for me!

The second standout was the service.  It was a Sunday night, which has at times spelled disaster in the service department.  Not the case last night!  Our server was so enthusiastic and passionate about the food, like a case of the chicken pox, it was almost infectious!  His recommendations pretty much drove our dinner choices, from the wine to dessert, and they totally stood up.  Not only that, but between the two other servers and hostess, someone was always seeming to be around to check on us or clear a plate.  And that's even with a party of about 20 in house!

My husband and I shared a four-scoop bowl. At $4.95, that's a deal that's hard to beat for really GOOD ice cream. The scoops weren't huge, but they were a nice size and the bowl was enough for the two of us to share.

We had the peanut butter and jelly, cocoa puffs, carrot cake, and chocolate passionfruit which had a salted caramel flavor to it as well. Out of all of them, I enjoyed the chocolate passionfruit the most. It was so smooth and creamy. Many of the flavors had ""stuff"" inside. While it tasted good, it seemed a little awkward because the consistency of the ice cream was so smooth. Plus, the carrot cake ice cream with a little bit of coconut was perfect; the cream cheese chunk I got was overkill. Same with the brioche bread in the peanut butter & jelly (though I LOVED the jelly swirl). 

Anyway, it was delicious. Since I'm so much closer to Mitchell's and Sweet Moses, I would probably return to either of those first, but next time I'm in Tremont I'll definitely patronize Churned again.

I came in last night and its now called The Lucky Break - great name. The place seemed cleaner and like it had some small changes that made big impacts. Good stuff.

The bartender addressed then and said ""I'll be right with you""...then walked away and cleaned glasses for over 5 minutes lol They were pissed!

Pros
One of Toronto's venerable sushi institutions. Hiro has delivered authentic sushi to Toronto for 30 years (time-line is an estimate). Of course, Ichiriki and Yasu are near downtown.
Rare fish, staples, omakase, etc. it is all here (well, except fake crappy all-you-can-eat whatever of course). Sushi FLAVOUR!
The cooked items are only a few but they are actually worth savouring. They are umami.
They use real wasabi and not the powdered horse radish stuff.
Many fish from Japan
Very nice new décor, especially if you sit at the new wooden dug-out bar. Low lights and cleanliness, which extended to the washrooms are good things.
Great service. The waitresses were polite and sincere
Not many places in or near downtown actually serve authentic sushi. This is a shame in Toronto so Hiro is welcome.
The store within the restaurant is a treat. Buy a knife, or a cloth or a book, doesn't matter they have a very nice shop of Japanese gifts and souvenirs.

Cons: 
Frankly the nori on the hand rolls and rolls was disappointing
The negihama rolls had something like stalks in them, a total no-no, just stick with fish and fine green onions please
And worst of all, certain items were an explosion of wasabi. This spice is supposed to be applied sparingly and not put on like a party dare. It darted from my chin to my nose to my forehead and back of my neck and I was in tears. It sounds funny now, but wow. Perhaps it is better to order sashimi here.
The menu has a few inauthentic rolls, but at least they identify them as such..
I am not sure how cute or sanitary peanuts acting as chopstick rests are. Is it rally proper to rest the tip of one's chopsticks on a peanut (with its shell)?


We had the Chilean sea bass appetizer, which was tasty and completely umami. Nice use of dashi flavour. The Hamachi and toro were top-notch. The rolls and certain items hit by the avalanche of wasabi were not.",2017-05-20 04:32:00

1. TOO EXPENSIVE: The food is overpriced by $2-3 per plate. We don't mind paying for good food (Customshop and Five Church are favorites), but the portions and flavor profile has to justify the high cost, and they didn't for us. We felt we were helping to pay the investors back for the huge, beautifully-appointed restaurant.

2. FOOD (2.5 Stars out of 5): So, what about the food itself? The menu was impressive, and we were excited to try a number of small plates (since you can't access a menu online, we're going from memory):

---- Beer Cheese and Warm Pretzels (4 Stars out of 5): The best thing we ate - five or six warm, long/slender pretzel bread with a piping-hot triangle of beer cheese. We'd recommend adding some salt to the pretzels and continued work on the cheese - fairly one note - but compared to everything else, satisfying enough.

---- Ahi Tuna & Seaweed Salad (2.5 Stars out of 5): This likely would have been a four star dish, but our server noted that they were having trouble deciding whether they could do it for us, and its clear they didn't have enough tuna to serve a full portion. The way its served is as bite-size portions (with dollop of salad) on small forks situated in a unique display with seven slots. Ours came out with just five forks of tuna, and at $14, it was a crazy-small amount of food. It tasted okay - I do a better version of it myself, and with about 3oz of tuna total, we were very let down.

---- Duck Quesadillas (1 Stars out of 5): Yikes. These were not very good at all. Very small portion with just a little smoked/prepared duck in each one. We wish we hadn't ordered this. 

---- Flatbread Pizza (2.5 Stars out of 5): So, which flatbread pizza did we order? Well, we tried to have the jerk chicken pesto, which sounded delicious. And since we were still so hungry after the first round of food (the three dishes above were so insubstantial, we had to order a pizza) we started to wolf it down when it was delivered without inspecting its ingredients. But 5 minutes later, another server came by with what looked like our pizza (""that's right, this was supposed to have pesto!"") making us look down at what we were eating. My wife doesn't eat beef, pork or lamb, and I'm pretty sure we were eating the one with bacon. It was tasty, but my wife wasn't too thrilled with eating bacon when she's so cautious to avoid it. 

3. THE BEER (2 Stars out of 5): I never understand when a brewery tries to have a dozen different beers on hand. Why? Assclown does this as well, and its a rookie mistake IMO. Find 4-5 beers you can produce well and do those only. We did a flight, and I have to say that I'd likely only order a couple again - the Peach Hefe was quite good, and likely our reason to go back.

4. THE SERVER (2.5 Stars out of 5): We were seated upstairs, and our server had to comment every time she came up about what a trek it was to walk upstairs. Well, yea, I know, but come on, don't make me feel badly for you having to wait on me. Also just too talkative -- clearly, they are still getting their act together being open for such a short amount of time. But we had 9 different people stop by our table, and obviously the flatbread pizza mix-up... I'd prefer one server, not a team.

5. Overall (2.5 Stars out of 5): I'm giving such specific notes because I want this to be a great brew pub. The backdrop is stunning, but just because it looks great doesn't mean people are going to come back if they have an uneven first visit.  Looking at the burgers and sandwiches, that appears to be how one should experience the food. And some of the beers were standouts. Work on the cost/portion size, slim down to a narrower number of high-quality beers, and make sure your servers are experienced. I started at 2 stars, but I'll upgrade to 3 stars as encouragement to keep at it.",2012-09-02 12:38:34

See the foodies in your place
Smell your food twist in the air
I'll wait for you

Eat with hands and share a plate
On a bed of Injera I'll taste
And I try Cafe Lalibela

Cafe Lalibela.....
Cafe Lalibela........

Ethiopian food in PHX!? Well this dude had to try it out for sure!  Cafe Lalibela has had the reputation of being one of the best vegetarian restaurants in town, but they also serve meals with meat too.  

Came here with my foodie buddies on a Tuesday night.  The place was pretty seemly on a Tuesday night!  Once we walked in the first thing that hit me was the aroma of the food.  Smelled pretty darn tasting if you were asking me and we couldn't wait to start!  

As we sat I ordered  a beer.  I wanted to order the Ethiopian Coffee served in a clay pot, but boy it was a late Tuesday night and didn't want to keep myself up all night!  You could order family style or individual plates here.  If you go with the family style you will be dipping into your meals with other people sharing with you.  I felt uncomfortable with that so I shared my entree with my gal pal; we ordered the Meat Combination and Kitfo.  Truthfully, if you asked me how to pronounce some of the ingredients I couldn't, but the meat combination came with beef, lamb, and pork in different kinds of colored sauce.  Unfortunately, there's really no explanation of some of what we were eating.  The Kitfo was under-cooked or raw beef depending on how you liked it and in the end I didn't really care for it in general.  The red sauce mixed with it had a hint of spice, but didn't really care over much flavor.  The Meat Combination was okay at best, but nothing to amazing in my books.  Just saucy meat you ate with Ethiopian bread called Injera.  

In the end, the experience was fun and the service was good.  The ambiance was lacking since I expected much more decors and flair to make you feel the culture and the food. - Enjoy!",2014-10-20 18:29:31

Finding the time to schedule a final Dim Sum feast with R wasn't easy, we could only come up with a weekday time and after asking for some Yelper's input (thanks all!) we decided to try Silver Dragon. We arrived shortly after 11 as we had read that it can get busy and we were immediately taken to a table. 

We had our tea, our water, our chopsticks and our appetites... And then we had Dim Sum! The carts started to make the rounds pretty quickly and there was so much selection! Every dish was piping hot and there was nothing that we didn't like. The best part was the abundance of items that I have not seen at other places. We had shrimp balls, taro dumplings, shrimp toasts (these were to DIE for), Gai Bao (chicken buns) and a few other things. It was all delicious and of course there were lots of left-overs.

Since the weather was near-perfect this week, I decided to walk over to the market for lunch with nothing but Portuguese chicken in mind. Unfortunately, I wasn't the only slob who had this idea as the line at Churrasco of St Lawrence was massive. So, when I spotted the menu at The Sausage King, I decided to hop out of line and grab either a porchetta and BBQ beef sandwich.

Spoiler alert: I grabbed one of each because I have no self-control and I'm a filthy animal.

The meat counter itself looked fantastic, showcasing some bad-ass butchering skills - the French-cut pork chops looked unbelievably good - and the staff were very friendly as well.

As for the sammies, the porchetta was a clear-winner in my book, even without crackling. It was only dressed with mayo and hot peppers so the meat was properly showcased, though next time I think I'd skip the mayo and the beef, though good, isn't actually BBQ'd, it's slow-cooked so the meat is buttery tender, but it was really heavily dressed, so I'll just have to go back and try again.

For a normal human, a single sandwich should be enough as they're served on a large kaiser and chock-full-o-goodness. Read: lots to eat for $6.75 tax in.

There are many places just like this throughout Vegas where you can get the exact same food for 75% of the price.  The only differentiation was the guacamole, salsa, and queso trio they offered for their tortilla chips which was quite good.  The main meals were lackluster beyond that.  They had lunch specials but there was nothing exceptionally special about them in terms of price or intrigue.

I love the idea of this place; you have to drive around in a giant circle to complete the loop of Glenmore Park.  It's a one-way street most of the way, so you don't have to worry about on-coming traffic.  The speed limit is slow so even if you're driving through you can still enjoy the scenery.

One of the great things about this park is the amazing view it has.  There is a giant cliff overlooking the Elbow River, and a couple paths leading down to the water.  I caution you if you're planning on making the trip down.  It's a steep slope and may be a little hard getting back up.

There are playgrounds and places for people to walk their dogs.  They have bathrooms for people to use, which is nice because no one wants to go in the bush, especially the ladies.  There are park benches to have little picnics at, and ample parking all around so you're sure to get a spot.

A side note: I once lost my wallet here and someone returned it to me.  It was awesome!

So, if you haven't gathered it from what I've said so far, North Glenmore Park is one of the most beautiful parks in the entire city.  The views are amazing, the paths are nice, and the parks are great for people of all ages to enjoy.",2009-12-13 02:51:18

I believe I paid about $24 for $60 worth of food here (not usable with ayce or lunch specials, and must have at least 4 people in order to use. Also a reservation. This was according to the fine print. What I found out at the restaurant was that they decided to add another condition. Not usable with bento boxes either). 

The interior of the restaurant looks more upscale than I thought it would (I have a preconceived notion of what a Chinese-run Japanese restaurant looks like). They have a few tables for larger parties (say six and up), and they're either large squares (with the seating running bench-like around it, or large booths. These are cute, but not so practical, I find (have you ever tried reaching into the middle of a really big square table? Good to put stuff on, but not practical without a lazy susan.

Had:

Mizuki roll (10.95) - torched salmon on top of chopped white tuna, crabmeat & fish egg with Japanese spicy sauce and sweet sauce. 8 pieces. One of them was sideways when it came to the table. I've never had that presentation issue happen before. Tiniest pieces of torched salmon on top of the roll. Could taste the torched part though. Added a nice depth of flavor. Rice was very overcooked. Almost mushy. For the first time ever, the spicy sauce actually had a good spicy kick to it. I enjoyed the taste of this roll, but the rice makes me wonder whether I'd ever get it again.

Spider roll ($10.95) - deep fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, flying fish egg & Japanese mayo. 8 pieces. Again with the mushy rice. Not cool. Also the tiniest spider roll I've ever seen. For this price point, definitely not enough crab.

Chirashi don ($15.95) - assorted sashimi on rice (served with salad and miso soup). Pieces of sashimi were quite small. Not very fresh either. Ironically, this rice was considerably more like sushi rice than the rice they used in their rolls. This bothers me.

Katsu don ($9.95) - panko-crushed (sic) pork with egg and onion, served with katsu sauce and rice (served with salad and miso soup). I'm used to the egg in my katsu don being much less well done than this. This was a pork cutlet with onions in an egg omelette. Not much sauce either. Pork cutlet was extremely tough. I ordered this thinking it would be very difficult to get wrong. I was wrong.

Salmon terriyaki dinner ($11.95) - two pieces of salmon terriyaki served with miso soup, salad, rice, and mixed veggies. Salmon portions could have been bigger, but the portion was decent for the price. The salmon was overdone (I have yet to have a properly cooked salmon terriyaki anywhere though). Terriyaki sauce had a good balance of sweet to savory. Veggies (broccoli, carrots, zucchini, perhaps something else I forget) were crisp, and the black pepper on top was a nice touch.

This was an okay experience, but unless I get another Groupon, I probably won't be back for their a-la-carte. I might consider trying their ayce (they have interesting dinner desserts like green tea tofu pudding and at $23.95 for dinner, it's not bad), but probably not anytime soon.",2015-12-04 15:50:26

I'm a fan of Downtown Las Vegas and the greater Arts District, and La Comida is an example of why.  Sitting on 6th Street, just off of Fremont, it's a great place to grab a bite for lunch or dinner if you're in the downtown area.

Sure, it's Mexican food and there are plenty of places to get good Mexican food in Las Vegas, but La Comida stands out.  The place has a look all it's own.  You'll never really tire of seeing what's on the walls, or looking at the bar which is a piece of art in itself.  There's ample seating inside, limited seating outside and when temperature permits, the entire front of the restaurant opens up to connect the indoor and outdoor seating.

Then you order and the real experience begins.  Everything on the menu is delicious and when the food is the focus, you feel like you're being served dishes created in your best friend's mom's kitchen instead of in a restaurant.  This is what makes La Comida stand out for me above most of the other Mexican restaurants I've tried.  Anywhere.  The wait staff reinforces the feel that you're a special guest in someone's house.  The attention is always courteous, friendly and frequent, but not so frequent that you feel bothered.  And don't forget the bar.  It's full and the bartenders can serve up just about anything you need to complement your meal.

It's a small bar and if you're driving down Main St. you just might miss it. They have a small parking lot that can fit about 10 cars so best bet is to park out on the street. During the night, you don't even have to pay to park. 

Walking in, instantly my eyes go to the decor. Very modern and cool. They have a Buddha rabbit, Buddha chandler, & they have little tables setup with comfy couches.  The environment is very relaxed and chill unlike most hipster bars downtown. 

The specialty drinks were not what I expected them to be. For instance, when I ordered Graveyard Of Champions.. The cucumber ice was Majority of the small glass. The actual drink was minimal. The presentation was cool but I basically paid $10 for a large round cucumber ice. 

Also when me and my friends would order the same drink, they would taste completely different. This happened with more than 1 drink. One would taste amazing while the other would taste nothing like it. the bartenders paid close attention to you though. And there would be someone who walked around picking up our empty glasses.

Now, I'm no Pho expert, but I enjoy the Pho here every time I get it (3 times now).  I usually order number 21, which is the combination house Pho (I believe).  I usually go with my friend that speaks Vietnamese, and he orders all of the goodies to go in our Pho (leaves, sprouts, fatty oil (good for the arteries), vinegar onions, hot sauce and the sweet sauce.  The combination makes a very yummy broth.  And if there is one thing I've learned about my own tastes with soup, it is all about the broth.  I've only had Pho at one other place, and the broth here is a lot more flavorful.  

As for the freshness of the food, I wouldn't say that it was the freshest, but it definitely wasn't spoiled.  The meat was tender enough for me to eat with my sore teeth (just got braces), which I was happy about.

I'm appreciative that this goes on in a separate room from the bar area.  If you've never been to the karaoke here it's pretty cool but after a while, you get to know the regulars and it loses its spark.

The bar is pretty small and it can get crowded around midnight.  I've never had a horrible time getting a drink but gender may play a part in that one!  The crowd is laid back but it can actually feel like a meat market at times.  Lots of boys staring down the girls but without the grinding of the uptown clubs.

I've had the food here a twice.  I'm a huge fan of the tater tots.  Other than that, it's above average bar food.  After 11 - 11:30 on a Friday or Saturday it gets sticky finding a spot.  Many people park across the street when things start to overflow.",2011-05-12 03:26:42

But from our experiences so far, they've got it worked out.

It's a pretty interesting Bistro-style menu, with the expected Steak Frites and Mussels and the like. But they've also got stuff like Chicken-fried Sweetbreads and Escargot Cassoulet. Pretty adventurous for the middle of Old Dooshtown Snottsdale.


THINGS WE'VE TRIED
Fried Green Tomatoes
Green tomatoes, almost too perfectly battered in a grainy breading. Too perfect, like they look like they came out of a bag of frozen fried green tomatoes. Like fried zucchini at a sports bar. BUT, they are topped with a generous helping of lump crab meat in a spicy light cream sauce. I prefer my fried green tomatoes kinda messy and pan sauteed, but with all the bitching, I've ordered them twice and love them.

Brasserie Burger
Perfectly medium-rare coarse ground juicy beef, on a brioche bun. Excellent.

Pork Cheeks
Rich and creamy pork cheeks with grits and greens, and pork rinds as an interesting added texture.

Frisée Salad
Lardons (basically, bacon) and a delicious cream sauce over frisée with a poached egg on top. Rich, but great. Not overly salty.

Steak Frites
A really nice, perfectly chewy perfectly cooked medium rare steak. Every bite edible. No gristle or inedible fat. A little thicker than a real French bistro steak. Accompanied by yummy frites - I assume double-fried with some duck fat involved.

French Onion Soup
My buddy Dave got this on our man-date. Looked great. He said it was.

Shrimp with Grits
See above.


SERVICE
Whatever. Took our orders, served our food well. No hiccups.


Really looking forward to trying the Vietnamese sammich - bahn mi, among other things. 

All in all, I think they're on the right track. Hopefully they can survive the Southbridge curse.


Nice that it's within bike riding distance for us too. Added to the wonderful Cafe Monarch, Old Town is gettin good :-)

As an avid viewer of Top Chef and all Top Chef inspired shows (yes, even Just Desserts and even Life After Top Chef so help me God), no contestant ever hit that special combination of ""oh he seems like a cool guy"" and ""I mean yeah, if I was gay or a woman, I'd totally!"" the way Angelo did.   Needless to say, the possibility of running into this rare man crush species altogether combined with some of the outstanding reviews this place has received from Yelpers I trust wholeheartedly and I was excited.    Then I ate there.

I met a friend at the bar and she had already started with an appetizer of meatballs (which conveniently were already devoured and all evidence removed).   She did tell me they were delicious, which raised my anticipation even further.   Ever since trying Comme Ca's excellent happy hour and their specialty drinks menu, my fear of specialty cocktails has subsided a bit and I figured who else to trust with my specialty cocktail needs than Angelo!  Started with the Sake Sangria.   It was good.  Really good.   Though I must say the best Sake Sangria I've had yet is still Bachi Burger, so in that sense it was a slight disappointment, but still worth ordering.   While waiting for some food I also ended up trying The Raven and the Poppy Sling.  I found them okay, but they didn't really hit the mark for me completely on either taste nor strength of alcohol.  Sort of regretted not just sticking with a whiskey and coke to be honest.   Back to square one on the specialty drink thing I guess.

Still having high hopes for the food, we received the following:  Crispy Pork Dumplings, Chicken Wings, Quinoa Fried Rice with Pineapple, a side of fries and a side of Shishito peppers.   Sadly nothing really excited me.  The Pork Dumplings were fine, but didn't really stand out to me any more than ones I could get at TGI Fridays.  The wings were similar for me, in that they tasted okay, but they seriously just tasted like the Pizza Hut/Wingstreet Asian BBQ wings.   I'm going to go out on a limb and say that was not the desired result.  The quinoa fried rice is raved about on here and was probably the item I was most looking forward to, and yet I found it overly sweet and barely finished half of the plate.  All I can remember of the flavor was that yup, I tasted pineapple all right.  Shishito peppers offered nothing new, and the fries were par for the course as well.   I will say I did enjoy the kim chee dipping sauce quite a bit, especially the more I had of it.

On the plus side, the service for the most part was exceptional.  The two bartenders worked their asses off making sure all the ladies were getting their free glasses of champagne during happy hour, and angelo himself stopped by to ask how everything was and true to character I lied and said everything was great.   It was already over by that point.  Now my man crush heart has only room for Gosling (I know the Gosling thing is tired, but I just cant shake this feeling)",2013-07-26 19:38:07

Anywhoo, this location is cleaner than the rest. My sister who came to visit swore this place had the best breakfast burrito. It was way passed 1 AM , she was drunk and hungry. I did have to admit that cold winter night the burrito was good. 
Then we tried to recreate that moment couple months down the road..and the verdict was quite the opposite. 
Something happened to the cheap magic of the breakfast burrito. It was awful this time around. The meat and potatoes were so overcooked and salty. You couldn't taste the fluffy egg. The whole thing was a flop. Will not return as it was simple a one hit wonder.",2010-02-10 19:26:11

Having previously lived in the Distillery, this was my go-to caffeine joint.  During the summer if you go early enough, it is great to sit outside on their patio.  If it's too cold, it's cozy on the mezzanine overlooking the first floor.  Second choice is the top floor proper.  Lastly, the ground floor.  This brings me to the lay out problem.

Because Balzac's is in a tourist attraction, it gets very busy.  The lines pose a problem because they obstruct one's pathway to pick up a beverage from the barista and  to access the cream, sugar, and lids station.  If you are sitting at a ground floor table closest to the counter, you are afforded a view of a sea of buttocks as others wait in the line then try to squeeze by after they pay.  And then there is the stairway - another issue with unsteady patrons climbing with very hot beverages whilst others attempt to exit.  It can go wrong oh so easily.  

In peek tourist times, it is almost impossible to grab a quick coffee and get on with your day.  And that is why, despite the fact that I love Balzac's, I cannot give it five out of five.  Its own popularity is its downfall.",2011-10-17 23:20:36

I took my visiting friend here for Sunday brunch this past weekend and there were some ups and downs. Our server with an endearing KY accent was very warm and accommodating; even giving my friend a free cranberry juice. She always had a smile so that was really nice. However, there was only one other table and it did take a long time to get our food. 

This is a fancier place with some nice decor, so the prices definitely reflected this. The entire brunch menu had some nice choices but nothing under $14! Portions are medium sized for me, but my friend finished hers in all of 3 minutes... I was REALLY looking forward to those chocolate chip beignets but they were more like regular doughnuts; not puffy and light at all. Still great tasting but...not beignets. Also, Since all 3 of us ordered a brunch menu entree that includes beignets, I feel like we each should have gotten a small plate of 2 or something instead of 1 each. Our server did give us 4 in all (she mentioned it was an extra) so next time, I might not even go for these beignets. 
My fellow brunch mates thought everything tasted really good but I felt like my dish was a little blah. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was not seasoned at all! The batter was too light and wrong for this breakfast dish. I recommend against this dish here.

Anyways, it's a higher end restaurant in Murrysville and opens up a few more options for locals. I might check out the dinner options in the future.",2017-05-23 13:53:21

I've been a frequent customer at the original Times Square on Deer Valley road for the last seven years.  Although in all honesty, I usually get the same thing. Oh, I've tried the pasta (terrific), the pizza (excellent), Happy Hour (awesome value), breakfast (amazing) but my favorite is and probably always will be the Italian Super Sub (or Hot Italian, if you will-not that I am). This is one of the BEST sandwiches in town, stuffed with high quality meats and veggies and it's exactly like the version on Deer Valley.

Not only is the food the same high quality, but the restaurant has the exact same vibe and fixtures as Deer Valley.  It's awesome to see a local restaurant have enough success at one location and be able to have a second one that is about twice the size-plenty of room for everyone so don't be shy.

Great central North Valley location at 7th Street next to Goodwill (used to be an Osco Drug back in the day).  If you haven't been to either of the Times Squares (or as the PetSmart peeps called it, The Truck Stop), you really owe it to yourself to try it.  Fantastic Italian food.",2014-07-06 23:48:40

It was very clean with just the right amount of lighting to be comfortable. I ordered a cocktail and wings. I consider myself to be a wing connoisseur willing to drive for miles to feast on some of the best wings in the valley. These were some of the best wings I've tasted and give Bricks and Cogburn's a run for their money. According to my server, they are baked, fried, and then grilled.  They had just the right amount of spice with a slight mild smokiness that made me think they were cooked over mesquite. The pizza also came highly recommended and looked good but I will save that for another trip.

It was mediocre and I know many other things I have had at Havana Cafe are much better.

Though I won't be sold on the vegan band wagon since I love my meats as well. This place is the bees knees for making veggies taste good.

This place is not like those Chinese vegetarians where you get non-meat products  that tastes like meat or other vegetarian restaurant that put spices to infinitum which is just an exercise of masking the flavours. 

Warning: do not come here hungry. Your wallet would regret it. However, if you 

The food in this place brings out the natural flavour of the ingredients which alone would be blah. However when you combine it together, the ingredients dance around your taste buds giving a much more fulfilling experience. 

The staff here is more attentive  than the Newmarket location. So that's a welcome bonus. They were considerate enough to even split our drink into two cups so we can share a relatively pricy compared to other places  cherry berry shake. 

One other nice thing about this place is they have their recipe book on display which they allowed us to read.  It was quite fun to look at how they make their stuff while savouring it.

Perusing through it on the work that is needed to make their food and then comparing it to the prices you are paying, I find that it is well worth it. It is a lot of effort and prep work to get their base ingredients which have a limited shelf life. 

So what did we have today. 

Cherry berry shake. A mix of cherries, bananas, avocado, goji berry, maple syrup, vanilla and almond extract  in an almond milk base.  Their shakes feel satisfying you need to have one in order to feel full in the end along with their main entree...

In which case we had the Pad Thai and Quessadillas. For those, do not expect more than the relative shape to match the name.  They taste unique.  You know they're veggies and there isn't a hint of meat in the flavor at all.  The portion of each entree is good only for one person so it's good we ordered two entrees.

We also had the watermelon salad.  Unfortunately that was a major miss for us.  The arugula was just way too strong that the rest of the watermelon couldn't counteract it.  However, I am not factoring it n this review, because the first time I went we had the Nori maki which was a very tasty appetizer.

Shortly after eating the food here, I do feel a bit cleansed.

Also considering I ate the food 3 hours ago, at the end I didn't feel *full*, but I am not hungry at this time.

From all of the anime characters outside, one might think that it is a video or anime or comic store, but it clearly has ""ramen & Teriyaki"" after Anime. The restaurant is still in its soft opening phase of operation, so business is still relatively slow and there is a 25%off soft opening promotion.

When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by two uber cute and very cheerful waitresses.  The place was empty, but nicely decorated (although the waitress said it looks like a pho restaurant - a nicely decorated new pho restaurant) with many anime paintings or art works on the wall, so I basically picked where I like to be seated.

The menu has a comic strip look to it, a nice touch.  

After checking out the menu, I opted to try Karaage Chicken Wings and Tonkotsu Ramen. The chicken wings were fried perfectly, but it was served with ketchup, which I thought was untraditional (chicken karaage is also traditionally boneless).  I think a simple wedge of lemon would have been a better choice.

The Tonkotsu Ramen (they source the ramen from the same purveyor that supplies Monta and Big Wong), but the noodle was not prepared as well as those served at Monta on my 1st visit. But I also don't think they hired a ramen chef directly from Japan either. For now Monta's ramen is still better than the ones served here.

Finished the meal with Tempura Ice Cream.  It is a good size, not the small ones served at the AYCE sushi places. But the waitress told me to try their Honey Toast, which she said was not as sweet as the ones served upstairs at Ichiza (I could not remember if I ordered that there or not, but will see about getting this on my next visit).

Ordered the Tom Yum Chicken Ramen (9-18-11) and the ramen was cooked a lot better tonight.  The broth was yummy and maybe a 3 spicy level. Different waitresses, not as talkative but still very pretty, so still a positive experience.

Decor/Ambiance: 4/5  Definitely sticking to the theme, although there are still a lot of room to go in the decorating department, such as Anime-related items as decoration on the tables (under a sheet of protective glass of course), photos of cosplayers that dine at the restaurant, anime figures, etc.  Even some of the waitresses are dressed in maid outfits like in some Anime, although some only donned anime-colored wigs and graphic tees. 

Service:  4.5/5  Very friendly, energetic, and attentive. (I definitely gave an extra star for this, although your mileage may vary depending on the waitress, your youthful good looks and AXE application)

Food:  3.5/5  Some items still need fine tuning, but that is to be expected for a new restaurant in the soft opening phase.  Would suggest serving more soup in the ramen, lemon wedge or alternative dipping sauce for the fried wings, serving the ramen WITHOUT the spoon already in the bowl.

Alcohol:  Will be on the menu once the proper licensing and other requirements are in order.

Price:  2.5/5  All items are under $10. Ramen (san the 25% soft opening discount) is priced higher than Monta, but comes with 1/2 shoyu boiled egg. Personally I think at the 25% off price, it is a competitive Japanese casual comfort food dining spot, but a harder sell without.

Value: 2-3/5  Not going to win any Best Deals in LV awards, but will not break the wallet either.

Location:  5/5  Very centrally located in Chinatown, not that far down the street from the Palazzo, Wynn, and Treasure Island. Just downstairs from Ichiza and a few doors down from Yagyu.

Parking:  You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya punk????

Final thoughts:  This could possibly be a great ""wotaku"" hangout in Las Vegas or just a nice friendly place to chill out and watch whatever Anime they happened to have on at the time. Waitresses are definitely the friendliest I have encountered around LV.  Have yet to wait for a table, and the place is larger and seats more people than Monta.

Note:  Accepts debit cards and only MasterCard at the moment, which hopefully will change after Chase card processing is also approved.

As of Oct 3, 2011, there are no more 25% grand opening discount.",2011-09-18 22:33:54

Abuelos is one of those chains, that if you didn't specifically tell me I probably wouldn't know it was a chain. They serve a little bit higher end Mexican food... kind of like if Garcia's had a wealthier older brother. The decor is really nice and inviting... complete with the vaulted and painted ceilings, which I'm always a sucker for (I know, I'm easy to please). 

The food isn't an A+... it's more like a solid B, but it's a consistent B. There are a couple of dishes that I get on a regular basis. One is the steak & enchiladas, and the other is called ""Mis Abuelos Manjar"". The steak here is suprisingly good for a Mexican place... actually it's one of the more reliable places to go get a good and affordable cut of meat. Mis Abuelos Manjar is basically a couple of enchiladas which are smothered in sauce then topped with two eggs; pretty tasty. Also, I gotta throw a shot out to the roasted salsa they serve; you have to specifically ask for it; it's served warm and it's oh so good. 

I've never left Abuelos and thought I'd had the best meal of my life, but every time I go, I leave full and glad I made the choice to go there. 

As a sidenote, if you go to this Chandler location, ask for Theresa... she's a fun waitress.

The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  

The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.  

Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)",2011-05-17 17:03:33

This is good if you want to eat here without being in a smoking section.  I've had some good sandwiches and burgers here, but the food has been inconsistent.  My initial visits had me enjoying juicy burgers with lots of toppings, yet my recent visits have given me nothing more than dry sandwiches that were lacking in flavor.  If the bread has more flavor than the chicken...

Unfortunately, the service here does nothing to help the experience when you get a bad dish.  In my experience I've spent just as much time waiting as I have eating, and that's made worse when the food isn't satisfying.  I've only ever been here during lunch, and there really is not a lunch crowd.  Perhaps another table of guests and a few people at the bar, but that's all.  I'm not really sure why everything takes so long.  

During my last visit we were sitting for a half hour after having our orders taken, and the food was nowhere to be seen.  I went inside to ask how much longer our food would be, but I ended up waiting at the bar.  There was no one behind the bar and I wasn't sure where our waitress was.

Hot steamed bun has enough juice and the peel is thin enough,  but the minced pork's texture feels like it had been used to make a broth.  Tables are way too close together,  so everytime a waitress tries to reach a neighboring table of ours,  she pushes our chairs. Worse off,  there are two different tables around us and she needs two separate aisles! This means that she runs her greasy hands to dabble on our down winter coats while she pushes our chairs took get through the non-fire-compliant aisles.  She passes her dishes and hot soups in the air over the heads of the kids in my family.  Brocolli in egg dish not cooked through.  Bean tips over aged, very tough.

I had a lot of expectation for this place. Called Greenhouse, and me being a vegetarian, I was sure this would be up my alley.

It's good here. I won't be so bold as to say that it sucks, it doesn't. But for a place that has OBVIOUSLY taken a lot of thought and time into planning a stellar establishment, I wanted more. 

I have to say I was there with a friend who is also a manager of a downtown fine dining spot, so we did get some attention that may or may not have been the same otherwise. 
That being said, our service was nice and friendly. She did forget a drink refill at one point, but whatever.

We started with appetizers...decent.
The bread was nothing spectacular, I would venture to say it was on the bland side and prepared poorly. Hard to do with bread, but it was the case. And honestly, it was. Even my husband mentioned something about how it wasn't that good. Bummer.

The main course was something along the lines of a veggie medley. I can't exactly recall. All I know is it was fine, but I had no need to finish or bag it up at the end of the meal. It just wasn't that memorable.

I really felt bad about the meal when I left. I mean this place has so much going for it. It was a well thought idea and I see the heart in the building and in the presentation, but unfortunately the food isn't the shining gem in the joint.

First off, there is a rule where guests need to be 19+ but usually, they'll let you in no matter the age. However, I've only been for lunch so perhaps they are more strict for nighttime? Dining here is perfect when the weather is nice! Their outdoor seating options are perfect for dates or a quick and friendly catch up session! Inside seating is more hectic and clammy. 

The menu contains all the typical comfort foods that you would dream up! Macaroni & cheese, perogies, poutine, wings, tacos... you name it, and they've got it! 

Now, in terms of pure food quality, this place is just a little below mediocre. I've tried several dishes and the first few bites are good, but then you i just get tired of it. That's why I would suggest getting plates to share instead of your own meal when with a group. The works burger is the typical BBQ (at home style) burger while the fries are simply drenched in pepper. Mac and cheese is bland, and the perogies are really doughy. HOWEVER, keep i mind that your paying $6 per dish so quality is expected to no be extremely high. Portions are excellent and quite hefty! 

If you're looking for typical comfort food and you're on a budget, then this place is perfect for you! However, if you're looking to satisfy your stomach, and wouldn't mind spending a bit more at the other amazing Downtown food places, then don't bother waiting for a seat, and getting disappointed with the quality.

It wasn't bad but wasn't something I would go back to, either. 

It has an upbeat atmosphere. Everything is kind of new inside so it looks nice. There is a giant chalkboard that somebody spent a lot of time writing the signature dishes but the chalkboard is back in a corner so being a new customer, with so much other noise going on, I didn't even notice it until halfway into my meal. There's also an 8 foot picture of their lobster pho advertisement that is also positioned in a way that only the hostess pointing it out, I would've noticed. In a dimly lit place, these types of signs need a highlight light to get noticed.

The hostess asked if I wanted a booth but I was by myself so, I decided to sit at the bar. There was a guy bartender that seemed to be eyeing me like he was going to take my order. If I sit at a bar to order food, I prefer to order from a server but I've never been here so I just go with the flow.
The lobster pho obviously is something they are trying to push. I decided to try that. The price is listed as 'Market Price.' My personal opinion when a guest orders something listed with this label is that the server should suggest the price. Only after it is ordered. And, this is why...

A woman dressed in plain clothes who appeared to be either a manager or maybe even the owner because she was sitting with guests and overriding the register and accepting a delivery ( which was strange for 9pm on a Saturday night, but...who am I ). But, she casually walked by while I was eating and asked how it was. So, lemme get to that...the important part.

The lobster pho had the full shell as garnish. It was hollow but the only thing that gave the dish substance. The broth was clean and flavorful but was bare. There were the typical pile of noodles in the bottom of the bowl but the entire dish was 1. Broth 2. Noodles 3. Lobster 4. Couple slices of onion...from most to least. The flavor was right but I was hoping for more so when this manager asked me halfway through, I couldn't really give a correct assessment. If she asked me at the moment of service or after I was finished, I would probably have had more to say but asking while my mouth is full is an indication that something isn't right. 

Like I said...it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to knock my socks off. Although the dish is actually more traditional than the Americanized versions that are so popular, it was only so so. And, if the bill is going to show up $40 for the pho and $5 for tea, I would prefer to have known what it was going to be priced because what started as a so so dish dropped immensely upon learning what they value as such. 

On a side note, the bartender was a little personal with his questions. I understand a bartender is supposed to be a sort of quasi therapist for patrons but he acted more like he was a reporter with his questions. And, I wasn't ordering any alcohol. But, he found out that I'm involved in a community event beauty pageant for girls. He told me that one of the servers was competing but, I think he was trying to grab my attention. Problem is, while trying to get the girls attention that he pointed out to me, she was almost running from me. I didn't recognize her but she was in work clothes so I just wanted to verify. He told me her name and I still didn't recognize it so I'm wondering if this is the same as the price of the pho...deceiving and in the end, a disappointment like getting a Thai massage without a happy ending. 

It's a shame because the broth was good. The place has an upbeat atmosphere but the location is bad and the prices are a little inflated for being in a rundown area and getting surprised with a fifty dollar bill for soup and tea kills any good taste in my mouth. I know seafood is not cheap but I was thinking that would be the sugar on top. Instead, it was like eating a bowl of rice and after finishing, finding out it was actual fried meal worms. 

I don't think I'll return again.",2015-08-16 14:26:46

A few issues I had. Firstly, it is very expensive. Secondly, the chicken schnitzel was far from authentic. It was thick and juicy, and while that is normally a good thing, it doesn't translate well to schnitzel. Appreciated the minimalist salad dressing but the side portion could have been larger.

All that said, the beer quality is surprisingly good with excellent presentation and style. There was clearly some careful decision making in how to approach the beer drinking experience in this venue. If you can afford it, I highly recommend checking it out.

I had four tacos (Beef, Chicken, Pork, Egg and Tofu) I ate it all before 5pm so I didn't feel bad. The meat in the tacos were so tender and full of flavor. The Kimchee had just the right balance of spice to it and I liked that it tasted fresh. I was surprised that I liked the egg and tofu taco so much because I'm a meat eater! I think the tofu absorbed all the spices and I liked the strips of red chips on there it gave it more bite! I also had the donuts which were nice and warm. This was accompanied by some Chrome soda which I thought went well with the meal because it tasted light and it didn't drown out the flavors just enhanced them.

Fair time. I was expecting it to be a lot longer, but they had at least 5 auto technicians on the job and had at least 4 more cars before mine. I was surprised, well not really, that the customer service personnel at the counter were so nice on the phone and in person. The young man that helped me out today was very patient and nice. I was not helped by the woman, wish I got both of their names, was real cool too. Anyway it took that time and I was told that I was going to need to take off the oil pan to get to the leak and I also asked for an overall maintenance check out. Had that done.

  I was pissed tho. I was pissed at the work my previous auto shops sloppy job that did my transmission on my car and how it was coming back to haunt me with this oil leak problem. I had my transmission rebuild by someone else and when they had that done they sealed off my oil pan so hard that it had three layers of a gasket on it. I am guessing so in the future it wont ever drip. But it was sealed poorly and I am guessing that the liquid nails, Not what is supposed to be sealed with, was not allowed to cool off in time to have it permanently sealed so it was still leaking. 

  long story short I had to pay for another new one because this one was so tite the tech had to use a prie bar to take it off. Now that I am thinking about it... that way of taking it off could have damaged something else, but thats the risk I took and it came out fine. Anyway I did an oil change with a new filter, fixed an issue i did not know with my e break that was not looking all that properly, and that oil issue. Oh, also adjust and clean my breaks, air filter, remove & replace windshield washer fluid reservoir. It all came out to $696.20.

  I think the lesson I took away is to not look to cut corners on MAJOR repairs. Biggest payments were the maintenance on the Oil Pan Gasket and the windshield washer reservoir. It was all done at 5:30ish. Man I am still blown away by this mistake of taking it to these other guys... Thank goodness I found this place so close to my house.

If you're coming with a big group of loud and fun people that love to socialize, you're in for a treat. Ru Sans is awesome for a night out. Do a couple of sake bombs (if you're into that) or just watch all of the bankers do them. HILARIOUS.

Two words: LUNCH BUFFET. If you haven't had time to experience it, you're missing out. Again, not the most mind-blowing sushi you've ever had, but the array of choices and other non-sushi items is worth the coin. 

Service is kind of meh. Lackadaisical at best and certainly not super attentive to things like, oh say.....drinks? You might go thirst for a couple minutes, but fear not. 

The atmosphere can get a little bit tight at times. You'll be squeezing in between chairs and tables to make it back to your seat. Also, the bathrooms are tucked behind the kitchen in a long hallway. Pretty cool, if you ask me. Kind of feels like you're part of the kitchen for a hot minute.

In no time, the dogs were in my hand.  Two dogs and a water for ~$7 isn't bad at all.

The chili has beans and peppers so don't expect ""hot dog chili.""  However, it has a good taste and a nice spice.The pimento cheese helped to cool it down.  Very good.  I had asked Vic to add the spicy mustard to the southern dog but there was some confusion because I think he added the spicy ketchup.  It blended with the chili and almost made a sloppy joe flavor.

1F3bYiHBNRLEPEpTdBhMHA,fhNSa1szPhXYvtcGzPXLiw,kuJRRmmmDUXqwM6kNihXXA,4,0,0,0,"Everybody Jump, Jump!!!  Well one could certainly relate to this if they had ever been to this next restaurant.  Jump is a wonderful bar and restaurant located right in the heart of the financial district.  No matter what day of the week, this establishment is always packed like there is no tomorrow.  A few of us went there on a Thursday evening following a business meeting and it was a good thing we had reservations to this place because this place was packed.  We were given a private room away from all the noise however one could not but help notice that the place easily had about three to four hundred people and maybe more for that evening.

I had a three-course menu that evening which included the Soup of the Day, The Red Wine Braised Veal Cheeks as an entree and Toffee Creme Brulee for desert.  Despite the hundreds of people outside, I was really impressed that dinner was served swiftly.

The Soup of the Day for this evening was White Bean Mixed with Bacon Bits Soup.  Personally I didn't quite like the overall texture of the soup as it was almost a little ""starchy"" in nature.   The white beans were blended down to a puree form while bacon bits were added on top of the soup.  Now I could be wrong but for some reason the bacon bits did not taste like bacon bits but instead tasted like Chinese sausage.  As I said I am probably wrong on that but whatever reason that's exactly what it tasted like.  (Yes the same Chinese sausage that you find in Chinese supermarkets).  With no other Chinese person in the room to ask, you readers will just have to take my word for it.  The soup otherwise tasted okay as it was a little bland however with the bacon bits added to it, it provided just enough saltiness to give it a bit of taste to it.  . 

The Red Wine Braised Veal Cheeks was my entree and it was crazy good and I'm not even exaggerating on that.  The meat was very juicy, very soft and for someone who loves juicy meats this was one dish you should try to have if you ever come to Jump.  The meat was marinated in just the right proportions with the red wine in that you could certainly taste it with every single bite.  I was actually amazed at how soft the entire veal was and how the meat was like melting in your mouth.  All the bones were removed so all you had was just the meat and meat only.  It was absolutely delicious. There were no words to describe the veal that evening.   The dish also came with a couple pieces of crispy polenta and some charred heirloom carrots which in my mind didn't have a whole lot of taste to it, however all the talk was on the veal.  It was definitely the highlight of the night. 

The toffee creme brulee was fantastic.  I know many of you will say a creme brulee is a creme brulee.  How many different ways can you make it?  Well the chefs at Jump certainly found a way to do it with a toffee flavor mixture sprinkled with a strawberry on top.  The end result was a much sweeter and crispier creme brulee.  The beauty of the dish was that the creme brulee's original taste remained throughout as the toffee flavor didn't overwhelm the overall original taste of it and in fact if anything enhanced it even more by bringing more sweetness out of it.  Anytime you go outside the norm, it always opens up one for criticism and the potential for disaster but in this case, the chefs definitely knew what they were doing. 

Overall, it was truly a great night there.  Out of the three dishes that evening, only the soup was a little disappointing in my mind.  The entree and dessert were of the highest quality.  Despite the huge number of people there, the place was well-staffed and the staff itself was helpful and present all evening.  It was a great restaurant experience and a great place to hang out especially after work.  If you haven't been there before, make reservations and really, prepare yourself to have a fabulous night.",2017-02-17 02:25:45

I came here after a few recommendations, and was excited to try their raindrop dessert. While browsing through the menu, they took the time to explain to us what each of the items were..essentially latti is milk tea, frozen latti is ice blended, and cotton candy is shaved ice. We ordered an iced matcha latti, iced taro latti with boba, and the raindrop dessert. I usually don't like any matcha lattes/milk teas when the matcha powder is overpowering and makes the drink very grainy. But this one was one of the best matcha milk teas I've had in town. It was just slightly grainy but just about the right amount for you to know it was made with real matcha powder. Not too sweet at all but very full and flavorful. I tried my friend's taro latti and it was equally good, and the boba isn't too sweet on its own to overpower the milk tea. I've never had the raindrop dessert before so I don't have a previous experience to compare this one with. But it's a very good dessert, especially for the price of $3.25, and overall a fun experience that is definitely worth trying. 

We sat on the couch against the wall facing the glass windows. It's a very comfortable and welcoming space and I can definitely see myself getting work done here. Where the couch is located, you can't actually see the counter where the drinks are served, allowing a pleasant sense of privacy. There is a larger study table toward the middle, and smaller and more intimate tables toward the back, where there is also a wall of magazines (of mostly interior architecture/design, which I have no complaints about). The service was great, a very friendly staff.

I like everything this place offers, but only wish they served coffee. The only coffee item on their menu is Americano, and if there was a bigger selection of coffees I think I would definitely come here even more often than I will. Perhaps this is more of a dessert-drinks type of cafe, but I think if they offered coffee they would attract even more customers, because their drinks are already great.

The meat is really, really good. Tender with a deep-smoke, slow-cook flavor -- the pork is excellent (especially on the bone), the chicken is good. The quality is consistent -- good every time. I keep hearing about the amazing burnt ends, but I have not yet lucked into finding them available. They run out early and frequently.

The sauces are average to below average. Sorry -- Porgy's (another local bbq joint) has much more robust and flavorful sauce (Texas style). I'm not just talking about one sauce -- I've had several (including the Georgia Peach, which a friend recommended). The sauces tend to be light on flavor and thin on substance. 

The sides are anywhere from excellent to okay. My favorite is the twice-baked potato casserole. Amazingly rich and delicious. A friend had the Southwestern potato salad and also loved it, except he said it was room temp rather than cold or warm. The sweet potato fries are good, but not great (they could use a dusting of curry powder or something). The pit beans have a nice meat flavor (bacon added) but also suffer from the same thin base, weak seasoning, and lack of complexity as the sauces. The coleslaw is bad. The cabbage is thick cut and bitter, the vinegar dressing nearly flavorless. I'm not a fan of NC bbq, and this reminds me of a bad side in NC (where I lived for a year).

The stuffed cornbread appetizer is very good -- a wedge of dense and flavorful not-too-sweet skillet bread with some meat and extras worked in. But it too should be served warm and with butter, rather than slightly cool from the fridge.

In all, if you are a meat lover willing to doctor or add your own sauce, Black Dog offers superior entree fair. The sides are kind of hit or miss -- choose what others recommend.

The restaurant is in a very small space, so go early, expect to wait, or even accept getting turned away (happened to us once). Other people have told me the bar is good, but I don't drink and couldn't sit through the noise if I did. The place is usually packed and extremely loud. Just standing at the counter waiting to pay, I felt like my head was being banged on a gong. I also had to navigate a small, packed entryway going both in and out -- that may not seem like much, but it's tough on us quiet types.

I was there last night and I ran into some friend who'd had some of the appetizers and they were raving about them so now I'm REALLY fascinated.

The Steam Punk/Jules Verne-esque decor has a feel that makes you wanna grab a glass of brandy, light an old pipe and listen to stories of the high seas. It's got a very comfortable feel and the people that work there are friendly and very professional.

I can't wait to go back.

If any of you go there before I get to go back, PLEASE do a a quick review...I really want this place to be successful.",2014-01-09 03:29:39

When I heard that they were opening up a new spin-off restaurant, I was excited to check it out!

Farmer's Daughter Eatery is like the smaller, hipper, seafood loving, and boozing little sister of the original restaurant.  The space is bright and much more modern than expected.  There was a large patio space but since the place is newer, it didn't seem very ambient and we chose to be seated inside.

The menu was very small but there were some interesting items.
I went with the southern fried froglegs on waffles.

The waffles were soaked in syrup and the maple butter was freaking amazing.
The frog legs were tasty, interesting...tender..sort of crispy...
The legs are also full of little bones... so more effort to eat.  More than I would like in the morning.

The burger was stacked high and the presentation was pretty with purple cabbage slaw.  It was made fresh, but it needed some time to rest because it was ooozing and dripping juice all over the place.  The pretzel bun added a lot of saltiness and was soft and yummy.

Be warned, if you are ordering a mimosa, the mimosa was tiny. 
Like a kid sized mimosa for small little hands.

Overall, brunch was creative, but not outstanding.  Since the restaurant is new, I feel like they will work out the kinks.

They have Sunday evening happy hour specials - ""F@ck Monday!!!!'
I will have to come back for drinks and some seafood! :)",2014-07-22 02:23:39

This Safeway is like a perfect, symbolic microcosm of what's happening in downtown Phoenix. Until a year ago or so it was a major ghetto. Now it's a nicely renovated, modernized grocery store with a few uppity elements, in a solidly ghetto environment. Just like downtown in general. The parking lot still smells like poo. But there's a full-scale Starbucks cafe inside. A few homeless dudes continue to lounge around the entrance. But some lawyer in a suit is throwing change at them as he walks by. I think you'll feel comfortable here whichever end of the spectrum you're on.

I logged on for the first time and thought the online ordering process was very simple. The site offers a variety of restaurants, access to view the menu, and the option to order immediately, or select a delivery time. 
So, I selected my restaurant, chose my items, and selected my delivery time for 7:30. After that you can indicate cash, or charge, and if you choose charge, include tip if desired. Note: most restaurants require a $15.00 minimum purchase and there is a $5.00 delivery fee. 
I arrived home and at 7:10 my doorbell rang. A very cautious delivery man was there and removed my meal from a heat proof bag. With that said the order was perfect, and warm. Overall, I was very satisfied, but do wish there are more restaurant options.

Again the food was not fresh and I was watching the kitchen this time and that microwave just kept on going off.  

My guest ordered the chicken shwarma.  It was microwaved!!!  They didn't put any onion, lettuce, fresh tomato, or tabouli.  Just dry steamed chicken and tomato that was, again, microwaved!!   The tomato was even microwaved.  The pita bread was burnt and it was fat and short.  Shwarma are supposed to be long and fit comfortably in your hand.  And I was especially not happy because I brought my guest there for a supposed special lunch because he loves shwarma.

The food was disgusting.  And we were not happy with the waitress whom was totally NOT helpful.

I started with the Crab Bisque . It had little bits of blue crab, sherry, cream and crushed croutons. It had a light sweet taste with a pinch of saltiness. It was crabtastic! I think this has a slightly better taste then Texas De Brazil 's Lobster Bisque. 

I ordered the Thai Shrimp and Scallops as my main entree. I was hesitant at first because some places under cook the scallops where they taste a little too chewy . They cooked the scallops perfect! I expect scallop to be flaky and not gooey. The curry taste was mild which I prefer. I liked that the coconut/ curry taste  didn't over power each other. 

We ended the meal with the Pina Colada cake. My husband and my brother wanted something chocolaty but I had way too much chocolate for Valentine's day  so we ordered the cake. Everyone at the table liked it because it was nice and moist and the frosting wasn't heavy or overly sweet.

Decor is okay, nice place to go with friends, family or coworkers for a casual but nice/quiet lunch. In the back, they have a few tatami style rooms with chairs that have a back rest. Very nice spot to have lunch/dinner in. 

They have good quality sushi, real non-artificially coloured ginger (suppose to be white-yellowish not pink FYI), and huge visually appealing speciality rolls. After you order, they usually give you a very very tiny but tasteful bowl of noodle soup to try while you wait. If you want miso soup though, that is an extra $2. 

I have tried the spider roll, salmon roll, spicy salmon roll, unagi roll and California roll.. All very good. If you want a bit more value for your $$ you could also try their special bento boxes but they are a bit limited. Available only from 11:30-3:00pm.

I would have preferred more of the type of arcade games that turn my money into three-minute opportunities to play shiny new video games despite the fact that I already have hundreds of games purchased for Steam, PS3, Xbox One, and Wii U at home that I've never touched. Although they do have Alien vs Predator and a Jurassic World cabinet, so it's not all bad.

First of all Palms Place really hard to find. Parking is confusing and no any signs to Palms Place when you drive on Flamingo Rd. We were going back and forward from Palms Casino to parking with luggage then finally saw little sign Palms Place. A lot of construction going on outside and inside. Hotel seems to be very old and not well maintained. 

Rooms
Interior of the room pretty old even tho it's looks modern but not very practical. Sofas and bed overloaded with pillows. Kitchen is small and not practical. Room in general seems to be big. Bathrooms is good but little bit small for 2-3 people can get easy congested. Balcony door is openable but it's really dirty. Building seems to be not cleaned from outside for years. 

Amenities 
Here is no place to eat!!! Beside McDonalds, Cafe6 and junk food nothing to eat! Me and my husband eat healthy food and you cannot find anything here for affordable price.

And I'm like, ""Oh, you just assumed I'm going to Clever Koi?* Where do you get off, buddy?""** But yeah, those sneaky buggers will totally corner you into valeting, tail betwixt legs.

*I said literally none of this.

Edible portion: 
- Highlight was also not an HH offering - chicken and waffles, featuring taco'd waffle filled with saucy chicken.  
- Blood orange chicken wangs: sounds more creative than it is. Saltier than expected and served with ranch, you get three full bird arms in an artsy little stack. A great option for your friend who wishes you were at Pei Wei and a sports bar.
- Yams o'brien: cubes of Japanese sweet potato with sriracha aoli, also much more normal than I had in mind. It's a fun and easy activity to mindlessly eat the whole bowl, but not essential. 
- Seasonal vegetable plate with steak: maybe I hate Spring, or vegetables, but the asparagus, beets, and kimchi didn't really do it for me. I liked the yams, but I'd already eaten like, 14 cups of yam by this point. I would pass on this in favor of several more chicken waffles next time.

I got the delice de pistache, croissant, pain de chocolat, and and almond croissant. Needless to say I ate them all in one sitting.

Since February 14 2010 is both Chinese New Year and Valentine Day, Lemongrass offers special menu that tailored to both event. I really appreciated how they did not jack up their prices.

For Valentine set dinner for 2 ($39.99), it comes with pumpkin seafood soup, appetitizers: spring rolls/chicken satay, shrimps with pineapple fried rice, lamb chop with pad thai and cheesecakes.

We opted not to have the cheesecake and has it replaced with coconut icecream. It maybe a mistakes, because now I start to have craving for it even after I finished eat it!! It is made with real coconut, not sweet..with tons of real meat inside...........served in a real coconut!

He was working at the conference center, hence the hotel choice. He drove in from LA and was much later than my flight, and the hotel was nice enough to be able to transfer the prepaid room into my name so that I could check in. 

We were on the 24th floor with resort club privileges- not sure what to compare this to, because the room was pretty generic. We got a letter listing our resort level benefits, including lounge access on our floor to have a light breakfast, snacks, and wine/cheese social in the evenings, which was a nice touch. Also included free fitness center access, which I'd researched upon arriving and balked about the $20/day access fee- which is insane considering what is actually available. It's essentially a room of weight machines, some treadmills, and three outdated ellipticals. I was surprised. Used it for what I needed and left, but nothing there was worth even half of that access fee for the weekend, let alone the day. Room came with printer-- but I am still waiting, an hour and a half later, for someone to bring me the cord to actually USE it. Housekeeping says they're still looking for it and to go to the business center instead. Will do, but not thrilled about it. Also, my partner was a little annoyed not to get the slippers/robe listed among our amenities. 

I'm not a casino fan, so I didn't evaluate that, but the giant sports screen at the Superbook was pretty cool. Didn't want to do the buffet, so went to Paradise Cafe instead on my first night alone. Date and I did the sushi bar inside of Bennihana's the following night.  Having access to the monorail was a plus.

All in all, aside from the printer cable situation and fitness center access fees, it was fine. But just fine. Expectations were a little higher.",2012-05-20 19:33:28

My friend had huge expectations for the toast but was very severely disappointed... We got huge lumps of whipped cream and ice cream and very little actually chestnut cream. To add to the displeasing experience, the outside of the toast was not toasted, making the whole outer layer of the toast tough and not edible. 

Drinks were a bit too sweet for our liking and tasted very much like syrup. My kiwi slush was made mostly with canned or kiwi syrup and a very few chunks of real kiwi.

Prior to grocery shopping, I hadn't eaten breakfast yet so I was drawn to their cheap $3.99 silog combo. But the inefficiency of the servers here is just mind-numbing. It seemed like the ordering system is pretty simple. Order what you want then go to the register to pay. But, for some reason, there were 5-6 servers just running around, talking to each other and nothing was getting done. The line didn't move for a good 15-20 minutes. Finally, one of the women noticed I hadn't yet ordered. It was around 10:00 am and they didn't have the entire menu ready. There was only a few of the sausages left. 

Service aside, the food for the price is pretty amazing. It's by no means fancy or anything close, but if you've ever had down and dirty Filipino food, this is it. I love the garlic rice and the longsilogs (sausages). You also get two fried eggs, all for a little over $4 with tax. The portion size is pretty large as well and enough for two meals.

Rooftop bars at the Rio and Palms have the view from a distance, the Mandarin Oriental is in the middle of the Strip, and the Stratosphere is... well, the Stratosphere. The space has been spiffed up a little for its new incarnation, with royal blue and yellow accents and a big bar as well as tables along the window and outside on a terrace. I like it for early evening, because it becomes a dance club later in the night and gets crowded and I'm too old for that sort of nonsense now.

Plus, early evening is when you can order off their sunset menu, which has snacks ranging from $5 up through about $18, plus several specialty cocktails for $12. I tried three cocktails (oops) and they were all very good, if not huge (probably for the best).

  I had heard of your happy hour specials. After work, my energy had been too drained to make the trip to the north parking lot of the Galleria Mall. Yesterday I had the chance to give you a try. I had just voted in the Galleria Mall and when I was in the bottom level of Kohl's sneaker hunting, I looked out the door to lay eyes on you a few hundred feet away. It was time to take a hiatus from shopping to give you a try. The walk from Kohl's is a beeline to your door. Some malls like the one in St. George, Utah would consider you a mall tenant. As I neared closer to the door that faces the mall (not Galleria Drive), I saw the Happy Hour specials. That could be for another time. It was 2 pm on a Friday afternoon. As I made it nearer to the door, I noticed that the parking lot was barron. This was an oman to the infinitesimal amount of customers inside. 

  Now inside, I am standing inside a colossal lifeless building that reminded me of a monastery. I'd gaze at an unoccupied host station to my right, empty bar in the middle, and monastery spaces to my left and right. I'd gaze and gaze and gaze for ten minutes. I was feeling like an unwanted bull. My left foot was bothering me and I did not want to resume sneaker shopping just yet. There seemed to be a want of a seating policy. To me, your policy is sauce. Was I supposed to walk deeper into the monastery rooms? Was an employee (there are employees here?) going to venture toward the entrance where there might just be a slight possibility that an individual could of walked inside with an intention of like eating here? Why wasn't there a buzzer that informs an employee that somebody is here? Finally, a waitress acknowledged me. She apologized for the long delay on account of a blind spot where she did not see me. That is a bunch of sauce because she should of occasionally walked past this blind spot to the waiting area where customers are waiting to be seated. 

  I followed the waitress (no hostess here at 2 pm on this Friday). we walked deep into the recesses of the monastery to the left. For whatever reason I am one of the couple of people in this restaurant, and she seats me out of the way. Why not nearer the kitchen where I would be nearby instead of some Bull seated way out in the boondocks of the monastery. The waitress gave me the menu. This is the last I'd see of her. 

 Spending some time in your lifeless place, I had trouble believing that you are this energetic bar slash Italian restaurant in the later hours of the day. I just couldn't fathom it. As I looked at the menu, it was dawning on me that I was better off transforming from an unwanted Bull to royalty at a different place. This is Las Vegas after all and not Siberia. The menu just wasn't the kind of sauce that is my flavor. I saw relatively few lunch specials. But my love for eggplant parmesan with provolone cheese topped with pasta and a glass of Coke turned a blind eye to the fact that there was zero mention of coming with a soup or salad. If only you gave me a chance I would of exchanged $20 of my hard earned money for it. I remained an ignored bull. I had had enough. I was now in the mood to be appreciated in either Miller's Ale House or Cafe Zupas. It was time to leave the lifeless spaces of the monastery. 

  Sauce, I wanted to like you. But you barely acknowledged me and in reality should open at 4 pm,  if you treat customers like this as 2 pm. I don't like going to a restaurant to feel like an unwanted bull. To me that is just bull sauce.",2014-10-26 07:04:37

We also tried the watermelon basil lemonade. This was probably one of the best drinks I've ever had, very good!

As a part of our Spring Break food vacation, my daughter and I used a gift card that a friend treated me to last year. We decided to enjoy a three course lunch and split our meal because we knew we'd be too full if we had our own entree. 

Our server, Paisley checked on us a couple of times while we waded through the long menu. We had a hard time deciding so we started backwards. We chose the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. Then we ruled out steak and fish for a pasta dish. We considered the mini crab cakes, burger sliders and spring roll sampler, but after choosing the Pasta Carbonara, we decided that a lighter starter would complement the meal better.

Our server came back with warm dark wheat loaf with oatmeal and ciabatta bread with real butter. Yummy! My daughter wisely cautioned, ""Don't fill up on bread, Mom! We will have a lot of food coming."" Our server brought fresh extra plates for us to share our salad and pasta.

The Caesar Salad was terrific. The lettuce and croutons were crisp. Our server ground fresh pepper on our salad. The dressing was spicy and made from scratch. They were also generous with the Parmesan cheese.

Our second course was the Pasta Carbonara. The chunky bacon was crisp and still had a nice bite and chew to it. It was smoky and cut through the creamy garlic Parmesan sauce that was a slight heavy on the olive oil. Still, it was super delicious. I enjoyed the green peas and the pasta was cooked beautifully al dente.

Tip: While grilled chicken could be added to either the Caesar Salad or the Pasta Carbonara, I have learned that chicken does not always enhance the flavors of these lovely dishes. I did not regret not adding chicken this time. The dressing was the star of the salad, as was the smoky bacon in the pasta.

Finally, our dreamy cheesecake came out with an extra mound of whipped cream. The raspberry ribbon was tart and refreshing. The chocolate base had a nice dark chocolaty flavor. The cake was exactly what a chilled cheesecake should be. Of course, it was dressed with fresh shavings of white chocolate.

The company was great. The restaurant was quiet enough for me to enjoy our table conversation. The food was surprisingly good especially a chain restaurant. Our server was attentive. I enjoyed my meal and would not mind repeating it soon. Our tab for our 3 course shared meal was $33. Thank you, Paisley and Cheesecake Factory!",2017-03-22 21:04:25

The place itself is pretty cavernous as you make your way though the building. The interior is very typical pub style with some booths, some high tables, and some bigger normal height dining tables in the middle. Some areas are better lit than others, some seem incredibly dark but some people like the dank I suppose. Bathrooms are not exactly the nicest, and the sauce squeeze bottle of soap maybe speaks volumes in that while the place is clean enough to be non-offensive, it really isn't trying to be upscale.

Pretty standard pub beers to choose from at pretty standard price points. A pint of premium beer is just under $7 and a pitcher is $20 even. The also had some pretty good specials including 2lbs of wings and a pitcher for $29.99 on Fridays. I had a chance to try the wings, and the meat was good, but the wing itself wasn't as saucy as I personally like. Also tried the nacho's which were pretty blah, and a little too soggy from grease and salsa. I also had the Tandoori Chicken Wrap which was decent, and I'll say that their french fries are actually better than standard pub fries as well. The sweet potato fries and the accompanying chipotle mayo on the other hand were both a complete disappointment. It's rare that a plate of fries will actually go uneaten when you've got a group of people drinking around it. Overall the food in general was pretty weak, but the fact they accommodated our group and the food all made it out in decent time, it was slightly redeeming.

That said, shout outs to our server. He's the reason that things went smoothly and was helpful over the couple hours we were there even to the point of running out the door down the street to catch us as someone dropped an event ticket in the bar. Super awesome.

My dog had an accident in my car.  (I was bringing him home from the veterinarians.)  I was afraid to clean it up myself and make things worse.
So the next day, yesterday,  I went to Fabulous Freddy's and spoke to a girl.  She said that I didn't need an appointment and the interior and exterior-including the mess could be done for 84.99.  Fine.  I go on line and saw the detailing for around 150?  Okay!
So I go today.  First guy gets someone else.  She tells me that dog poop is a bio hazard.  She asks a detail guy.  They talk.  Then she comes over to me and tells me it can be done but I would have to leave a tip!  I looked at her and told her that I had worked retail and I always tip.  She looked at me like I was out of my mind and said ""You did?"".
So guy #1 tells me I have a chip in my windshield, we did fix that and my insurance is paying.
The car  was fixed beautifully.  Everything looks great!  I ended up tipping the detail guy-guy #2-$10.  He did give $5 to the guy who cleaned the seats.  He did make some comment about not usually cleaning up dog poop.
I was willing to pay more but don't tell me I have to tip and don't tell me that dog poop is a bio hazard.  And I always tip!
I was recommended this place by an employee at the veterinarian.  When I called my doggy day care place they said that dog poop is not a bio hazard they were shocked and asked if I spoke to a manager.

Service was sloppy in that our waitress forgot to bring drinks, extra plates.

The bartenders didn't really know anything about where things came from.

The specialty cocktail I had was nothing special: much better mixologist out there.

Food was well prepared. My chicken fried game hen was hot from the fryer, full of flavor, and not dried out, which could be easy to do with such a small bird. We had a side of the tater tots which were quite tasty, as was the side of zucchini sauté. The burger was nice, but, nothing extraordinary.

Top it off, they ran out of the dessert we wanted (and this was an early dinner).

Nestled about a mile and a half away from the Wynn and the famous fun filled Strip and directly across the street from Fashion Show Mall is the beautiful luxurious Trump Hotel and a place that I was excited to call home for 3 nights and 4 fun filled days!!

Not knowing where we were staying, I was a bit confused on where we were going after we exited the highway. Took a couple of turns here, a turn there and came upon the biggest tower I have seen (well outside of the city center hotels). There sparking in the night sky was our hotel! Note to guests staying here: There is no self-parking, only valet parking. 

The Valet staff was beyond professional each time we were there, and did not keep us waiting long for our car.

After handing over our keys, we gathered our things and went into the lobby to check in. The door attendant held the door open for us and said Good Evening and Welcome! Wow, a girl could sure get use to this kind of service! Walking into their grand lobby (no joke this was huge... huge as in I could do multiple cartwheels without running into anything).

Big beautiful and bright chandeliers hung high above and the scent of jasmine filled the lobby (as well as the hallways). The front desk attendant was sweet she also welcomed us and asked how our trip was. After checking us in she gave us free bottles of water, explained that there is a resort fee that is charged each day that will allow us to use the internet, have free bottles of water and covered the valet parking as well as access to their fitness area. We were told we would be on the 24th floor in a Suite; she then took the time to come away from her desk and show us where our elevator was. 

This hotel has a swanky looking bar but no casino, which is nice not to inhale the second hand smoke each time you enter or leave.

Now onto our humble suite: 
We were towards the end of the hall, which was nice and we did not have any neighbors to the left or the right of us either! Entering into our suite, we had a private entry into the first door, a mini hallway, then our door and our neighbor's door to the right of us.

Walking into our suite: I do not know what hit the ground first, my jaw, my eyes or ummmm ummm never mind! This place was perfect and fit for a cupcake princess!

It had a living room
An oversize comfortable looking bed with fluffy pillows
A full kitchen with high-end appliances.
Sub Zero Fridge 
Big closets
Hi def TVs in the bedroom, and even a TV in the incredibly huge bathroom (make that a TV in the mirror).
The bathroom had marble floors and was oversized
Shower could host a huge party. The first night we took showers, it took about 15mins for the hot water to kick in...
A nice deep whirlpool tub in the bathroom that could fit two or more!


This suite was immaculate!


No complaints about this hotel, we would totally stay here again! Only thing that happened was around 4:30-7:00am there is a train that passes through and the horn is loud, how loud you ask?

One of the things that amuses and infuriates me is when people extoll the virtues of one outpost of a given chain over another.  In the spirit of recently acquired humility, I have to publicly state that for whatever reason, Eggspectations in Quebec are far superior to their counterparts in Ontario.  

I was in Montreal with a group and when the majority voted for Eggspectations I cheerfully acquiesced (sulked the whole walk over).  We were promptly seated outdoors and coffee/juice orders were taken almost immediately.  Although I wanted an americano, I ordered a latte as the milk tends to hide less than stellar coffee.  It arrived promptly and was --pretty decent.  The fresh OJ was really nice as well.   The server (having correctly sized me up) steered me towards one of the specials - a Montreal smoked meat benedict served over a real Montreal bagel.  It was damn tasty and everything was served just as I had requested.  The service was a bit slow, although with the major crowd circling out front I felt this was a reasonable compromise.

Since everyone agreed that they had eggsceded our eggspectations (yes. I had to...) we decided to catch up there for breakfast the next day.  

Almost walked out front to make sure we were in the same restaurant.  Although far less crowded, the service was s-l-o-w, almost every order was delivered with a serious flaw (friend ordered eggs benny, ended up with a crab cake underneath the egg - he's allergic)  The juice may have been fresh squeezed, but not in recent memory. The bagels were frozen in the centre.  What happened?  I discretely approached the manager and described the problems of the day in light of our stellar experience the day before.  He was very apologetic and sought to rectify all of the wrongs immediately.  

I'm forced to offer a 3 star rating as a bit of moving target.  This place is obviously capable of serving an excellent breakfast, your mileage, however, may vary.",2011-08-17 13:26:58

With all that being said, this Chipotle recently opened within walking distance from my work.  Naturally I offered to pay a co-worker to go pick some up because heaven forbid I get some exercise.   I was happy to see this location offers online ordering so that I didnt have to even use my vocal chords in order to get food to my mouth.  2012!   I ordered a Burrito Bowl with Barbacoa, opted for Brown Rice (which I dont believe is available at all chipotle locations, so bonus), black beans, both medium salsas, and guacamole.  The online system said it'd be ready in about 30 minutes.   40 minutes later I was presented my food and on my first bite I noticed it wasn't very hot and the guacamole had lost some of his texture due from being with the rest of the food for what seemed like a while .   This is one of my pet peeves with online ordering in that I THINK some use a default timing system of when the food will be ready, but the employees might just start making it immediately.   So if they tell you 30 minutes, your food often sits out getting cold for 10-15.   Temperature issues aside, the food tasted about what I expect from Chipotle.  The baracoa was spiced nicely and the salsas and rice tasted fresh.  I also ordered a bottled water and was displeased to see a bottle of Arrowhead when it was delivered.  As you all probably know, Arrowhead is disgusting.  Next time I will order a Nantucket Nectar instead, or have them just pour their pinto bean juice in a jar as that'd be more refreshing than Arrowhead.

So on one visit, nothing to really set it apart from any other Chipotle experience I've ever had, and I'm sure I'll be going there often if I'm ever in a time crunch for lunch.

This place is totally overrated. I went there to celebrate my 30th birthday this past weekend and was utterly disappointed. The head hostess was rude and didn't seat my party until an hour after my reservation time, which then cut into my karaoke room reservation time. They charged me for the full 2 hours even though we were barely in there for 45 mins, which was their fault. Furthermore, I booked a small private karaoke room, which under normal circumstances (meaning, a REAL karaoke sized room) would have accommodated my guests. The person I made the reservation with failed to mention that a small room will only fit 6 people MAX. It's more of a closet than a room. Most of my guests had to stand in the hallway because there wasn't enough room for them to sit down. It was horribly embarrassing. The seats were ripped up and the karaoke machine was totally outdated. They had a huge book of songs that was also totally outdated. They are also supposed to include a small sushi platter with the room which they didn't, I had to actually go find a server and ask for my sushi platter to go. Then the sushi was not rolled correctly and fell apart when I picked it up.

I am VERY angry about my experience here. I feel ripped off and they ruined my birthday. I would have had a better experience making my own sushi and doing karaoke on the Wii or going to a karaoke bar in Phoenix where me and my guests could actually have room to breathe.

Is it as good as your average or above average tapas bar in Spain, I'd say yes, definitely.  Is it as affordable?, nope, but hey, I'll give these guys a break for having to pay what is probably exorbitant rent for their awesome hidey-hole location.

The service is very good, sometimes a little unnecessarily aloof, but I wouldn't say snooty.  They also seem to have a few genuine Spanish expats working there, which lends itself well to the general feeling that you are getting well-made traditional Spanish tapas.

The clientele is as tolerable as you can have downtown in an upscale dining establishment (think suited corporate douchebag avec requisite skank-ho heaven).

Order the paella early (the veggie one is our preferred option, here - it's tastier than its meat-filled counterpart) since it takes a while to prepare, and resign yourself to the size of the bill before you get there so it doesn't impact your tapas selection (it's gonna be expensive any which way you look at it, so just order what you think you might like to eat).  Salads are surprisingly good, as are the croquettas.  In fact, I don't think we've disliked anything there (the patatas bravas could be better - they seem to have overthought them with how they're presented and prepared - a lightly-fried egg broken over them at the table - I much prefer the less pretentious preparations you typically find in Spain).

Items came out rather quickly.  The soup first and it was probably the most tasty thing we had.  The main orders came next and they had forgotten my egg roll, but they showed up with them in just a minute or so after advising them.  They stuck an extra in there for the mistake.  The egg rolls were fairly tasty.

Our main entrees however were basically bland, no spice, no taste at all.  I could tell I was chewing something, but you really could not tell what. My wife also agreed that it was tasteless.",2015-05-20 23:20:18

Although I'm not a huge Milestones fan, one Saturday morning we were lusting after some brunch and took a chance on Milestones. We were pleasantly surprised!

Doors open at 11:30am, and this particular location, the dining room is located upstairs where there is tons of light and seating. (Elevator and stair accessible).
We started off the meal with raspberry mimosas - DELISH. The sparkling wine, raspberry puree and fresh raspberries were a great combo (they also had a tropical fruit option). Then onto the main course. All ranging around the $10-12 price point, we had the Milestones traditional breakfast (three eggs anyway you like, bacon, fresh fruit, homefries), French toast (made on fresh baguette, syrup, strawberries and some sort of cream to top it off), eggs benedict (huge serving, delicious), and an omelet (they offered western of mediterranean accompanied with bacon and fresh fruit).

The menu isn't huge, and doesn't offer anything 'basic' like pancakes, bagels, etc. The servings are huge, but everything we ordered was done to perfection. I highly recommend the french toast, not too eggy. 

The fresh fruit showing with the traditional breaky was a little weak, but other than that, we had tremendous service (ya I said tremendous), delicious food and a good family visit. Thanks for paying Mum & Dad",2011-02-28 19:17:14

It was really strange that they asked, as if we would be ok with the draft. 

We came with some friends that are doing raw vegan for lent, so they ordered salad, salad wraps and lettuce wraps. Two out of three of their items weren't made properly according to their request. They had specifically asked to ensure nothing is cooked, but those details were looked over. Our friends has to pick around their food and send one dish back. 

All in all they were not as accommodating probably because they were in a rush to close. 

The food here is pretty good, there is a lot of variety. A little too much where it can get confusing. Especially for a non vegetarian. 
It's very typical chinese food that you can get at a regular store but with a lot of meat substitutes and vegetable options.

Either way I know I will be taking care of and have another FABULOUS trip. I'm looking fwd. To seeing my friend @ hash House A Go Go (go there hungry because plates are big) and also see my FAVORITE slot host MO. She is the greatest. So my next check-in & update will be on August 2nd. When we arrive for some gambling, people watching, good food, & see my friends I've made since I started going to the Plaza. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THERE! More updates to follow..",2015-07-15 17:22:18

They had been previously, but I had never heard of it. What a nice, little surprise! As other reviewers mentioned, Harlow's gets crowded and this was especially true after the race. But despite that, they got us seated within 15 minutes. Not too shabby. Service was prompt including the water and coffee for our weary and parched souls. 

I had the Cisco, I think it was called, with french toast, two eggs, and sausage links. I have had better french toast elsewhere, but I still really enjoyed my meal. My companions also had meals that looked delicious. Perhaps even more so than mine? Can you say food envy? Anyways, the prices were average and also the ambience. I can see the charm of an unchanged place after many years especially when you have been coming for years. Overall, I thought it was cool. Would I drive from CenPho for the food? No. But I would stop for breakfast if in the area. I am glad I had the chance to try it....",2012-04-24 04:32:23

I ordered the most lucious wine, Butternut Chardonnay.  My man got an IPA.
We chose the sushi special, which was called Wasabi. But, it really wasn't spicy on its own.  We also got fried oysters.  Primo!  A flatbread featuring truffle whipped giant cheese, honey, arugula and pistachio goat cheese.  Amazing!  And spanakopita in the shape of those little paper ""footballs"" that some of us used to make out of paper and thump with our fingers when we were kids.  You could really taste that fresh dill.

Be prepared to pay a premium though as this stuff is not cheap but the prices are comparable to other high end patisseries in the city. The space is quite small and won't accommodate a large crowd. It's cute though.

We didn't think it would be very busy because it was a Friday morning around 10:00 and we figured most everyone was working.  Surprisingly when we walked in there was a group of people waiting in the lobby.  Once we got to the host stand the guy told us it would be about 10-15 minutes because they only had one busser working.  That's annoying because you look around and see all these tables that don't have anyone sitting there but they're all dirty and you have to wait.  We were hungry though and didn't feel like trying to find anywhere else to go so we decided to wait.

I saw several people with delicious looking Bloody Mary's so we went to the bar to order some while we waited.  There wasn't anyone tending the bar when we got there so we stood around for a little bit waiting for someone to show up.  After a few minutes someone came to get our order and make our drinks.  The drinks looked awesome while she was making it so I was really excited to try it.  It did not disappoint!  The flavor was amazing!  My mouth is seriously watering thinking back to it right now.  It was nice and spicy with a great balance to the tomato and the rim of the glass had a chili-lime powder which was great too.

When we were about half way done with our drinks our buzzer went off signaling that our table was ready.  A waitress kind of walked past us as we were going to hand the buzzer back to the host and mumbled to follow her.  We weren't sure if she was talking to us since she had wandered off a little bit but once we got to the host stand he pointed us in her direction and she waved us over with an impatient look on her face.

That was kind of the theme for the rest of the meal as well.  Our waitress wasn't very friendly and every time she got to our table I felt like she acted as though we were taking 20 minutes to order or ask her anything.  The food itself was pretty good, I had the Buttermilk pancakes with bacon and eggs and my friend had the Eggs Benedict which she seemed pretty happy with as well.  I think next time I come back I'll just sit at the bar for everything so I don't have to deal with grumpy waitresses or make sure to drink enough of their delicious Bloody Mary's that I don't realize how poor the service is.",2013-04-28 15:59:47

What I like about this post office is that they have great Saturday hours, and have counter hours until 3PM on Saturday afternoons.  They also have an automate attendant in the lobby if you should need after hours help.  They have post office boxes for rent, a drive through drop box for letters, supplies for sale, and this location is usually clean and neat.

The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because, in typical USPS fashion, the lines here usually include a tremendously long wait at times.  Its not that people are lined up out the door.  Usually its a matter of 4 or 5 people waiting for what seems like forever.  I've stood in line for at least 20 minutes here before, usually do mail a larger sized envelope, which really doesnt take more then a minute or two.

They do have an automated scale in the lobby, but with new Government regulations, not all items can be accepted on the scales.  Plus, with some supplies, they don't carry all sizes of envelopes.

I will definitely be back to this place, again and again.  I don't understand the ranking on Yelp, because this place is actually more reasonably priced that that.  For the prices, what you get here is absolutely amazing.

I highly recommend you try the Mozeralla Caprese.  It's one of the best I've had in Happy Valley, and possibly ranks among the best Capreses I've had since my last trip to Italy.
Next, I had the Pollo Affumicato.  Omg, sooooo delicious.  And priced under $20!  Are you kidding me?  This place is a gem.

The vibe at this place is superb.  Very lively.  And you feel as though you're in Italy because of the decor.  I was especially fond of the extra authenticity added to this place by the numerous Soccer tournament posters all over, many of which say to be sponsored by Mr. Bunga Bunga himself, Silvio Burlosconi.  You may not like the guy, but hey, it sure as hell makes the restaurant authentic :-)

Finally, I'd like to say that the service here is ""Johnny on The Spot"".  Whatever you need, there's always someone around to take care of it.  Oh yeah, try the Grappa Amarone.  Good stuff, if you can handle it, that is.

The bed was just okay. Not the most comfortable I've ever encountered in a hotel. I did really like the pretty blankets, however. Everything about my room felt very cozy. 

The front desk staff was always pleasant and helpful. There's a decently-stocked pantry with wine and beer as well. Just wish they carried frozen pizza as there wasn't much for a late night snack.

Depending on the time you go it can either be a restaurant, club, bar, or even a hookah lounge. Whatever you want to call it Blue has never delivered anything but a mediocre experience for me.

First off the drinks are very overpriced for what you get. Each martini is about $14, at this price point you are approaching what high end night clubs on the strip charge and this place is no Marquee. 

However, what bothers me the most about Blue Martini is their half-assed attempt at being a 'club' at town square. On any weekend you will see a group of the sleaziest bouncers this town has to offer enforcing dress code and holding up the line for no reason. Once they make you pay cover and get in, you come to realize that place is full of people old enough to be your parents trying to dance to some no-name DJ playing songs off his ipod.

While Blue Martini is not a small venue, it is by no means comparable to any of the nightclubs it aspires to emulate. Low ceilings, cramped seating, and a tiny impromptu dance floor created by shoving dining tables and chairs off to the side. Personally, I prefer not to get down in some chain restaurant.

They had a number of food sampling opportunities, and they had also already reduced their prepared foods to clear. Yes, I'm that person. I like to wait until there are discounts before I buy prepared foods, most of the time. This time, it was not a weekend, and it wasn't late enough, so no samples and no discounted food (unless we're talking day old food). 

This is a pretty big store. Lots to see. Lots to buy. However, 8 lbs of sweet potatoes cost about $16 here, and for the same price, I can get 10 lbs at Galleria. The persimmons I saw at H Mart were on the bruised side, and if they had been at Galleria, would have been reduced to clear. I did buy two pints of blueberries though. They were $1.38 ish each, and looked quite good. 

I also bought a box of day old japchae at 50% off. That meant my big box of japchae was about $2.50. It was very tasty, and had a decent amount of veggies in it, including zucchini, carrots, wood ear fungi, and spinach.

I came here a couple days ago with a colleague from a board I work with, in the midst of a raging storm that was taking out trees left and right. While the pub was seemingly empty when we came in, we soon felt right at home when the waitress greeted us.

The pub is roomy and cavernous - the kind of place you could find a dark corner to get lost in if you were looking to avoid people. There are plenty of nooks and crannies in the place, punctuated with TV's mounted overhead and the bar itself in a central ""nexus"" within the building.

It had been many years since I last came here, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. I ordered the special (chicken on a bun), while my associate ordered a reuben for herself. I was amazed to see that the portions were absolutely massive - my sandwich had to have weighed a good pound or so. I found myself trying (and almost failing) to keep the contents from spilling out onto my suit, while my companion found herself full after eating half her meal and not even touching the fries. The special is one of the best meals I've had in a long while - great value for the price.

Despite a few dodgy moments in terms of service (we waited way too long to get our food), the rest of the experience was stellar. This is easily a good 4.5-5 stars, only conditional on the service and time of day.

Our family style dinner for our group of 15 consisted of spinach salad, vegetarian curry pasta, jerk chicken, rice and peas, coleslaw, oxtail gravy and funnel cakes for dessert.  The curry pasta was a hit, very creamy as was the jerk chicken which was moist and tender but full of flavor.

I actually had a really good time when I saw Senses Fail last week. The sound was really good and I was able to get close enough to see the stage. I'm pretty short, so I'm not usually in luck at concerts and the floor is just flat so I can't even stand at the back of the room to get a better view. Overall this venue was fine.

First of all I just don't understand why they didn't serve brunch at Green, that's where the kitchen is. They were very adamant about waiting until 9am until anyone could place a brunch order even though the place was filling up before 9am. 
Though once orders were placed food came quickly.

The plates were brought over from Green and probably played a hand in why the food wasn't hot, but it was more likely due to it being pre made, quite possibly the day ahead of time, and not heated well, which in turn made for a very dry tofu scramble.
 I got the Sage Sausage Hashsheesh, unfortunately no sage flavor just one note flavor, even so, it would have tasted better Hot and it would have been nice to have toast with it as well.

By the time we left it was standing room only. 

I may be pointing out the obvious here but Nami should stick to being a coffee and pastry shop and let real meals be at Green where food can be served hot from the kitchen into a dining room that can accommodate more people. Maybe consider having an option to order brunch at Nami for the overflow but to have it solely there is asinine.


P.S.
I'd like to add that the first time I visited Nami I ordered the Fluffernutterin
Soynami which is ORGANIC peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmellow flavor and I stood there and watched her scoop in SKIPPY Peanut Butter=Not Cool=False Advertising=Fail!",2011-12-18 17:50:36

We booked our reservations through OpenTable, mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and requested patio seating. When we arrived, the hostess and possibly the manager dressed in a suit and tie did not even greet us Happy Anniversary. The manager showed us to our table, and our chairs were both filled with yellow flowers from a nearby Palo Verde tree. We wiped off our chairs. You would think that given the caliber of restaurant BLT is, the mgr would have had someone wipe off the chairs for us. Not a good start. In fact, when he sat another couple next to us we overheard another gentlemen guest say, ""this is ridiculous."" 
As for the food, it was MEH. Underwhelming. We started by sharing the tomato & burrata (caprese) salad. I've had better burrata (@ Rusconi's). Hubby had the rack of lamb and I had the Dover Sole. Given the $60 price, I was expecting the Dover sole to knock my socks off, but that was not the case. Not worth the price. Should be priced around $32. Dessert was the only thing delicious: Peanut Butter mousse with Banana ice cream. They actually wrote in chocolate, Happy Anniversary! 
In fact, The only person who greeted us happy anniversary was the girl who refilled our water; she read the dessert plate! No acknowledgement from the manager, hostess, not even our waitress wished us a Happy anniversary...but only the smiling girl who we filled our water! 
Another surprise was that they charged us for dessert. Granted it's a nice surprise when they comp it... We were at Eddie V's the night before and they compd our dessert. Earlier in the day we were at iPic Movie theater and the waiter even insisted on buying us dessert! BLT? Nope. Not even for a special occasion. It would've been a nice touch, but the way our dinner experience was going, I wasn't surprised.

One more note to add: our busboy was a little ""rough around the edges."" Again, given the top-notch service that BLT is known for, he needed some more training in fine dining service. He was a little annoying/rude (plunking down new silverware versus setting it down gently); didn't make our experience an enjoyable, romantic evening. 

BLT is a nationally acclaimed restaurant known for its impeccable food and service. Unfortunately it was a miss on both counts tonight. We've celebrated special events here several times and tonight was not up to par. The view was the only thing special about this evening. Tonight was disappointing actually. Don't think we'll return here anytime soon.",2015-05-25 05:03:23

There is room inside for about 6 people to make their orders and wait in line (unless you are there when they are prepping the deliveries for grocery stores and restaurants - then there's room for about 2 skinny people) so the line frequently stretches out the door; but it moves fast and the hot homey bagel smell melts all but the coldest hearts and makes the wait mello, friendly and fun.",2011-11-18 15:49:57

Other good items spotted were Tamale factory tamales, a really good brownie from Fairytale bakery, parsley pita chips and fresh fruit. Both employees were really nice, one guy following me outside making sure my box was good enough for my groceries. When you check out, they ask box or plastic. I was feeling crazy, so I chose box.

Since being a new South Hills resident, I refuse to start the ""there's nothing in the South Hills"" argument. So I go in search. And sometimes there's hits and sometimes there's misses. This is definitely a hit! 

Betsy's is a two fold treat. One because they specialize in some funky fresh flavors. I'm not even a fan of lavender, but I loved the lavender raspberry! I actually went through and tried like six flavors! I'm gonna have to say the Pittsburgh Pride is probably my main jam because I love cake batter, I love brownies and I love some chocolate fudge drizzle!

The order : Crab Rangoon, hot and sour soup, Philadelphia roll General Tso's Chicken and Pork Fried rice all small portions at 28 !!!! When she told me the price I was like really all that for under 30 bucks ! 

Crab Rangoon -- If not the best I have had to date, lightly deep fried honestly I couldn't even tell it was put in a fryer no resemblance of fryer oil nor smell. This is honestly really really good. (5 pieces give or take ) 

Hot and sour soup -- nice mix of shredded beef, egg, bamboo shoots not too spicy nor not to mild also they give little fried crisp that again not waited in fryer oil or greasy. Very good soup. 

Phili roll -- amazingly good high quality sushi rice everything worked real nicely. 

General Tso -- I normally get this to test out Chinese food places because I have seen so many ways / sauces that go on it i.e. brown sauce, or red sauce.  This was been my fav so far I haven't had this good since living in Washington State. For small portion is actually quite large see pics also comes with white rice. The sauce is a mixture of brownish redish color with medium heat index to it witch is nice cause sometimes it can be done over baring heat. I will strictly return for this dish as its one of my favorites. 

Pork fried rice-- its above your average fried rice dishes. The rice again is quality normally you might get hard rice and under-cooked witch I have gotten from some places before. This was really good nice mix of meat,rice, veggies.  


Again the ticket price for food was the shocking part 28 dollar for all this food, I still can't believe it. The portion size for small is well enough for 1-2 people to eat and maybe have left overs. I seen there menu for Japanese food I am hoping the Gyoza , and miso soup are amazing if so you def. have my business. There sushi prices are amazing I think the most expensive sushi roll was 15$ DO NOT LET THIS PLACE MISS LEAD YOU FROM THE OUTSIDE TRY IT !

Digression and discombobulation is what happens though, when I get to thinking about the spire and Lloyd Wright.  Having only viewed it from afar until recently, I'd always thought that it was a bit of an eyesore! (I know, perhaps I'm alone in this camp.) and that was BEFORE I'd come to learn that it's a FLW design. My understanding of FLW & prairie lines & ""blending"" into natural surroundings was completely thrown here. I even recall, at Taleisin (FLW's winter camp back in the day) how the tour guide emphasized that ...even when the power lines went in, FLW had a fit - noting how they interfered with the natural view. 

Anyway, the spire is said to evoke images of the desert - (btw, it was originally conceived for a 1950's proposal for the AZ state capitol that was rejected) - the reaching skyward saguaro and the jagged, rugged desert plants. I can see that now and can appreciate that aspect (though I think it a bit of a stretch at 125 ft). 

The green grounds and canopied area are well-kept.  The water features are pleasing. The sculptures are interesting. Something though is restless. I tried for a nap, but I think there's a bit too much of a sense of hustle n bustle. (Which is odd since I can kick back in a place like Millenium Park, Chicago.)  It's a lot more yang than yin here, (busy parking lot, bustling intersection, giant jagged horn) probably better for a quick walk through and then grab lunch at the Maggiano's patio and look upon it from there.

I'll keep coming back though. 

I imagine Frank LW bare-backing that unicorn, will rise up and explain somethin to me. I bet he's wearing that t-shirt! ""Admire the Spire, biatch""",2014-04-13 19:18:40

If you're looking for a Cheers-like atmosphere (except still no booze!) where it feels like a family dinner in several levels (comfy décor, friendly camaraderie, traditional home-cooked tastes/flavours) then you've found your place.

Things I have eaten that have been delicious:
- oxtail
- meatloaf
- burger
- chicken noodle soup
- leek soup
- jerk chicken
- ackee and salt fish
- the free starters of pita and garlic bread with chipotle mayo....mmmmm...
- funnel cake
- cheesecake

Two words: eat here",2014-03-09 18:43:41

My hubby & I went to Mastros Sunday night to celebrate his birthday.  Everything is a la carte (and very large portions)...so, we split a cesar salad (average but not disappointing in anyway), swordfish (I loved it, but my husband who is very picky thought it was too fishy) , 12 oz filet mignon (great cut of meat cooked to perfection), garlic mashed potatoes (very tasty, maybe a little gluey) and sauteed broccoli (tasty, but boring...we've had the sauteed snap peas before and they are better).  They put a small piece of dry ice in the bottom of my martini glass and my cosmo had a little dry ice smoke...loved that.

Since it was his birthday, they brought out a slice of chocolate cake with a candle.  The cake was damn good.  

Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful.  He was very professional...the entire wait staff was on point.  They took very good care of us.  

BTW, there is an attendant in the bathroom...so bring a dollar with you if you want to be able to tip.",2009-12-01 07:40:00

Only the first 2 miles and last 2 and was sparse. Some parts of the trail are in great condition and some don't allow for easy trail running but check out the photos.

I had super fast checkout at the register!

The vanilla shake had a decent, albeit mild but not artificial taste.  It actually tastes like it has vanilla extract in it.  It was perfectly thick and cold.

The cup was styrofoam, so the drink stayed chilled, and the extra wide/thick straw made the shake drinkable.

Gas prices are lower than Chevron, but not as low as Costco.

The large has area under the canopy is well-lit at night and the employees aren't surly.  They actually say hello to you and are polite and helpful.",2015-07-21 19:22:30

I love love love the ahi tuna burger. Its made very well. My husband loves spicy food and says the Diablo burger is one of the best in town with regards to spice level. He says that it's extremely well put together, with the perfect amount of spice. We usually get a side of fries as well with the aoli sauce. This place is great.

Might even have to ""read"" a movie from time to time as you'll get some good foreign films here. Located in a great spot off Providence to grab a meal or snack before or after the movie. Theater is well-maintained and the service is always topnotch. Restrooms are upstairs and small. My main issue with the place is that because of it's age the modern conveniences of the larger theaters do not exist like comfortable chairs.

Nice menu, friendly  attentive service. Moderate prices. Food nicely plated and served hot.
We ordered:. Butternut squash bisque, , 2 orders of roast chicken ,one beef brisket  dinner and  one pork shoulder dinner. 2 sides  per dinner  some of our sides were roasted pee wee potatoes, beets with blue cheese, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower and creamy coleslaw
The brisket very tender as well as the pork.  Our chicken was a bit dry. The soup delicious as well as  most of the sides . The coleslaw was fresh and brussel sprouts just a tad chewy

On the way to the single  restroom we saw spilled water on the floor with staff working  around it. . I mentioned something and it was cleaned up promptly with  a caution sign out up.

I would  definitely eat here again",2017-01-11 22:16:26
