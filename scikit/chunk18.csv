Its usually about 70 % full every time I visit and never had to wait for seats. I usually get the rice or the vermicelli dishes with chicken or pork or beef or spring rolls depending on what I am craving at the time.   Its not amazing but it's not a let down either. Prices are fair and portion sizes are reasonable.,2017-09-05 13:54:52

It's always best to start with a low number and then add the spice they give you if you want it more spicy.  Always big portions!  Today I decided to add some vegetable egg rolls. Actually came with FIVE medium egg rolls.  Most places seem to give you one or two so I'm happy with that. I'll definitely have leftovers. Lol.,2016-10-11 03:30:38

Just a few minutes ago the store had five people working behind the chocolate bar and nobody on the other side checking out people that just wanted to buy boxes or items that were ready. Myself & 1 other put our armful of stuff down & walked out after waiting far too long.

I did wander along Church Street on the Friday and Saturday. Everyone was there , from every walk of life , and all love was celebrated. Everyone was in a good mood and the vibe was just wonderful.

We were charged for our oldest child without anyone even saying anything, and when we asked about it, they actually questioned her age.  The manager rolled his eyes when we explained that our child was 12.  Seriously?  My kids aren't even big for their ages, especially compared to many of their friends.  Ironically, our daughter wasn't even over the age limit, but even if she was, was it really worth it to lose regular customers over one $5 meal?

I ordered the Shredded Beef Chimichanga and my friend ordered the Chorizo Empanadas. YUM to both! The Crema that they served on my chimichanga was so delicious I could have licked my plate, if it was socially acceptable.

cEtquT8H-yNeRYW-wOe9Ng,xApIDag8sgxCiguyPHMWsA,tstXUpIFZQ9xYejjGQrDwg,3,4,2,3,"Pizza fire is located in the front of a strip mall on Pearl Rd in Strongsville.  Very close to the high school.  Nice location.

You wait in a line and get your pizza made in a line Chipotle style.  That has both pros and cons to it.  Since it only takes them 3 minutes to bake your pizza in a large brick oven that sounds pretty fast.  Biggest downside is if you have 8 or 9 people in front of you you will wait over 30 minutes in line to get your pie.

Pizza itself tastes fresh.  All the ingredients taste really good and fresh.  Crust is thin and crispy outside with a tender inside.  Several options for sauces and toppings make it really tasty.  They also have salads and soft drinks.

At peak times I may use their web site to order a pie to go instead of waiting in a long line.  Stopped in on a Wednesday.  Its kids night.  I thought I was walking into a Chuck E Cheese with all the kids running around and sippy cups all over the tables inside.  Each adult pie gets a free kids meal.  Good deal if I had kids that age.

I like the buy 7 pies and get 1 free card.  They offer it sporadically so I have forgotten to use it a couple times.

I will tell you that the BEST thing about Cuisine Malaya is the fact that they deliver to the Uptown area! The only other sushi joints to do that (especially on a Sunday when I NEED sushi most) is KO, which is a tad different and pricier.

The pizzas were excellent, both in quality and taste. Certainly, this isn't delivery pizza, and is a just a notch above a CPK. The crust is fluffy and yet at the same time crisp, and the toppings are clearly of a high quality.

We tried the Blanca with spicy italian sausage and the Truffle as well. We enjoyed both of them thoroughly. 

Certainly, you are paying a premium here. 22 (cheese) to 29 (truffle) for a (non gigantic) pizza is at best considered ""casino"" pricing, and at worst, just flat out a rip-off. I don't think I could even justify coming here to spend 5.50 on a slice, as the slices aren't really ""meal"" sized like some places.

We also had the pork belly appetizer, which, when digested with all the ingredients in a single bite, was just absolutely incredibly. Still, it would be 15 dollars had we been paying ourselves.

In the end, it wasn't a bad experience at all - in fact, service was really good and we came away very happy. However, the bill without consideration of comps would have been 100 dollars before tip (3 beers too). That's a lot for a pizza meal! It was good, but not THAT good...",2013-07-08 10:20:52

First time eating Dim Sum.  First time for both of us.  After we figured it out it was fun picking out little steamers or plates of dumplings.  Most everything was flavorful and tasty.

Just one thing I didn't care for, it had yuca in it... but it was just my taste... not the quality of the food.

I would love to come back and have a larger group... that seems like a lot of fun and a good way to try lots of food!  

I do want to try the chicken feet.  The sauce looked really good!

Staff was informative but maybe a little impatient for first timers.

From the outside, the place has absolutely NO curb appeal.  Still though we went in, trusting in 105 yelp reviewers and walking inside was like walking into another world...Very, very nice.  Very nicely decorated.  Service was fast and efficient.  We were well looked after by the wait staff.  
I had an old favorite, pad thai.  That's usually the bench mark I use for measuring how good food is.  The pad thai was excellent.  Had it with chicken but there were some shrimp thrown in.  Got the medium heat and it was delicous!!
Wife had one of the currys.  Ordered medium heat but she said that, while absolutely delicious, it wasn't as hot as she'd like it although she, too, had ordered medium.  Could be a mistake in the kitchen.  Anyway she said it was delicious. as well.
We also got some egg rolls.  There were two of them and they were wonderful as well.  They come with a fruit sauce which was ever so delicate.  Very lightly pink but we couldn't tell from which fruit it came.

After my first visit to Margaritaville... I still don't understand. I get it, it's a way of life or state of mind, a way to cut loose... but continuous videos of tailgating at Jimmy Buffet shows, with Chesney or Wilson thrown in every 10th video? Not for me. I'm sure a lot of people find this place to be like a little 'cheeseburger in paradise'. The atmosphere is kind of fun, but with a quoted 'one to two hour wait time', at a place that will not do reservations or call-ahead seating, it would be nice to have bigger bars to kill that wait time. The food is not bad. I will say the Volcanic Nachos were like manna from heaven, after we got seated, stacked THIIIIIS high with lots and lots of 'penos. My fish tacos were nothing to write home about, and the side of 'paradise' or something of that nature rice was... rice with carrots and peas. Huh. I have to say, though, I did not feel ripped off. The food wasn't stellar but at $10 for a good-sized helping, it was decent. My friends ordered other things and I really did not hear any raving. One person's steak was still mooing, after ordering it medium. 

Service was really, really good. I wish I could do a separate 4 stars for the staff, they were awesome. I never had to ask for another drink, and our guy was incredibly patient while we waited for the rest of our party to show up after we had been seated. We did not feel rushed at all, and that means a lot in such a packed restaurant where others are obviously waiting still. They split our check without batting an eyelash. I tipped accordingly, you should too. These guys were facing a mosh pit with smiles on their faces. The balloon guy on stilts was a hoot (ask him to give you crabs if you go) and the live band was classic college alt rock, about 5 years after college. No one danced, which I thought was pretty funny. They didn't sound too bad.

I originally found this restaurant when I was trying to find vegetarian eateries for two colleagues from India who were helping my group out for a few months. We never went because they craved food from their homeland. 

I actually visited this place with our team months later. We have a vegetarian on our team. A few months after that, I came here with my manager. 

The food here is incredibly tasty. You don't even realize that you are not eating any meat. 

I have had the following delicious items:

- Sweet and sour lappa (fake chicken nuggets, salad, and purple rice, and sweet and sour lappa)
- Iced lemon green tea
- Cutlet bento box
- Har gow
- Siu mai

I love the sweet and sour lappa. Yum! It tastes like sweet and sour chicken. The purple rice is wonderful. Then again, I practically like anything purple. Naturally, I need salad. I feel odd without it. 

I have also tried the cutlet bento box. It is yummy, too. 

The iced lemon tea is exceptionally fragrant and refreshing. I was impressed. The har gow and siu mai dim sum items tasted authentic. Again, I didn't feel the void of meat. Everything was filling. 

As a tea freak, I was pleased to see a tea room at this restaurant. You can buy loose leaf tea here. There is a ton of variety. 

There is a decent number of parking spots in this small plaza. I have never had any issues finding a spot. 

I was hoping to return here for a colleague's birthday. Sadly, that didn't pan out. So, I'll need to make another determined effort to get out here soon. I miss the food.

Saturday mornings from 7 to 8 am around the valley seems to be quite lovely; barely any traffic on the roads at all. All you weekend pleasure drivers should give it a try. The drive north on 7th avenue to Dunlap took about 10 minutes, and my head danced towards thoughts of sugarplums... and other sweet treats. I hope they have a good Apple Filled donut!

Arriving this early just about anywhere means you pretty much have the run of the place. There were one or two other customers and the scent of freshly baked goodies was almost overwhelming. I had my eye on the freshly made quiche, which looked awesome, but that's not what I was really here for. I asked the girl at the counter ""What's your most popular donut"" and I got a list of some of the local favorites; Apple Fritter, a variety of fruit / cheese danish, a few different cream filled goodies. MMMM... what a way to start your Saturday! Unfortunately no Apple Filled donut, but the Apple Danish looked like a pretty good alternative.

Mental note: Next time bring cash, $10 minimum order with credit cards. We ended up ordering extras to meet the $10 mark and the thought of bringing home donuts is scary. I know that if I bring baked goods into the house, its leaving one of two ways; me eating it, or my wife eating it. I'm pretty sure we all know how that's gonna turn out. We sat at one of the cafe tables and began sharing. Yes, that thing you were taught when you were two. Sharing is caring!

At the first bite of the Apple Danish I was hooked. In my head I am working out this scheme to convince my wife that it was no good and she wouldn't even like it. Since that probably wouldn't work anyway. I gave in to my selfish desires to finish the danish and shared the other half, with my other half. The Apple Filling was just about perfect.

We made reservations way in advance and for a Friday night at about 9:00PM it was surprisingly dead. I think there may have been 2 or 3 other couples dining besides us, and they were gone by the time we were even seated, ahaha.  I guess reservations weren't needed afterall.

It is definitely a trendy steakhouse with a good size bar area to sit at, but it is right off the casino floor which might bug some. On to the food...we split the meatball pizza as an appetizer and it was ok...I mean it was pizza! We both had steaks, but I don't remember what kind/cut. On the side, I think it was asparagus and some kind of mash. I think we were kind of disappointed to see it so empty in the restaurant, and it made us want to leave that much sooner, so we didn't order dessert, which we almost always are down with trying something. 

The service was pretty slow for being the only ones dining. I'm not too sure what was up with that, but it was kind of a turn off! Anyways, service was nice...just not very attentive.

Flour and barley was at the top of my list for wanting to try. Sadly, I was disappointed by both service and food. 

Service was almost non existent. I understand it's a new restaurant, and most employees are new, and it takes a little time to get in the groove of things. However, the service was too bad to be able to overlook. Our server did not seem to know much about the menu. When asked what their recommendations were, she couldn't even answer because she hadn't had most of the food items. Service was also quite slow on the drink refills. 

As for the food, we started with the baked clams as well as the mozzarella en carozza (Italian bread filled stuff mozzarella, prosciutto, and basil). They were ok. The mozzarella en carozza was basically just a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. The bread had a nice golden brown toast to it and was quite crunchy. However, the inside of the sandwhich left more to be desired. A thick slice of cold mozzarella and a very thin piece of prosciutto did not cut it. The baked clams were decent enough, just a little heavy on the salt. 

For our pizzas, we ordered the Carbonara (pancetta, roasted cauliflower, farm egg) as well as the Calabrese ( meatball, Italian sausage, prosciutto).  The Calabrese was decent enough. The tomato sauce had good flavor and it had a good amount of toppings. It ess basically their version of an escalated meat lovers pizza. The chili verde that also comes on it was a nice addition. As for the Carbonara, well, that was the low point in the meal. I was quite excited for this one, as it sounds amazing, and I'm sure it would've been. But upon receiving our pizza, it was room temperature at best, as if it had just sat out while our other pizza was being cooked. The crust was no longer crisp, just soggy. Super disappointing. Would've sent it back, but l again, service was bad and we could find out server. My party and I all tried to eat a slice, but we left half the pizza untouched. And as much as some of you like to eat cold pizza, it's definitely not what I expect to eat when I'm paying to eat hot pizza in a restaurant. 

Overall, would I go back? Probably not, which is a shame. I can already forsee spending many nights at The Linq, showing around my tourists friends or bar hopping with my fellow locals, but I don't think Flour and Barley will ever be a stop on the list.",2014-03-27 18:36:44

My aunt who lives behind GVR, moved elsewhere so, I had nowhere to crash and I ended up staying here for the night.

The Pool:
They have a very nice pool area and it's not super crowded like the pools on The Strip infested with diseases. Lots of areas to sit and chill out. Very clean and I didn't see drink cups/ glasses/ bottles, etc. It is relaxing. 5/5

Room:
The room I stayed in had 2 queen beds, flat screen TV, mini bar, ironing board, bathrobe, and a desk area. It was by the pool area but it was quiet. The toiletries include: lotion, shampoo, conditioner, almond bar soap, hand soap, and body wash. Nice marble floor,beautifully tiled shower separate from the tub. 4/5

Restaurants and Bars:
Tides, Drop, etc. You may want to go across the street (The District) if you want to eat something good. 2/5

Entertainment:
They have a casino and movie theatre. 3/5

It's pretty reasonable to stay here maybe for a staycation which I've never done and probably would never do since I'd rather travel. The District is just across the street for food and shopping. They have a spa and a fitness center - make sure you check their hours.",2014-07-25 19:02:18

The appetizer was some beef bruschetta thing where the meat was cold on it.  I was not impressed.  However the entry was a chicken fried chicken and it was the down home comfort food I was craving and it was hot.  I felt sorry for the staff yesterday it looked like they were trying but were in need of a good manager.

This is one of the most popular Greek restaurants on The Danforth and whether you like it or not, there's always a line up to get a table, especially on a weekend. Expect to wait about 20 minutes on a Saturday night. That said, the hostess does try to seat you as quickly as possible.  I last went here in August, 2011 and the vibe is very casual. Usually, someone is having a family meal, a birthday party or a group dinner here. It is a good date place though. In fact, the vibe is so casual that I saw a guy come in on a date adorned by two HOCKEY STICKS. WHO BRINGS A HOCKEY STICK ON A DATE? Most Canadian thing I've ever seen. It was quite hilarious. Moving along...

WE ATE 
We were pretty starving so we had the bread that they bring out (note:  don't come here if you're on the Zone diet. Greeks can't part with their carbs) and then we had the taramousalata, the fish roe caviar dip that is pink. I love this stuff and they make a very large portion that's creamy pink fish roey goodness.  We were able to substitute our iceberg lettuce salads with the greek village salad (no iceberg but green pepper, kalamata olives, cucumber , tomato and plenty of feta) and though it was $2 extra, wroth the cost (I hate that they do this but it's life). Our mains were the chicken souvlaki dinner and the lamb souvlaki dinner. The souvlaki portions huge and juicy and not dry unlike Mr. Greek's version. Served with rice, we were stuffed.  As others have said, Mezes is not cheap (and I think they have raised their prices over the years). With two glasses of wine each, our meal came to $100. I won't go there for a while, but it was a great meal and I highly recommend it. This on my top three Greek restaurants list in the city (and I live in the Danforth area, so am familiar with the other options). 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Mezes is Greek for appetizer. Pick a little. Take a little. One Greek restaurant to appetize your senses.",2011-11-25 14:59:30

They have items from the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, the Orient, and so much more. Their food court offerings though are only from Asia. 

Prices are really good at the food court. You can get a 2 item combo with rice or noodles, and a soup (hot and sour or wonton) for $6.99. I tried the Black Pepper Beef, Honey Garlic Chicken with Yeung Chow fried rice and wonton soup. The soup was lukewarm, which I didn't like, but the actual wontons weren't bad. The fried rice had lots of shrimp and pork in it, in addition to carrots, corn and peas. The black pepper beef was tender. The honey garlic chicken wasn't as crispy as I like, but that's the norm for prepared breaded and fried dishes. These items are not made to order, but rather premade like at places like Manchu Wok, Shanghai 360, etc. The portion was huge. I shared this with my mom. There's no way I would have finished it by myself (and I'm a hearty eater, believe me, lol).

My dad got the BBQ combo with BBQ Pork and Peking Duck on steamed white rice for $5.99. The portion was quite generous as well, and my dad enjoyed it. I didn't have any, but he said it was good.

One of my pet hates is a restaurant cooking basic foods, charging higher prices and then failing to make the food well.

We ordered burgers, not hard, except neither of us can stand onions, of course we requested no onions and of course they were brought to the table with onions.

Both burgers were sent back, when they came out, mine was over cooked and my wife's was under cooked.

At this point we had been in the place for over an hour waiting for food, so it really didn't matter, these burgers were getting eaten :-)

They actually looked very good, however, they were nothing amazing, pretty much your standard defrost and slap it on the grill type thing.

The manager did take one of the burgers of the check and comped us desert (some very strange deep fried PB and J thing) which was nice, but it should never get to that stage, if a burger cannot be done correctly I have to wonder about the other dishes offered.

With chefs from Osaka and Kyoto (I don't know where these two chaps trained) and two waitresses that are also nihon-jin, it hits a mite bit more authenticity than many of the other venues that purport to be shinnihon ryouri.

The vibe is a version of Tokyo hip... the colours are a tiny bit... melodramatic, but in a Dante meet Japanese Urban, this is pretty on-the-money.

It is only half completed at this point and will close after mid-September to complete the rest of it, so go quick! 

The space is gorgeous with marshlands, elevations, open grass fields and playsets (swings, slides, teeter totters, etc.). The giant slide which must be at least a storey-and-a-half high is reason enough to visit. You can see the residences being built next to it to house the Pan-am athletes next year.

Finally after walking in again for the zillionth time on a Sunday afternoon, the bar was empty! 

The hubby ordered the Cuban and I, of course, got the Chicken and Waffle. I am a sucker for chicken and waffles; it's hard for me to ever get anything else when there's chicken and waffles on the menu. So the food tasted exactly as I had imagined their food to taste like: rich, bold, flavorful, and oh so yummy. However, I felt the food was a bit too rich after a while. Halfway through the meal, it left me craving something fresh. Despite this, I absolutely loved Kaya's take on the chicken and waffle. The chicken had a spicy batter and the dish was topped with green onions and bacon, which added a little extra punch of flavor and differing textures to add some contrast to the dish. The Cuban was a simple sandwich, but it was done right. The bread was toasted to the perfect level of crispiness.

With brunch being this good, I am looking forward to coming back and trying out dinner!",2016-06-09 02:40:44

All of his restaurants are terrific and this one is no exception. Granted, I have only been here once (Its kinda far out there and I live in the Copa) but the one time I went was a great experience. I had some kind of chicken pesto sammich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was very tasty I think mainly because of the flavorful pesto that was on it. The sweet potato fries were good, however, since I am a sweet potato fries connoisseur, they were not the best I have had. However, they give you a mango salsa that does with them and that was pretty legit. Also got to try their BBQ chicken pizza. It was good but I think I am starting to lean toward not being a fan of BBQ pizza, the sauce it just too much for me on a pizza. Anyways. service was good and I loved the atmosphere outside.

Surprisingly, this place wasn't busy at all when we came - not sure if it may have been because we came around dinner time? There was only one other group that was playing on one of the life sized pool tables in the main area at the time when we left. There were a few of those tables in that main area when you walk in, as well as a few private rooms.  

A coworker had booked the VIP room for 1 hour for our group of 9 ahead of time since she had been to this place before. The VIP room had several small tables and chairs along the walls, which was great. There was also a TV mounted on the wall and of course, a life sized pool table with soccer balls in the middle. We were able to play a few rounds in that 1 hour and we noticed later that we were actually able to stay for longer than that. We were politely told that we could stay longer to finish our last round despite it being over our reserved time, which we appreciated. I really can't complain as we only paid about $13 per person, plus any drinks we had. Drink prices were on par with other bars and lounges. 

It seems that the lower ratings have to do more with some reviewers having really high expectations of this place, particularly in terms of food and customer service. I can't comment on the food aspect since we all had dinner elsewhere beforehand since our coworker mentioned that she didn't think that the food was that great when she came here before. Avoiding the food here seems to be the general consensus based on the reviews as well. I guess that's an area that could be improved on if this place wants to bring in more customers in the future. Customer service was fine in our opinion - we had no issues during our time there and when it came time to paying.

Overall, this place has a fun concept and recommended for larger groups. I would recommend trying it if you're in the area. Take it for what it is and if you go with the right group of people, you'll have fun!",2018-03-28 23:43:33

I will always order deep fried spicy pepper shrimp, they are so addictive. Once you ordr them once you will order them every time you go. The fried rices are all delicious, BBQ pork is solid and the crispy chili chicken is delicious too.

The server was very good, well knowledged of the food and could identify the dish by photo which we took many during our previous visit.

We started with the bruschetta and calimari appetizers. The bread they served this time wasn't quite the same as previously but still had the tasty white bean dip and also the olive tapenade. You can taste the depths of flavor in all their dishes. Totally well balanced flavors. They definitely taste everything they make and know exactly how muchthey needed to add if necessary. Kids had stuff off the menu which I think is a challenge for the kitchen, not difficult but can be easily messed up with imperfections of the dish screaming bad flavor or presentation. They respected all the ingredients used in in my children's dish including the prosciutto. My kids had a butter parmasean pasta with a heaping of prosciutto. They just sliced the whole ham over the dishes. Seriously great!!!! So many things to compliment the chefs that cooked us a fantastic meal again!!!!

Their expansive list of flavours provides value in coming back as I have been here twice. You get $1 off your next purchase if you bring back their take-out jars as well. 

The seating I'm not as big of a fan of, as they are not the friendliest for pairs of guests.

Then I saw how long the line was and thought ""OH this place is going to be good!""

First being the soup dumplings!
They really should have a diagram on how to eat these little morsels. I was presented with a bamboo steamer with dumplings, a side of ginger and vinegar, and a soup spoon. Okay? Luckily my friend who was with me showed me how to eat them. It was slightly embarrassing but enlightening. Google it if you are unsure how. The flavor is mellow yet delicious. The combination of ginger, vinegar, and soup gives this appetizer that great Umami taste!  Just don't wait too long to eat them or else they will dry out.

Braised Beef Soup Noodles:
The soup was very good and flavorful. The beef has a lot of tendons in it (not my favorite type of beef) but overall good. You have the option of getting Rice or flour noodles (wide or thin).  I like the flour noodles best. The rice noodles are light and thin; breaks apart easily. The flour noodles are more dense. It all depends on your preference.

Oxtail Soup Noodles:
I LOVE OXTAIL! Just sad that the oxtail they serve was small. But it sufficed my oxtail needs. You know it's cooked well when it falls off the bone. That's all I have to say about that!

Pork Belly Slider:
Not my favorite. 1) Too large 2) Dry bun 3) dry pork
It would be so much better and presentable if they made several small portions of the slider and served it that way. Or just make a bun instead. The steamed slider should be fluffy, like you are biting into a delicious cloud. Instead it had hard pieces like it was overly steamed. Lastly the pork wasn't that good, it was so dry.

Service/Space:
The service is fast and friendly. No complaints. There are some communal seating by the noodle makers. The restaurant space is very tight yet clean. It reminds me that I am in the city and I like that.

Overall, I love this place. I'm definitely a fan! And can't wait to try more dishes!",2015-03-26 15:27:22

I appreciate that they took the time to return my calls. I can't stand companies who do not follow up, listen to their customers, apologize and provide a solution. That is a sure way to lose a customer, and that is my biggest pet peeve! I'm one of those people that like to give others a chance, so I am willing to give their service department another try.  However, I am going to be very extra cautious from now on, and going to protect my finances by learning my owner's manual and familiarize myself with the components under the hood of my car. I'm also going to buy a diagnostic tool such as CarMD or ScanGauge II to my vehicle's OBD 2 port, and download an app to my phone to set up reminders. If I do find an issue with my car, I'm going to get two or three estimates from other independent smaller businesses to get competitive quotes and decide whether to get my repairs done here or not. Sometimes bigger companies who usually charge more don't mean better quality and work. If Larry H. Miller Nissan wants to gain my trust again and earn a 5-star review, they need to improve their service and have their employees double check their work to avoid this kind of problems with their customers.

Two years ago this was a rotation nightout spot for friends and I, so, I never had the chance to try out the place during early evening hours for food and drink. Fast forward to recently, seeing that Hi-Fi Kitchen across the street was ridic crowded compared to not as busy El Hefe, a friend and I decided to stop by for a drink and a snack. Upon entering we were told by one of the server/hostess girls to pick a table or sit at the bar. We both wanted to sit outside but saw all their high tops were taken and reluctantly sat at the bar. After a few mins, while waiting to order drinks, a table emptied out, and we snatched it up and this is where they get a one star. 

Personally they do a good job as a bar in old town during the weekends, they play okayish dance music, it's loud, it's happening, it's relevant. They have the douches out to play and they keep the nighttime masses liquored up BUT that's it. Service wise they fail miserably. As we sat at our table, we waited, and waited, and waited so more. There was a server who went by us to attempt to clean up (attempt because she didn't do much) another vacated table, she passed us yet again to check on another table, and passed us yet again just walking by. She could clearly see that we were sitting there with two menus, looking at it, and now bored looking at our phones, and not ONCE did she take the courtesy to stop by and offer a drink order or water. NOTHING. Let me add, it's a bit disconcerting as a customer when you hear the bar staff express concern that Hi-Fi seems really busy across the street while they talk about their lack of business on their side. With servers that do not provide service I can see why you ought to be worried. 

I'm a patient person, and I give props to good service where due but our last straw occurred when a group of girls (six in all) showed up, walked in a grabbed a table behind us on the patio, and lo behold, the SAME SERVER, walks up and assists them, hands out menus, and turns around and ignores us yet again.

If you do take your kids here, pay very good attention and make sure they do a thorough job.

Edited to add: Gotta laugh at the owner's response that they encourage parents to always inspect the haircuts.  Guess we can't have our husbands (who know nothing about hair) take the kids to get their haircut so they can make sure their stylists don't mess up.

The sandwiches range in price from 2-6$ which really is not bad for all the items you can get on the sandwich plus they all come with a choice of a size including bag of chips, animal crackers or vanilla wafers. I went with the peanut butter and Nutella sandwich pretty basic and very tasty. I also got the funky monkey which came with crunchy peanut butter, crushed up pretzels and chips with sliced bananas. It was amazing! We had a $25 gift card to spend which was actually hard so I also got a yogurt parfait which had granola and lots of fresh fruit. For dessert we got dirt- have not had that since I was a kid with gummy worms and all. I would love to go back for lunch as the are so many other sandwiches I want to try.

I drove a good 30 minutes from Scottsdale just to get a taste of my favorite biryani.
The Dum Biryani is something that Paradise always gets right but compared to the others in California especially Santa Clara this one is a let down.
It tastes nothing like the biryani one expects from a chain like Paradise (no fried onions and the flavor of the rice was just average).The Spice level i asked for was Medium but the biryani was too hot to handle.
The raita and mirchi ka salan were fine.This is not the quality one expects from Paradise,the biryani tasted like something you would get at an average Indian restaurant.

Definitely not worth the Drive or the Hype.

I came here for lunch and I knew exactly what I wanted to order since I read through the menu online the night before.

I got deep fried pickles which was made well in my opinion because I know it's hard to keep the batter on the pickles.

I've never had cornbread before and I wasn't disappointed at all. It was sweet and moist.

The mac-n-cheese was not amazing. I don't understand why it's considered a must have item according to many blogs and reviews. Personally I prefer KD's mac-n-cheese.

The main entree I got was the Harlem sandwich with sweet potato fries. If you read the description on the menu, it may put you off but I guarantee you that the combination of all the layers was delicious.

My parents are partial to their satay beef noodle soup because they have their own unique spice blend and it is quite good. I also enjoy their dumplings as well because they are so juicy and flavourful. 

But we do get their dun tong for take out - they only have one kind - but it is sooo good and you do get a HUGE pot of it good for at least 3 days - this is a specialty item and you do need to order at least a few days in advance - because it is 5 hrs worth of labour for the restaurant and sooo worth it.

At this point, we only go here 3 times a year or so due to it being fairly expensive. The fact that they a the chef's table and the kids club that basically gives an adult a free meal with a paid adult makes it worth it. We came here this time for my daughters birthday as it is her favorite place due to the food and he entertainment.

This place pretty much offers a 5 course meal with most of their dinner entrees. You start out with soup and a small salad. The soup is pretty good and always piping hot. The salad is ok but the ginger dressing is pretty tasty. Then comes, perhaps, the best part of the meal with the chicken fried rice. It is delicious!

My wife and I both got the Benihana Trio which gives you steak, chicken and jumbo shrimp. Add into this the fact that you get appetizer shrimp with your entree and it ends up being a lot of food. It all tastes great too! My daughters each got the Habachi Chicken. They also both love the chicken fried rice

You get an hour of classroom training on their topic of choice. Then you get to go & shoot a .22 pistol or bring your own gun. 

Check out their website for info & pricing. 
I've always been a little uneasy about guns but found myself a little more comfortable the second time around. I will be doing other classes that they offer in the future to help get more experienced & one day possibly even buy my own gun! 

The instructors are AWESOME!! Very well knowledgable, experienced & have lots of patience. Darius has taught the classes both times I've attended & Dianna has joined in too! There have been other instructors in the classroom the first time I went but I forgot their names. (sorry) but they are ALL great!! 

I got 1:1 time with an instructor when it was time to go shooting. It helped ease my nervousness & the more I shot the easier it got. The second time I went I went thru my amnio so fast I was proud & sad @ the same time! lol

They have different target sheets to choose from with zombies, circus like game,  and plain ones, etc. You even get to take it home with you!! I've been hanging mine up in my garage...lol

I can't wait to go to next months class!! 

Their store is filled with lots of merchandise. I ended up buying a purse size flashlight that can also be used as a weapon if needed, in a pretty pink! (My favorite color) Along with a purse size pepper spray (pink in color of course!). I did end up also purchasing some protective eye wear & ear protectors (for my future visits)...yes both in pink.......I didn't spend a lot for all these products due to them having great prices & you also get 10% off on Ladies night.

We found this place by searching Yelp, since we couldn't find the restaurant we set out to go to.  Talk about unassuming -  when we entered the front door, it felt as if we were on Let's Make a Deal:  should we choose what was behind Door #1 or Door #2?  They were marked, so it was a no-brainer, but it sure seemed strange.

We were greeted and seated right away, and were instantly impressed by the friendliness of the waitresses.  The good impression continued when we looked at the menu, and couldn't believe the prices.  I can't remember the last time I saw a half-carafe of house wine at a restaurant, and even back then, it always cost more than the price of two glasses of wine.  Here it was less!  The house wine is Barefoot, and it's our favorite cheap wine.

I ordered Chicken with Spinach and Portobello mushrooms, and was easily able to substitute mashed potatoes for the rice pilaf.  This is the rare time that the live dish actually looked better than it did in the menu's photo, which looked like canned spinach.  But no, this was fresh, and the mashed were homemade and had what seemed to be scallions.  The chicken was very good, but could have benefited from a minute or two less cooking.  Hubby had the blackened wild salmon.  Usually the first ingredient in the blackening seasoning is salt, so I pass it up.  But this time it wasn't overly salty.  Bravo!!  I like my salmon slightly undercooked, so my comment for the chicken goes for the salmon, too.  But Mr. +1 likes all his food cooked until rigor mortis sets in, so it was perfect for him.  It did taste wonderful.  His salmon came with fresh mixed vegetables, and he stayed with the rice pilaf, and left no grain uneaten.

Both entrees were supposed to come with soup or salad, but we were told at the outset that the soup had been all slurped up and was gone; it was a cheeseburger soup, so I guess we were better off not having the opportunity to ingest all those calories. I know at least one of us would have gotten it, and the other of us would have tasted it, then tasted again.  We did get a perfectly ordinary iceberg salad with excellent homemade dressings, and found out later that next time we can ask for romaine.

Our waitress, Robin, was perfect, and funny, too.  We had a thoroughly enjoyable experience and a very good meal.  The best part was the absence of sticker shock at the end.  We'll go back soon, and often, to what other Yelpers have described as a hidden gem.  It is for sure!!",2013-06-09 08:14:05

I was unaware of Empire Bagels up to the time that my Yelp friend Lea checked-in here. I was under the impression that I tried all of Vegas's independent bagel shops. Lea's check-in developed into a mental bookmark that I was going to erase the next time I was in the southwest part of the Valley. 

  Yesterday morning, I erased this mental bookmark at the time that I stopped here on the way to a Summerlin park adventure. The first thing that I noticed from the parking lot is that it is next to Starbuck's. What a clever concept having a bagel shop next to Starbuck's. Customers can pick up a bagel sandwich to bring into Starbuck's and others could bring in a Starbuck's coffee or Frapucino to compliment a bagel. 

  When I walked in, the woman working behind the counter greeted me. She let me take my time ordering off the menu displayed on the wall. I ordered a Nova lox with cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, and numerous toppings for $8.99. At 11 a.m., they were out of a handful of bagels. I was satisfied with a sesame bagel. The sandwich was good (3 stars) at the same time it fell short of the New York bagels (5 stars) that I vividly remember. The sandwich included a can of a Coke Beverage and bag of chips, which reminds me more of a Jason's Deli that authentic New York Bagel shop. New York bagel shops generally follow the practice of including either potato salad or macaroni salad plus a pickle with the sandwich. In my taste, fresh potato salad or macaroni salad tastes better than a bag of chips. In Las Vegas, the Bagel Cafe follows this practice. 

   Noticeably missing in Empire Bagels was the scent of fresh baked bagels. The smell of fresh baked bagels is one of the most delicious smells. It is evidence that the bagels are being made fresh and on the premises. In New York, bagel shops are also called bagel bakeries. To be fair, the scent of fresh baked bagels is missing in all of the bagel shops that I have visited then consequently reviewed in Las Vegas. The upshot was that this bagel was missing the softness and warmness of many bagels I have enjoyed up in the Empire State. If a five star New York Bagel shop was at this location, I assume it would be so popular that the Clark County Highway Department would expedite installing a traffic light at Fort Apache and Patrick. 

   I am happy that there is a New York style bagel shop eleven miles southwest of New York-New York. In my heart, I know there are better bagel shops 3,000 miles northeast of New York - New York. In conclusion, I  rate Empire Bagels at a 3 stars equals good.",2015-02-10 05:35:42

My old friend was in town, and we hadn't seen each other in years.  We planned on getting together, having facials and massages, then laying around the pool all afternoon before a fancy dinner.

I had a gift certificate from spafinder and thought that the spa at the Valley Ho seemed like a great choice!

We arrived 15 minutes early, were checked in, showed our robes, given lockers, and told to wait in the waiting room for our technicians to fetch us.

We waited.
And waited.
And waited.

After approx 40 minutes (which went by fast as we're old friends and had a lot of catching up to do), I poked my head towards reception and was told ""We forgot you were here, we're sorting it out""

Another 20 minutes pass, and employees start trying to devise plans to accomodate both of us and both of our appointments.  

The hour long wait cost us our much anticipated pool time, they put my friend in a hotel room with a mobile table for her massage, and my afternoon of relaxation turned to extreme anxiety and disappointment.

They did not apologize, simply took our money and turned their noses up at us.

I luuurve that they sell Penn Ave Fish Company sushi to go so that I can just grab that for lunch instead of fighting the lunch crowd at the actual restaurant. 

They also always have a plethora of soup options Sometimes 8 at a time! And although half of them sound a little scary to me, I can usually always find that delicious tomato bisque I totally crave. I also try to convince myself that it's healthy even though it's probably made with a gallon of heavy cream. But that's beside the point. 

Annnnnd, their baked goods! You would never guess that they would have such a great bakery, but geeez! It's fantastic! IF there's free samples out, please take them. I watch for no one looking at me in the deli and scarf at least five samples down if I can! But everything is baked fresh to order, cookies, cakes, scones, pies. It's a great place to order a cookie tray, which I KNOW yinz Pittsburghers love! 

The added perk to this place is thee most friendliest, cheeriest, funniest guy that runs the check out line at the to go good counter that just brightens my days with his prerequisite fist pump. I'll totally fist pump for this place!",2011-02-01 02:50:14

I've been to both the College location and the Massey Hall location of Frans and both were quite good, with the Massey Hall location being my favourite. I expected more of the same from this location when I brought my boyfriend here before a game at the ACC.

The menu at every Frans is the same but the execution definitely is not. I ordered the grilled cheese and I recall on other menus it was a triple decker grilled cheese and was always nice and crispy, cheesy and came with shoestring fries. They've changed up the fries at this location, not the best. It was an okay dinner but it really didn't live up to the Frans I'm used to. Service was fast enough but we were sat at a table DIRECTLY beside the kitchen, which is a horrible location to sit.

I want to talk about the service first because it was excellent!  Our server's name is Aric and he was pleasant and attentive from start to finish.  He answered my questions, was patient when I switched my order and made sure our bottomless drinks and sides were refilled quickly.  I could not have asked for better service!

As for the good food - my son had a pepperoni pizza which looked like it was freshly basked, almost artisan like.  My son had broccoli for a side and since it was bottomless (and he must have really liked the broccoli) he asked for two more orders of it.  Can't complain with a kid liking his veggies!  My husband had the Siracha Burger I believe and said that it was good.  He remarked about how good the onions were.  I had a Smoky BBQ burger which was not too sweet and just the right size.  I had sweet potato fries as my side order and it was delicious.  I ended up getting a second order to share with my husband and son.  For my drink, I had the raspberry cream soda, which was also bottomless so I had a second order followed by water.  It was very good.

Pricing wise - there were definitely some pricier burgers but others were reasonable.  With the bottomless drinks and sides, it makes it worth the price!

We went on a Wednesday night so it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away.  I think there was sufficient parking and the interior decor was ok - nothing spectacular but definitely refreshed and fairly modern.  Looks like they have a bar as well.

Papaya salad was very good, right away I was impressed. It had the perfect balance of sweetness and tarness. It wasn't too light or salty. Just a perfect little plate of salad.

After the papaya salad, I havd a very high expectation from the rest of food which took a while to get. We sat and watched customers get turn away and waited. It's a small kitchen! Give them a break!!

Pad thai was pretty good, a little sticky. All the noodles got stuck together, but that shows the noodle was not cooked with two cups of oil.

Green curry was only reason I deduct a star from the rating. It was a little salty and I did not find it tasty at all. I mean, curry should taste complex and rich, but this one did not have either character.

We've been wanting to try this place for awhile so it actually worked out perfectly. We came on a Friday around 6 pm with 6 people and were able to easily get a table. Throughout our entire meal the servers were super helpful and friendly.

To start the meal we took advantage of their happy hour specials and went with some house oysters, belly buns, and crispy egg rolls. We also had to add in some drinks of course too so we shared the asahi pitcher of beer and a sake flight. Hands down my favorite part of the entire meal was the house oysters. They were super fresh and came topped with a ponzu sauce and jalapeño. I honestly could have eaten just a dozen of these by myself. As for the belly buns and egg rolls they were just alright to me. I felt they could have been a bit more flavorful, but overall still good. Next for entrees I went with the garlic noodles and fish tacos. The noodles were good, but a little bit bland. I added some hot sauce to give it a little extra kick. The fish tacos though, amazing! They're a bit on the smaller side, but the perfect size with a side of noodles.

I often hear about acts only after I've missed them because these aren't folks who are being promoted to the gills by their record companies.  You might have a week filled with Lyle Lovett, a mariachi festival, Cyndi Lauper and D.L. Hugely.  Jazz, funk, Tejano, R&B, Gospel, Punk, Classic Rock and comedy.  You name it - it plays it.  

This is one of those places where it's actually true that there isn't a bad seat in the house.  BUT - it's important to know that some shows will not play in the round, and some will actually use a backdrop.  I've even been to a show where they roped off part of the seating so we could only sit in one area.  I've only been to a few shows here that were open seating - most of them have been reserved.  Though a few of those were only assigned by price - inner level one price, outer level was another price.  

This is an older theater and seats are kinda tight - but it's not too bad.  Just plan to get cozy with your neighbor.  The other cool thing about the place is that there is a little bar/nightclub feeling in the area outside the lobby area.  Full bars, often some good music playing.  Folks often getting a bit more social.

Seriously this has to be a one off? 

On the grocery story theme sweet potatoes, canned, no gravy,undercooked cornbread stuffing, grainy cranberry sauce  rounded off with a lacklustre dessert which was still thawing.

Reasons could include that the special exhibit (Pope John Paul II) was in it's final week and there were guided tours going on. Regardless I have never had a museum visit like this in my entire life and I have been in huge museums all over Europe, museums where motor coaches just dropped groups off, and museums with tons of kids. 
The special exhibit was a maze connecting four rooms. All the people on the tours and those who did not want the tours had to walk through the hallways of this maze following the same path into one of the four rooms. There were two tour groups in front of us and two behind us and more forming. We didn't particularly want a tour group, but there was really not a way to avoid it. The female tour guide in front of us had a very large group and spoke very softly. I could not always hear her above the loud male tour guide behind me and the random sound effects (e.g., plane bombing noises) throughout the exhibit. My suggestions include making the exhibit a bit more spacious, limiting the size of the various groups a bit more strictly and eliminating sounds that add no value. 
Aside from all that the content of the museum's special exhibit was good and arranged in a chronological story form making understanding it and piecing other bits of history together with it not terribly difficult. I have driven past this museum quite often for a long time now and finally decided to go because of this special exhibit. The special exhibit area is larger than the permanent collection so I would recommend watching to see if a special exhibit interests you before making a trip out here.

In reality it was much more than tapas: it was small plates of food covering almost every cuisine I know of. Calling this a tasting would be like calling World War II a limited skirmish. Our waitress brought us out 24 different small dishes (including heftier items such as bouillabaise, a chimichurri striploin, venison, and a cheese plate) over the course of the evening, and we washed it down with the house white, a nice Vinho Verde for only $4 a glass! This is a rare restaurant in town that uses a lot of local ingredients, but is not gastronomically hamstrung by the idea.  The flavours were excellent (right from the ceviche through to the lemon tart), and it is clear that the chef is as excited about cooking as we are about eating.  I am normally stingy with my stars, but this one gets five.

The decor is urban chic, and the service attentive, if uninformed. My wife and a friend had gone for lunch, and the quality is consistent with our AYCE experience. Clearly the AYCE night is a major loss leader for this newly opened restaurant, so get it while you can.  Seriously, I mean it.

rnDtFiAYx1hplAFcmnRFUg,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,6aDfalYZOkWzwtVRA2wYaA,4,24,12,21,"People usually tell me that all they know about Pakistani food is that it's kind of like Indian food, or that they remember the character Babu Bhatt from Seinfeld whose business plummets when he changes his franks and beans joint into a Pakistani restaurant upon Jerry's suggestion, only to come back in the series finale courtroom scene and accuse Jerry of destroying his life. 

Pakistani food *is* like Indian food. More accurately, Punjabi food. That's because more than half of Punjab actually remained in Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947, and Punjab is far and away the most populous province, thus heavily influencing the national cuisine. Punjabi cooking revolves around the tandoor, a clay oven to grill meats and chicken and bake naans to crispy, doughy perfection. Because of this, when Pakistanis go out to eat, they judge restaurants by how good their tandoori specialties are, and not as much the curries or vegetarian dishes (because everyone eats those nightly at home anyway). And there is one ingredient commonly found in Pakistani cuisine that you'll be hard-pressed to find in an Indian restaurant: beef. Lots and lots of beef. Whether it's ground for seekh kebabs or its shanks slow cooked into a spicy stew called nihari and topped with fresh ginger, cilantro, fresh squeezed lemon juice and green chili, beef plays an important role in Pakistani cooking. 

There is one dish, though, that is not typical of Pakistani cooking. Actually, it's not typical of Indian cooking either:

Chicken tikka masala.

That's because chicken tikka masala was created in England, NOT the Punjab. It's the chop suey of south Asian cuisine, and to me, depressing when so many people judge Indian restaurants by this one dish that no Indian or Pakistani person I know has ever grown up eating. When I first told my mom I went to a restaurant and had chicken tikka masala, she responded, ""What the hell is that?"" This coming from a woman whose father had one of the busiest restaurants in Karachi back in the day.

All that said, let's get to Z-Grill itself (my apologies for the long-winded intro). It's the mini-restaurant nestled in the far corner of Zam Zam Market. You walk up to the counter to order, and then sit in one of three small adjacent booths. No real fine dining atmosphere, as you're eating in a market. The Z-Grill serves both the aforementioned seekh kebabs and nihari, along a number of other dishes such as goat karahai (a curry dish), chicken biryani (a spiced rice dish with chicken), reshami chicken (skewered boneless chicken breast pieces), samosas, and on the weekends, aloo paratha (a flatbread stuffed with spiced potatoes) and a plate of channa/halwa/aloo bhaji with puris (a traditional but diet-busting brunch dish consisting of fry bread, spiced garbanzos, spiced potatoes, and sweet halva made from semolina). 

I've eaten here on a couple occasions now, and must say that even though the menu is pretty limited (barely any curries - and no chicken tikka masala), what they do make is really tasty and is definitely worth the drive over. First trip I had the chicken biryani, which was full of flavor and also full of chicken (very important), and some tasty seekh kababs, accompanied by raita and kachumbar (our version of pico de gallo). The biryani was a little greasier than it needed to be, so I hope they temper using so much oil next time. 

Second time was a couple hours ago, this time bringing Ayesha S along with me. I was starving and ordered way more than necessary. I ordered an aloo paratha and the weekend brunch plate, Ayesha an aloo paratha and reshami chicken. Drink selection in the little fridge included a number of Arab yogurt drinks, Indian sodas Thums Up, Limca and Miranda and Pakistani soda Pakola (in both original cream soda and lemon-lime flavors). I think my paratha was great and was also pretty filling. Which was too bad, because I could hardly make a dent in my brunch plate. But from what I did taste, the halwa, channa, aloo bhaji and the puris were all really tasty and could quickly become a big danger for me as I try to lose my November/December gut. Prices are reasonable and you pay at the cash register in the front of the market. They need to work on the music, which is this morose Arabic violin playing on an endless loop. Kind of incongruous with the rest of the place, but that's a minor detail.
----
In conclusion, Z-Grill is not going to be a prime destination for if you want the full on Indian dining experience. The menu is limited to a select number of Pakistani/Punjabi items which the owner, who is from Lahore, has taught his small team of cooks to do, but do well. They have a weekday lunch buffet which is limited to just four dishes, and its casual atmosphere may make it a better option for takeout. But the food is the real deal, and I am happy.

4 stars for now.

They support local business and promote local brews, which makes this place a cornerstone for good eats. The ambiance is fantastic, with tables that have that butcher block nouveau feel. It's comfortable and the service is fantastic. What's even better is the food.

The menu has an amazing variety of Asian and American fare, from their in-hoise cured pork belly to the Butcher Block (the Vegas meat vendor, yes) burger, and their varieties of poutine. We have the chicken wings, Asian style, and their made from scratch burrata with ginger apricot chutney a try for starters. The wings hit hard with great soy and gochuchang flavor, crispy on the first bite, and finger licking good--literally.  The burrata is a gentle cloud of cheese goodness that is enhanced by the chutney. 

The butcher block burger is so well seasoned and cooked to perfection that squeezing down with my fingers against the bun bring out a lot of juice. The toppings don't overpower the great flavor of the burger itself, but compliment it with every bite. On top do the beautiful bun, it's a perfect meal with or without fries. However, the fries here are made with love, so I strongly suggest ordering a side with aioli. The hot Fried chicken is spicy, crunchy goodness topped with cool lettuce and pickles. It's just a great chicken sandwich that satisfies any southern chicken cravings. I highly recommend the poutine made with gravy made in house and some cheese curds and a fried egg. Lovely, crispy fries that don't get soggy even with gravy, it was creamy, perfectly flavored goodness. I wanted to lick the paper! I know now that every visit here will include poutine no matter what.

Dessert was amazing, served in the cutest jars and with crumbles that felt like my childhood cookie dreams on a plate. The dark chocolate dessert topped with sea salt and crumble, olive oil drizzle and roasted hazelnuts was crunchy, chocolate goodness. Almost close to a ganache but still at a mousse consistency, I enjoyed every chocolatey, nutty bite. Their cheesecake topped with yuzu and served with strawberries and a shortbread crumble with olive oil drizzle made my night! Light, citrus tones and sweet cookie crumble made this dessert a must for those wanting a sweet but light finish.

Paired with local beers, each part of the experience was fun and a true experience. I love the fact that the owner and chef work hard to make everything from scratch, because it shows with every bite. I appreciate the care and love in the food, and look forward to our trip through the menu soon.

One point of concern in the area of customer safety is after about 8:30 in the evening, they lock and block 2 out of the 3 available exits. Even though it's printed above each door that they are to remain unlocked during business hours. I'm sure this is meant to curb shoplifters from sneaking out of the store while staff is reduced. I would think customers being able to exit the store quickly in case of an emergency  would trump what little loss they suffer due to shoplifting.

Unfortunately this was Not a good interpretation of middle eastern (Persian) food.  As a middle eastern person ,I'm very offended by the owners attempt to sell a dish that is of very poor quality and taste. I get it , if ur not busy than its hard to put fresh food on a plate.

2. Unclean (sticky tables , dirty floors ) 
3. Beef tenderloin is not fresh and not seasoned well . Tasted old, I had to spit it out .
4. Rice is only decent .
5. Chicken is seasoned poorly and lacks that flavor that should be in this type of chicken . Don't try a recreate the wheel by adding Rosemary where it don't belong . 
6. Bread was only cooked partially as one end was still doughy. 
7. When I asked bout gyro meat, they say it's pre-cooked . Gyro meat should come fresh as it cooks and turns .  
Good luck with this place as ur days are numbered for ur lack of care to the business, quality and taste.  I've noticed the owner likes to respond to reviews . Don't bother . Focus on delivering a better product. 
Don't worry , he responded .

I had the carne asada platter and it was good - steak was tender and flavorful. My friend had the carnitas, which was disappointingly dry. The freshly made tortillas were mucho goodo, and the trio of salsas that they deliver with the chips are quite tasty!  The rice and beans were ho-hum, but it is pretty hard to make those jump off of any plate.

Margaritas were yummy, but overpriced, although this IS Vegas and we WERE at the Hard Rock, so it was expected.

Over a week later, my nail color is still intact and free of chips. Mike is pretty funny too. At one point I was confused between three colors and Mike and Jackie chose one for me.

Once again lunch comes with fresh Italian bread. Their entrees give you option of soup or salads.  I had Italian wedding soup, strange but all pasta mini balls, little carrot, onion, spinach, or meatballs.  Salad was better, homemade Italian dressing and fresh green stuff. 

The ravioli was available as combo or either meat or cheese. Why have only one?  The ravioli are big, but you only get for of them. For $8 it was ok with soup. The sauce is best part. The rigatoni comes with one giant meatball. The sauce is same unless otherwise listed in menu.

I liked the feel of the place and noticed an outdoor eating area - we would definitely come back when the weather gets warmer so we can dine in the sun!

I never order cocktails at restaurants and usually stick to water or iced tea, but I decided to go crazy and try the Coral Gables - it was delicious and not overly sweet. Yum. My husband had a beer. They had an interesting cocktail list and a really nice assortment of specialty sodas/lemonades. I would probably try one of those next time since I am not a big drinker.

The food...(I am a vegetarian and husband is not)

The biscuits were delicious and we really liked the butter and preserves to spread on top. Too bad it was only one biscuit per person - I could have eaten another one, but didn't want to ask with our food coming. (Um, I also had some Campbell's Cupcakes sitting in my car, so you know.)

I started with the Ruby Cado salad which was spinach, avocado, blood orange, almonds, and a light dressing. It was really tasty and a decent portion for the $7 price tag. My husband and I split the Smoked Gouda Mac n Cheese, which was a great portion for $5.50 - it was a really good macaroni and cheese and we both liked it a lot. My husband had the Pork Bun ($10) that came with homemade chips - he said it was really good. I had the Sweet Potato Ravioli ($12) which was awesome - it had greens (could have been more for us veg people!), goat cheese, pecans, and cranberries on top. The portion was decent for lunch, but I think the price was a little high on this one. 

When we looked at the menu online, they had several vegetarian options that sounded really good, but at lunch there was only really one veg entree option (unless you did soup or salad or an app). It would have been nice to have a couple more options during lunch time...especially on Good Friday when many do not eat meat anyway! 

Overall, we were really happy with our first experience here and we would definitely come back - for lunch or brunch. The dinner prices are a little steep. It was a great little place I would recommend to others.",2013-03-29 22:34:54

But now that I've been to Beauty & Essex a couple times, I feel like this place is legit.

Hands down, my favorite dish on the menu is actually the garganelli. It's hearty but with just enough kick at the end to make it really interesting. My other must-haves are the tomato soup dumplings and chicken meatballs. The caesar toast is my favorite of the toast offerings but to be honest I like all of them; the wedge salad is also killer but I'd prioritize other, more interesting / different things on the menu first.

And don't forget dessert. The affogato milkshake shot (an affogato with godiva liquer) is one of my top guilty pleasures anywhere - I'll admit I don't usually even wait until dessert to have one.

We got a free daybed so cheers to that.  We had a good time despite all these problems. Oh and the waitresses have cool monokinis?

If I had to pay though, I probably would just go to the Palazzo pool because it wasn't that different.  The Palazzo pool is bigger and has free lounge chairs after all.",2011-06-14 08:14:15

DELICIOUS.

The tuna tartare is soooo good. My husband was even surprised how good it is. It gives your palate so much flavor.

Udon with tempura is also delicious. We've been trying to find some decent udon for a while now. We had a hard time finding good udon compared to the one at Sushi Catcher. THIS IS IT. Their udon is different, but very good. I think I like it more than the one at Sushi Catcher. It has a slight sweet, seaweed flavor to it. The tempura and fish balls that come with it are so yummy too.

Oyshi roll is basically a cucumber roll. It's decent, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. I had better cucumber rolls elsewhere.

The Popcorn lobster roll is interesting. It's literally popcorn lobster on top of a california roll. If they sold the popcorn lobster by itself, I would honestly buy it. It's really good. I don't care much for california roll.",2015-03-18 15:37:55

Another recommendation was the bread pudding of the day- so of course I had to jump in dessert, the current flavor was Reese Peanut Butter cup, and boy was it good, I loved the cream and sauce m, it was a perfect balance and it was moist and not soggy, so the texture and flavor was in point.

We both love Italian food and Esther's Kitchen came highly recommended to us by the chef at Sparrow + Wolf.  We certainly couldn't ignore the word of a talented chef at a restaurant we'd just dined at and loved.  Even though it was a Wednesday night a little after 6PM, the dining room was packed and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  Thankfully, we had dinner reservations and were seated immediately.

We ordered a couple of appetizers to share, the Ricotta Gnudi ($15) and the Polpette (meatballs) ($11).  As I learned, the name of the dish ""Ricotta Gnudi"" is actually a bit redundant since gnudi by definition is a gnocchi-like dumpling made with ricotta.  Regardless of its name or definition   They were fluffy, light, ricotta pillows complimented nicely by beets and pistachio pesto.  The polpette were moist, juicy, and flavorful and served with a piquant red sauce.  For my entrée, I had the Bucatini alla Amatriciana ($16).  We were informed that all of the pasta was made fresh in house.  My bucatini, a pasta style that I had not previously tried, definitely had that taste and mouth feel of fresh pasta.  It was paired with a nicely seasoned, spicy, red sauce.  My dish was absolutely delicious.  For dessert, we shared a Budino (butterscotch pudding) ($8) and a glass of amaro ($9).  It was a sweet, but not overly sweet, ending to our meal.  Service was exceptional as we were made to feel like guests in someone's home.  Esther's Kitchen offered outstanding quality, new (for me) Italian food experiences, and value.  It was the most pleasant surprise of our time in Vegas.

The matcha latte was really nice and smooth, it had a great matcha flavour to it and some sweetness to balance it out. It's probably one of the sweeter drinks on the menu.
The hojicha latte, on the other hand, is very strong and has an almost chocolate/coffee flavour to it. It tasted very smooth and creamy with less sugar than the matcha. I'd describe the hojicha latte as the adult and brooding version of the matcha.
The matcha rare cheesecake was quite soft and fluffy. It wasn't too sweet and came with a little scoop of red bean paste. It was a really nice light dessert!
The matcha walnut brownie had a great texture to it, likely because of the walnuts. I really love walnuts in any dessert, so I'm a little bias with this one. However, the brownie had much less of a distinct matcha flavour than the cheesecake.

My cat is indoors-only, and I have never bathed him myself. I called Galloping Groomer because he hates the car and I liked the idea of minimizing his stress time by taking the car ride out of the equation by having someone pull up to my place. I took advantage of their convenient 7am appointment so that I could handle the grooming before work. 

Making the appointment was easy, and my groomer, Kristi, was right on time. She came in and built rapport with my cat and was very patient as he clawed her shoulder, drawing blood, as she carried him out to the van! She was also patient with me: she allowed me to stay with my cat throughout the process, and helped calm me down by explaining everything step by step and assuring me that even though my cat was basically screaming, that he was okay (apparently she stops immediately if they start heavy panting or have an accident). 

I was very impressed with the office's follow-up call several days later to ask me how my experience was -- very good customer service. 

Overall I am glad that my cat and I got through it. Kristi was great with him and I can see why people call her the cat whisperer. My cat was still pretty traumatized by the entire experience so I won't be doing it super regularly, but he felt ""so fresh and so clean clean"" afterwards so I know it is worth doing at least every 1-2 years.

Admission is $15 and that includes the skate rental. I assume this is an all-day rental as there are no other price options. Tickets and Skate Pick-Up/Drop-Off is located on the left wall prior to entering the rink.

There's a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf drink truck located on the left side of the rink that serves cold and hot beverages. They offer their signature Ice Blended standard coffee, tea, lattes, flavored lattes, tea lattes and their iced counterparts, and of course, hot chocolate or vanilla. The prices range from $3-5.

Restrooms are conveniently located between the rink and the skate pick-up/drop-off office.

The rink is a nice size and seems to be larger or possibly the same size as the popular rink at The Cosmopolitan. There are a few benches surrounding the east side of the rink, but not nearly enough to support many people hanging out. Also, there are no fire pits or snacks (ahem, s'mores?). So, this rink is for ice skating only and the occasional hot (or cold) beverage break.

The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, and the service was good.  We were all laughing at how quick they were to refill our bread actually, even after we had told them we'd had enough.  They were good at refilling the water glasses quickly also, and I was pleased to see that all 7 entrees arrived at the same time and no one said their food was cold like it had been waiting for the other's to finish.

I had the peach/basil julep drink, which was good but expensive.  For dinner I had the stuffed swordfish with olive paste, my husband had the whole roasted chicken, and we shared a side of the creamy polenta.  Everything was nicely presented and the portion sizes were good.  My entree was very good, and the others at the table all liked the sauce that came with my husband's chicken, although he didn't like it much himself.  He liked our polenta, but I thought it was runny and tasted too much like dairy and not enough like corn.  A couple people at our table were unhappy with the lack of vegetarian selections on the menu.  They ended up getting the gnocci and said it was very bland and were disappointed with the amount of tomato in the sauce.

My biggest complaint about this restaurant is with the menu.  It's terrible.  We are a well educated and well traveled group, but there were just so many words on the menu that we were unfamiliar with.  When there are a few new things, it's nice and you feel like you're learning and it adds to the experience.  But when you're with a semi-large group and you all want to ask about 3 or 4 items, it's just too much hassle.  We used our phones to look up a few things, but gave up on the rest.  The other major problem with the menu is it's lack of descriptions of the dishes as a whole.  Even for things that were easy to understand, like the whole roasted chicken my husband ordered, you're forced to ask what it comes with (potatoes and greens) because it's not listed.  For someone like me who often chooses a dish based on the sides, that's a huge deal.  And I'm not going to ask about 5 or 6 entrees when there are 6 other people waiting to order.  If we were dining with just 2 people and I was trying to choose between 2 or 3 dishes, it wouldn't be as big of a problem.  

Overall, the service was good and there might be dozens of things on the menu I'd love, but unless they change their menu I won't be back.",2012-05-21 13:42:13

The service was horrible. The server literally came over twice the whole dining experience. If she can't handle so many tables at once, maybe the management is to blame.

Spoke to the manager in the purple/blue shirt and he was a joke. He was arrogant and refused to admit the restaurant server had any issues or the fact service was at a snail pace.

Aside from the hype of the random meat available, this place is pretty neat.  The ambience of the dangling lights, the communal table setting.  It's a very chill place to have hot dogs at.  There are a variety of beer, but I don't drink alcohol so I wouldn't know how that goes.

The hot dog itself, it was alright.  The rabbit was juicy, very subtle.  If you're not that adventurous with your food, rabbit is a safe choice.  Kangaroo is more gamey, but not as strong as bison.  I say this because bison really caught me off guard.  If I would go back again, I'd go with the rabbit.  

You have a list of sauces to choose from, that was cool.  You also don't have to have it hot dog style, you can try the curry-wvsrt, in which they slice it up for you and have sauce on top.  We had the wvrst sauce and rosemary for our fries.  It was tasty, but not too strong, so you can dip the entire fry and not feel overwhelmed.  I don't really know why the duck fat is a ""must try!"".  It's fries.  It was tasty, but I wouldn't say it's awmygard good.  

I recommend this place to people who would like those different meat.  I find it a bit overpriced if you're just going to get a beef dog, because I can't imagine it having any wow factor.

Granted I rarely go during peak hours which are crazy busy here and they have mentioned before they were understaffed but at least the checkout is fast when there is a crowd. They have been nice and helpful when we needed something. 

They keep the store neat. I like that even though I come late, they don't have aisles inconveniently cluttered with pallets to re stock. They take out a few at a time it seems because from 10pm-3am when I do majority of shopping, its not overly crazy. Go to Wal Mart down the street and sometimes the stockers get in the way.

One thing that drives me nuts is bad produce. They keep up with theirs and I appreciate that as I've been to a few that the fruit at the bottom is rotten out.

UPDATE 7/5 So for a little bit I was getting worried because the produce was looking sparse/not as fresh last month, but it's starting to look pretty good again.  There are some ""off"" times in every neighborhood market- It seems though I have felt that way about almost every market in Vegas. Seems they hired some new people so hopefully that helps peak hour service for all you morning folk.

The styles from the milk teas, my favorite the sea salt creme (not idea what it is but all I know is creme layer on top, and once stir around makes the world go around in perfect tea harmony), or slush. Think missing one other style. As you can imagine am sure there is something for everyone. The guys are extremely knowledgeable about the Tea they serve very impressed. They can even break down history lesson if you want. My first visit tried the Mango Sea Salt Creme. I mention earlier talk about refreshing drink! It not only had the right amount of mango flavor but add the Creme it was divine. I associated more like Thai Ice Tea with the Creme but at WHOLE another level cause Mango much more refreshing and more addicting. If you like sweet drink any of the Sea Salt Creme only way. 

My second visit tried the Berry Lovers Crepe. Talk about all giddy for Crepes. I went with my roommates for desserts after dinner. My roommate was telling me never seen me more excited about food. It been long time recall having good crepe. The pictures saw on yelp looked amazing. I watching the gentlemen put together the crepe fresh, every step putting on the fresh fruit, whip cream, nutella, and then the kicker green tea ice cream. It really was seeing artist painting his mona lisa. Truly looked that good had no idea the best way to attack it. I was in awe of it. The flavors was unreal good. The combination of nutella and green tea ice cream. Never thought of or think would be that addicting. It was beyond addicting was the perfect marriage of flavors. All the fresh fruit the strawberries, blueberries, and think bananas. No bruises on any of the fruit, all looked hell of fresh, and each one tasted sweet. The Green Tea Ice Cream you would have to add on. The Green Tea Ice Cream is by far the best Green Tea Ice Cream ever had in life. I asked them if could order scoop of it by itself the next time. It super expensive stuff they could not afford sell it by the scoop. I can understand why cause the depth of the ice cream unreal. Never had one that strong of green tea flavor but yet perfect balance nice creamy and still taste like ice cream. The portion size if great. My roommates shared one while I eat whole one myself. I made room for dessert. lol. I also ordered the Taro Slush with boba wash it all down. The scoop of fresh Taro on top really nice touch and tasted awesome. I love the color of the Taro in drinks and the Taro Slush not only looked the part but tasted the part. If looking for filling drink the Taro Slush is the way to go. Between the crepe and Taro Slush. I could barely stand up for all the food/drink., 

My third visit tried the Coconut milk tea. Talk about Haupia! It was the perfect liquid Haupia drink. So so so refreshing. 

Only draw back is the place is small so when it gets crowded no place sit down. The decor is pretty plain outside of the cool Brew Tea Bar sign. I enjoy the asian style tables. The way they display all the base teas in glass jars. The fact that can see them make the crepes. Cool. It perfect entertainment for the kids. The whole staff at Brew Tea Bar is super friendly, know their Tea, and by the second visit all within same week the guy remembered my name. They have stamp card program ten stamps the next one free. 

Brew Tea Bar is great place go anytime of the day just chill with friends.",2015-08-14 21:55:18

Is it wrong that I ordered a second serving of the duck fat fries?  I couldn't help myself.

So from a recommendation from My T, I ordered the Wagyu Rib Cap... it is a slightly different cut from the Wagyu Rib Eye, and just $3 more.  According to our server, it is a special cut from the top of the ribs, and slightly more flavorful than the rib eye.  Honestly, I bet they are both delicious.  My medium rib cap came out, it was tender as all tenderness can be.  I had to resist eating it within 10 seconds.  Our sides were the trio of mashed potato (Horseradish, Sour cream and onion, and lobster).  I may have an eating disorder because I was dipping my duck fat fries and using the mashed potatoes as a dipping sauce.

Great meal, our server was very informative.  The restaurant is really nice and not loud like some of the steakhouses can be in Vegas (sometimes you feel like you're at a nightclub!)  There is a great picture spot where they have all the olive oil in jars along the wall).  I'm not sure how an animal activist will handle this place because there are glass windows with the Wagyu beef hanging.  I'm not sure if that would be the design of my choice personally, but the food will steal the show once it is cooked and in front of you, I promise.",2012-08-02 23:25:36

Thing is it wasn't even packed.  This place is going down hill as they only had 1-2 people working and an older couple working the bars and watching tv. Might be the owners.

This is the 2nd time I went as I decided to give them another chance.  I usually like St. Louis bar  & Grill but the one in Richmond Hill I would suggest you stay away.  Worst Service Ever.  First they take 30 mins to seat you when there are 3-4 tables that are free but needs cleaning.  The old couple there seems to be the owners are terrible and cheap.  Stay away.

Yes people, this is the buffet to go to when you are in Vegas if you are craving for Sushi. You will get a great value when you come here for lunch, I believe it was around $16. Many of the locals come here and sure enough, I love local places.

I remembered they open at 11:30am. It's okay because you can roam around the outlets nearby if you come early.  The cut rolls here are top notch. The cold appetizer bar has the usual edamame and tofu and sometimes beef tartar?? What a bargain! 

Your hot foods consists of the tempuras, the chickens. What I usually get is the clams in this butter, ginger broth. OMG, it is SO good (and yet so bad for you). I finish with the green tea ice cream. You will need to ask the person behind the counter to get it.  There's no sign for it so you will need to ask.

Tequila might've been better than Vodka. Mojito was almost like water. Ice is just an excuse. I get the mojitos all the time at Milesotnes and it's still strong and minty and tasty. Seriously, not worth the price. Get beer instead. 

But then they redeemed themselves with the burger. The braised beef burger is A+ awesome. So flavourful - wonderful combination of braised beef, juicy burger, toasted soft bun, and fresh toppings. The fries are pretty great too. In fact, we ordered extra.

This is my 4th time coming here and I keep thinking my bad experience was just a one time thing, but it no longer is! And I want so bad for this Outback to do well, because it's close to uptown!
I ate at the bar and the bar has a stale beer, dirty smell. Like things have not been cleaned properly. Everyone knows when you walk into a place what that smell is and this Outback had that smell! I had to ask for my spot to be wiped down because there was food and crumbs everywhere! In fact, Ive been sitting here for close to an hour and the bar spot next to me is disgusting. It had potatoes, old food all over the bar and hasn't been cleaned in an hour! Yuck! 
Each time I have come here, my baked potato is undercooked! Same thing again tonite! Plus the bread isn't even warm enough for the butter to melt on it!
Lastly, it is a Wednesday night and this place is empty? Maybe 4-5 tables occupied? I have never, ever been in an Outback that isn't packed, any night of the week! Sad, again because I'm a fan!
Nothing worse than eating at the bar and having to hear 4-5 servers hanging around ""airing out their dirty laundry"" and having to hear all their complaints! 
This Outback needs a total overhaul! Clean it up and improve the service! Outback was always known for their service! This one I don't feel the warmth!

I was excited to hear about this cafe from the same folks/chef but with an organic twist. I visited tonight and they were busy. Not so much when I first got there around 6:30ish but it soon started getting packed. I was greeted quickly and had to wait less than 5 minutes for a table. I chose to sit outside. if you like Gallo you will like it here. Maybe more so since I think the hotel location is just bizzare in the form of mood and atmosphere. (Unless you visit the rooftop pool first-lol) At Otro there is a type of a cool, hip, Chelsea /Greenwich Village  arty, beatnik, type of feel to it. The menu seemed the same but the hostess assured me it is not. (More organic options which has been the chef's dream for the past ten years) Oh well! That all sounds good and dandy to me but I always order the same thing because I love their Carne Asada Tortas and Guac so much! ( I swear one day I have to branch out and try some of their other food items) I usually end up taking half home and tonight was no exception.
   I liked the fruity Ice tea, the hot green salsa ( Not so much the smokey, red one. I do not like smokey tasting anything) and yes I ordered my usual for dinner. I had to knock off a star because the bread was slightly burnt on my Torta ( that is a big no-no for me)  and the Guac seemed bland for some reason. Maybe the recipe is different here? With that said, their Guac is still soooooo yummers and I devoured half the Torta anyway. I never said a word nor sent it back so a solid 4 stars it is. However, I am guessing 5 stars on the next visit. Maybe my taste buds were off or something on the Guac but I did not get that citrus bite I love. For some reason I just wanted to keep reaching for a salt shaker. 
   I have to give 5 stars to the Coconut Pudding though. It was a small piece of heaven. I have been trying to make a good coconut creme cake filling at home but it is never correct. It is either yuk; too fake tasting or too sweet, This pudding is to die for. Not too sweet, smooth as silk, delish in a cup sprinkled with dark chocolate shavings. I died and went to Hawaii.
    Michael was my server but the entire staff, more or less, all chipped in and helped. Michael is a nice man and treated me well. Micheal knows what Haupia is so he gets an extra shout out. I have to admit though he was a little too busy at times. It seems other Yelpers agree maybe they need more help here?

A brick monolith surrounded by a sea of industry that used to be.  

Sainatos has become home to many of us at the summer league rowing session at the nearby Western Reserve Rowing Association. It's a place where firefighters, local townsfolk, and rowers converge. A friendly bar staff, adequate beer selections, HDTV's to catch the Tribe game and a huge menu. 

Now, while I imagine the majority of reviewers are basing their experiences solely on the long standing take-out pizza place, a newly formed connected bar has joined Sainatos. Inside Saianato's doors and through another set of doors to the right takes you to the bar area. The food comes from the same long standing Sainatos take-out kitchen. I'm pretty sure both the bar and older kitchen area of Sainatos are one in the same, although the bar area looks much newer and more conducive for relaxing and staying for a while than the take-out side of this place. Either way, the food, especially the pizza and wings that come out of this place are legit! 

The pizza we ordered was a basic pepperoni and cheese. The pie was sinfully good. Greasy pepperoni slices, cheese that strung as you bit into it and a crust that was, as proclaimed by the bartender, entirely homemade, as evidenced on how good it was. No frozen discs of dough used here. Everything's made on site. 

After a long evening of water sport, there are fewer things that complete the night than a cold beer, a good pizza and crispy wings.

No different here at this location. I've read some recently negative reviews for this location....but I had a really good experience.

First off, this place gets VERY busy before most businesses starting work time....lots of banking folks sitting around me. I grabbed a seat at the counter to watch the chaos in the Kitchen, and to watch the ONE waitress bust her tail in order to make her customers happy. I also find it amazing how very hard Latino cooks work back in the kitchen, and how quickly they can switch from getting their orders in English yet speak Spanish back there among each other. Their head cook was about as hard working an Expeditor as I've seen, repeating every order and making sure his line cooks get it done right.

My little blonde waitress was filling in for someone who apparently called in sick, and she was uber busy yet kept me happy with coffee and getting my order in and to me very quickly (like 5 minutes). 

So I'd say the STAFF here easily gets 5 STARS. Very hard working and efficient.

Now that I've painted the picture on how this place operates, let me tell you about my Greek Omelet. I got it with Gyro meat and grilled onions, and it was very good! Hash browns and English Muffin were acceptable and average. But the Greek Omelet was filled with tomatoes, feta cheese, gyro meat, grilled onions and some Greek spices. Not overcooked and quite tasty overall. Good size too.

I got about the most expensive thing on the menu and had a coffee and it came out to just over $10. They have MANY breakfast items that hover around $5 if you didn't want to get one of their ""signature"" dishes.

So if you're Uptown and want a good, home cooked meal, come to Showmars....just don't expect Dean and Deluca quality (nor their prices).",2015-01-30 13:27:33

OOFiBzcwJt5Wuq_LedxMLQ,kqyCQG4c5dwNt2cTkMcvGA,GKCbql3yNcAu1hudKUd21w,5,5,0,1,"I just had my wedding at Palais Royale. We planned it in 4 months and people have told me it was nicer than weddings they've been to that have taken all year to plan.

First off, Stephanie our event co-ordinator was fantastic! She was extremely organized, responsive and proficient. I am a very detailed person and can honestly say working with Stephanie was a pleasure. She even taught me a more efficient way to send emails! 

The executive chef Stefan is passionate about his work and aims to please. At the tasting he explained every dish to me, let me mix and match sides with entrees and created hors d'oeuvres for my wedding that weren't on the menu. Speaking of the menu... WOW! so many options and price points. There is truly something for everyone. 

Our wedding fell on the last nice day of this year. Clear skies, sunshine and a sparkling lake set the backdrop for our outdoor ceremony and cocktail reception. The stunning back deck is what really makes Palais Royale unique. It is a good idea to get the tent in case of bad weather. They can close the sides and add heat lamps. Thankfully we didn't need to do this but it's good to have the option, and you can split the cost if there is another group using it the same weekend as your event. 

The room itself is extremely versatile, done in tones of beige and brown. You can dress it up or leave it plain and it is still quite nice. The room was designed to be a music hall so the audio quality is superb. (makes a huge difference IMO.) Soren the lighting tech did a fabulous job. My husband and I were well lit every time we were on the dance floor, as was the head table. We splurged and got the pin spot lighting--GET THIS. It really transforms the room. 

Our guests are still talking about how beautiful everything was and how delicious the food tasted. Thanks to Stephanie, Dora, Robin, Stefan and the rest of the team at Palais Royale I had a fairy tail wedding.

TIP - Use some of their recommended vendors to ensure a seamless evening--particularly the valet as it is a bit of a complicated parking situation.

I was checking out with a WIC coupon. Which I know can be a pain and nobody likes doing them or being inline behind either, well nobody like using them either.  Anyway the cashier, who I'd gone to many time before with the coupons argued with me about whether or not an item was allowed. The same item she had checked out for me in the past. She refused to even scan it to see the the computer would let it go through. The line had to be closed and all the other customer moves to a different line, while she straight argued with the supervisor who told her to scan the items. She still refused. I can't for the life of me understand why that kind of insubordination was tolerated.   after the supervisor checked me out, with the items in question, which scanned just fine and were clearly listed in the allowed items book, I was driving home and started having contractions. My baby was born hours later healthy.  I sent letters to the store and the headquarters and haven't heard one word about. If the cashiers are going to argue with customers to the point where they go into labor, if someone had a heart condition and was through into a heart attack?  And they don't even have the manners to contact me in response.

Do you rate according to the experience, or whether or not the food was exactly your cup of tea?

The wife and I have wanted to try some celebrity chef places before we leave Vegas for good and Bouchon, being one that is willing too look the other way on.... Well, let's just say we put the ""casual"" in ""business casual"" and they seemed like an option for us.

I'll get this right out there and say that I am generally not a huge fan of French cuisine. WIth the exception of the marvelous concoctions served up by Olivier at his Baguette Cafe (Hi Olivier!), which routinely blows my socks off, and many wonderful encounters with crusty bread across the globe, the flavour profiles just don't do it for me very often. Bouchon was up against it from the beginning.

I ordered a new potato salad with egg confit, the steak Bouchon with a black truffle demiglace, and a chocolate marquise for dessert. All were good on various levels. The salad was fascinating and I was surprised how much I liked the way the raw egg yolk that crowned the whole affair oozed all over the dish. 

Steak was cooked to perfection and tasted good, but of course I just wasn't that into the glaze. I'm not one of those Philistines who smothers steaks in gloopy brown sauce from a bottle; however, I'd have preferred my steak unadorned or in a nice peppercorn sauce. Mushrooms and fungi, it turns out, don't just turn me off because of their texture -- the taste plays a part too. As I alluded to in my intro, this is personal taste preference rather than having anything to do with the quality of the dish.

The desert was suitably chocolatey and tasty, nothing I'd go running out again and again for, but pleasant and a nice way to round off an elegant meal.

Overall, the meal was tasty. The experience was amazing. So why only four stars? Well, it was nearly $200 for the pair of us without any alcohol and I find that I'd prefer to be spending that money on a week's worth of panini and chocolate tart from around the corner at The Baguette Cafe. 

Bouchon was an experience that I am pleased to have had and I would recommend it to friends, but it's not calling me back.",2012-06-19 01:33:00

Their location right off the 101 makes them able to serve a larger population than a typical family run pizza joint. They were super easy to get to and if I lived somewhere in the Desert Ridge area I would be here often! 

We arrived on a Friday night and was able to grab a seat right away which was surprising since after looking around I couldn't find an empty table anywhere. Our waiter took good care of us. We were entertained by the TVs showing different sports, but it was the right amount of TV's (if you've read my reviews you'll know I don't like to be overwhelmed with TV's). 

I started out with a Sleepy Dog Brewery beer right from the tap so +1 point there! Then we shared a ""Specialty Pizza"", the Buffalo Chicken Pizza that was super tasty! It survived a night in the car (since we went straight to the bars afterwards) and is still making a name for itself in our fridge as a left over. 

We finished things off with Upper Crust's Pizookie. I remember reading about it in another review so when the waiter asked about dessert I ordered one with no regrets.

Is it the most beautiful looking interior in the world? Nah. But then I've seen a whole worse. It's fairly clean but could still use some work. The only real issue is the service.

The food was great - not too salty or overly seasoned and priced well.  There's nothing worse than overpriced skewered meat... lol.  And as with all of KINKA family restaurants in the city, the staff is super helpful and attentive.  Go check it out!",2014-03-11 02:50:07

Granite/rock counters, large windows, gorgeous patio seating outside and a large bar. The menu is what you would expect it to be- burgers, pizzas, apps, salads. We tried out a salad and 4 meat pizza. The salad was great with dark greens, no iceberg here. The pizza was also very good with the exception of the crust which was obviously not homemade. The only downfall, in my opinion, is that you order at the counter and seat yourself. The line at the counter can be long and the tables fill up fast on busy days.",2014-10-20 19:05:54

MpUToOaPnh1vq5VbB3Xk6A,SlgpAnj2gQd44EM_Uq6DkQ,x0Ec6gz07SBnWrBOQLisiA,3,4,0,0,"When I heard this restaurant was opening I did my research first and discovered they are a chain and this was their first Charlotte location. So being that I'd rather support locally owned businesses I was reluctant to try this place.

What brought me in here is I was looking for something to take home after running an errand and didn't want the usual sandwich or fast food places.

They have printed menus near the door so I'd recommend picking one up so you can peruse while you are standing in line. The line starts at the back of the restaurant. Someone takes your order and they had you a sheet. That person gathers all the ingredients in your order and then passes them on to someone down the line who chops your lettuce and mixes everything in your salad. Then it's stuffed in a clear plastic bowl in a rather unappetizing way. Then on you go to pay and get your drink.

Like one other reviewer mentioned it's a rather chaotic process. Seems a bit disorganized at times and it's very loud in there so you can barely hear the person making your salad.  

For my salad, I went with one of the First timer recommendations - the Santa Fe salad which comes with Avocado, grape tomatoes, corn, pepperjack, fried onions and romaine. It sounded appetizing but what I received was not. It looked and tasted like a lot of mush. The high point was the spicy Chipotle vinagrette.   

I can't say if I will come back or not, especially when there's a locally owned salad place up the street. But who knows, I may end up here again for the convenience to try something beyond the first timer recommendations.",2016-04-20 18:51:49

And wow, all I can say- it was by far the best dinner I have ever experienced in Cleveland.

See, the best part about Cleveland, is that you don't have to be waitlisted for 3 months to try to get into a restaurant of this caliber- nor do you need to shell out 200-300 dollars on one meal. You don't have to wait in some ridiculous line for 2+ hours to get a seat (just make a reservation though). You don't have to push your way through crowds to get to Trentina. There is a dress attire, so you have to dress up- but hey, why not, it makes for an enjoyable experience.  Trentina was incredible- and we made reservations only a couple of days prior to our dinner, parked in the complimentary valet, and walked peacefully into the restaurant.

It's a great looking restaurant- clean, white walls, large windows, mirrored tables- I love the design of it.

Currently, they have two tasting menus- the bianco and the pasta. The bianco is the bigger menu, and it's cheaper to buy online rather in the dining room. However, we chose a smaller tasting menu (5 pasta dishes + other tastings) - and it was amazing. All the pasta is made in house and they were by far, the best pasta I think I have ever had. Ever. 

I wish I could rattle off the names of the pasta, but not being Italian, I kind of am unsure of what I'm talking about when I say the names. All I can say though, was that the pasta- was utterly amazing- filled with varying dishes including abalone (abalone! Chef Sawyer gets his abalone from his a friend who owns an abalone business. When I saw the abalone, I was like, ""WHAT? Abalone?!), caviar, roe, scallops, special fungi, amazing cheese, and so on. My favorites of the night were the ouvo all trentina (the egg comes out in this wooden branch of some sort, cooked over embers....straight onto your plate of amazing pasta), and pline + zuppa di vino vianco- which was this amazing cheese in a bread ball of some sort, with pureed cabbage, etcera... amazing. Utterly amazing. And all the pasta is made in house. OMG, SOOOOOOOOOO amazing. I was in food heaven.

And what was great about this restaurant, was that the service was great. They replaced every fork and knife we used with each course, and were attentive to our needs, explaining each dish. Chef Sawyer himself even came out, explaining multiple dishes for us, and telling us where the ingredients came from.

I was even surprised with the candles they had used on the table..was really beef fat! But it made for great dipping for our bread (between our courses). ""Everything is usable"" they said.

Overall, I was stuffed after our pasta tasting (which, is not listed on their website- you have to call in and ask), which completed with a trio of desserts, including olive ice cream on amaretto, homemade yogurt + red currants + gianduja + danish, and apricots+ other fruits. We were STUFFED. But, seriously, Trentina is the best restaurant I have ever been to CLE.. I dare say this may indeed challenge the high caliber places in NYC and LA..... wow, it was so amazing. 

Even the bathroom was nice- they had a bidet (which was even heated), along with a sink faucet with built in dyson fans INTO the faucet. Dude, I could have lived in that bathroom. I've never even seen a bidet in CLE before! Nice, very nice.

Overall, I was extremely impressed and highly recommend going to Trentina when you want to experience a world of amazing flavors. You don't see this type of restaurant in CLE, and I applaud Chef Sawyer for Trentina. It definitely sets a new stage of foodieness in CLE...and I like it a lot. Amazing. Five stars to the max.",2014-07-25 03:57:10

The gym is laid out fairly nicely with a cardio area and weight area separated by a basketball court. There is an indoor pool (there is a glass wall beside the cardio area, so you can see into the pool are) and running track above. 

Some of the pros I like about this gym:
-TVs on all cardio equipment (Though recently TWC switched to Digital so all the tvs are having to be updated, so there arent any channels now)
-The functional fitness room- Monkey bars, large ropes, weights, plyo boxes, jump ropes. There is also a WOD on the board in case you want to get your crossfit on
-The salad bar area- Great to grab a quick lunch to go after the workout. Prices are very reasonable. 
-The Quick Fit room off the track- Great for a quick workout away from others. 
-Weight area- For being a small area, they have a good amount of stuff. I think there are about 4 unassisted squat stands/bars, which is alot for this size gym.

We came in with a party of 8.  The staff was very quick to put 2 tables together for us and brought a clean high chair for our daughter.  We had waters before they took our orders and helped explain any questions our guests had with the menu.

The food came out in a timely manner.  We were told the Chicken Karaage was a new recipe so we ordered it and it was delicious.  Our daughter loves the tofu salad and that didn't disappoint either.  I ordered the tonkatsu raman and my wife had the tom yum ramen.  

The tonkatsu was great.  Plenty of noodles and meat and the broth was delicious.  The only thing that made it better was adding the Mayu they provide and a few drops of lemon juice to make the broth pop.

The tom yum ramen was a nice twist on the traditional thai dish and was nicely done.

There are tables in the middle and booths on the sides as well as two big TVs that they can hook a system up to so you can play various games. The booths on the sides also have small TVs. At the front they have a list of all the different games they have. It was awesome to get to play Mario Kart and enjoy our drinks at the same time! 

The tables in the center are for board games and this place has A LOT of board games. We didn't get a chance to play any because of Mario Kart but it looked like they had a very wide selection. 

This is a great place to hangout with friends or even go on a date! They have escape rooms as well. 

My only complaint is the staff was not very friendly but you don't have to interact with them too much unless you're ordering or picking a game out. 

Overall, this place is a great hangout spot and I would definitely recommend it, though it gets crowded so pick the time you go wisely.",2017-03-12 16:49:50

My wife doesn't do seafood so when she's out with the ladies its sushi time! I called at approximately 7:15. The lady that answered the phone didn't even wait for the call to pick up before she started into her ""please hold"" speech. All I got was ""...ind if you hold please?"" then a click. There's no hold music, no beep, just dead air. It makes you think you've been hung up on.

When she came back to my call a minute or so later she started to ask how she could help me but then started to talk to someone in the restaurant and without notice put me on hold again for a few seconds. Finally I got my order placed and was told it would be about 20 minutes. Sounds about right for a busy Friday night.

Picking up my order was quick. The same lady that answered the phone was at the front desk. She was mildly more friendly in person than over the phone. I was in and out as fast as the debit terminal could process the payment.

I went with the deluxe sushi combo. For $20 the portion size was good, but unfortunately the quality was not there. Most of the individual sushi items were just okay. One of them, which I believe was snapper, was definitely not very fresh. It was a little dry and had a slight odour. the dynamite roll was equally disappointing. Each piece fell apart when I picked it up and flavour wise it was meh.

Based on this experience there are definitely many other better sushi places in the city, but this one being the closest to my house means they'll get a second chance.",2016-01-16 03:39:14

It goes without saying, then, that when I found out I'd be coming to Vegas for my birthday, I immediately booked a brunch reservation at Mesa Grill.

We arrived right on time and were seated at a small table between two loud tables. Really? I booked this reservation months in advance and this is where you choose to seat me?

But okay, fine. I'm willing to overlook a questionable choice like that if the experience is otherwise perfect. It was not perfect. Not even close.

My dining companion and I decided to start with a cocktail each, and my dining companion also took the opportunity to ask the waitress what she recommended on the food side of things. Said waitress immediately pointed out the most expensive items on the menu. Annoying, but forgivable.

By the time the waitress returned with our cocktails, we were ready to order. My dining companion decided to go with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla, which provoked a bit of a face from our waitress and a declaration that it wasn't big enough to work as a main meal (even though it costs as much as most of the mains). Extremely annoying and not terribly forgivable, to be honest.

But fine, we plowed ahead. My dining companion decided to go with the Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffles, to which we were told that the kitchen had ""run out"" of this item. So that's two things my dining companion attempted to order and twice she was shot down. Not surprisingly, she said she needed a minute to pick something else.

Finally, my turn had come. The reason I had booked this reservation so far in advance. I proudly told the waitress that I wanted the Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash. A distressingly sour face ensued and I was told the kitchen was unable to make that, either.

Really. You're a professional kitchen run by a celebrity chef and you don't have TWO items available on a fairly limited menu? Even if I were willing to accept that, I absolutely cannot accept that we weren't told about these unavailable items the second we sat down or, at the very least, before we ordered our cocktails!

Fuming, I choked down my cocktail and asked for the bill, assuming the drinks would be comped. No such luck. Instead, our waitress amazingly, brazenly asked if I wanted another drink to go! She just might be the most boldly money-hungry individual I've *ever* met, and I know quite a few lawyers.

What a horrible, awful experience and on my birthday no less. Bobby Flay, you are dead to me.",2016-09-27 16:28:40

We actually ended up going two nights in a row! We ate at the restaurant Monday night, and then ended up doing to-go Tuesday night after seeing ""Ka"" at the MGM. Yep, in spite of the vast array of choices at the MGM, we went back to Hachi for take-out. And the waitresses remembered us from the night before. Of course we had to order the crispy chips (a/k/a deep fried chicken skin!) and the grilled homemade chashu. The husband is obsessed with this dish! We ordered two orders of the grilled chashu Monday night, AND Tues. night! Also tried the stir-fried pork belly with kimchi, which was damn good. The kimchi was not overly spicy, yet had all the flavors you'd expect.

Thank you Hachi for two more awesome dinners!  Service, as usual, was spot on.

Just discovered recently how great is the cappuccino here. Definitely like hazelnut flavored coffee. 
So, when you decide whether to get only coffee or something else too, Leone Cafe is the perfect place to try. It's located in the beautiful Tivoli Village, West side of Las Vegas.
Besides coffee, there are many different pastries and various entrees to choose from.
After entering into the restaurant, you get in the line to the cashiers, where the drinks and meals can be ordered, and paid for. Afterward, the cashier gives you a number, what you place on your chosen table, where you will be served by waiters or waitresses.
Pretty easy process!
I visited Leone Cafe twice last week, while I was doing business in Tivoli Village.
Both times I ordered Hazelnut Cappuccino (large) and Chocolate Croissant (warmed up), and my friend ordered a Grilled Salmon Salad. 
According to my friend, the salad wasn't too bad, but unfortunately not very good either.

The environment at this location is much smaller, only fits about maybe 5-6 tables worth of people in 4s, and then a relatively ""bigger"" table by the window side that can seat for 6 people or so I believe.

Their system works by having customers pay first and then they get their meals delivered to them. A little bit more odd, since the paying system will ask you to tip and I suppose if it is semi self-serve, people may not necessarily tip so they would lose out on that portion...

My advice would most likely to change the system by having the server (they only have one) to go around, take the orders, and then provide the bill after the food has been consumed.

They also have a charging station for smartphones by their cash register, in the event you need to charge up your phone while eating.

I've been twice now, once with a group of friends and once with my girlfriend, and both times I left with a lot to be desired.  The atmosphere is agreeable, with a small selection of tables/booths and a quiet social feel.  If there's any plusses that would be the biggest one.  Most Mexican restaurants that I've been to in my life have been either noisy, basic, or non-traditional, and La Mestiza definitely gets points for having it's own style.  As you walk in, they have the entrance blocked off by stage-like curtains, and the overall dining area is peaceful.  One of the first things you'll encounter after sitting down is their lovely chips and salsas, which are delicious as others mentioned.  There's something sweet in taste about the chips, and the green salsa is probably the only of it's kind that I've ever enjoyed.

Now that the good part's out of the way, let me tell you why I'm giving La Mestiza only 3 stars.  First, they are extremely overpriced.  The drinks and appetizers are reasonable, but almost every meal is $12-18, and for Mexican food that's just too much.  If it were something I was impressed with, I'd be a little more generous in this area, but for food that came off as incredibly bland, this price is not something I can settle with.  I've tried their first chicken dish on the menu (can't remember the name), the tamales, and their enchiladas.  All of these selections had a very basic description, but once they were served you found yourself with a meal that was chock full of ingredients and smothered in unfamiliar sauces.  My first Chicken dish had a handful of things I'd rather not eat, and so I had to basically take a few bites and then resort back to the free chips.  The other two entrees were just bland, with a giant dumping of brown mole sauce and white unknown sauce slathered over all of it.  I ended up cleaning my plate for both of those, but that just left me uncomfortably full and not satisified because there wasn't anything tasty about them.

Taste buds are different for everyone though, and seeing all the positive reviews here makes me think that maybe others just hit something that suit them.  That said, I tried 3 dishes and they don't have a ton to begin with, so I'm still skeptical.  There's also no hot sauce or flavor sauce of any kind, something that is a MUST for me at a Mexican restaurant.

Service was questionable.  At first, it seems very personal, as there are few people in the restaurant and the waitresses come off as polite and prompt.  But the politeness seems fake; both my girlfriend and I were like ""what the hell is her deal?"" almost the entire time, both times.  Both waitresses read the options and specials off in a really robotic manner, and while they showed all the usual signs of courtesy, there was just something a bit off.  I don't know how to explain it, and we certainly were in good moods both times so it wasn't something that we carried over from a previous activity.

It might have something to do with the patrons.  The typical customer seems to be either older middle-aged white westside parents with a dose of snooty, or business women out for a work lunch.  I guess if I was serving that type of clientel all day, I'd be putting on a front as well.  Then again, maybe we just hit a string of bad luck.

So in the end I can't recommend La Mestiza.  While there is truly a drought of good Mexican in Madison, this place just doesn't have enough shine to fill the gap.  If you want good Mexican, drive to Milwaukee and go to the soutside.  You'll get your money's worth, you'll be full, and you'll have a big smile on your face.  

And for pete sakes, at least put some Cholula on the table.",2010-02-01 02:32:50
mbCgDfR5mYGbGVOqusZD7g,CXLJPkPhqMUysBA9TiPPHw,swX3Vj3dQsz1YlCRmwNQEQ,2,8,11,4,"This place is a bit stuffy. It's nice and all, but let me put it this way- this place is very age specific (like most of Scottsdale I suppose). You will have a lot of people in their late forties and up here- not that there's anything wrong with that.

I like some of the food,especially the tuna tartare, but they do some sort of sushi-American fusion roll that really sucks. I complain because it is one of the most expensive small plates on the menu and the number one thing the bartenders recommend (more on the bartenders... ahem...  'recommendations' later). So this roll consists mainly of lobster and high quality beef but then they go and ruin it by smothering the 2 indulgent ingredients in a sauce that overwhelms the entire plate, and the sushi rice is gross and kind of mealy. 

That roll pisses me off. It needs editing, but I guess it reminds me of some of the unedited clientele I see at Eddie V's as well- like the bleached platinum blond girl with a hair piece, fake eyelashes, dark navy eye shadow, oompa loompa tan, injected lips, caked on makeup, fake boobs, fake claws, wearing a skin tight designer t-shirt along with a thousand dollar handbag and $400  jeans to coordinate with her stripper shoes and abundantly accessorized sterling silver Tiffany's jewelry that sat by me last visit. I mean each element of her style probably works on its own, but all together it looks like a Vogue magazine threw up on her. That's sort of what the roll was for me. (BTW, she ordered the same thing- the roll- and liked it, so what's that tell you?)

Now, for my big gripe. I can describe the type of wine I like quite well. I will ask for something that tastes a certain way and immediately every bartender- no matter what description I give- will direct me to the 2 most expensive wines by the glass (around $25 a glass) on the menu. Price does not equal quality and I find it offensive when I taste the $25 glass of  wine and it in no way mirrors what I was asking for. I feel like they are just trying to up-sell me without considering my taste. I get it. I work in sales too, but I think it's more important to give the customer what they want rather than try to push them into spending more money. Also, if I don't choose the most expensive wines, they kind of shrug their shoulders as if implying that all the other wines on the menu suck. I'm of the thinking that nothing on the menu should suck or not be worth suggesting in one way or another, so for that they get 2 stars. I have a feeling it's the staff more than the menu that is the problem.",2012-07-07 02:51:26

I preferred it with that house sauce which had sweet and vinegar notes rather then the plum sauce. Also got the Papaya salad that was too heavy on the fish sauce and shrimp paste. Not well balanced.

For entrees Khua Taley was not rememberable. Combination of seafood, veggies in a spicy salty sauce with citrus notes. Good but not mind blowing to get again. Now the curries are what they do. The Mango Curry was jammed packed with veggies, fruit in coconut milk, red curry and peanut sauce. Nutty, sweet and spicy. Did get 3 stars for everything and thought they were all spot on with the spice level.

The place is small. Making it noisy when service picked up. When we arrived everyone working was sitting and didn't care to stand up to greet us. Just told to sit anywhere. Then after a few minutes our waitress came over with menus. Got a vibe from her that she didn't really care the entire time. She never cared to check up on us though service. Which made it hard to get more water. Another girl actually cleared our plates, gave us our checks and another guy gave us our entrees. Who are we tipping?

May return for the curry but will go to the Atwood location first to see if they have better service.",2012-12-21 03:19:57

I am a big fan of veal so I was quite happy to see that Stone and Vine serves Veal Parmagiana, Marsala, and Piccata.  And they were charging only $18 for these dishes, which is quite a value compared to other italian restaurants in the area.

I ordered the Veal Piccata and it was a quality piece of veal and was prepared as it should be.  We also had the Rigatoni with the Bolognese and it was great.  Such a simple dish but not everyone gets it right..

Stone and Vine offers a varied menu including flatbreads and pizza, which are a few dollars less during happy hour.

I came about fifteen minutes before closing and apparently they had a big day because the majority of cupcakes were gone. There isn't a HUGE selection but your basic fix is there. 

Typically, I don't eat desserts that are not vegan or made with a bunch of organic ingrediants but I did have a key lime cupcake from here which was pretty good. I usually am not a fan of key lime but it was flavorful and I enjoyed the creme inside the cupcake that was a nice surprise. The cream on top wasn't so bad either (remember I typically do not have milk based items). I don't think mine was cream cheese based but there were some cupcakes there with cream cheese frosting. 

These cupcakes seem homemade so I appreciate that. Hopefully in the future they will offer vegan/glutenfree options. That would make this a five star place.

Today at lunch, I was invited to try a new burger joint, which apparently everyone loves, and was told that my love affair with In&Out would be shattered.. Well, that was a lie. 

I got a cheese burger, fries and a cherry coke. The sheer fact that there is fountain cherry coke automatically merits a star. I liked the options I got for toppings, I chose mayo, pickles, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce and A-1..  I've got to admit, I was excited, really excited.. however, that excitement was quickly shattered when I got my meal.. I unwrapped the tin foil, hoping to find a delicious juicy cheeseburger, just for me.. yeah well, I found a burger, just for me, but it was WET. The entire bun was drenched.. THIS, ladies and gents, this disgusts me to no end. One of the words I hate most in the world is moist, and I also hate when things that are not supposed to be moist, are moist. Especially bread. BARF. The meat wasn't very flavorful either.. and they used portobello mushrooms, that were cold. I frowned. My lunch date frowned back. The fries were apparently from Shelly Idaho, I know this because they have a ""Todays fries are from.."" board.. they taste just like In&Outs, just thicker.. so basically it is imperative that you order them well done.

The place is big, holds a lot of people and they are really well staffed, but the meal was just meh.. and for the two of us the total came out to be $22.00. TWENTY TWO DOLLARS for 2 cheeseburgers, fries and a drink.. for real?? 

Whatever, i know its inevitable that I will give this place another shot, mostly because I work next door, and Fat Burger doesn't do it for me.. But I was just really really sad with the whole experience. I don't eat burgers often, so when I do its a treat, and well, this was not a treat.

I've been wanting to go to Colossus for a while now, so I jumped at the chance when a gf suggested Greek for lunch!

The restaurant itself is cute and quaint.  Service was friendly, patient, and prompt.  All good signs,

BUT

In all honesty, I was quite disappointed with the food.  To test out the restaurant, I ordered the staple Greek meal, Pork Soulaki Entrée.  Prices were quite reasonable at $10.95 which included a coupla large potato pieces, rice, Greek salad, and the meat.  Good portion at a great price point!  

All the staples, re:  potatoes, rice, & pork were dry and bland.  In addition, rice was slightly undercooked and seemed like it was left sittin' out (dry).  There wasn't any sauce with the potatoes.  And the pork was overcooked (dry).  Everything needed a bit more salt and I am not a sodium addict.  The flavours were almost there, but lacked something.  My dish didn't come with a lemon wedge, so I wasn't able to liven things up.

I've had better at the mall food court.  Salad was fresh tho'!

Since the service was pleasant and setting was pretty, esp. at night, I'd give them another chance.  Maybe they were having an off-day?",2013-11-06 01:16:38

We came for Happy Hour around 5 on a Saturday afternoon. Granted, it was probably unfair of us to come here after last week's foodie extravagance at Gallo Bianco in Phoenix.  But we found the food good and the drinks cold, always a plus. 

The atmosphere is a cross between a sports bar and a Mexican beach cantina. They have a large bar area which extends out onto the sidewalk. You can sit on bar stools outside, on a ceramic window area and still see the game on their two HDTVs inside. 

Salt and Lime is a bar where Dos Equis Lager, Corona Light or Modelo Dark are on tap for $4.00 and come in a pint glass, while their small wine list was $7 a glass. Salt & Lime doesn't carry or serve Sangria. They also had several margaritas on the menu starting at $6 and going up from there. 

The food was good and what you would expect. We started with Guacamole for $5.50 (photo) and shared an order of Nachos ($8.50).  The guacamole had some mango through it, which made it interesting; while the nachos were drizzled with several different types of cheeses. Not bad for bar food. 

Since these appetizers were filling, we ordered some Empanadas ($5.25) and a couple of Tacos for $3.25 each. The empanadas came with shredded chicken(photo) but were overly doughy and had a flour after-taste. The Carne Asada tacos were good, but admittedly we were spoiled from last week's adventure at Gallo.

Concessions, in my opinion, leave a lot to be desired. Half the time, there isn't someone there to help in a timely fashion. The other half of the time the concessions that they have are not ready and so you need to wait for them to be prepared. By the time you get someone to help you and then get the preparation, it takes too long. It is OK if you simply want a chocolate bar, but it's not OK if you're looking for pizza or nachos, etc. You literally need to get to the theater a good 20 to 30 minutes before the movie starts in order for concessions to be potentially worth it. Being that concessions are a big deal for movie theaters, because they do not allow you to bring your own food in, this place gets only three stars and they seriously need to start to improve the poor quality of service at the concession stand.
Otherwise, it's located on the second floor of the Southpoint hotel. If you are staying at the hotel, it is not even two minutes from your hotel room. It is clean.

1. Does anyone ever work here?? Every time i walk in theres like nobody working. i will see 2 girls at most and their always busy helping other people or ""pretending to look busy"" .. If i am lucky enough to get someones attention and speak to an associate there always so DAMN rude!! Some things i've noticed with the sales associates are their middle aged woman trying to be ""sexy"". Excuse me but its not my fault that your a middle aged woman working retail in a mall, so please change your attitude towards me and give me some service.

2. Whenever I find what I need theres hardly ever any selection, they are always out of my size or color or style and im left with the leftovers. 

3. the victoria secret deals are complicated at this location. i always have a problem whenever i bring in a free panty card or a ten dollars off card. etc. they always mess up my transactions and i always have to return and fix it. and when i do try to come back and fix it im left with their attitudes again like they didnt mess anything up? i remember one time i came in and asked a sales associate if this deal was still going on where if you spend a certain amount of money say 70 bucks you get a free duffle bag.. she said yes so i did some shopping and went to check out. when i got to the register the lines were soooooo long. when i finally made it to the front and made my purchases i had noticed that the lady had forgotten my duffle bag so i went back to the store and politely told her and she responds ""oh we ran out"". excuse me?? If you had ran out of duffle bags why didnt you tell me when i had asked you when i walked in the store?? I was so angry.

Chairs are not the most comfortable because most of them are like benches without backings and no cushioning. The restaurant could fit smaller groups and probably 1 table or 2 tableS for larger groups if they combine a few tables together.

FOOD: 3/5 - Their menu is very diverse with a combination of both Japanese and Korean dishes. You could find traditional Korean food like Kam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Soup) or Japanese sushi rolls and also a new mix of them both. They also give you a few Korean side dishes as appetizers.

I was here with my hubby and tried their Kimchi Bulgogi Fries as a starter. The bulgogi was cold and tasted like hard, crumbled minced meat tossed on top of the fries. The fries themselves were great and the mozzarella cheese was hot and melted but the bulgogi was certainly a disappointment. I also think the portion was a bit small for the price ($8.99). We also ordered the Don Katsu and Kimchi fried rice as an entrée. The Don Katsu (pork cutlet) was huge and crispy but not comparable to Katsuya in terms of tenderness and flavour. The batter also comes off from the meat fairly easily so it could be a bit messy. The cutlet also came with a sweet and tangy sauce served on the side. 

The Kimchi fried rice was served on a hot skillet in a decent portion. I could barely taste the bacon bits but the rice and cheese were pretty tasty as they are. Towards the edge and bottom of the skillet, you'd also get the crust of the rice which I especially enjoyed. Overall, I think the food was average. The watermelon slices was a nice touch to end the meal though.

SERVICE: 2/5 - Here's where things get interesting: When we were offered the machine to pay our bills, the machine indicated 3 options for tips (I believe it was 13%, 15% and 18%) and with no other option to enter your own amount. I always pay my tips on the total before tax was charged. So I wasn't pleased when I was forced to pay a certain percentage in my total bill after tax. After pressing randomly on the keypads (I think I pressed OK without selecting any of the 3 options) it actually led me to a screen where I could enter my own tip. So, I ended up giving them the tips based on what the pre-tax bill was (converted in dollar amount), which I thought was fair in terms of the service I got. But the older hostess grabbed the machine, checked the receipt and ignored us for the rest of the night. NO Thank you, no smile, nothing. She just walked away. And after showing the receipt/machine to the younger hostess, who was friendly to us when we first came in, she then also completely ignored us as we exited the restaurant. We were both a bit turned off by that.

Overall: 2.5/5",2017-07-24 19:19:23

I ordered the little bacon cheeseburger, cajun fries and regular drink. The burger was decent (not In and Out quality, but pretty good). I really liked that they let you load up on your choice of toppings (I got grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and pickles) they also had green peppers, jalapeno peppers, bbq and A1 sauce. I was a little disappointed with the price as $10.24 seemed a bit high.

I loved getting to experience a brand new Hobby Lobby!!  I liked seeing one before the store gets dirty/disorganized, the employees get surly, etc.  

Everything was very clean and well-stocked (as it should bee a week after opening).  

My only complaint is the employees seem to be very low quality and have very little training, if any.  

For example,  I went to get fabric cut and the employee helping me was named Jolayne.  She began to cut the fabric and then a co-worker of hers stopped by to talk.  Every time Jolayne began to talk she would stop what she was doing and put her hands on the counter.  I was standing there for close to five minutes staring at her....trying to get 1/4 yard of fabric.... and watching her talk to her co-worker.  Extremely rude.  Jolayne needs some manners.  

Then I went to check out and my cashier was Josie.  I had four items and it took fooooooooooorever to check out. She would ring up each item and then check the entire sales flyer to make sure it wasn't on sale.  (The sales flyer had probably 80 items on it so this took quite a bit of time).  A manager stopped by and asked her what she was doing and she said ""I'm just making sure it's not on sale."" so that tells me even the manager knew something was wrong.  

If you go, be sure to download the Hobby Lobby app on your phone.  When I went on Saturday the app had a 40% off one item coupon on it.",2015-08-17 16:16:33

Pecan tart - this is a southern staple & these guys did it right. Tender crust & lots of buttery pecan throughout - repeat!

Macarons - even though most were raw on the inside, I was a fan in concept. Longer in the oven definitely required. Got 1 of each & here's the rundown

Jalapeño- weird flavor that tasted more gelatinous & half raw on inside

Basil-lime - raw but surprisingly nice compliment of flavor

Pistachio- subtle nut flavor

Raspberry little bit raw, real raspberry jam (seeds). Intense raspberry flavor

Salted caramel - this tasted like chocolate. No caramel taste. Wonder if it was mislabeled 

Cinnamon ganache - CINNAMON. Just like biting into a cinnamon stick

Bourbon vanilla peach streusel - raw. Peach jam & maybe a slight cinnamon flavor to represent ""streusel""

Mixed berry - dry with whole strawberry inside

Lemon - raw. No lemon taste

Milk chocolate passion fruit - bit raw but nice compliment of chocolate to passion fruit

Honey - my fav. Lovely honey aftertaste. Light creamy perfect crisp

Orange - very orange w a vanilla cream. Like a dreamsicle

Our flight got in at like 2 am and rather than pay $200+ for 8 hours in the room like we would at Palazzo (where we stayed the rest of the trip), we decided to give the Flamingo a try. I've always been kind of fascinated by it and its kitschy old Vegas appeal- the pink neon, the sordid mob history, etc.

Parts of the Flamingo have been remodeled adorably and parts of it still miss the mark. I would love for them to just go all-out retro and put some pink shag carpeting in the rooms and make everything as awesomely tacky as possible. If they renovated the rest of the rooms à la the Go rooms and did some remodeling of the casino floor and other areas that haven't quite been updated yet, and maybe if they kicked out Donny & Marie, this place could be well on its way to awesome.

So our room was very cute and in terms of looks alone, I would give it 4 stars. Unfortunately, behind the hip exterior things were not quite as clean as I would expect. I mean, there was an empty condom box in one of the beds.

It was also pretty hard to get to sleep; being an older hotel, the rooms are not exactly sound-proofed and I could hear the thumping and bumping of music in some club ALL. NIGHT. LONG. We were super tired and got to sleep anyway, but if I'd had to stay here for more than one night, that would have driven me absolutely nuts!

I wanted to like the Flamingo so much, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I suppose it would be cool for a short stay in Vegas if you don't want to spend a lot of money and you want to be right in the middle of things- the location is pretty great, after all. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon, though.",2011-06-14 08:11:34

Came here after hearing good things from my classmates in regards to an AYCE (all you can eat) shabu experience.  What they failed to mention was the variety of other dishes you could order from the kitchen.

To summarize what you get for $19.99:
1. AYCE proteins/veggies/tofu to be cooked in your hotpot.
2. More than 20 other dishes that you can order from the kitchen that aren't even mentioned on this restaurants website.
3. Unlimited dessert.  They only have strawberry, vanilla, and green tea ice cream... still unlimited though so you can't go wrong.

The reason I'm giving this place 5-stars is that the dishes you can order from the kitchen are both eclectic and super flavorful.  Have you ever been to Firefly or Ichiza... or any other type of restaurant that gives you the choice of a smaller dish for 3-5 bucks each?  Imagine that type of experience, except you won't rack up a bill over 23 bucks for trying as many things as you can on the menu.  Simply amazing.

I was able to try the stuffed mushroom, pan fried fish, satay curry chicken, sizzling beef tenderloin, soft shell crab, and salt and pepper tofu.  Each was different from the other yet still very flavorful.

I almost died when I had the salt and pepper tofu.  I had no idea tofu could taste that good.  I just may go back and eat 10 dishes of the tofu next time and skip everything else.

5 stars - wait staff was friendly, quick, and always accommodating
5 stars - food was great.  ability to shape the shabu to your taste was cool.
5 stars - restaurant was clean, very nice ambiance, crowd noise low (able to have a nice conversation over dinner.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.  Even though it's located in the area of Silverado Ranch and Maryland, it easily rivals and dare-I-say outcompetes some of the asian eateries on Spring Mountain.  

Check this place out and see what all the hypes about, the hype is well deserved.",2013-04-25 07:57:28

Noticed it had a nice and chill space to grab a coffee and snack with a friend or even with a group of friends since space was pretty big. They also sell merchandise along the walls such as jarred items, crackers, coffee and tea items. They also have a chalk wall of food menu ranging from Pizza to greens, to protein bowls, to brunch items to sandwiches. They also have TiTo Rons remixed filipino desserts and steam box dumplings. What don't they have? 
I got the iced latte and one scoop of their masala tiramisu gelato. Iced latte was delicious enough not to have to add syrup which I always find I need to. The tiramisu gelati was was pretty good but not the best I've had, wouldve been better if there were pieces of soaked lady fingers of some sort cause I like the texture it just reminds me of the real thing.

I don't know much about the history of this restaurant but I know they kick out a good product and the name says it all...I wanted to savor every bite!

I went with the chicken cutlet that was covered with pimento cheese and bacon.  It was pan fried and had a nice texture.  It was crispy but not all bread--it was a nice plump piece of chicken!  It came with 2 sides and this is where they lost me a bit...One was a root veggie ""hash"" so I was picturing more of a casserole style dish but instead it was diced up beets, sweet potatoes and some type of squash I believe.  IT was okay but I really only picked out the sweet potatoes.  The second item was what they call ""drunken collards"" and it was not good.  The server told us they were the ""best"" side on the menu and maybe I just came to realize I don't like collard greens but this dish was not for me.  It was very tart and it had bacon pieces mixed in but it still didn't cut it for me.  There were other sides to choose from so I wish I went in a different direction but that is just personal preference. 

Husband ordered the burger which was about as unadventurous as you can get but he thoroughly enjoyed it!  It was served with kettle chips that were also very good.

I like the menu at Savor because they really have a good variety.  You can order fish, chicken, burgers, salads or pad thai!  They have homemade desserts that are divine!  I have tried the Coca Cola chocolate cake and it was absolutely wonderful.  It is super rich and they use the coca-cola to give it the nice fluffy texture.  It is not for the faint of heart.  You have to be in it to win it with this dessert but it is totally worth it!!

The service is friendly and the atmosphere is intimate.  I would say almost a little too close for comfort on some of the seating arrangements.  I mean we were sitting RIGHT up on the people to our left and right.  I guess if Charlotte is going to keep trying to act like NYC then we have to get used to this type of seating.  :)

My iphone 5 qualified for the free battery replacement so I went online to make a genius bar appointment. Ignore for a second how preposterously pompous it is that I am required to make an appointment with a ""genius"" , which apparently to Apple means someone with too many tattoos and piercings, also ignore that there were no geniuses available for 6 days, just focus on the fact that I have an appointment. It is for 2:30.

I get to the store at 2:25 and walk in. There has got to be 30 employees working in the store based on the number of blue shirts. This impresses me- that is a lot of people working there on a Saturday. A few of them greet me and I let them know I am here to  see a genius. They direct me to the back of the store and tell me to wait in a little line. it is now about 2:30. I have arrived on time for my scheduled genius time.

2:45 I am finally met by a genius, we will call him Einstein. Einstein informs me that he is not the actual genius that will be helping me, he is just the genius that is checking me in- a job worthy of a genius. He asks me why I am here (something I filled out online and something the greeter already asked me). He lets me know that another Genius, lets call him Tesla, will be helping me shortly.

2:55 Tesla greets me and asks me why I am here. We rehash it. He then gets a macbook out and checks to see if my phone qualifies for battery replacement on the website. He then repeats the process on an Ipad. This is baffling but he is pretty fast so the whole thing takes 10 seconds. He sort of blabbers/fills time for about 5 minutes while he does who knows what on his ipad before taking my phone and telling me it will be done in 45 minutes.

I then go to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and knock back some drinks to cope with this whole process, the highlight of the trip.

4:30 I return well after the 45 minutes this would allegedly take. We repeat the same process- 20 people ask me the same questions about why I am here. I am here to pick up a phone. In hindsight I know this involves someone walking up to me and handing me the phone- there is no paperwork, i didn't need to check anything or sign something, literally someone needs to hand me a phone.  Eventually I am informed that a lady genius, lets call her Marie, is the only genius who can get my phone ( I asked). As she is working for her 77 cents on the dollar Marie is dealing with about 5 other customers at once as 20 dude geniuses roam around the store shooting the breeze. Real nice apple. During this time I have a conversation, and by that I mean I am spit on, by another customer who is picking up his computer and has been waiting for 45 minutes. Not encouraging. After waiting about 20 minutes I spy a genius just sitting on a stool literally staring at the wall. I walk over and say Marie told me to ask him to get my phone, which he then does.

For the number of employees present, the organization of this place is terrible making customer service useless. I get that there may only be a few people trained to actually replace the battery, but a Monkey could have done the sign in/pickup process so there is no excuse for it taking more than a minute. Also, I had a reservation. I don't think apple knows what reservations mean. Anyone can TAKE reservations, you have to actually enforce them.",2014-09-02 16:00:59

What a great instructor.  He took 20-25 minutes to patiently give me step by step instructions on body position, holding, aiming, releasing and follow through.

They don't do big breakfasts/meals but have a good array of pastries, sandwiches, and soups - Which is fine because I usually only go for a snack, not a full meal.

One of three bakeries (not counting Dunk'n Donuts) that opened within walking distance of my house in the last couple of years. And in my opinion, the best! 

It is true, there is occasionally a dud in their selection. But I think their cupcakes are one of the best in town. The icing is delicious and the cake always stays moist. I typically prefer a mountain of frosting on my cupcakes, and since their frosting wouldn't constitute a ""mountain,"" this praise is high indeed. This store is a great example of quality over quantity. 

In fact, my wife and I (after a taste test) selected A Bakeshop to provide cupcakes for our baby gender reveal party.

They have small to extra large bowls of Pho.  Props goes out to all those people who can finish an extra large bowl of Pho and still function after...that much Pho in one sitting would make me go to sleep instantly!

Pho is the best comfort and hangover food.  Needless to say they are pretty busy on Saturday and Sunday afternoons but they turn around the tables quickly so feel free to wait.

My jones for eggplant got the better of me and I wanted to slurp some down now.  A Thai restaurant, I thought, would surely have eggplant. 

Behold!  Spicy eggplant was on the menu at Thai'd Up.  Spicy eggplant -  that's how it was called on the menu.  Other veggies were indicated in the description as well, but the dish was called spicy EGGPLANT, ergo I expected to get mostly eggplant.   

I paid $11 because I requested they toss some broccoli into the mix as well.  Then I ordered some veggie spring rolls because I like those too.  That was another $6.  After tax, the total was shy of $20

Was it worth it?  NO.  

- small portion 
- only a few chunks of eggplant with a lot of the cheapie veggies (carrots and such)
- the food was greasy

Furthermore, the spring rolls were like bread rolls.  The shell was too thick for my liking and they were stuffed with very few veggies.  The dipping sauce was light and flavorless.

I would give two stars, but I like Thai food a lot.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that I've only tasted one dish so my knowledge of Thai'd Up is limited.  3 stars.

Hubby ordered the enchilada and steak dish (can't remember name), loved it!  I ordered the enchilada verde.  Dish was yummy but so huge I was only able to eat about a half of one!  

We will definitely go back!  The comments I read abt the waitstaff had us worried, but our waitress (blonde) was very attentive. I did see the other waitress checking her cell phone often :(",2014-07-09 03:53:46

Nice atmosphere, casual but trendy. A lot of wood and brick and a nice welcoming feeling. We were greeted at the door and directed to a booth. As a big guy - I was happy to see that I fit in their booth and the table moved as well. Sounds dumb, but nothing turns you off faster than not being comfortable where you are sitting.

A nice collection of tap beers - we tried a couple which were both good. Our waitress was very nice and filled us in on the specials. The descriptions were a bit long winded, but we are sort of foodies so I didn't mind too much - but it could have used some editing. 

We first tried the Shrimp Fritters - AMAZING! If the owners of this place read this - don't change a thing with this appetizer. It was the perfect size (I think we got about 8 fritters), the taste was excellent - perfect shrimp to breading, not too greasy and very well seasoned. Even the sauce that came with it was great! This is a lock-down excellent menu item.

Next we had two items from the Sandwiches - I had a fried cod sandwich and my wife had the grilled portobello sandwich. Both were quite good. The portobello had great flavor and was very good. The fish sandwich ended up a bit messy - not sure why but about halfway thru the bottom bun was done for. This is probably because the fish was cooked well and was still juicy and yummy. Very good. We also tried a side of sautéed green beans. They were a touch under cooked for my taste - but fresh. 

Overall we were pleased - good service, decent beer tap selection and very yummy food. We will definitely return to try other items.",2014-07-07 23:15:16

So this did not happen on MY watch! But anyway, a friend of mine in the medical field referred me to the Orthopaedics department, Dr. Greg White. It was difficult-VERY difficult trying to schedule an appointment over the phone and I found myself waiting for several minutes, becoming impatient and then calling back to try again. Well my relentless dialing paid off and I'm so glad. The hospital is so organized and streamlined in their processes, from the parking garage to the elevators, every step of the way, we were greeted, assisted and guided. They even have a automatic appointment confirmation call that reiterates directions and your apt time a couple of days before your set appointment. Onto the staff. I wish I could remember the names of all them, because each one was so helpful and patient. Adam gave ME a sucker because it was my birthday! And he had my son cracking up, anyone that has a kid knows how important it is that your kid is treated well!! The nurses that assisted with Scott's cast were great and very funny and sweet. Everyone genuinely seemed like they loved what they were doing and every kid that walked through the door. My son was probably the oldest the couple of times we were there, but there were some little kids, screaming and crying getting casts on and the staff never let out a sigh and just gently took care of all of them. I'd have to say Dr. White was my favorite part of the experience. From insisting that my son was going to get a pink cast because that was the only color they had, to cracking jokes about his monkey bar skills. He lightened the environment and we found ourselves laughing, smiling and having a good time in what could have been a very uncomfortable and scary situation. He explained every step of the process, he kept me informed and put my mind at ease when I would start to question or worry. He even told me that he would be doing the same thing if it were his own child's arm, which really helped me to feel at ease. We have another appointment coming up and I am honestly excited to take Scott back there! He loves it and so do I!",2012-03-20 01:31:04

Just when everything seemed to be going so well...

Separate incidents on different visits have encouraged me to take our dining-out dollars elsewhere.

1. Minor but nonetheless irritating, I placed an order for chicken tenders. Wasn't asked if I wanted the plain or seasoned batter AND got a young man with an attitude who gave me dirty looks and rude conversation because I didn't know the sauce for the chicken tenders was called dipping sauce.

Um... no.

2. There was also the incident where an older gentleman took our order (as opposed to the younger folk who usually do) and got one of the condiments wrong, resulting in a request for a new sandwich.

And he told the member of my dining party that SHE told him the wrong condiment. Which she did not. I was standing there when she placed her order. It's more likely he heard ""m"" and assumed mayo instead of mustard or thought he hit the right key.

Either way, how do you sustain a customer base by accusing a customer and using a derogatory tone of voice?

Um... no.

3. On another occasion, we went to the pick-up window and although my companion had her hand out for the bag, a young man working the window pushed our food across the counter at her and walked away.

Um... no.

4. Then there was the couple that came in with the dog. And the dog's water bowl. And the guy handed it to a young man standing at the register who filled the bowl from a sink in the general food prep area.

Um... HELL no.

I was willing to give the Char-Grill the benefit of the doubt because sometimes things happen.

I passed by this place last weekend and thought it would be an interesting place to try out. After searching this place on Yelp and noticing reasonable reviews, I decided to try this place tonight.

We started with a bottle of coke and a bottle of water. I've been skipping on carbonated water lately to maintain healthiness so I took the bottle of water and gave my dad the bottle of coke. In terms of food, we had the Ultimate burger with cajun fries, the Central Park burger with onion rings, and 1lb of blue BBQ wings.

The portions were gigantic! My dad is normally a huge eater and he only barely finished the burger and had only half of the fries. I finished by burger but didn't even touch my onion rings (okay...I had one). We did share and finished the wings, while tasty and juicy, lacked the blue cheese taste it was supposed to have. The burger, aside from quantity, was moderately juicy, and was very generous in terms of the ingredients (eg: my burger had mushrooms and blue cheese; the blue cheese I had was probably the size of a rubik's cube and the mushrooms were certainly plentiful).

Total came to around $56. A little higher than I expected considering we were a party of 2, though we did have to pack our fries and onion rings. I only realized after I checked in that they had the free fountain soda offer, but it was too late as I already had two drinks on the table. Oh well, next time.

Service was great. The guy (I assume the owner) was attentive to us the whole time (aside from the 2 minutes he was on the phone) and asked us if everything was okay. Nice guy too.",2014-03-13 04:14:52

Dinner Menu - So diverse and so good! Everything from burgers to tacos/enchiladas, Asian inspired dishes and salads. My favorite dish (and always a crowd favorite) is the Coconut Ginger Curry.

This location is down the street from me so I go often due to my burrito addiction. I basically always get the lil (their smallest size) bean and cheese on whole wheat. Same order I get at Burrito Bandidos but this place just gets something wrong along the way.

Beans are tasty and smokey in flavour, they offer chow mein along with the rice but I usually skip it. Bit too much starch for my liking. Then they have the usual toppings that I indulge in - lettuce, pico de gallo, jalapeno, cilantro, peppers, salsa, sour cream, burrito sauce (it's very tasty here), but they also have coleslaw which I think is gross and the vinegar dressing takes over and runs throughout the burrito. They also will crunch up some chips in there which is kind of a nice touch. Watch out for the hot sauce, I ask for a little bit which can vary depending on the person making it but it is extremely spicy. My husband likes the burn so he goes for it.

A friend and I decided to meet here and catch up over a drink and dinner. I went for a pumpkin beer (of course, such a sucker for pumpkin products) and she had wine.

I guess it's different if someone doesn't like burgers a little pink inside and they come out pink, but I prefer them pink and this was a little overcooked. But, even THAT wasn't the issue (expensive beer, ok fries, and overcooked meat so far). The REAL issue was the grease. Anyone who knows me or reads my reviews knows I love grease, but this was gross; edible, but kind of gross for what I paid for this hunk of meat on a bun. 

The grease had soaked completely into the bottom bun; my finger went through it entirely, straight to the burger immediately. It was like I was eating leftovers before they even got to become leftovers. The bun was brown and dripping with grease! I guess it was good, but not something I would expect from a place like this.

The interior is very laid back. I loved the wooden scuplted tables....they added such a nice element to the dining experience. We ordered a bottle of wine to split and the boiled peanut hummus to start off with. The wine was a cabernet and excellent. The boiled peanut hummus was so good....my dad was even talking about it the next day!

Next, we ordered three small plates to share. We ordered the WTF chicken (the name was longer than that but I can't remember it....only the first 3 letters stood out haha), the Short and Corny, and some seafood bake. The Short and Corny was the favorite among all 4 of us. Delicious short ribs sitting on top of a creamed corn casserole........so good! The chicken was also very good and had this very tasty sauce over it. The seafood bake was good but didnt stand out like the other two items. 

The only negative comment is that service is pretty slow here. They don't have many servers...sometimes it is just one person taking care of the whole restaurant. It didn't really bother us much because we were just drinking wine and chatting. 

At the end of the night, all four of us were stuffed and left happy. We were still raving about the food the next day....so that means it's gotta be good!",2013-10-21 17:20:45

The problem with hype is that it's usually overdone. I recently attended AYA and left a bit disappointed. I agree with fellow Yelpers that the dishes here are quite tasty, but it's not exactly a value proposition when it comes out to over $50 per head, including 1 cocktail, 2 dishes, tax and tip.

My DC and I ordered the POBLANO STUFFED PEPPER, which was one of the highlights from a taste, texture and spiciness perspective. The BEEF TONGUE STEW was also quite delicious, as echoed by others. The MEATBALL was decent but not *amaze-balls* (wah wah wah). Most disappointingly was the CEVICHE, which while nice and limey, didn't seem to have enough fish.

We dined on the main floor and sat at the awkward wall tables, where your legs end up dangling forward as you twist your body to talk (and this was even with an aggressive game of footsies!). It also felt very cramped, but I suppose some will enjoy this setup and it's not a bad idea per se, given the limited space, but I would try to get a regular table instead. Service was otherwise good, no complaints there. The cocktails were tasty, and I need to remind myself that something's only worth as much as anyone is willing to pay for it, but even then, I don't think they're worth it - go with the beer instead.",2014-04-11 21:13:14

I've been to Chiado many times and delight in the server coming over to describe the fresh fish offered that evening, the way it is prepared and its accompanying sides. 

The guy we first had just pointed to the fish and named them...I was trying to show off this restaurant so when I grilled him for more fish detail, he was clueless ""oh they are served with starch and vegetables...the chef chooses day to day""...well we want to know today! So I quietly called over the guy who seems to run the show, he suggested two dishes, gave us half portions of two of the fresh fish with half portions of their sides, too. It was great.

The biggest Con of this place? It's conveniently located right inside Square One. This place is a zoo! Maneuvering your cart through overcrowded aisles of screaming children, inattentive parents, and distracted employees is quite the task!

Soups - lobster bisque and a leek soup. Both were good but not amazing
Salad - tuna with scallops and a beet salad. The tuna was really good. It was sushi style tuna and the scallops were seared to perfection. The beet salad was also good but the tuna was way better
Pomegranate sorbet to ""cleanse"" the palette
Dinner - my wife had the beef tenderloin and I had the black cod. The tenderloin was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. All of the other flavours it came with matched very well.

We came by for a late lunch on a weekday and it was almost empty and devoid of small children. We sat at the bar and ordered an Irish Mai Tai (has beer in it) and a blackberry Moscow Mule.

This seemed like a great deal. We opted for the nachos, which were priced at $12. By paying $14.99, instead of $12, we got a game card for all the games letting us play whatever we wanted for 1-hr. The one catch is that you can't earn tickets when playing with a timeframe card. But you definitely get a lot more play for you money. The nachos were pretty good. Standard bar fare. The selection of games was pretty good, including some unique ones we'd never seen before.

1. Excellent quality fillings - from the steak to the grilled veggies, everything here is cooked well and tastes great. Toppings are fresh and a cut above what you find at Salsarita's or Baja Fresh.
2. Whole wheat option - the tortlla's and salad bowls are available in whole wheat.

The stylish dining room has a nice view out to the river, though partially obscured by the Waterfront Line.  There was an outdoor dining area, though it was inexplicably underused despite the nice weather.

The dinner menu consists of appetizers, antipasti, pastas, full Italian dishes, pizzas, panini, and salads.  The antipasti featured five cheeses and a number of meats to choose from.  Relying on our server's recommendations, the selection of olives, cheeses, and meats we received was decent.  The lasagna was excellent, baked just enough to get a slight browning of cheese along the edges.  The lasagna is plated on top of toasted breadsticks laying on a plate of red and white sauce in a yin-yang-like pattern.  For dessert, however, the white truffle chocolate milkshake was a major miss that I couldn't stomach to finish.  The truffle paste seemed to leave the shake with a soured milk taste.  Service remained friendly and casual throughout.

Overall, I thought Lago East Bank was a decent place, and I have high hopes for the revitalization of the Flats area.  You will too if you take a post-dinner stroll away from the Ernst & Young building and into the Scooby Doo ghost town.",2013-08-26 02:55:17

Not the best eggs benny by ANY means, despite what the other reviews say. 

Service is not the best. You won't get any smiles or pleasantries here, at least I never have. Maybe because I am not a Lululemon-wearing, dog-walking soccer mom who lives in the area and shops and brunches all day. Food takes YEARS to arrive, but when it does, it's pretty good.

Large iced hibiscus green/black tea with aloe and no ice.
Large iced longan green/black tea with aloe and no ice.

Those two provide actual chunks of the actual ingredient so it is not just flavoring.  The black tea is better, but it keeps me up at night.  I also order with no ice so they don't block my way to the chunks.  They still prep it with ice, they just don't put the ice in your glass afterwards so it is still a very cold drink).

Since my friends got those, I chose a different tea for myself which was pomegranate.  My drink, the longan and the cheese cakes were all good; though I still prefer the pomegranate blueberry cheese cake.

However, the hibiscus green tea that night was excessively sweet.  I commented on that one to the waitress and she recommended that I order with half sugar is possible.  So my new standard orders are

And boy we're glad we did coz by far this is one of the best jerk chicken and oxtail stew  in downtown Toronto! We tried Rasta Pasta and it doesn't even come close to the deliciousness that Under the Table offers.

ultra convenient location, of course. and if there's one thing I can't hate on shoppers for, it's bigotry. I have seen so many employees that are edgy with facial piercings, tattoos, undercuts, the whole shebang. good on shoppers for hiring people without letting those factors get in the way.

but really, move those drugs to the first floor. I don't want to climb stairs for them!",2013-08-12 04:19:27

Here are my notes:

1) They charge you per can of soda.
2) Tried the calamari, and while it was cooked well, it was bland. The only saving grace was the fact that there was some sriracha at the table to help give it some flavor.
3) Tried the Tonkotsu ramen ($8.99), added extra charsui ($2.50), mushrooms (uh regular american white mushrooms), and bok choy...  all of it bland. the broth, the charsui, the bok choy, bland. I tried adding hot sauce, soy sauce (they only had low-sodium), and it was still bland. Didn't even finish my meal.

So in the end a expensive bowl of ramen that isnt worth it. Go to Monta or Ichiza or Ramen Sora.

This was my husband and I's second time coming back here! In retrospect of my review the prices are definitely reasonable. Our waitress, Chelsea was so amazing. She had great suggestions for us, and checked on us frequently. We tried the seafood enchiladas which I highly recommend. We had a few drinks and stayed for about an hour and a half. We sat more in the dining area rather than the bar and truthfully that made a difference to our experience. We met with Jim (if you've seen the comment for this review), and he was such a great host and super generous. I'm so glad we gave this place a second shot, it's close to us and the food was amazing. Look forward to coming back!

----------------------------------------------------

First time coming to this place, I definitely would say if you come to expect not great service. Our waitress let us know that she was training someone today, which is no biggie (congratulations, ya know?) but then they disappeared. It took a good 15 minutes to receive our food, which was great. You have to pay for chips and salsa which is weird, most Mexican restaurants it's an automatic gesture to the table. Would come back to try the margaritas, their alcohol selection is pretty wide range",2018-09-01 23:55:48

90cSOFDue_EXX9ag-K9L8A,qDgApqioN9qReeLiNytQqw,mqiHZYNXnMLaEK87JZOzmA,4,6,8,5,"As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.

Tasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because ""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees"". 

I'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.

The new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.

Tasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.

Generally, SUPER SALTY food but totally made sense..to keep you drinking

Beers were also undersized for the price..they're about $7 for about a 1/2 to 3/4 pint. If you drink a few, you'll find your paying quite a bit more per ounce of beer. 

Where they charge less for food, you get gauged in beer 

Food was 5.95 per item (no more $5)

Best thing was the poutine, good portion with nice amount of cheese curds and gravy

Honey garlic wings were ok, sauce was like liquid sugar. Way too sweet. 

Works burger was ok. Burger was something you'd find at your local grocery store frozen aisle

Beef dip pretty good, bun was good, beef was very tender and moist, jus dip was INSANELY salty. If you order side salad, hold the dressing! They drench it (again, to get you to drink more!)

Waitress was friendly and took good care of us.

Monday night is Margarita & Fajita night.  I tried the chicken fajita special for $6.95.  A lot of food, plenty to serve 2+.   Lacked spices for my taste, but the veggies were nicely crisp and plenty of chicken and toppings.  He liked the $3 margarita special.  

Also tried the wings.  They offer them about 8 different ways.  We tried honey-BBQ.  Nothing special in my opinion.  Maybe a different sauce would have been a better choice.  (Sorry but I think it's hard to beat Zipp's.)

One other couple inside.  Each table has its own grill.  We started with soup.  My girlfriend had miso soup.  It was too salty.  I had pumpkin pourage.  It was cold, sweet, and had the consistency of pudding.  I tried some of the already prepared items.  They were all cold and flavorless.  The waiter was really, really nice and attentive.  He kept our drinks fresh, plates cleared away, and swapped out our grill top when it started to turn black.  I really like this guy and hope he gets a job at some place better where his skills will be more appropriately rewarded.  The grill meats were mostly bland.  You pick the raw meats up on a buffet area.  I imagine cross contamination is a real issue here.  The cuts were too thin.  The shrimp was in the shell and had not been de-veined.  That is, the gastro intestinal track was still in tact.  The dark line running down the back is their feces.  Gross!  Besides peeling the meat out of the shell while smok'in hot is no fun.

When I went into the store the man with the grey handle bar mustache was pretty insulting right off the bat. I said to them, hey I got this beer brewing kit from Target and he stopped me right there and said, "" Ya a Mr. Beer, I am familiar with it"" in a very condescending attitude. Before I could even ask another questions he continued by saying, ""Let me say you are going to get mediocre beer at best, OK beer. We here are brewing the best beer on the planet if you want to brew good beer you need to get something different, but a Mr. Beer is an ok place to start to see if you like it."" I was pretty insulted by this and at that point didn't want to spend a dime at that store but I really needed the bottles and the were the only local place I knew I could by them and the cappers. Well one case of bottles (24) and one manual capper and 400 bottle caps was over $40. So not only did I get poor service, but it cost an arm and a leg. 

I have already bottled one batch and started brewing another. This time I was smart and went on online and was able to get 1 lb of priming sugar ($6.99), 1 case of bottles and caps (16.99) and it was less than $30 shipped to my door.

After being a college athlete and spending much of my late teens/early 20s working out additionally in a traditional gym I was severely burned out. I swore off working out for three years and instead maintained my weight through diet. After realizing that sitting in an office chair probably wasn't the best for my health I researched gym alternatives and decided on TruFusion. I was impressed by the number of classes they offered and how early and late the classes went in the day. The membership was also relatively cheap compared to similar gyms. 

I was warned by friends when I signed up that TruFusion was ""so busy and crowded now, especially at nights."" This worried me as I planned on mostly going after work around 6. Maybe these warnings helped me think it was going to be worse than it is but I don't find it to be a problem at all. Most of the time as long as you get there 10-15 early and are there when they open the doors to the class you can get a spot. The most packed class I've been in is Liz's class but she helped people that showed up at the last minute by asking people to move over. I'm definitely the kind of person that dreads walking into a packed room with no place for me so I will always try to get there early. 

Each instructor is different so you're constantly getting variation through class types and instructors. So far I've only been to hot pilates and bootcamp but I'm excited to try the others! I will admit that on my first day there I was thoroughly confused by the sign in process, lockers, and where to get the equipment for class. The front desk wasn't overly helpful but if you just watch people or ask for help you'll get through it.

It was at the 2018 Greater Pittsburgh Food Truck festival at the Meadows Casino. The festival started at noon, we showed up at 12:10 And the line for Cousins was already very long!. Note to self, this truck is more popular than I was led to believe, show up early! After a 40+ minute wait in the hot sun I made my way to the window. They had tv's on the truck with the menu items and prices, but honestly they were very hard to see because of the sun. They also had printed photos of their items and it would have been a much better idea for them to have the prices listed on those pictures for people to see. It would also speed up the line because I could see people were taking forever to order. I was smart enough to examine the menu on my phone whole I was in line so I didn't have an issue. Another note is that they take cash or credit which is nice because their items are not cheap, $15/roll. I went with the Maine Lobster roll, their cold lobster roll version. They also have a Connecticut Roll which is served hot, lobster tots and tacos. I was so very surprised when I saw the roll, I had been anticipating this moment for quite awhile! Large, and I mean very large, hunks and claws of lobster. I loved the fact that is had his the absolute bare minimum amount of mayo and there was a little wedge of lemon to squeeze over the succulent lobster. So fresh and delicious. I was almost sad I didn't order two! Forgive my skepticism thinking that a Food truck in PA would have a good lobster roll!  I will most definitely be back for another when I see this truck at a future event. Loved it!",2018-05-26 19:18:00

This place is excellent for korean fried chicken. I usually get half a chicken to share. Crispy skin on the outside, even when smothered in gooey yummy special sauce that apparently has 20 natural ingredients....?...! It's good. I get the HOT version because I find the regular too tame for my tastebuds.  It's happened twice so far though that I ordered the HOT version and they just gave me the regular version. I'm not gonna send it back cuz they're both good, but they need to get their orders straight.  Their oyster kimchi fried rice is a pretty good side if you want carbs in addition to the meaty goodness.  I am often just happy ordering the chicken!

I find it funny that they serve chopsticks/spoon to their Korean patrons and fork/spoon to their non-Korean patrons. Just an observation.

Also, at the air bag jump the young man doesnt pay attention to how many kids are jumping in at the same time. An older girl jumped right on top of my daughter.

Maybe, although I've bellied up to the bar (for food, too, okay?) often, I haven't shared my experiences because I wanted to keep this secret all to myself. Well THAT obviously didn't work! 

Let's begin with offerings from the bar. DO indulge! A classic margarita perhaps? A Ramon Gin Fizz? Maybe a Spicy Cucumber or a Classic Daiquiri or an Anjeo Witch or......SO many well created cocktails from which to choose. Or maybe a frozen concoction or interesting beer? Let your bartender guide you...some of the best in town are behind the stick.

On to the food. If you're a lover of guacamole, THIS is the best in town. You're given a slip of paper with add ins for your custom guac to check off with abandon. My hands down favorite combo is bacon (if nothing else, GET THE BACON!), roasted poblano and blue cheese. And the chips! Whoa. 

The tacos. More to the point, the täkō tacos. The Japanese word for octopus is täkō, hence the täkō taco is an octopus one. And it's delicious! My first experience with the cephalopod, I'd say it tastes like a cross between lobster and shrimp with a similar texture. 

More traditional? Don't miss the carnitas or al pastor tacos or if you'd like to step outside of the box without going all the way to octopus, the Korean tacos are an umami bomb of tender wagyu beef, fermented cucumber, pickled carrots and peanuts. 

The atmosphere is comfortable, sexy even. If you're lucky enough to score a swing out seat on the sidewalk out front of the open kitchen, grab it! Oh, and word has it that brunch is coming soon. Shhhhhhhh...let's keep it out secret.",2015-10-02 22:58:40

In the four years I have lived in Bridgeland, I have been to main dish about 50 times or more-and for various reasons. Sometimes it's for an eat in supper (the turkey gnocchi is to die for as is the burger), sometimes to take home supper, sometimes to grab quick meals from the deli (mac and cheese, stuffed chicken breasts, meatloaf), sometimes to grabs dips for a party (tzatziki is deadly), sometimes for breakfast (scrambles rule) but always for the DELICIOUS FOOD. Main Dish sells itself as ""healthy and nutritious"" which I believe they are doing well. Everything is fresh, clean tasty and not over processed or stuffed with junk ingredients. The make home deli items are easily heated in the oven with mains, sides and desserts all available to round out dinner after a hard day at work. 

The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem to rarely turnover, so I'm going to assume they are treated well and like their jobs- which is encouraging to see. The atmosphere is casual, outgoing, quaint, cute and fun. Brunch and breakfast is always good and their coffee bar is quite delicious. During summer they setup tables on the sidewalks which makes for a awesome supper in the sun with wine and great food with friends, and within walking distance for me (think drinking more wine than planned trying to absorb as much sun as possible).

Regularly they also bring in olympic athletes to talk about food and their stories about eating and exercise, which is fun and very interesting to hear (not to mention afforded me the opportunity to actually touch a gold medal:). Jazz nights are also a regular occurrence with live musicians which we have attended and enjoyed.

Favorite items:

Mac and cheese, turkey gnocchi, burger with mushroom ragu, Italian stuffed chicken, vanilla bean cheesecake and without a doubt the feta cheese and chick pea salad. Life changing in my opinion.

The pecan praline was essentially a yellow cake with pecans that was also covered with the delicious cream cheese frosting - honestly, not as good as the red velvet in my opinion. 

Customer service was friendly and fast. I was given a punch card. If you buy 12 bundtlets, you can get one free bundlet of your choice. I just can't get enough of that cream cheese frosting. I will be back to try more flavors - chocolate chip, white chocolate raspberry, cinnamon swirl, white chocolate, marble, carrot, and lemon.",2016-02-07 18:54:12

The PBR was 10 dollars... I don't care if it's a liter. It's still PBR. It's not supposed to be the most expensive beer on your menu. The food was pretty interesting, i tried a bite of the kangaroo meat, and I had some of the bison. It was a really novel thing, but I suspect in the future I would prefer the street meat for 3 bucks over the rare game meat for 9. However, i definitely like the idea, and trying something new was fun.

I liked the place, it was definitely worth trying. However, you have to be able to look past the cafeteria-ish setting, which while interesting, would probably wear thing on me eventually.

Great location! Situated on 4th Street, a closed off street in d/t Cleveland, you get to take in all the great restos that Cleveland has. The decor of Greenhouse is really nice too - very hipster.

The service was quite slow. My sister and I were here for almost two hours. Luckily we had all the time in the world.

The food was meh considering the price point. I had the steak frites; the steak was pretty good, but the frites were extremely salty. My sister had the lamb burger, again, she found the burger tasty, but could only taste the salt in her frites. The drink menu is not that big, but they do have some unique beers. I had the gluten free raspberry ale and it was quite sweet and light.

Service:  Very friendly staff that got us seated immediately with smiles.  The servers kept my diet Cokes fresh and I worked my way through the food.  The kitchen got our food to us quickly and was prepped well.

Pho & then some: Dining with my God-daughter, parents and bros ensures we get to try a lot dishes.  I had the #12 otherwise known as the Special 88 Beef Noodle Soup Pho Dac Biet.  Great broth that compliments the tasty noodles and beef.  Lots of noodles and beef ensured it would be hard to finish this tasty bowl of Pho. Great stuff
The pork chops with egg was very good.  Cooked and seasoned well and the eggs complimented the flavor  
The egg rolls were as good as you'd find in any Pho joint but the chicken wings were my favorite non-pho dish. Lots of flavor and you got a lot of wings for the order.  Great value in price and flavor and something I'll have again.

Ambiance:  Green walls and contemporary lighting make for a bright and pleasant dining area in a very large open area.  Red Asian decorations, and art line the wall and floor plants throughout the room.  There are lots of tables and chairs in the center with big booths along the wall.  I don't think there'd be an issue with a wait even on the busiest of nights with this much seating and quick service.

Pho 88 just became my favorite casual Pho restaurant on the Southwest side of town.  I love the fact that even the non-Pho dishes were great along with the Pho to give me more options when visit.  You're getting some very flavorful Vietnamese food for a very fair price.  I wasn't planning a dinner here that night, but this was meant to be. hehe  Enjoy!",2017-12-11 08:03:45

We actually couldn't decide on Joe's Farm Grill or Joe's Real BBQ, but ultimately picked Farm Grill because I was craving fries and the BBQ joint does not serve them...

When we arrived, there was a line to order, however it moved pretty quickly.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and although initially I wanted fries, I opted for the onion rings at the last minute.  Both were excellent.  I rarely order a chicken sandwich because usually a grilled chicken sandwich from a restaurant is inedible, but here the chicken was moist and flavorful.  I was not disappointed.  The onion rings were great too.  

My man ordered the double dogs with chili - two chili dogs - they looked really good!  He also had fries that I shared.  :)

We sat outside since we were lucky enough to have 80-ish degrees in the middle of a Phoenix summer.  It was so nice!  The sounds and the smells of the Farm reminded me of BBQs and picnics I enjoyed as a child in Illinois and made me realize it was probably time for a visit again.  :)

I'm not a fan of cowboy culture or what I'd traditionally associate with ""cowboy food""-dead animals, goopy beans, etc. So when I went to Cowboy Ciao for a work dinner, I was a little apprehensive about the menu but was pleasantly surprised at how decent the meal was. Not to mention, the ambiance wasn't all Western-themed at all-it was modern and classy, with more European influence than anything.

We ate in the back room reserved for large parties, and our servers were friendly and attentive throughout the meal. To start, I had the Stetson chopped salad ($12), which normally comes with smoked salmon, pearl couscous, arugula, dried sweet corn, bruschetta tomatoes, trail mix and a pesto buttermilk dressing. I opted to leave the salmon off. The portion was tiny, but the remaining ingredients made for such a fun and interesting combination of tastes and textures. I loved the crunchy corn, which went really well with the dressing. I opted to mix everything together, even though the ingredients were originally separated, and the only complaint I have is that I wish there had been more of it.

For my main course, I had the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry ($24), which came with polenta, mushrooms, tomatoes, avocado and cheese, drenched in a delicious ancho chile cream. I thought the mushrooms were amazing, but I'm not a huge fan of polenta, which I passed on to my dining companions. They said it was wonderful, so if you like polenta, you'll probably like this. My favorite part was the ancho chile cream, which had just the right amount of spice to it and complemented the other ingredients well.

I paired my meal with a tasty mojito, but someone else ordered a bacon-garnished cocktail that I had to take a picture of. Seriously, why is bacon such a big trend?! Poor pigs.

Other people noshed on Stuffed Pork Rib Chops ($27) with blue cheese, ancho bread pudding and raisin/fig compote, while others dug in to Grilled Salmon ($29), with poblano cakes and tomatillo relish. The dishes looked pretty, and I didn't hear any complaints about the rest of the food.

Dessert was so delicious, I would go to Cowboy Ciao just for after-dinner drinks and dessert. We had Ricotta Cheesecake ($8), with a strawberry/orange blossom compote and honey. Every bite was creamy and fruity and melted in your mouth-just how cheesecake should be. Mmmmmm.

So, don't judge Cowboy Ciao on its name. The menu includes everything from a New Zealand Lamb Loin to bruschetta and enchiladas-not exactly stuff you'd expect to see cooking around a campfire. And with candlelit tables and chandeliers gracing the ceilings, the eatery is way prettier than a dusty old saloon, too.",2012-07-10 06:18:35

However, our visit this week left us wondering if we will ever be back again.  Service was definitely subpar and the food was equally disappointing.  First, we were seated in the smaller dining area to the right of the entrance.  There was a pianist playing on an electric keyboard so there was very little room to maneuver.  I literally had to move the table in order to get to my seat and my husbands chair was up against the chair of table behind us.  We were bewildered as the hostess kept cramming people into this tiny room when the larger room behind us was practically empty.  When our waitress initially came by, we said we needed just another minute before ordering.  20 minutes later .... we had to hunt her down.  We ordered the duck, the Burma chicken and a small order of the Thai chow mein.  After another long wait the duck and chow mein were served .... both dishes we had never had there before.  The duck was pretty good, but the noodles left a lot to be desired.  First, the portion size of the noodles at $11.99 was definitely not worth price.  It was more like a $6.99 portion.  Secondly, the noodles were in clumps.  Like they just dumped them in a pot with too little water and didn't bother to stir them to separate them.  After getting half way through these dishes we had to hunt down our waitress again and ask about the Burma chicken.  Her response that she didn't think we order that.  I had to remind her that my husband specifically asked her whether ordering the small noodles and the 2 entrees (one of them being the chicken) would be enough.  We actually came here specifically for the Burma chicken.  It's been my favorite dish here since we first came to Malee's.  For the first time, it was a huge disappointment.  The stronger curry flavor with just a touch of sweetness made it stand out from other Thai curry's at other restaurants.  Unfortunately, that night it was much heavier on the coconut milk and lighter on the curry.  Don't know if they have changed management or ownership, but the service and the food were not what we had come to expect from them.",2018-03-13 06:49:27

Many people wait for the crab to come, so we basically had to stare at the buffet area so we can get some when they brought it out.

It included a crab of around 6 pounds which was steamed, deep fried, and cooked with congee. The combo also included the snow tips dish and a sashimi platter. Since we had 6 people we added some dim sum and the vermicelli.

I wouldn't say the crab was cooked the best, but definitely a good deal seeing that the king crab is very expensive these days. I was disappointed because there was no crab roe at all. I wonder where it all went....

The deep fried dough fritter for the congee was extremely hard. I think they have refried it a couple of times.

The servers here are not the brightest. I ordered a steamed charcoal sticky rice but when the server brought it to us, it was the charcoal salty egg lava bun. I told him I ordered the sticky rice and pointed to him on the order sheet. He's like yeah that's the sticky rice. Then he looked again then changed the buns to the sticky rice.

While putting down the steamed minced beef balls, the server's (a different server) pencil touched one of the balls. I literally said to her your pencil touched this one. She just ignored me and left.

The sticky rice was also very inconsistent. In a single piece there was like 20 pieces of preserved sausage (which I hate). Also, one roll's skin is like a quarter the thickness of all the others.

8-DczSAjm-4gizJedLbhaQ,AwyM03qzhwgyskBruurWQw,gTn_YaXUYEC5py8ESrX5Wg,3,3,0,1,"As food trucks go, Maki, in concept, is everything one can aspire to be- mixing and crossing international cuisine borders to produce inventive new food that pushes gastronomic boundaries and challenges conventional thinking.  This is, afterall, one of the pluses of a food truck, smaller overhead and freedom to try new things without worry that some will be a hit while others will be lacking.

Maki certianly swings for the fences by incorporating Pan Asian dishes into the convenience of street-friendly taco shells.  For example, bulgogi (or Korean bbq) is delicious all by itself, but it is normally a sit down meal.  When wrapped in a soft corn tortilla, however, you now have the distinctive taste of spicy sesame oil, soy, and garlic in a package fit for going mobile.  The sauce alone is unique and wonderful.  Maki's beef strips are rightly thin-sliced and the bell pepper and onion is not overly cooked into mush. 

The same goes for their crab and avacoado tacos.  This is basically a deconstructed sushi roll placed into crispy taco shell, complete with sesame seeds and cream cheese.  I wonder, however, if real crab is used given then uniformity of the shreads of meat that seem to be the hallmark of faux-crab stricks most commonly used in sushi restaurants.  Minor point, but the final product is most enjoyable and different due to the crunch of the shell.

I just think Maki could go even further, however.  Rather than just wrap it all in a traditional Mexican exterior, why not include a few Mexican inspirations into your offerings?  For example, a verde ""salsa"" to go with your habachi dishes made from either cilantro or basil.  Lettuce shells instead of corn tortillas.  Rice paper taco shells to deconstruct a summer roll.  ""Refried"" lentils in place of the ubiquitous beans dropped onto the plate of most every Mexican restaurant.  Curried rice in place of mexican rice.  I'm just spit-balling, but my point is there is much more than can be explored here, and I think the chef has the skills to pull it off.  

For the price paid, a side or two would go a long way to quelling the many Yelper comments I echo here: $10+ for 2 or 3 tacos leaves me feeling a bit wanting on the value scale.  I understand food trucks prefer a la carte pricing, but either price needs to shift down or something more is needed to add value for the customer. 

I will certainly continue to patronize Maki and will encourage others to try the same, but there are sparks of inspriation here ready to ignite and take off- I hope for and want Maki to light that fire.",2012-03-22 15:23:25

We thought this is a good place to stay since it's in the middle of the strip.  Not a very family friendly place even though the lagoon type pool online may be inviting.  Only a small section of the pool, where the lame slides were, are for families.  The lagoon area was blocked off for 21 and older.  The kids were bored out of their mind.  I got a nice golden tan out of it, though.

We asked for non-smoking rooms and it reeked of smoke and fragrance spray to mask it...gagged me.  We asked for another room and it was a little better.  We paid $179 a night per room in advance thinking that it will reserve 3 rooms, all with 2 doubles.  We still got one with a king.  My friend said we were jipped for paying that much per room.  Live and learn.  

The remodel was nothing exciting.  Slapped on some paint, change the bedsheets, and add a flat panel tv...voila!   Our room had the laminated floor and the rest had the dirty and stained carpets...eww.  The bathrooms were not too bad.

With hordes of people, expect to line up for everything...yes, everything!  The buffet was not that great (review coming up).  

It is centrally located and the view of the Bellagio's fountain from our window for the two stars.

We tried to accomodate everyone's budget...we will not stay here again even if we have to go off the strip, that's for sure!",2012-07-31 18:31:04
flFlnxB3sSgPiO9pLgWu4A,BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,UmZabXjUjTVekZlys2Ao8A,3,7,4,7,"Ok guys, I have to add my two cents about this mall. If you were to go to The Galleria Shopping Centre today for the first time, you would think the mall sucks. You would think that it's dated, dingy, and sometimes smells funny. However, if you have some past connection to this mall, like I do, you will find it strangely endearing. In a time when so many malls are owned by Cadillac-Fairview, and so many malls look exactly the same, it's kind of refreshing to see good old Galleria, still stuck in the 1970s and unapologetically so. 

I remember going to this mall as a child. I remember when the FreshCo was a Food City, and the Rexall was a Boots (yep, the drugstore chain from the UK, they actually had them in Canada, once upon a time). There was a Towers in this mall (not the record store, but a discount store similar to Target and Kmart). The mall area (not inside the stores, but the common area) looked exactly the same! I remember people would go there and hang out, but not in a sketchy-what-are-they-up-to kind of way, but in a building community and making friends kind of way. They were mostly older men. They wore slacks with their shirts tucked in. They'd drink coffee and talk about life. 

There was a discount store there (like a dollar store, but prices were more than a dollar) that sold the most unusual things. I saw a Jesus night light there. Twenty years later, I'm pretty sure I saw the same night light. I think it was in a different store, but definitely still in the same mall.

Once in a while the parking lot would be closed off and there would be a carnival/fair. With games, rides, and cotton candy. They still do this occasionally.

So I heard the mall is set for demolition and the place is going to be redone. I have very mixed feelings about this. I realize that revitalization will likely attract more customers and make the place more money (this kind of nostalgia does not pay bills), but I will really miss the old time charm.

So even if you have no sentimental feelings for the mall, it's not that bad, it's a functional mall that's not too crowded, with a grocery store (FreshCo) and a drug store (Rexall).",2017-11-17 05:30:26

I was actually on my way to explore another restaurant when I came upon Aroma and decided to try it. As I walked up the stairs, the smell of the food opened my appetite and I was anxious to dig in.

Their lunch buffet (13.99) wasn't very big but they had most of the popular dishes. The butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, beef rogan josh, curry goat, they were all good. As tasty as it was, I could only manage to have two plates before I was stuffed. Good food.

My big disappointment, however, was dessert. Their ice cream freezer was only half full, with four tubs, and they were all practically empty. I didn't see any fruits either so I skipped dessert.

Overall, a great restaurant with high quality unique food.  Would have given 5 stars, but it was just a little too salty.

Recently I've been on a gastropub kick, so this was exactly what I wanted.  Everything was very very flavorful!  It kind of reminded me of Chego in West LA, but, instead of intense, strong, asian flavors, Greenhouse Tavern's dishes had super salty citrusy flavors.

We opted to order one of the ""thirds"" and a 4 course chef's tasting menu (at $44 it is such a good deal!)  Best decision!  We got to try so many more dishes and they were all full portions, unlike some of the other tasting menus I've tried.

Crunchy Hominy - a little too salty, but hominy is always great and the pork cracklins are a really nice complement.  

Crispy Chicken Confit - delicious!  Not too greasy and cooked so well!  Again a little too salty after you eat a few of these, so I wouldn't necessarily suggest ordering both this and the crunchy hominy at the same time.

Fish of the day - really well cooked halibut & again, super salty sides to go with it.

Pork Chop - Definitely recommend it!  Comes with two types of pork chops and delicious sides.  Also cooked so well.

Stoner's Sandwich - OUR FAVORITE!!!  Ice cream over this waffle/bread/cake with chocolate crunch in between.  YUM YUM YUM!  Even though the BF doesn't really like sweets, he really wanted another one!

Victoria Brew Draft - really good!!  very light and crisp.  Exclusively brewed for Greenhouse Tavern!

House Red Merlot - also suprisingly good for being the house red.  Spicier than I expected for a merlot, but I LOVEEEEEE shiraz and spicier wines, so it was a pleasant surprise for me.

The atmosphere is very fun, trendy and SUPER DARK.  Honestly, a little too dark for my taste.  I mean does it really have to be that dark for it to be cool?  It made me feel like they were trying to hide things/mistakes/unclean dishes :p

Service - Our waiter was excellent!  He provided great recommendations and was very informative, without going overboard and being overly chatty.

I just haadd to say ""delicious"" in both Korean and Hawaiian. 

Island Style is quite the hole-in-the-wall. Now I am aware they have added a new location in the Greenland Supermarket food court, but I urge you to try it's original location first. It's a little mom and pop restaurant located in the middle of an older business complex. It seems very modest from the outside, as the small establishment is covered by highly reflective film on its storefront. Nonetheless, from the moment you walk in, there's a overwhelming feeling of coziness. It is furnished nicely with wood flooring and homely decorations, which provide a nice and warm environment to eat in. It reminds me of being in someones own kitchen, especially since the owners are extremely genuine and welcoming. 

On to the goodies. I've been here several times, and it's often a struggle to decide whether to choose something from the Korean menu or the Hawaiian side. Both are equally solid. I have a few favorites on the Korean side, the stand-outs being the Casseroles and the Cold Buckwheat Noodle soup (Neng Myuhn), which is THE BEST IN TOWN. I live in the far Southwest side of town, and when I get a craving for Neng Myuhn, I take the 20 minute drive without hesitation. For those of you who haven't had this dish, you might be a little intrigued over a noodle-based soup that is served... well, cold. It is mainly a summer dish, but plenty still enjoy it throughout the colder seasons. The ingredients are fairly simple. The soup consists of a beef broth, is chilled, the served with thin and stringy buckwheat noodles. The garnishes are what really tie this dish together; sliced lean beef brisket, julienned cucumber, sliced Asian pears, pickled radish, and half of a hard-boiled egg adorned with sesame seed sprinkles. You are also presented with white vinegar and hot Korean mustard paste, both are things that I add to mine. The reason why Island Style's Buckwheat Noodle soup reigns supreme is because their broth is perfectly seasoned and the noodles glutinous texture is just right, or ""al dente"", if you will. If you haven't had this yet, and are a fan of Korean cuisine, I strongly suggest you try this, regardless of the temperature outside.

Island Style's Hawaiian fare also delivers, and it's apparent because this place is frequented by Vegas's local Hawaiians. I've tried most of their offerings, which consist of the usual favorites. My personal go-to dish tends to be the mixed plate, with the Meat Jun often being the first to disappear from my plate. I do recall them having a few specialty Hawaiian items on Thursdays, such as Kalua Pork & Cabbage and Ahi Poki which were delightful as well. 

There really isn't much else to add, except.... BOILED PEANUTS?! OMNOMNOMNOM. Oh and the Fried Mandu (Pork Dumplings) are also worthy of being labeled best in town. Hand-made daily.

Anyways, Island Style never fails to provide a quality meal in warm, homely atmosphere by owners who really seem to enjoy taking care of their local, and first time customers.",2010-11-08 05:59:12

I had heard that DiBella's might be better than Dave's Cosmic Subs, so I immediately went over there to check it out, only to find out that they're completely different and that a comparison would do neither seller of submarines justice.  While I can't exactly articulate what makes them different, I will say that Dave's seems a little more natural and might have better ingredients, while DiBella's sandwiches are a tad greasier and make you feel slightly crappier after eating one.

That said, this is still an excellent sandwich.  I had the hot Godfather sandwich (an assortment of Italian meats) on sesame bread.  Do not, I repeat, do not, try the large sandwich here.

The menu is more than a bit complicated. I believe there were actually six of them this Friday evening. That's half the fun and where a helpful waiter comes into play. Since a majority of our party had never been to the restaurant, we opted to share numerous small items to sample the menu. Many were ordered on the recommendation of our waiter. We were not disappointed. Interestingly, the bistro green beans tapas was my favorite dish (I was traumatized early in life by too many middle school cafeteria green beans, so green beans are never preference of mine). Or were the pork belly buns my favorite? Or the shrimp tempura udon? Can't decide. 

Highest praise came from my daughter, the one who lived in NYC for a year. She stated, ""this reminds me of my favorite NYC sushi spot."" 

I greatly appreciated the helpful waiter who showed no impatience with our illogical ordering process or our preference for water (there goes the big tip in many waiter's eyes) as our beverage. We tipped him as though we had all ordered cocktails.

Yes, this place is expensive.  But when you get the ""deal"" the cost falls into the same range as other car washes.

This was my first visit here.  I did get the Living Social deal.  When I pulled-up a young man walked over and explained their system (I was going to go inside and ask since I had the coupon deal thing).  You pick your wash (my coupon picked that for me), your scent and then go inside to the register.  Inside I could see how the wash worked, and I liked it.  There are no spinning brushes or flopping strips of material.  There are arches with sprayers, and as the car goes under each it gets wet, then soaped, then rinsed, and probably a spray wax too.  In between each arch are people washing by hand.  So after you get soap they move in and work the soap in by hand.  I lost sight of it after the rinse, so not sure about the spray wax.

Next the vehicle is taken to a finishing station outside where they vacuum it, do the windows, dry it off (blowing compressed air into all the crevices to get out all the water), and then they put something on the plastic pieces and dashboard to make them shiny.

Given the amount of by-hand labor involved, the pricing isn't too bad here.  All the cheaper places have spinning brushes and such (hope you remembered to take down your antenna!).  If anyone does anything by hand it's only the finishing at the end.  But Classic Car Spa is all by hand, so you should expect to pay a bit more.

When it was done the car seemed clean.  They did it reasonably quickly, and I haven't found anything that they missed.  My coupon gives me two more washes, and I will be using them happily.",2013-12-25 21:35:30

My last visit here was on a night in the middle of the week.  That didn't stop what seemed to be the rest of Scottsdale from coming here for a great evening of food and libations.  When you walk into Ocean Club, there is an ambiance that simply states sophistication and upscale.  

I was fortunate to be on the arm of a dashing and handsome gent as we were joined by another couple.  We were seated promptly for our reservation at a fantastic table that had a great view across the dining room.  The service was impeccable.  We ordered drinks and a bottle of wine suggested by our server.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and we were set for while as we looked over the menu and carried on conversation with our friends.  

My friend and I are pretty easy to please at restaurants like this.  Dare I say, we're pretty predictable.... for me almost always I order sea bass if it is on the menu and my friend 100% orders bone-in filet.  We were in luck, they had both on the menu as a great and amazing establishment like this should.  Their sea bass was as buttery and delicious as it was the first time I had it and all the other times thereafter.

So, the sides are where we usually get somewhat creative.  I suggest the lobster mashed potatoes, so very yummy and succulent and filling.  Not something I would order, but I definitely enjoy when someone else has ordered it at the table!  The garlic mashed potatoes are also tasty.  My friend loves the creamed corn.  My personal favorite is the sauteed spinach.  

For dessert, my friend loves Mastro's butter cake and we never go there without having it.  Again, very tasty and delicious.

This is a place to bring your mom for her birthday or parent's wedding anniversary, a woman that you are with that you care for or just care to get with.  This place is fantastic.  It is truly as good as it gets.  I'm also a HUGE fan of Mastro's Steakhouse.  I'm totally biased, this is the best restaurant chain on the planet.  Period.",2013-03-13 04:37:42

I've been here a number of times with several people.  A handful of meat eaters offer approval to the smashed meat patties and I (+1 more) vegetarians offer praises to the veggie burger. 

Things I love:
-  The yummy fountain ice teas
- The veggie fries (deep friend and herbed carrots and string beans which are yummy but less calorie laden compared to the smash fries which too are yummy)
- the service (despite it not really being a service expected place)

The veggie burger is not my favorite veggie burger of all time... but it's darn good.  It's made of black beans and is not processed which makes it a nice change.  I find the original recipe on the menu a bit too spicy for my tastes but you can make your own burger or select the style of any other burger on the menu (I heart places that slap a veggie patty into a whole menu of burgers like the rest of people choose from).   My favorite style thus far is the mushroom swiss configuration.

The service concept at XYZ seems to be on a ""share"" basis. As in every server shares you as their customer. Whichever server isn't busy will take your order. The next time around, someone different will refill your drink or put in your food order. Only one issue with this strategy: If multiple people are taking care of the entire dining room and it's busy, a table or request is sure to slip through the memory every now and then, right? Well it happened to us. Drink orders and food orders took too long to be filled. Apparently servers X, Y or Z assumed that server U, V or W had already taken care of us. It all just seems so unorganized and not at all logical to me. 

But besides that, the food, beer and booze selection was definitely above mediocre. The chicken and waffles were the best I've had in town.

The service is pretty close to non-existent.  I don't ask for much.  I just want my water glass full, my sodas refilled, and my order taken quickly.

Maybe there are some people who like to sit down and talk for a while before ordering - but I am not one of them.  I want to get my food ordered, and on the way.  It's rare that I'm not hungry by the time I roll in.

Mind you, at the end of the meal, I don't want to feel as if I'm being rushed out.  

At this location I've had to wait a while to order, and then when the food does come - it comes alone (without a refill of the drink that had been emptied in the interim.)  It's not like the waitresses don't get to your refill when they notice it - it's just that they're rarely around to notice.

I don't blame the wait staff (although there have been some occasions where they've walked right by.)  More often than not, I assume it's because they under staff.  I have no basis for this, it could simply be that the other locations I've been to over staff.

This seems to be the calling card of modern Swiss Chalets...

It felt like such a tease to see amazing artifacts and then read that they were reproductions. The dead sea scrolls were so amazing, partly because it is fascinating to stand before something that is so old and so important and think about the people so long ago who may have held or touched or seen those items. After this, the rest of the museum feels a bit fake because almost everything is a replica, not the real deal.

One very interesting exhibit contained WWII era postcards. Interesting, but the museum only has a few. I could have stood there and read these all day if they had more, but there was only a handful so I moved on.

You can probably see the whole museum in about 30 minutes. For the price tag, it's really not worth a trip (in my opinion). Check out the section on Judaism at your local library instead (for free!).",2009-07-25 18:40:15

Windsor is great! The words ""Best meal we have had in a long time"" came out of my mouth before we were even finished with brunch. 

The boy and I met mom and dad at Windsor for brunch a few weeks ago. It was hot out, but we braved the patio, their misting system is awesome! So we were comfortable. Oh before I forget we got a drink at the bar before sitting down and the menu is great! several things for $5, I got a pitcher of some great concoction for $5, it was like 4 drinks in one, needless to say I got myself a little tipsy before noon. Mom and the boy partook in the bloody mary bar they offer, they seemed to like it. Something interesting I saw, they offer a green bloody mary, I think it's spicier than normal. Hmmm?

Once we sat down we decided on a few appetizers, the deviled egg dip and corn dog popers. The dip was fab! I want to figure out how to make this shit at home and eat is on the reg! The popers were good, nothing to write home about, but the fried pickles they snuck in there really made me happy!

We all got something different, me the Eggs Benedict and they were great, eggs were perfectly cooked and there was a heaping of ham on top, I tried my hardest to finish it all. The boy got the Homemade Biscuts and Gravy, they put cheddar cheese in their biscuits, pretty much amazing! and it came with Schriener's sausage double win! Dad got grilled chicken sandwich (which I will be having next time we stop in, so obviously it was good) and he got a side of fried okra and mac'n'cheese. I stool more than a few bites of each because they were just that good. And finally mom had the Pastrami Reuben, mmmmmm yum maybe that is what I will have next time, I cant decide. 

The service was great, everything was just awesome!

Decor was cozy. Simple and elegant, but modern at the same time. Well light and had a very relaxed ambiance. Cute lollipops were on each table as well. 

We already knew that the soufflés would take at least 30 min, so the wait time didn't bother us. The waitress was very nice and informative, explaining the menu as it was our first time. 

For our picks:
-Amazing pudding, but definitely overpriced! Worth trying, but probably wouldn't get another one if I go again. 
-Lava cake with guava sorbet was a bit lacking, as there wasn't enough chocolate flavour in the cake and the sorbet fell a bit short. The plate ended up being a bit bland, without much of a contrast between the cake and sorbet.

XtH8YEVAx3dU6QJREJ-JSA,pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg,4,2,1,2,"These dumplings have been excellent virtually every single time I have ordered them. I'm new to the soup dumpling game as it's only been about 5 years since I had my first taste.

The best way to eat these is steamed and at the restaurant. When you order it for delivery, the dumpling experience is somewhat dulled. These awesome pockets of meat and juice depreciate with time like a questionable investment. Thirty minutes in a styrofoam container, followed by a quick 30 second zap in the microwave, renders them a little chewier and grittier than the fresh product at the restaurant. Nevertheless, the flavours are still there. My favourite is the lamb coriander, followed closely by the the shrimp/pork combos. Beef curry is also rich and hearty. The soy/vinegar dipping sauce is unique and perfect for these dumplings. 

This is real stick to your ribs food that fills you up quickly and efficiently. The average price for 15 steamed dumplings is about 13 dollars. You can get them fried as well, but I find the flavours do best when they can breath rather than being obliterated by the frying process.

The batch that I ordered last night tasted slightly less seasoned than on previous occasions. Also, the filling was a little less smooth than I had remembered. I don't know if they have changed them, or if this is in my head. This is why I took the rating down to a 4 rather than a five. I'll make a point of eating at the restaurant soon and will be more than happy to bump it back to a 5 star if the dumpling is consistent with the past. Either way, whether it's 4 or 5 stars, we're talking about a great product.

Either way, these dumplings are a great experience, especially during the colder months. Like most food, they go really well with a bottomless glass of wine or beer. Good times.",2018-09-12 18:03:09

(disclaimer: I only ate here because they had a deal with the Ritual app where a few items were listed at half price for your first Ritual order from them)

What I ordered: Beef and Chicken Dinner Plate (with rice, salad, tahini, garlic sauce, and a pita) - $15.99 ($8 with the Ritual deal)

The experience was actually a lot better than the other location, but it depends on the aspect you're focused on.

Service: C-
The estimate they have noted in Ritual is ""usually ready in 10 minutes"". I ordered and they said it would take 15. Fine. I arrive exactly at the 15 minute mark and still had to wait another 11 minutes. THE WHOLE POINT OF RITUAL IS TO GIVE ACCURATE PREP TIMES. YOU CAN PICK WHATEVER NUMBER YOU WANT. If you need 20 min, or 25 min... just select that! Then people will leave home/work accordingly, to time that out. I don't need a server walking up to me every 3 or 4 min with a ""it will be a few more minutes, sir.""

This was all compounded by the fact they were pretty dead. Two tables of people, but both already had their food. Two people were waiting for their order when I walked in. That's not a lot of business. Plus I used an app where they get to SPECIFY how long they need, and they still failed to meet it.

Food: B+
I've harped on this place before (both the service and food at their other location were underwhelming) but my experience food-wise was actually pretty good this time. I was very full by the time I was done. The chicken and beef were both juicy and flavourful (the beef was the better of the two) and the rice was plentiful and nice, although I needed to add salt/pepper to help give it flavour. The pita was large and actually quite fresh.

My complaints: the salad was boring. It was basically just shredded lettuce with two spears of pickle and turnip on the side. No dressing. That's not a salad. I can shred my own iceberg lettuce at home -- that doesn't make it a ""salad"". Also, the amount of tahini sauce you get is pathetic. The amount of garlic dip was fine, but I could have used like 3x tahini sauce for the amount of food.

Value: D
Every review seems to say 'overpriced', both for the quality and quantity. I'm judging this on the actual menu price... which is NOT worth $15.99. As full as I was (mostly on rice and pita bread, mind you), $18 after taxes per person for take out? Wow. I don't know if the prices were jacked up for LV, but I wouldn't pay more than $9.50 for that. I'm glad I had the 50% off deal, but I probably won't return at those prices.

Overall: B
I think this is my first review breaking things down and giving letter grades lol, but I felt it was needed to differentiate the fact the food itself was rather pleasant, but the customer service and value was not.

Conclusion:
I won't likely go back because it would be twice the price, and it's not worth that. If they want my business, they'd need to lower their prices. Which they won't.",2016-12-31 02:57:56

Came here for the lunch buffet on a Friday, this place was packed!  Normally, I'd be put off by the masses, but this just meant the buffet items were frequently replenished with fresh ones. 

$9 for all you can eat Indian food is a great deal.  There were 4 vegetarian dishes (yay!!!) and 2-3 chicken dishes. There was also jasmine rice, naan, sauces, salad, and rice pudding.

The food was good, but not great. It was tasty, but nothing amazing. It just didn't seem to be prepared with love and tedious care like I'm accustomed to at Woodlands. The naan was good, but not fluffy and not melt in your mouth like I prefer.

We had lunch at 11:30.  I mention when because when we left it was full.  Rizzo's is catching on fast and I truly believe that it will certainly rate four stars and some fives.

They do have separate lunch and dinner menus.  Good move.  Lunch has appetizers, sandwiches, pastas, a variety of ""parms"" with chicken, egg plant, etc. options and 10"" individual pizzas.  A nice selection along with wines and beers.

Business day diners are suggested to call ahead so their wait time is minimal and their party will be better able to eat, enjoy and get back to work within restricted times.

Prices are reasonable.

We looked at the dinner menu and it is really, really a good one.  Expanding on the lunch menu are more appetizers, lots of seafood options, three sizes of pizza and meat dishes like veal/chicken piccatta.  In other words, the heavier meals are there at dinner.

Portions are certainly generous.  My wife had a pasta dish, penne with sausage and peppers, and when she boxed up what was remaining it looked like a full portion.  That take-out did become dinner for her later.  My 10 inch pizza was just right portion-wise and the toppings, like mushrooms, were fresh.  Crusts were not NYC thin, but not thick.  And the dough was very yeasty and flavorful.

They brought bread sticks of the pizza dough along with a salad and they were soft and very lightly seasoned with an Italian style shake of spices.  Very good.

Service is a bit slow and the kitchen is a bit confused.  To be expected, along with their cash register system not properly working.  All newly opened business bugs.

Dining space is rather limited.  Booths along the wall and tables in the center and I would guess about 50 - 60 patrons if at max.  Recommend calling ahead as Indian Land dinner restaurants are few and far between.  Especially for lunch, as mentioned, the business people just don't enjoy the luxury of longer wait times than the many retired people in the area.

Very similar to Mama's in the Publix shopping center and I think will stand as competition.  Just their pizza dough is better.  Will have to eat more to see just how the difference between those two Italian restaurants shake out.",2015-09-19 14:08:11

Im a younger fan of theater unable to recognize some of the tunes but i  still found myself captivated by the amount of dancing and singing this crew does.

If you think youll be bored they seemed to have added a few bits of light hearted songs which are pretty funny and kept everyone engaged. I like that Wynn seemed to analyze his show with his audience in mind and had the main singers introduce a song and where it was from to give us a point of reference. They werent just singing at us they made us apart of the show. 

One or two songs felt a bit dated towards the beginning, but at a certain point you started to enjoy the skill of the singers and band along with the talent of the dancers. By the end of the quickly wrapped up show everyone in the audience was on their feet giving them a standing ovation.",2016-02-18 18:39:42

Atmosphere- Large sports bar, numerous televisions, cigar bar (near front entrance), large windows that open in the summer to face the patio for outdoor-seating.  On this night, the entire place was kind of empty.

Service - The staff here is friendly and communicative (even spent some time with me chatting about Charlotte).  Bartender was in shutdown mode while the wait staff stopped by more frequently to check on me.  It was understandable, with only five people in the place, including me, I would want to leave too. 

Food - Despite being disappointed that a place called the Pittsburgh Grill does not have any Pittsburgh specific menu items (at least from what I could tell), the A1 burger (see pic) I ordered was very tasty.  However, the side of tots were a little dry.  The beers here were cheap w/ $3 Labatt's keeping me happy on this Saturday night.   

Overall - A satisfactory experience here.  I would give Pittsburgh Grill and Sports Bar another try on a different night...maybe when the place is more lively...though it is unfortunate that the overall menu was just okay.",2012-06-20 03:59:03

The food and drinks are good but not killer. This place is more about a fun, contemporary vibe for evening drinks and loud music where you can ALSO get some good food.
They did to a GREAT job on the design though! 
The biggest draw is their amazing setup on the sharp corner of King Street when al of the windows and doors are open on the north side of the restaurant.

The FOOD:  They decent a decent, but small assortment of ban chan (not my favorite kimchee).  The Korean BBQ is unlimited, if that's your thing, but I wouldn't call any of the meat either low of high quality--firmly average.  The beer and pork were my favorites...I can definitely pass on the liver.  There is sadly very little in the way of veggies or sides....it's an all-meat affair.  The grill can get a little gross as well.

The SERVICE:  Well, there's not too much service needed with Korean BBQ.  They were nice enough, perfunctory and replaced the empty trays rather quickly.  

The VIBE:  It's kind of odd, every day folk mixed with asian girls in ridiculously high heels...do you really take someone here for fancy date night, folks?

First, the food isn't 100% authentic Mexican, if you truly want such, you will need to fly south of the border.  Otherwise, in the american-mexican cuisine category,  Cozumel seems to offer pretty decent quality food.  The serving size is large and loaded with rice, sour-cream, beans, lettuce - the usual fixings.  My lunch order was the Tamale entree in lunch portion, which consisted of two large tamale (chicken and pork) topped with guac, sour cream, served aside beans, rice and other fixings.  My dish was full of flavor and well balanced moisture to the tamale (something not all mexican restaurante get right) the shredded lettuce was crisp and fresh the guac was well balance with avocado and red onion, the rice was perfectly made and the beans (not my favorite at other places) were actually nice.  In all dish was well made and well presented on the platter.  

The serving staff were courteous and had the usual mexican restaurant flare - 'si senor' although I would say they were more attentive than other places.  Our food was served without much delay and several times the wait staff ensured everything was OK with us.

Cozumel can seat a large crowd given its seating areas (front room, back/side room), and an outside deck.  This place is a must visit if you are in the area and are craving Mexican.",2011-10-12 02:09:29

And not just any brunch but one that will amazed him with warm and fuzzy ... in his tummy! Gosh, this is yelp you know =P  Of course, I dreamt about this on Saturday so I had amble time to put my name onto their reservation list.  To my surprised, you DON'T need it!  At least not at 11:30a  Wooo, btw if you are planning to walk around The Eaton Centre (TEC) after or check out the new Saks, you should really consider parking at TEC so that your entire adventure is paid for ... when it comes to parking.

Checking out the menu, I was all excited about the special 1 weekend Canadian Maple Syrup brunch menu, but shortly after i took a peek at the menu, I was drawn to ... ""POUTINE""! Yes, that's actually what guys want in the morning.  But to 110% justify it, it's a Brunch Poutine!  For a decent 12 dollar it comes with curds, corned beef brisket and a fried egg :)  Aside from that I've also ordered the free-run turkey burger (tempura onion and avocado really got my attention), but since I don't want to look like a fat-so, I told them the Brunch Poutine is for the table LOLL  .... NOT! 

The service was great! Waiter was really promoting cocktail inspired drinks for this fine morning.  He was very attentive and the food came out quickly.  At 11:30am there was only 1 big group (12+) at the far end of the restaurant.  When you first work in from Bay it looked almost like an upscale diner, but once you hit the main dinning room you know the in something fancier :)  Fancier enough to simply just do the ""walk of shame"" in of course, your fancy bar/club attired you wore last night hahaha (yes, I'm laughing at my own dumb humour)

OK - back to the poutine.  Lets cut to the chase ... it's worth more than $12 (@Bannock, plz don't raise the price) but I'd paid $20 for this dish! OMG, it was SO GOOD!  In order to have the full experience I've cut the egg into 3 (so we can allow the other 2 to try .... a bit).  The fries where NOT soggy, it was mixed nicely with turkey gravy.  The curd was soft and not overly stringy.  It was JUST mouth watering tasty!  Somehow the mixture of egg yolk, gravy and fries just works!  ... Reminds me of steak and eggs + RICE! :) 

I'd touch on what other has or the free-run turkey burger, but the highlight of this adventure is definitely the brunch poutine!  We'll come back again! and maybe try the brunch poutine pizza.  But YESSSS the turkey burger is also awesome!  It wasn't dry as expected. The choice of bun was well picked, not too soggy or greasy.  You know what? if they also add a fried egg in it then it will 1+ in my book too.  I might ask for that next time =P",2016-04-08 00:04:15

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 this time was because when I called to see if my car was ready, I told her that I had a coupon for $169.99.  She said that is for the ""good"" brake job.

My family and I have been seeing another eye doctor for some time and have been very, very happy. In fact, in the past few months, we saw our normal doctor and were very happy then too. Nothing could go wrong at all.  Until I met Dr. Duggan.

My son just went back to school and noticed he had issues with vision. He wanted an appointment and our current optometrist was booked and the earliest appointment was 7 days later. 

This was an issue on two levels
a. I have a very busy schedule and was trying to make things fit.
b. My son was wanting an appointment asap to improve things.

So, I secured an appointment with my Dr. and then went searching on yelp for an alternative.  I saw the reviews on Dr. Duggan and here is my comments.

a. I asked for an online appointment at about 7:30 am.
b, I noticed they were not open for another 30 minutes and so I started to make some business calls. The stock markets were coming down hard during this time and I was getting plenty of calls.
c.  At about 8:00 I got two calls that I could not answer and then a few minutes later, I got an email for an appointment at 3;40 pm, right after school and perfect.
d.  The two calls were from the Dr's office to confirm times and when they could not reach me, they emailed to me. I was able to email back while on my phone call and we were set.
e.  This was timely as getting ahold of my son at school is tough due to restricted use of cells at school. I caught him in time so he could set his afternoon schedule and be ready!
f. Visiting the office, it is very comfortable, spacious, plenty of seating and just right.  The two receptionists were attentive and had gotten all our details all ready and quickly.
g.  Sarah, the technician was amazing. She quickly got my son in every analysis, explained everything, and then again to me as i was confused. We took a ton of test and she went over any options which we gladly took.
h.  The best part was when we got to see Dr. Duggan.  Often times, I am used to being seconded or sent to the assistant or the newbie and never the main doctor.  I was surprised that Dr. Duggan was our doctor and she took care of my son top notch.
i. At the glass selection area, I went to the receptionist to thank them for setting up my appointment and for doing it so quickly and accommodating my needs. They informed me that it was no problem, but they did NOT do it, Dr. Duggan checks her email and message and responds early to take care of clients!

Now I was more impressed. That is first class service and this is something I highly value.  

I plan to have our entire family start using Dr. Duggan. They will be very, very happy!  I am.

The buffet table's spread wasn't that appealing, though they had a very interesting cheese bread loaf. What was really above average about the food was the they had these cheese ball breads (that you have to request for them to bring you), and high quality meats. The experience is also unique in that the employees will actually go around the restaurant with different freshly-grilled meats (steaks, chicken breasts, kebabs, all the good stuff) and cut it for you. You have a little metal tongs that you hold the meat with while they cut the meat for you. DO NOT PULL on the meat though, as I was told by the first person who cut the cut for me. 

Ambiance 2/5 (10% of final grade)
Could have been so much better if there wasn't this super loud music by the live band. Don't get me wrong, I love live music, it's just that it was too loud for me to even hear my friends on the other side of the table, while they were shouting. That isn't normal volume, I don't think. The lights were dim, and in general it seemed like an above-average place, but only bring a date here if you want to concentrate on the food and have zero conversations. Seriously, the music was way too loud. 

Service 3.5/5 (10% of final grade)
The employees were well-dressed and attentive despite being busy. Even though my group of 5 went during Summerlicious, we were asked how we liked the food and everything my the lady server. The meat cutters would usually be gentlemen. The only reason I didn't give a higher score was because were requested pineapple several times with different servers, but most of them failed their promise to come back with it. Luckily, one very good homie brought the goods, and that was awesome. 

Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
The cost was expected with the quality of the food, the experience, and the service. Not much of a bargain, but standard. With the frequency at which the servers came around with the meat, you don't actually get THAT much. It's just the illusion you're getting a lot, because you eat slowly and get full faster.

Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade)
To the hot cheese bread balls the lady waitress brought out for us. And the pineapple. 

Final Grade = 67/100 = 3 Stars (But almost 4!)

This is a definite place to visit during your stay in Scottsdale.

Until then, Cheers! :p",2015-05-21 07:41:08

I am very conflicted but ultimately not going to go back.  I went on my birthday with a friend.  I got a free steak dinner and he got a sandwich.  I ordered the ribeye steak Medium Rare.  After 25 minutes, we both got our food. There wasn't many people there for lunch at the time.  They apologized for it being late but not much of an explanation.  My steak was cooked Medium well, almost well.  LIterally a faint pink in the middle and grey for the rest.  I told the waitress and she agreed and took it back. About 2 minutes later a lady puts the steak back on the table and says, sir you said this is overcooked? This is medium rare.  I explained, it is not, medium rare should be red, pink, grey, not this, it's almost well done.  She was like, no it's medium rare.  I was like no it's not, it's like almost well done.  Then she was like, so you want me to undercook you one? I'm like sure if that's what it takes.  She then said, it will take another 8-12 minutes.  Which is appropriate, interesting she can tell me how long it takes to cook a steak and rest it but not what the temp is.  The second steak was rare.  Undercooked but better than overcooked so I ate it. The rudeness of the manager, I assume, is the reason I would never go again.",2014-03-12 00:48:15

The garlic bread was deliciously heavy on the garlic and butter. Despite being drenched, it's texture was surprisingly still crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. (You order by the basket for $4, otherwise, you get regular bread which is meh).

The baked ziti was perfect. The penne pasta was perfectly cooked. The ricotta cheese was nicely proportionally mixed in with the pasta and sauce. Its a simple dish, yet satisfying.

The tiramisu was also mouthwateringly delicious. Its consistency was very mousse-like  making it basically melt in your mouth after every bite.",2013-10-21 04:48:12

Deagan's did not disappoint
taco tuesday too!

Stopped in for dinner at the bar last week.  This place will see me again, and soon.  Here is my experience in a nutshell.

We chose to sit at the bar, although tables were still available.  The ubiquitos large flatscreens were scattered about.  seems like the norm now, but it also stifles conversations.  The dining room had a very mixed crowd, and it appears to be kid-friendly as well.  Nice atmosphere.  So far so good.

One very nice thing I noticed immediately is how seriouly they take their beer here.  The two lines of multiple draft beers have glass rinsers that shoot clean water into the beer glass for a final rinse to remove any residual soap and sterilizer.  The cocktail list is nicely done.  I ordered a Moscow Mule that had a non-traditional twist of fresh mint.  It was tasty.  Very tasty.  The mint takes the edge off of the ginger beer, giving it a very nice new flavor dimension.  Not a ""traditional"" Moscow Mule, (actually, no longer a Moscow Mule) but a very nicely done cocktail indeed.  The bartender was quick, pleasant, and had a contagious smile.  Obviously, she enjoys working there and it shows.

My GF ordered 3 different tacos, as it was Taco Tuesday, a popular Cleveland bar tradition of sorts.  1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 shrimp.  They were 2 or 3 bucks each, depending on the filling.  I tasted all 3, and they were all very good, with the shrimp taco being the standout.  Appetizers we had were chips and guacamole.  all fresh, flavorful and well done.  I had the crispy chicken livers which were also delicious and flawlessly prepared.  Fish and Chips was my entree of choice.  Fluke was the fish of the day.   The batter was tempura-like, the fish very mild and undoubtedly fresh.  5 good size pieces.  I couldn't finish, but I sure tried.  It was served with what I believe was a remoulade sauce as opposed to tartar sauce.  I like.

Our food was brought to us by a food runner who sort of just plopped our plates in front of us, whirled around and ran back to the kitchen before we could ask her for silverware.  Twice.  No biggie, the bartender took care of it right away, and that was the only minor glitch.  

I look forward to expolring the menu, and will do it soon.

Carry on.",2011-03-04 13:28:44
ZtrAeUDQvNhAzUmwaeFK_A,9Lskp3870EP6fGbI9V6ZMQ,ViErpcikhbAjsDcpdAfwSQ,4,5,4,4,"Last Saturday afternoon we were actually on our way to grab a SLD (Short Leash Dog) at the Phoenix film festival when we received the sad and unfortunate news that the SLD food truck was not going to be able to make it. Oh no! Judging from our hysterical reactions, you'd have thought we just received the worst news of our lives. Man, were we bummed! At this point, we had been craving a hot dog for the better part of the day; so much so that any other type of food was just simply not going to cut it. I'm not kidding, you could have put a filet mignon in front of our faces and we would have passed. We wanted some dogs!! (And not just any old crappy hot dog). 

Luckily for us, we knew about Maui Dog and headed right over. We were charmed right off the bat with the colorful exterior and handwritten drive through menu. The inside is just as fun and quirky as the outside with surfboards and random Hawaiian decor abounding from floor to ceiling. The owner struck us as a very cool ex-hippy type dude who was very nice and accommodating. We ordered three dogs in total; one Hana dog, one Sweet and Spicy dog and another beef dog that we topped with pretty much every topping available. These dogs are definitely not your grandma's hot dog! The combination of tropical toppings such as coconut, mango and pineapple colliding with the juicy meat of the dog was a perfect mixture of sweet, salty and spicy. I think the Hana dog was my personal favorite, but I don't think you could go wrong with any dog here. And don't let me forget to mention the fries! They were out of tater tots that day, but the fries were just as amazing, hand cut and freshly made, we couldn't have asked for a better compliment to go with our dogs. 

Tempted to give this place 5 stars, but we're going to hold off for now until we can go back and try some more creations on the menu and hopefully get our hands on some of those tots!  This place definitely lives up to the hype, so the next time you're craving a new age dog head on over and show them some Yelp love!",2011-04-07 00:26:47

The Pond is advertised as a pool party but it's not your typical dayclub scene. In fact, it doesn't even come close. (Doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing.) I would say it's more of like a lounge pool. Like what everybody else have said, the pool IS pretty small, literally the size of a pond and it's pretty cold too. Although once the weather warms up by the afternoon, you'll be begging to get in the water. Even at this size, I never felt like it was crowded. Mid afternoon, I counted about 16 people in the pool at once and there were still plenty of room to roam around. A lot of people like to chill by the edge of the pool, drink in hand, enjoying their group's company. Wide variety of ages. Crowd is definitely aged 26 and up. Thank goodness there weren't any obnoxious douchebags or bimbos.
A live DJ was there and he spun some pretty good mixes. Top 40s pop, mainstream hip hop, a remix of 80s tunes....I liked it. Boyfriend and I were able to grab some lounge chairs (it was plush and very comfy by the way) so we didn't have to pay for a daybed. Daybeds and Cabanas are available for rent with a f&b minimum. Prices will vary depending on the day/holiday weekend. Lounge chairs are first come first serve and those are free of charge. No f&b minimum either. Cocktail waitress was attentive all day. The food was alright....pool food was better at Drais, Marquee and Daylight. Since this is an off strip property, aimed more for locals....everything was pretty solid. 

I would definitely be back here for a day of relaxation and lounging around. Knocked off two stars simply because the size of this place. If the pool was bigger, it would give Daydream at The M Resort a run for its money.",2017-08-23 17:21:51

Schenley is great for jogging on the wide, rolling paths that extend into the park from behind the visitors' center. The steep stairs that drop down to the valley and the pond are maybe better for walking (and they really should fix the stairs that go up the other side). But in the spring there are duck babies. 

If it isn't joggers' rush-hour, the Schenley paths also are good for bicycle routes to and from Oakland (please hail when passing, Pittsburghers). I also like the pool in summer. 

In winter, the tracks at the top of the hill (now, the new rubberized track) get a lot of sun and thaw quickly. Sometimes, in the evenings, the tennis court lights are on, which is cool. Plus, the wide open views up there, near the kids' toys, are relaxing after your jog.

But, the fella is a bit of a wiener fiend and told me he loved Ted's when he was at ASU. I'm not usually big on hot dogs, but we decided we'd give it a shot after we found out that they offer gluten-free buns for him. 

We arrived at around 12:30 pm on a Saturday--our bad call, since it was prime lunch time. The wait was about half an hour from the time I walked in to when I walked out with our food in hand. The set up was super confusing for a first timer; the line wrapped all around the dining area basically, and the grill chef was asking for orders far down the line so there was a ton of shouting over other people's heads. It was overwhelming. 

I had a regular hotdog with mac and cheese and the split onion rings/fries. The hotdog was fine, a touch burned. The Mac and cheese was fine, a touch mushy. The bun was fine. The exact potato buns I buy at the grocery store, actually. The onion rings were fine. The fries were pretty good, nice and crispy while still potatoey. We also had the loganberry juice which was basically just extra sweet Kool Aid. 

Fella had a polish sausage and a regular hot dog, both on the gluten-free bun. He said he liked the hot dog more than the polish, but both were just fine. The buns, he said, were pretty awful. Also, when I was ordering the gluten-free buns, the employee behind the counter seemed pretty irritated that he had to go grab them separately. I appreciate that they offer them as an option, but why even bother if your workers are gonna be sassy about getting them? 

Everything came out to about $25, which seems really steep for some mediocre hot dogs. But don't make the mistake of saying ""it's just a hot dog"" inside--the other patrons will get REALLY upset about it and let loose a few profanities.",2018-07-22 20:46:32

2AUbKMDNHAS47v11ZNMKtQ,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,KVGdRDCXOPbcDH_3HC1jfA,5,2,0,2,"The Gist: Located in the Doubletree by Hilton and close to the airport this would seem a strange choice to most, but as the first stop on an eight day trek taking us from Toledo to Montreal and back by way of Toronto and Ottawa the west Toronto location was not only convenient but I had on good word of mouth from a trusted palate well experienced with Chinese cuisine that the food was quite good as well.  

The Why: As above, plus some more ""Americanized"" options for my mother and aunt who are generally not tremendously adventurous when it comes to authentic ethnic cuisines.  Certainly meant to appeal to both Asians living in the Toronto area and clientele staying at the hotel the diversity of the menu was impressive and unlike many similar restaurants a good website assured my family that there would be choices for them as well.

The Reservation:  As we were entering Canada via the nearly impossible to predict Ambassador Bridge no reservation was made and given the location both outside of town and in a hotel we arrived to find the restaurant 3/4 empty.

The Space: While I am no expert on Chinese cuisine, the room seemed rather typical from my limited experience with tables and chairs covered in flowing materials, the carpet an ornate floral pattern, and fish tanks in back displaying live fish available to be cooked to order.  Music was light woodwinds and chimes and with the central dining area slightly raised on a spiral ramp a small bar with top shelf alcohol sat near the hostess podium where a few businessmen were enjoying cocktails while browsing their laptops.  Interestingly, to those who take note of such things, I will additionally note that restrooms were spotless and with the kitchen largely visible through open doors the entirety of the restaurant was much cleaner than any of the places we visited in BC.

The Service: From our check-in at the hostess station to the end of the meal service was professional - smiling even - and with half the items ordered from the dim sum portion of the menu while the rest were ordered from the main menu there was never ""too much"" at once on the table.  As an added bonus, both water and tea were refilled frequently throughout the meal and plates were cleared as they were finished to make room for more.

The Food:
Baked Diced Cod Fish Pastry in Thousand Layer:  Fairing far better than the shrimp rolls, this was perhaps the best dim sum selection to date as each of the three multi-layered pockets shattered on mastication giving way to juicy chunks of fish seasoned with pepper and herbs.  Impressively crunchy and without a hint of grease due to baking rather than frying this was on bar with some of the best cod 'fritters' I've ever tasted - a stark contrast to the sometimes greasy brandade versions.

Deluxe Steamed Barbecue Pork Bun:  When asked what made these ""deluxe"" the waiter explained to us that it was the use of abalone sauce as opposed to Barbecue and while I at first hesitated I will have to admit that this was inspired.  Starting first with the tender bready dumplings and moving right on to the large chunks of supple swine there was no skimping on the ingredient quality here and with the focus of the sauce leaning more towards the savory than the sweet the end effect was really quite lovely, a sort of soy and spice flavor with just a touch of funk overlying the pork.

Freshly Baked Egg Tart in a Puff Pastry Shell Dusted with Swallow's Nest:  My first experience with Swallow's nest, though honestly it was not at all the reason I ordered this dish; in reality I simply love egg tarts and despite being served on a flimsy plastic carrier these were incredible.  Served warm, bordering on hot, with the pastry golden and flaky but not 'crisp' while the custard was still jiggly but not runny each sweet bite simply melted on the palate with creamy sweetness and a light tinge of salt and butter on the finish...without a doubt a must order.

Deep Fried Duckling Stuffed with Shrimp Mousse and Almond:  My 'main course' of the afternoon, and more along the lines of what my mother was expecting when she ordered ""fried chicken"" this was a truly unexpected and exciting dish where the kitchen had taken the liberty to pound crisp confited duck flat before matching it with creamy shrimp paste, and quickly deep frying it in batter studded with sliced almonds.  Something like a fried pate or rillet in texture and rested across young green asparagus sliced lengthwise this was a dish I've never seen before on any menu anywhere and all-in-all utterly delicious.

The Verdict: A resounding win for everyone involved with each of us walking away impressed by not only the food - never oily, low on salt and MSG, and full of flavor - but the room and the service.  While obviously not the most authentic, cheapest, or convenient to those residing in the greater Toronto area this was the sort of place where ""something for everyone"" did not mean compromising quality.",2012-06-14 15:28:07

We started with two sharing plates: the BC rock crab cakes and the Alberta hanger steak.  We really enjoyed the crab cakes - there were 4 small (about 2cm diameter) cakes which had great flavor.  The tarragon buerre blanc sauce went really well with the cakes, as did the pickled cabbage and carrots.  The hanger steak was really tender, but I found the sauce and the dressing less flavorful compared to the crab cake plate.

The main lunch plate options consisted mainly of sandwiches, which was a bit disappointing on a hot patio day.  However, the BLT I ordered was really good - the heirloom tomatoes were colourful and thickly cut.  The bacon onion jam brought just enough sweetness to the sandwich.  The side salad had an awesome vinegary dressing.  The other 2 guys with me ordered the Reuben sandwich, which they really seemed to enjoy.

The service was a bit slow and distracted.  It was understandable given that it was a busy Stampede afternoon, and no one seemed to be interested in moving too quickly.  I'd really like to return one evening because I think that Home Tasting Room has the potential of providing an even better experience!",2012-07-31 22:09:30

They weren't as fast to prepare as the one at Baseline and Country Club or the one by Chandler Mall.  I got the Italian and my daughter got the  turkey.  Both were fresh and delicious and a good size for the money, $5.95 each. They only cut the sandwich in half if you request it so my torpedo was whole.  They said it had an oil and vinegar dressing but it was so light as to be indiscernible.  If they had pepperocinis I wasn't aware of it.  The roll was wonderful.

 All was fine till I decided it needed a little oomph and went up to the counter to ask for pepper since there were no shakers on the tables.  What? No pepper??  I can't fathom that.  I didn't like the loud music either.

I went for the jugular (or better yet, the glycemic index) and ordered a hot fudge brownie sundae with coffee ice cream.  There were atleast 30 flavors of ice cream and frozen yogurt (including some low fat options, but who cares?) and the gentleman who took my order was quite friendly.

The ice cream was pretty creamy and the brownie was a tad dry.  For $6 and some change, I was hoping for another scoop or so.

Next visit was not so hot.  I ordered the Shrimp and Spinach salad.  The salad is described as ""slightly wilted spinach"".  My spinach wasn't slightly, it was totally and completely.  Every single leaf.  Mangled and maimed.  Very sad spinach.  The shrimp was fairly good.  Loved the tri-colored peppers and red onions.  But the bacon in the vinaigrette dressing was pretty much raw.

Awesome experience. Most of the people in here were Greek.

Sat outside...it was nice and shaded and got to play a game of checkers. We ordered the pita and hummus and the lamb kabobs on special. The hummus was simple, yet, perfect. The lamb was so tender it literally melted in your mouth. It came with a large greek salad and some fries. Everything we had was just so delicious and authentic.

I've dined here a couple of times for lunch but last night was the first time for dinner.

Walked in and were prompt seated by a server I call the Energizer Bunny. Constantly in motion the whole time committed to his customers

We had been shopping for a new Washing Machine so it was after 7:30 pm when we got there.  It's well after the normal dinner trade and considering the bar, a little surprised they wre not more active.

We were seated and menu offered along with the perfunctory chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and no hint of oiliness and the salsa was the smooth type (I prefer chunky) but a good fresh taste and a good amount of heat.  Portion size was very large. They don't kid around with this.

Got our beverage order and time to place out order. Bear in mind my wife is not normally a fan of Mexican Cuisine 

She ordered the Chicken Quesadilla with Rice and loved it. Not as spicy as she expected with a great balance of taste and texture.  Rice was one of her favorites.

I was a little bit more adventurous and ordered as an appetizer, although it does not show  up as an appetizer.  Coctel de Camarones or in other words, Mexican Shrimp Cocktail.

Not at all like anything I have had before. Looked up the recipe and it's shrimp in a base of 
Clamato or V8 thicken with Ketchup to form a light gelatinous base with a bit of heat along with onions, celery, avocado, cilantro  etc

Different taste and texture than I was expecting but good with nice contrast of taste and textures. Not originally a fan of the semi-gelatinous consistency but it grows on you.

Would order again.

For my entree, I had the more conventional  Tostadas de Camarones which is a more conventional shrimp,onions tomato, lettuce, cilantro open faced sandwich.

End result is a delicious entree. Simple but elegant with a fresh taste that permeated the dish.

Totally enjoyable dining experience.

Service is great in a nice relaxed atmosphere.  My wife who does not like Mexican 
Cuisine loved this place. What more can I say",2017-09-28 02:21:42

We ordered two extra-crispy General Tso's Chicken with added rice (one white, one fried) and an egg roll. They do not serve combos here so our two entrees came to about $23. There was a lot of food - but it was a little pricier than some of the other fast food Chinese take-out places. I don't mind paying extra if it's tasty- and it really wasn't that much more in terms of price. 

It was hands down the worst Chinese I have ever tasted. The rice had a rancid flavor - it smelled and tasted quite bad so my husband graciously offered his white rice to me. The base of fried rice is white rice so I doubt it was the rice itself but whatever they put in it was not appetizing. The chicken was soggy, sugary-sweet (tasted like a very spicey sweet and sour sauce, it was even bright red in color) ...it didn't taste like any General Tso's I have tasted before. I barely ate my dinner and because it was take-out I wasn't able to give management a chance to fix it unfortunately. 

There were a couple of highlights ...the staff went the extra step to attempt to keep the crispy texture and did not sauce the chicken until we picked up our dinners, which was very thoughtful of her. They also have a really delicious homemade eggroll. It was oily but you know what it had actual meat and veggies inside of it and that made me happy. 

Overall I just can't bring myself to come back for take-out, but I was told the Dim Sum on Sundays is delicious so I may give that a shot in six months once I forget about that rice that will haunt my dreams.",2014-01-31 18:30:24

My girlfriend and I got seated in the back of the establishment by the TV room. This wouldn't have been an issue if the servers would have left the door closed, but this seemed to be an action somehow about the skill of their pay grade.

The Hemingway daiquiri was spot on. A daiquiri isn't supposed to be insanely sweet or sugary, and they got it there. It was sour like it was supposed to be, and high in citrus. I got a drink and my vitamin C for the day. That's WINNING! in my book.

Then they brought out the soft pretzels and gruyere fondu. Holy hell, that was brilliant and delicious. Someone finally came up with a ""foodie"" version of one of my favorite classics of garbage eating.

After the Yelpy Award night, a few of us decided to get a bite and a drink to keep the party going.  It was about 10pm when we arrived, not late by any means for a bar.  We ordered food and drinks.  We were aware that our waitress is new (3 day old).  The service was a little slow, but what the heck, we're having a good time talking.  Then it dawned on us that it's REALLY REALLY SLOW.  As in 45, 50 minutes later we still haven't had food, and the waitress had barely came by. 

The place was virtually empty.  It doesn't take almost an hour to fix a few sandwich wraps and fries.  Plus people don't order food at 10pm unless they are just-got-out-of-prison hungry!  We started to voice out loud our frustration, I mean, last I checked I'm in the US and I have the freedom of speech to say whatever the heck I want as long as I don't scream ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater (I know I learned something in school...).  There was another waitress out on the patio doing clean up work.  And before we knew it, she HUFFED and PUFFED right by us and said LOUD ENOUGH for us to hear ""F$#K, YALL ARE KILLING ME""

I am not sure which school of waitressing this chick came from, but I'm damn sure that's unacceptable at anywhere.  And boy she picked the wrong table to F with... a table full of Yelpers?!  We eat for a living and we sure as heck have an opinion and the whole darn world is going to hear about it. Man, I was pissed... this chick done got my neck-twisting, finger-snapping side out of me.

A NOTE TO MANAGEMENT (if you are reading): 1. Please tell your waitresses to NEVER be so rude to your customers. NEVER, no exception, even if the customer was rude (which we weren't).  I waited tables, so I had rude customers, go b!tch in the kitchen.  2. Keep your tables informed if there's some unusual wait time.  How the heck would we know you had a big take-out order if you don't tell us?  Let us decide if we want to wait (thus forfeit our right to complain) or not wait.  3. The F word is to be never used at any table for any reason whatsoever by your staff!    

This is one of my fav spots in town, and it was such a disappointment to have to encounter this myself (on an empty Wednesday night to say the least).  I have sticked my neck out plenty of times for this place, and now I can't even use my usual line ""I never had bad service here, ever"" anymore",2011-09-25 16:32:45

Saturday night, we decided to meet a friend there for dinner as we were curious. 

I have to say, I am a fan.  We were greeted promptly, our service started and ended great, and the food was pretty good.  I did not expect it to be like some other places that we frequent but when I base this review on other establishments like this, it definitely deserves a 4.  We got the fried pickles and banana peppers with ranch and I think that they were pretty awesome.  We also had Vanilla shakes, a few burgers, regular fries, sweet potato fries and the Steak and Fries (Wagyu steak with a red wine reduction).  The only think I would not get again would be the steak... i will save that for some other places that I go to.  The steak and reduction were good, just not the best that I have ever had and they did several other things better. 

The sushi that I had seen looked good, and since the Original Fish Market was one of my favorite sushis in town, and the staff seems a lot the same, I am confident that when I try it, I will not be disappointed.  I regretted not ordering it when I saw it walk past our table a few times. 

Prices were fair... $5 for a vanilla shake, $8 for a 6oz burger, the steak and fries was $25 I think.  I think they were in line with the market downtown.  

Large beer selection, some good wines to choose from, specialty cocktails... I was pretty impressed.  

I had seen someone mention that they could not tell who was staff and who was not.  The staff (less the managers and the host staff) is wearing denim shirts... easy to spot.

I had high, high hopes for the food but it was a letdown. Granted, it was mid-day and the tavern offered an abbreviated menu. But the confit chicken wings were so overwhelmingly salty as to be nearly inedible, and the abrasive lemon tang certainly didn't help. The combo was unbearable. On the other end of the spectrum, the animal style frites (basically poutine) somehow seemed completely bland to the point where the cheese curds, fries, fried eggs and gravy all kinda tasted the same.

Eaton is deceptively small - it's a long, single hall flanked by stores, so you don't quite realize that it's three stories tall with a foodcourt that takes up an entire additional basement floor. I think it takes a couple of trips to really appreciate/realize/absorb the size of the mall.

What Eaton has in quantity of stores it lacks in size - most of the individual stores are on the smaller side, especially since many of them have a second location on Yonge or Queen West, so Eaton is more about the convenience of having everything in one location. 

Eaton is definitely very well lit, bright, and airy, with a really nice, massive open skylight and a fountain, which helps mitigate the fact that it is usually extremely crowded and overrun with younger kids and angsty teens. I've pretty much never seen the mall not extremely crowded to some degree.

The food court is pretty top notch in terms of quantity - sushi, asian foods, burgers, McDonalds galore, with a massive amount of seating. However, bussiness people tend to swarm here during lunch break, so despite the seating it's still almost impossible to find a table at 12:30.

I got it with a cup of French Onion soup, which was way delicious and surprised me 100x over as I had such low expectations for it.  But it was served correctly with the cheese melted on top and over, granted it wasn't melted to a slight brown crisp, it so fixed my craving.  The s/o ordered their Ruben the Great, which was piled on with Corned Beef and Pastrami.  At other sandwich spots,  you'd get that much meat for the whole sandwich, and this was just HALF!  The s/o opted for a side salad, which was one trip to the salad bar. The s/o came back with a huge smile saying it was the most awesome salad bar in a resto that he's ever been to, as apparently they had all these premium toppings, as well as dessert to boot.

This was not really a big concern for me since I live right down the street from their location on Buffalo and Washington, but I've been staying in the southwest region temporarily and, nope, no TJ's around the bustling 215/Rainbow area.  This new location at Downtown Summerlin is the closest one, so at least it's right off the 215 and Sahara if you're taking the 215 over for your TJ's fix.  It's roomier than the Buffalo location, with nice, wide aisles.  What remains the same here, as with the other Trader Joe's stores, are the staff in their Hawaiian shirts (they're traders on the culinary seas!), the friendly, Aloha attitude, and the basics that I buy week in and week out.

I was raised in Southern California, home of the original TJs (in Pasadena), so they'll always get 5 stars from me.

Bruschetta - whipped buffalo ricotta, figs, raw wildflower, honey, pistachio, preserved lemon 
- This was quite refreshing with an overall balance of sweet and sour from the lemon. 

Bigoli - duck egg pasta, duck ragu, venetian spices, mascarpone, basil
- The portion was smaller than expected for this but the overall flavours were quite rich. You could definitely taste the duck ragu. 

Brasato Misto - tomato braised beef short ribs, cotechino sausage, stone ground polenta, parmigiano, basil
- The short ribs were super tender and broke as soon as you touched it with a fork. It was balanced well with the polenta and sausage. 

We also ordered two glasses of wine along with the meal.

We ordered some of the signature dishes: Amberjack Crudo, Oysters, Tuna Tartare, Kim Chi Fried Rice and Chicken Wings. Everything was delicious. Every dish had a distinct and focused taste, texture and composition. The food is innovative and creative.  The flavors are powerful, unique and on point. Ingredients are fresh and of high quality. I can't wait to try the other menu items. It's great to have access to such talent  without having to head to the Strip.

Now the issue with service. The restaurant wasn't that busy. The service has to match the caliber of the food (i.e. SoHo Japanese) otherwise it's an annoyance. The oysters arrived in a timely manner, but things just dragged on and on from there. The service team doesn't seem to work as a cohesive unit, nor are they particularly excited (or versed) about the menu. You pretty much will only get the attention of your server and not anyone else.

It is kind of western food that is cater to people from Hong Kong without the broth made from scratch, lower quality ingredients and pretending to be a steakhouse sort of restaurant.  I like to come becausr my parents wants to eat something that feels like western food but do not want to spend too much money.  

The Christmas menu seems promising with lobster bisque, salmon salad, 8 oz striploin and cheesecake.  I could tell the lobster bisque was made from scratch since there were pieces of lobster shells still in my soup.  What?!!!  I was glad that I was able to pick them out, but what if you can't.  Sigh~ When I requested the striploin to be cooked medium rare, the waitress was telling me there's no such thing.  I was like, ""Huh, are you sure?""  Then, she gave me a blank stare and said, ""ok.""  

The salad was just like what you have store bought from supermarket.  The marsh pototoes was really tasty and creamy and the striploin was cooked to medium rare perfection.  The cheesecake was an after-thought as it was really bland with not much flavour.  

When I paid, I was expecting them more tip to return the differnece and I would pay them the tip.  But the difference of my payment and bill was nowhere to be found.  When I ask for the change, they just gave me the bill.  At first, I thought it was Christmas, I was going to tip them more.  But if they wanted to keep the change, be my guest.

There was a 20-30min wait, but they were super busy (for good reason!).  I was a bit hungry and annoyed that we are waiting for a table this long on a weekday, but the wait was well worth it!

Our server was great, she recognized that it was our first time here and explained the menu and how it all worked with tapas and her recommendations.  She recommended that each of us (there were 3 of us in our group) order two plates.  We put in an order of edamame and we were off to the races!

I chose the Sashimi Tuna Tacos (heaven in 2 bites) and Shrimp Ceviche which was an awesome way to end the meal since it came out last.  My cohorts chose the special:  fried shrimp with alfreado linguine and a crunch roll;  and the other two plates were soul wings and sticky veal shortribs.  Everything was excellent.  It was fun having all the small plates and being able to try everything.

We were lucky enough to get an outside table and halfway through the meal it started raining, but they have covers that rolled down to keep the splashing to a minimum.

""all in"" embrace of the Western theme by the establishment and patrons. It was true culture shock for me to see grown men in matching cowboy regalia NOT at a gay bar. But, once that novelty wore off, we settled in amongst the oddly decorated ""natives."" 

Didn't try any food, barkeeps were fast, drinks were cheap, music is loud and I guess everyone knows the same dances in country bars?! Watching people ride the bull (projected on big screen) was amusing in a train wreck Vegas-y way.  Love the saddles on the barstools, loved the band one night, the crowd was interesting to watch and I'd go back if asked to. They offer discounted or free admission with NV ID (depends on night) and that was kinda cool; Thursday is ladies night. So, if you are into country, dressing in matching cowboy outfits with your homies and/or know the secret dances = you're golden. Probably 4* for country people, who are not me.

I quickly browsed their website and found out that its pretty reasonable ($8.00 per kid), has long open play hours (9:00am to 6:00pm...I think), socks are required and clothes with buttons on the butt (aka: jeans) are not allowed because they damage the slides....so off we went. 

We pull up and the lady up front was helpful and quickly showed me the bathroom (the kids had a lot of caprisun in the car). Then for about 2 1/2 hours the kids went insane. It was so fun to watch the look of joy on their faces. It was nice for me too because when I wanted a break from playing with them I could chill on the couch and still have my eye on them. 

I noticed that there was a lady cleaning a lot....and I can't blame her. Some parents don't know how to clean up after their kids (super annoying). There were snack wrappers and popcorn kernels left by one such parent and her children. They don't get in the way. As for the mean workers yelling at the kids...I saw no such thing.

I think on some of the items, their inventory is a little sparse, compared to Lowe's.  But the people seem much friendlier, and much more willing to help.  Even the customers, if I am looking somewhat perplexed, will make suggestions. Can't beat that!!",2010-02-25 15:26:46

Ordered drinks.  Twenty mins later they arrived ... without lemons.  Asked for them. Server said she'd get some.

Waited another twenty.  Finally went to the bar to find lemons myself.

Bread arrived 15 mins later.

Asked for refill of drink.  Took a full 10 mins.

No refills for the rest of the night.

Nearly 1hr later, our food arrived.

Steak overdone.  WAY overdone.

Unbelievable I know, but it seems like a lot of work to open up your own restaurant and cook Khmer food so maybe it's the reason no one has opened up one in Chicago. Plus, I been working on compiling recipes from my mom to create my own family Khmer cookbook so I know about the work involved. I am part Cambodian and have been to Cambodia, and have a good idea of what good Khmer food tastes like and this place does an excellent job. The exterior made me feel like I was in a sketchy neighborhood, but the interior was simple and tastefully decorated to make you think that you are elsewhere. I am fascinated with seeing all the books on Cambodia. I was relieved to see that there was no karaoke Khmer music videos going on. That is so cliche for me and not even funny. The spring rolls are pretty good here. I had trouble deciding what to order since I was so familiar with all the items on there and it does cover quite a bit. One major thing that is missing is Prahok - this to me is one dishes that stand out from the other surrounding Southeast Asian country food dishes. I wouldn't mind seeing Sarai (coconut jello) and Bayng Janeau on the menu as well either - but that's just because I love that stuff, too. Had I been home at my parent's house, Katheaw is a Saturday lunch staple so I decided to have it here even though it was Friday dinner. It was very flavorful and maybe even better than the Katheaw I had in Cambodia. Well the portion is smaller than you would get ordering pho from a Vietnamese restaurant. In Cambodia I had to order 2 bowls to get full, so I think this might actually be the right amount. My only complaint was the price. My guess is that ingredients would be purchased from an Asian grocery store that other Southeast Asian restaurants like Thai and Vietnamese restaurants would also purchase items from. The prices would or should be on par with that. $3 a spring roll did make my eyebrows perk up a bit, where I think $2 might be more reasonable taking into account the size of the roll and all the ingredients. I've been getting creative with mine adding mangos and doing a brown rice wrapper so I can justify paying a premium for something that is a little more unique. Our server was friendly and helpful with recommendations. We did get a chance to speak a little Khmer. Of course, my face is going to get red from drinking - I'm Asian! Lol. I love the fact that the place is BYOB. I wouldn't mind stopping back in again - and if I know of others coming out to Phoenix I'll be sending them here!

But how completely and totally awesome is it that the Cubs (one of my favorite teams thanks to my grandfather being from Chicago) play here in Vegas almost every year? And ok, they play other major league teams (White Sox, Dodgers, Reds, etc.) when they're here. But it is so great to be able to see a classic baseball team in this nice, little stadium.

Like most stadiums, you basically have three levels of seating - behind home plate, under the upper deck (a.k.a. no sun); along the first and third baselines (a.k.a. work on your tan); and the outfield (no bleachers or anything, just grass - a.k.a. bring a blanket). And the prices are quite reasonable, especially for seeing major league teams.

The food and beer options aren't big league level, but they're quite decent. In fact, I would say better than most minor league stadiums.

The stadium itself is in a nice location. It makes it easy to make a day of it and do the Natural History Museum, Old Mormon Fort, Neon Museum, Fremont Street, etc.

The parking isn't as convenient as say the Strip (there's no valet here), but it is definitely easier than say Wrigley Field or really any stadium or arena. It's a walk, but not bad (no further than some of the walks from parking garage to middle of casino). Though, it would be nice to have some staff giving direction to the traffic as everyone is trying to leave.

Located behind Lucky Strike, this bar is an arcade that serves alcohol. It reminds me of a mini version of the ESPN Zone. They have a great selection of games including air hockey, skee ball, basketball, car racing, guitar hero and my favorite game of all? Group PAC Man! My only qualm with this bar is that they don't dedicate the entire bar to the arcade. It's a lot of fun and a great way to enjoy a night of cocktails through a fun activity. 

We went on a Thursday night so it wasn't crowded but I also noticed a dance floor which could be fun on weekend nights. But you won't find me on the dance floor, you'll find me having PAC Man fever in the arcade. Between Gypsy Bar and Lucky Strike (not to mention Stand Up Live), this area is guaranteed fun for a night out. If you see me there, I'll challenge you to a game of air hockey!",2013-07-28 03:17:34
YU2t0zI71xrBO_C9u4CGFQ,tCXElwhzekJEH6QJe3xs7Q,KTPRYqiFdLowAUEAnN7e3g,4,3,3,2,"Burgatory.  Some have crowned it as the best burger in Pittsburgh.

Four months living in Pgh, several visits to other Pgh burger joints, and a recent revisit to Burgatory, I might have to agree with this...at least for now. 

Food (9.0/10) = They have several pre-designed burgers on their menu, but I always opt for the custom creations option.  Here's the recipe for the burger I always create.  I have named this burger ""Noah's Ark 2013"":

""Noah's Ark 2013""
1) Meat = ""Natural Bison"" ($11) - juicy, moist meat from an ungulate
2) Bun = Brioche - buttery, fluffy, absorbing any of the juices oozing from the meat, the aioli sauce, and velvety egg yolk
3) Rub = ""Angel Dust"" (salt, pepper, garlic) - I keep some aspects of my burger basic, while others aspects with some jazz
4) Cheese = Aged Gruyere ($1.50) - a cheese with an essence of nuts.
5) Sauce = Truffled shallot aioli - genius; this is a life hack; GG no re 1337
6) Toppings (cost extra $) = Caged-free egg ($1.50), Applewood bacon ($1.50) - why have one animal in between two pieces of brioche, when you can have three?  My brioche is like Noah's ark, and I am like Noah ushering the animals inside it.
7) Other Toppings (no extra cost) = Arugula, cucumber - natural pepper essence of the arugula, with the refreshing crisp of a cucumber.  Here I provide the green grass for my animals to lay on inside my ""ark""

The burgers come with warm potato chips.  Chips are not my thing.  But does one really come to Burgatory with prime focus on the chips?  

Appetizer menu: Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites = $6.50 = pretty good fries. Definitely taste the truffle flavor.  

Shake: Grand-dad's Secret = $8.00 = bourbon, caramel, vanilla ice cream; thick richness of the caramel and creamy vanilla; bourbon...yea bourbon!

Other: Veggie Burger = Came with a vegetarian friend once.  She said it was the best veggie burger she's had.  Never tried it myself, but maybe this might give those who abstain from animal meat a reason to go to a placed called Burgatory.

Beer: great list of bottled and draft beers.  I would've subtracted one star from this Yelp review of Burgatory, if I couldn't pair my burger with beer.   


Service (9.0/10) = Service has always been great.  Always attentive. 

Ambiance (8.0/10) = cool set-up for everyone.  Booths, tables, tables outside, and a bar with several flat screens.  A place for the family.  A place for the kids.  A place for a close group of friends.  A place for those who want to enjoy an American meal while watching sports.

Overall opinion = So far...yes the best burger in Pgh.  This place is more of a 4.25 star place to me, rather than 5.   It just hasn't blown my mind away, like the other restaurants that have received 5 stars from me.  Maybe it will blow yours away.  Make your judgement.  Judgement day.  Judgement day at Burgatory.  Be like Noah.  Be Noah.  Build ""Noah's Ark 2013.""  Note, this place is usually crowded and requires patience to get seated.  Not sure if you can make reservations.",2013-11-06 04:18:04

I have no idea how I missed out on this place for this long since it is not far from home. I felt like Vic Tayback was going to stick his head out of the kitchen to yell at the servers. lol---- very Divey Diner, 1950's feel to it. The place itself is painted every horrific bright neon 1950's or 1970's loud color you can think of. Goodness the mustard yellow bathroom hallway is just painful to look at! -teehee--They have all these vintage like posters hanging on the walls.
   The food is typical comfort food and Diner fare. It seems breakfast is the thing here so I will have to come back. The prices are very reasonable and they have monthly specials. They also have a M-F Early Bird Breakfast special before 9am. The prices were an even better deal since I took home half of the large portion and had a second meal. I ordered the steak sandwich and fries $8.99 June special and it was not half bad. The fries were those fresh, hot, really good crinkly cut ones. However, for some reason they needed a lot of salt. I also ordered a side of potato salad which was just store bought tasting. The fun thing here is that all meals after 11am come with a free scoop of yummy ice cream.
   Everyone was so nice here. From the moment I walked in the door I was fawned all over by the servers.They were outstanding. So friendly and helpful. The customers were very friendly as well. I even became involved in conversations with the folks at the next two tables. Sigh, teachers you can't take us anywhere. Always talking shop to tables with kids. They did assure us though that Eddie's was the place to be on Friday nights for their wonderful Fish Fry Special. The best in town they said. One was an avid fisherman, no less.

I used to come here fairly often with my very sweet and lovable labs, but after the last time, I decided it's better to not come at night. I've never had a bad experience during the day for some reason- only at night.

The last time I was here, an aggressive dog was terrorizing every single dog that came through the gate. It nipped at my dog immediately upon entering and followed all the dogs around, including mine, while getting into numerous scuffles with numerous dogs. They just weren't your typical dog scuffles but outright dog fights. At this point, what did the owners do? Nothing. They just yelled at the dog every time it did something. They did not take the dog out of the situation, nor did they know how to correct his behavior. They just constantly yelled his name.

It got to the point where we felt it was no longer safe for our dog to be there, as this dog got into it with our dog at one point. Right as we were about to go to the other side of the park with our dog, the aggressive dog got into yet another fight with a german shepherd right as it was entering the gate. I had to leash my dog immediatly and walk her away from the situation, and other owners had to pull their dogs back, so the situation wouldn't escalate even further. 

Still, these owners did NOT get that perhaps this was a sign it was time to leave. I piped up that perhaps it was time for them to go and they still did not leave until their dog got into a few more fights. It was totally unreal and extremely disrespectful.

What irritates me is not the dogs. I love all dogs, even the aggressive ones. They simply do not have the right direction and let's face it, they're just animals. What irritates me is inconsiderate dog owners that cannot and do not know how to control their animals and that ruin the experience of a dog park for everyone else. 

Unfortunately if I'm to return, it will be during the day when there's less people and less dogs...and more considerate owners.",2009-04-24 17:47:36

Logan's is a spartan warehouse inside, with the ubiquitous giant pipe ceiling, and cement floors with a chaste smattering of peanut shells. 

We were seated and then pretty immediately given a few warm yeast rolls with whipped butter. The rolls were just ok- a little tough and yeasty for my taste. Hubby thought he had just about died and gone to heaven with the big bucket of roasted and salted peanuts on the table. I had a couple and they were tasty. Waters and our drinks came pretty quickly as well. My strawberry margarita was pretty good, and Hubby got the most exotic beer they had- Killian's. 

For our main entrees, Hubby had a NY strip and I had a rib-eye. Both arrived more medium than the medium rare we ordered, and when the server stopped by to see how things were, Hubby said the steaks were a little overdone. He apologized, and asked if we wanted new ones. We said, ""no,"" and that it was ok, we didn't want to be wasteful. A manager was at our table a minute later, asking if we were sure. We were super impressed by this- 10x better service than when we last had complaints at the Four Seasons. The sides were alright- mushrooms were sliced and in a heavily seasoned broth, loaded baked potato was standard, but Hubby just loved his baked sweet potato with butter and cinnamon.

At the end of the meal, we were presented with their signature three-tiny-bucket desserts. We hadn't ordered it- it was a surprise comp. One bucket was a rich chocolate mousse with a peanut butter top, another was a hella-sweet warm hot-fudge brownie with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream, and the last was a light cheesecake with strawberry topping. They were all tasty, but my favorite was the cheesecake. Then we got the bill. They had also given us half off both our steaks. We again were quite impressed. Logan's really went above and beyond to make up for a relatively small error. Naturally, we tipped based on what the bill would have been. We'll be back.",2008-07-13 05:48:31

Personally, I think better butter chicken than a lot of the restaurants in Little India (in Toronto) even (the restaurants Regency, Gautama for example).  The korma is good too.  Not healthy stuff, but delicious.  If you get naan bread, you're better to get the garlic naan for a little more, because their much less likely to make a crappy naan (The regular naan bread they do is hit and miss on being very dry or over burnt).

Cute motto

We didn't have a reservation but got a seat within 10 minutes for two people. 

We ordered: 
Full rack of ribs (mild)
Pork belly
Sake Mojito cocktail 
Tokyo rose cocktail

Cocktails that are $8 are $6 on Sats

Servers were friendly. Place was clean and brightly lit. Washrooms were clean!

The verdict:

The ribs are nicely seasoned and tender. I didn't find the cheese added much taste because it didn't have any taste. It gave it a cheesy texture, but it wasn't anything special. Kind of reminded me of cheese fondue. In my opinion, this is a novelty, but not worth $35.

Mashed potatoes, sausage (put cheese on this), and corn were really good. Flavourful.

I found the sweet potatoes too soggy. Egg was overcooked

TIP: they give you a glove to wear when eating the ribs, put it on your non-dominant hand so you have the other to use the spoon and chopsticks with. 

Pork belly: It wasn't as soft as I would have liked it but nicely seasoned. The presentation was nice too.


Sake mojito: I like this! It was light but good
Tokyo rose: orange juice with sake or Soju -  it wasn't the best

For a total of $70 including tax and tip, I didn't think it was worth it since my husband wasn't full. But it is nice to have a new experience.

Hit the drive-thru on Black Friday with the wife.  I ordered a Venti (large) caramel brulee latte, while she got a Tall (small) Pep Mocha latte.  The total was approximately $8.  I roll up to the window, and hand the cashier a $5 plus a coupon for one free drink.  I'd assume that she'd take off the most expensive one, or at least ask, but no, she didn't ask.  So I was expecting about $1 plus change, and was surprised when the cashier gave me $.18.  I questioned which drink she took off, wondering why the venti wasn't the free drink.  Her rational to me was that 'it wasn't that big of a difference because both drinks are about $4'.  I questioned her, specifically asking her if venti and tall drinks really cost the same.  She insisted that yes they did.  Of course, she proceeded to hand me the receipt, I saw that was false (which I already knew).  Yes, it was only a dollar, but this was a complete and utter customer service failure.  If I had not said anything, I could understand, but I questioned which drink she took off and she either lied to me, or was too incompetent to know the price difference.  Additionally, annoying is that I promptly sent an email to Starbucks customer service and a full week later, I have not received a response.  Zero stars to this location and zero stars for no email response from Starbucks corporate.

This night was converged upon by about a dozen willing participants at the area of Bathurst north of Bloor and south of Dupont at Napoli Centrale who on their website claim they are authentic Neopolitan which I'm realizing isn't that unique anymore in TO.  There are quite a few establishments who have this claim (VPN).

The dining area is deceivingly spacious and open.  You wouldn't know it by looking at the storefront but the inside is particularly wide and well lit.  The bar is to the right as you enter and the oven and prep area is open concept as well.  If you have a large 800+ degree oven you want to show that baby off am I right?  Some of the countertops around the oven appear to be treated concrete!  How cool is that?  

At the table we had 2 by the way, we already had water decanters as well as sliced pizza dough bread with olives and some type of pepper sauce.  The sauce is really tasty, it's as if they are in little baby food jars and I couldn't quite figure out what kind of peppers they used.  The color looked to be Scotch bonnet but they weren't that hot.  I should have asked.  The taste was great though, not too hot at all but tasty enough to dip with the bread AND use when you eat the crust of your pizza.

I started off with a salad as did my wife.  I had ordered a Grotto Azzura (Arugula, prosciutto, shaved parmesan, lemon and olive oil dressing) and she had the Mergellina (Mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, shaved carrot, corn, tuna, green olive, mozzarella).  The salads came in full size toss bowls.  They were large, I should have figured that since each was about 12 bucks but I wasn't ready for that size, just a small portion.  I ended up sharing mine out.  Each came with a serving tong.

For pizza I had ordered the Diavolo (rossa) as I normally do at these types of places (Smoked provolone, hot soppressata salami) and my wife had ordered a Napoletana (bianche - Sausage, rapini and fior di latte).  

I had mine and a slice of hers.  Both were very good.  I enjoy this type of pizza being that it's thin and chewy.  The crust at the edge seems a little thick but it's still good.  I used the hot sauce they provided to eat with the crust which was just great.  The Diavolo had a very nice salty taste to it.  The salami was nice and spicy and the overall flavor was rich with spice and bite to it.  The Napoletana was of course not as spicy since the sausage is much more bland but the rapini is a great combo with any pork in my books.  It was good but having the tongue for spice I have to say I enjoyed mine much more.

Over all the service was friendly.  It would have nice to not have to ask for more bread and water though but the service was still good and the food was what you would expect if a place claims to be VPN certified.  I enjoyed it at Napoli Centrale.",2015-06-05 12:55:55

For you beer fans, I counted 31 tap handles.  If your nickname is ""Minnesota"", they also have pool tables!

Food was particularly good at mid-afternoon - a good sign that their kitchen stood ready during an off-hour.  Wife had a very generous portion of pulled pork - nothing really special - but it was good quality and nicely presented. Portion was plenty to eat there plus some to take home!

An observation - not a criticism - I will eagerly order it again next time.  My generous portion of fish was fresh, too hot to eat when served, (a very good thing) and perfectly battered and fried. Chips were also too hot to handle and perfectly crispy.  Burgers at next table also looked tempting.

I can only eat one dish at this place as I've got a food allergy to onions; knowing full well that onions are critical to taste for a lot of dishes, I try and stick to this one dish. Also because I generally feel guilty if I have to ask to have it removed. With that said, the one dish I can eat here is OK; the barbecued honey pork ribs are pretty solid and have a pretty decent taste, but it's nothing extraordinary.

The service isn't phenomenal either; they do what they're supposed to, but they don't really go above and beyond. Also, you have to spend $20 to be able to run a credit card here, so for someone that rarely has cash, $20 is a bit too much to spend on mediocre food.

The buffet has your normal options like prime rib, salads, etc.  They also have sushi which is a bonus.  All of the food was good but nothing that really stood out to me.  It was your typical Vegas buffet.

I did think that the dessert station was above average. That boosted my star rating to three vs. the two that I was going to give.  The service was decent.

I would only go to Hefe when I was getting a table or if someone in the group knew a bartender. But after being dragged in all summer, I warmed up to it. It is still not my favorite but I do love the concept and the wall decor.

We came here 2 times during our 4 days in the desert.  Both times I left with a smile on my face and a stomach full of tube steaks.

The first day we went I got 2 regular dogs, a white hot sausage, split an order of onion rings and washed it down with a Loganberry shake.  We got in line and the man grilling the dogs kindly asks you what you would like.  You kind of shout it out and then he grabs the dogs and stacks them in order of when they are going to be cooked.  A very streamlined operation.  By the time you reach the man, they are pretty much done and then handed off to the condiment lady.  You tell them what you want on each dog.  I went with mustard, onions and their hot sauce concoction. They dish up your onion rings and make your shakes and then off you go.

These dogs are super tasty.  Everything just works so well.  They use a soft potato bun and the dogs are char-grilled over charcoal so they get a crispy/burnt like texture to them.  I devoured those things in a matter of minutes.  The onion rings are more like an onion loaf.  Pretty good.  The Loganberry shake was very good too.  Just sweet enough without overpowering it.  The shakes are a tad small though but they are the right consistency and you can easily drink it through your straw which was nice.

2nd trip I got a foot-long, a regular and an Italian sausage.  This time we split fries and got another Loganberry shake.  The Italian sausage was the winner of both trips.  It was the BEST sausage I have ever had.  I got it topped with just mustard and onions.  It was perfectly cooked, snap when you bit in, but soft and almost mushy when you chewed through it.  Kind of hard to describe but god damn that was a tasty sausage.  Perfect flavors and everything.  My 2 dogs I got topped like day 1.  Mustard, onions and hot sauce.  The wife had a burger which she said was ok.  Looked kind of skimp though.  She doesn't eat dogs so she missed out.  

I will have dreams about this place.  It was by far my favorite 2 meals in AZ and I would eat here all the time if I lived close.   I cant wait to find some reason to go back to AZ just to eat here.  It may even be worth the 5 hour drive just to eat these, turn around and come back.  Seriously.....these dogs are great!",2010-06-15 06:03:37

Her hair wrapping was OK but not as good as Kazuma's work. The top was too loose and she allowed it to flop forward allowing it to set all bent like that. Grr!! Kazuma had to tell her to add sticks to keep it in place. The perm still turned out but I felt it wasn't as even as it usually is due to the shortened processing time on the top section. I know he was concerned with damaging my hair because it has been permed twice prior to this visit within the last 10 months. But that's why he cut off 2"" of it anyway. I'll still come back for sure. Maybe I won't book a haircut just so he spends more hands on time on the perm. It was still cheap. Less than $130 incl. tax for the perm and haircut.

I liked both sauces, especially since they are served hot out of a pump dispenser. They both had good flavor. The hot was not hot but had some spice.

I sampled the turkey, it was tender and moist. 
I sampled the hot link, good flavor, not hot.
I sampled the ribs, great flavor, nice chew good crust.
I sampled the brisket... ask for sliced not shredded. It was perfection. 

The place is clean and inviting. The service was great and will only get better with time. They are on day 4 today.

We have been coming here for 14 years and have never been able to get our first choice of wine. On this visit, our first choice was a bottle that was also available by the glass. Our server said she couldn't sell us a bottle, because they didn't have enough, and had to save it for single glass servings. What? Why is it on the bottle menu then? Also if you are selling this by the glass I would assume that you have many bottles in stock. So we continued our selection process. And on the 5th try we finally got a bottle. Every time we chose a bottle, the server had to go look for it, while we had to wait for her to come back, only to tell us it was out of stock. Each time she suggested another wine at a much higher price. Had she offered us her selection at the price of our preferred choice, we would have taken it. The entire wine selection process from our initial request to actually getting the bottle took 40 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous! They don't know what they have in stock, and can't find what they do have in a timely manner. I asked our server if they use a computer to track the inventory and locations and she said the owner doesn't do that because it is too difficult. The owner here is obviously clueless. They filed for Chapter 11 earlier this year, and that does not surprise me. The quality of the food has suffered too. They are probably trying to save money to pay the creditors. My prediction is that they will close down soon. What was once one of our favorites is now a place we will never return too. Stay away, you will only be disappointed",2017-11-01 19:23:54

This is an unassuming old house in the middle of downtown Calgary, with charmingly friendly features and packs some powerful pints and pizza.

If you're starting to feel like a full on YYC savvy beer snob, you'll probably want to check out the Hop In Brew - with an ever changing super indie beer selection, who knows, you might just get out-snobbed!

I booked a few days in advance and was easily able to get reservations on a Friday night at 8:30pm.  We arrived early and had a short wait.  Place was pretty packed and happening.
Ambiance:  Kinda of a cool vibe to have to walk through a ""secret"" door to get to the restaurant.  Place is dimly lit and had a nice vibe to it.  Kinda hard to explain.  Music and ambient noise wasn't too loud. Great place for  small or large dinner.  Restrooms were really clean.
Service:  Pretty great throughout.  We had servers just bring out food and she did a great job of picking out dishes that highlighted the menu.  This was the first time we had made that type of request and we weren't disappointed.  Water was constantly being refilled.
Food:  Tapas (small plate) style so we got to try a lot of items.  Bone marrow was really good.  I could eat that all day.  I really liked their take on the grilled cheese with the smoked bacon.  It was a bite sized portion and I was planning on ordering another one.  But then the other items came out...The Bao burgers were also pretty good.  I have had similar ones elsewhere so it didn't really stand out.  The chorizo mac n' cheese was amazing.  Blend of creamy yet savory.  The chicken meatballs were interesting.  I have never had chicken meatballs.  But it worked.  I would order that again. However, our favorite was the deep fried Thai style shrimp.  IT was lightly battered, yet perfectly fried.  I have never had such a well cooked shrimp.  It was paired really nicely with a thai sauce.  We loved it so much we had to order a second one.  The most disappointing dish was the Filet.  NOthing special.  I would have rather had more of the small plates.

Overall, a great dining experience.  Food was good and service was as well.",2017-12-11 18:20:41

Went here to listen to the jazz quartet and have dessert after a day out.

Dessert (I had the cheesecake, my companion had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream) was really good.

We had coffee and water to wash our sweets down.

Our waitresses (we somehow ended up with two) were great. They both checked on us often enough and kept our drinks refilled as necessary.

We wanted to sit where we could see AND hear the musicians so we sat near the bar at a tall table, close to the patio area.

Great seats except that a slight smell of smoke wafted in continuously during our visit. 

The quartet was fantastic. Great classic jazz, uptempo as well as laid back sounds. 

I think they're in the wrong time slot as well as a bad location in the venue. They are set up in a back corner area of the bar area, where I assume seating was removed. It does appear the only location for them to set up comfortably.

However, because there are tv's in the bar and most of the seating in the area has patrons' backs toward the musicians, it doesn't seem likely that the quartet is getting enough visual or audio notice from the crowd.

The majority of the folk I observed in the time we were there (until 10 p.m., the same time the live music ends), seemed to be mid-30s. The folk who might enjoy the music seemed to gravitate toward the bar area around the time the group was packing up to leave.

Shame.

As a previous reviewer noted, the attire of the ladies working at the location is a bit short and tight (and the fishnets give them an air of ""Las Vegas showgirl"", in my mind) but it all fits the pseudo-upscale vibe I got from the place overall.

I don't usually frequent the south end area but if I'm in the area on a night the musicians are there, I'll drop in for dessert again.",2014-07-22 17:03:25

When we got there we sat in one of the booths. Now I love a good sports bar and this one has a neighborhood feel to it. Granted the TV's in the booths are a little much, but all the other TV's are just fine and make for a great game day! Had a great lunch special that day for $6.95 which included a burger, side and drink. Ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium with the onion straws as a side. Came with onion, tomato & lettuce w/pickle. 

The meal for me was OK. It was a good burger, though a tad overcooked. That said; it had good flavor and was a great size for the price, special price or not. The let down were the onion straws though. They were soaked in oil/grease as if they hadn't been cooked long enough. I was able to dive into some of the wife's tater tots and they were good.

My first visit, I had a few beers, a mule, and shared some hot wings. Now, I hate to sound arrogant, and this might... but I have a high standard for hot wings. I love spice, and a hot wing that isn't hot is a waste of money in my book. These weren't hot. They were more salty than hot. The full wings are interesting, but you really don't get much more meat. Hard pass.

On my most recent visit, I went for Brisket Tacos and beers. You really run a low risk of messing it up when it comes to tacos, yet somehow, they did it. The brisket was dry, yet the plate was drenched in a pool of grease. Seems to me like they were trying to resuscitate old brisket with oil but it didn't work. It would be SOMETHING if it was at least seasoned well, but alas... Flavorless and stringy.

Instead of wrestling with him in the bathtub at my home, I figured it would be easier to take him to a DIY place. I went to Wag 'n Wash and opted for the basic, which is around $13. This included; towels, brushes, shampoo & conditioner, an apron, and drying station. 

I start the cleaning process by putting my dog in the tub. This was not an easy task being that the tub is 2 feet off of the ground, my puppy is 70 lbs. and I'm clearly not a weight lifter. Fortunately one of the staff members helped me get my puppy into the tub, it still wasn't easy, but we eventually got him in there. So I get him washed and clean, and then he needed to be dried. So I again, have the task of getting 70 lbs. of puppy out of the tub and into the dryer area (quite the struggle). I get him over to the dryer area and realize again, that I will have to lift him up another 2 feet so I can use the dryer. This time he's sopping wet, fortunately one of the staff members again helped me lift him up, but it was still a struggle as his was slipping, sliding, resisting and then resulted in being sopping wet myself. I then attempted to dry him while simultaneously trying to keep him from jumping off of the 2 foot platform, since the leash that was connected kept loosening due to my dogs weight. After a while, I just gave up and left him half dry as it was too much of a struggle. 

I'm not sure if I would attempt to do this again, as I went here because I thought it would be easier than doing it at home by myself. It seems as if this place is not setup for large dog breeds, maybe if they added some step stools it would've been less of a challenge. The staff was very nice, but I came here as a convenience and it was actually more of a struggle. They do however have a very nice selection of dog toys. I purchased the pup a Vibram ball that seems to be holding up very well.",2013-02-13 22:35:48

Started out with us getting our pictures taken for a keepsake, was a nice touch. Then onto an hour of the most amazing canapés that included:

Gruyère cheese gougeres
Foie gras terrine with orange marmalade
B.L.T
Dungeness crab salad
Salmon tartare

These were all delicious, but my personal favorites were the Foie Gras and the Dungeness Crab Salad. They were never ending, one of the servers kept coming back to me because he picked up on my two favorites, I literally ate a healthy serving of both.  Also served during the hour was unlimited Billecart-Salmon Brut Champagne MV. Servers made sure our flute was never empty.

Moving onto our assigned seats, we were then given a table full of more food;

Huitres
Olives Marinées
Assiette de Charcuterie
Rillettes aux Deux Salmon

Served with a glass of Pastou Sancerre, La Cote de Sury 2011. I'm a big Sancerre fan, this wasn't good, but the the rest of the plates were pretty good, charcuterie being the table favorite.

Onto the Salad of Maine lobster, Dungeness crab, bay scallops, Bouchot mussels, prawns served with sauce gribiche. This was probably one of the top seafood salads I've ever had. Dinner could've stopped here and I'd be ok. It was phenomenal. Salad was served with Christian Moreau Chablis 2012.

We then chose between sautéed Scottish Salmon or Slow Roasted Rib Eye. I've had their Scottish Salmon before so I went with the Rib Eye.  Equally as fanstastic as the rest of the food, and it was huge. I couldn't finish it. Main entree was served with Deyrem-Valentin Margaux 2009.

Dessert, my favorite meal. Chocolate Sponge Anniversary Cake with vanilla bean bavarois & fromage blanc ice cream. Served with the most delicious  dessert wine, Domaine Cazes, Rivesaltes Ambre 1996.

I was stuffed and just when I thought they couldn't possibly bring more food, Mignardises, a full plate. 

We were also given a ""goodie bag"" to take home that included a signed menu from Chef Keller, a box of macarons, and bag of shortbread cookies and a copy of Finesse magazine.

I ordered a simple biscuit with raspberry jam and their beignets (initially, these are what drew me in). The person who took my order was friendly and the service itself was rather efficient. The food arrived quickly, and the portions were much larger than I expected them to be. I immediately dove into the warm, flaky biscuit, that was almost a tad underdone in the middle (perfection in my book) and slathered on some raspberry jam. The jam is from a spot in Asheville, and wow, was that the perfect compliment to the doughy, buttery biscuit. I then went for the beignets, which were doused in powered sugar (maybe bordering too much) and was excited to dunk them in the chocolate coffee sauce. I have to admit, I was disappointed in the sauce, with it having almost a burnt taste, but the raspberry jam....well that was perfection on the beignets as well!

First it's a meat & three, which has been long missing since Gus Sir Beef left Latta Arcade years ago.  Second it's a GOOD, upscale meat & three which is part of the Noble family of restaurants (one that even I will enjoy going to). Third it is the most wonderful concept: it is a nonprofit conceived by all proceeds are leveraged to donate to soup kitchens, and other food charities. Beyond that, they employ the otherwise unemployable (formerly incarcerated, rehabilitated, etc.) and are integrating a 40-week job training program to teach life skills. They also hand out box lunches to homeless. There isn't a place like this anywhere around, so I wanted to support this nonprofit even if the food wasn't good. Maybe their motto should be ""Do Good, Eat Well"" because lucky for me, it was delicious.

They said they have the best pan fried chicken in town, so that's what I tried along with some of the best grits I've had in Charlotte (Anson Mill stoneground grits with some corn kernels), stewed squash and fried green beans. The squash was absolutely delicious, and the beans weren't really what I expected- I thought they might be battered and crispy, but they were possibly stewed and then fried so they were definitely more crispy than stewed, but not crispy crispy. My chicken's breast was very tender inside and I would definitely get that again.  I will refrain from commenting on my husband's pot roast since I never like fatty meat. He said it was tender. He accompanied the roast with mac 'n cheese (good but not plentiful enough), collard greens which were tasty and not too vinegary, and creamed corn which weren't too creamy. He was very pleased as well.  Other meats included fried flounder, grilled chicken breasts and Eegads! chicken livers!! We are in the South, Jules, get over it.  There were several other things to choose from as well as some sandwiches.  Desserts included a banana pudding with a torched meringue top from the pastry chef from Johnson & Wales, a brown sugar pound cake, chocolate pie, coconut chess pie and others.  

Service was very friendly, but we got the sense some of the staff was underemployable. Since they've been open only a few days they're still in training mode, but was very encouraged about the friendliness.

Right now they are only open for lunch M-F, but they hope to open for breakfast and eventually dinner as well and are going to play with opening for breakfast/lunch on weekends.

The Santa Cruz sub was pretty good though (and my favorite of the two) - with its ingredients of Mesquite turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, corn relish, cheddar and chipotle mayo.

Egh! The whole point of preventing cross contamination is null and void. Pull off and throw away the gloves while doing cashier duties, than place new gloves on when you handle food. Simple. Protect your customers instead of giving them something, we don't know where that money's been! 

*Rant Over*

OKay. What I observed here: The young lady came out from the employee door greeting us and asking if we want a sample. I immediately declined because she had gloves on, doing god knows what in the back area. She handed out sample cups to the other two ladies there. Still wearing gloves, she handled cash - not once, twice! Why is she wearing gloves? To protect her hands? It sure wasn't for our protection.

My father also brings home take out from this location and he's brought home on many the occasion the rock lobster and shrimp combo. As the lobster was superbly cooked on those days I felt that it was a safe bet to go with the steak and Rock Lobster, which at $39.99 was their most expensive item on the menu and I had hoped that it would reflect the quality. I was proven very, very wrong. 
The rock lobster tail was so overcooked that it had a rubbery and incredibly unpleasant texture... I would compare it to a rubber band for reference. It was horribly overcooked and unappetizing.
The steak had the texture of gum, with such a foul smell and putrid after taste that after two bites of the questionable item before me, I was unable to continue the meal.
I didn't have the biscuits, because I didn't want to fill up on unnecessary salty and overly buttered, greasy bread before my meal (as I would never have been able to finish anything) so I can't attest to the quality of that food item, but my boyfriend does relay that it was enjoyable, albeit just as overly buttered and very salty as I had suspected.
I will say that the Caesar salad was quite enjoyable, as was the alcoholic beverages that I tried. I had the Peach Long Island Iced Tea as well as the Malibu Hurricane and I found both to be quite pleasant and refreshing. 
Will I eat here again? The answer is a resounding NO. Might I go here for casual drinks, perhaps... but I highly doubt it.

The manager on duty was kind enough to remove the item from my bill, and I think it was because it was painfully obvious that I took a very small cut from the lobster tail and a small strip off the steak. Even with his offer of dessert or another meal, I completely declined everything, as I felt absolutely sick to my stomach from the steak and told him in earnest, that I was now quite afraid to order anything else. I unfortunately still feel quite nauseated from the steaks after taste and I am truly confused as to what I was served.

Those with allergies be aware:- they do cook the seafood on the same grill as the steak and chicken, so if you have an allergy where you're risking anaphylaxis if you have seafood, this is unfortunately not the place for you... because they cannot accommodate you with most items. I was fairly annoyed to be told this after that individual had placed their order (and we had three meals out already) because I had called on Thursday and spoken to staff who assured me that accommodations would always be made for allergies of this nature. Many thoughts would be... why would anyone with a seafood allergy want to come here? They were given a gift card and wanted the opportunity to try the establishment, so it was a bit unfortunate that they were relegated to very basic fare. 

For those that do wish to try this establishment:- I would suggest going on a day that they are not busy and that they don't have their shrimp event going, because they seem completely incapable of dealing with a full house. I feel the food quality really suffered because of how busy they were. I could understand where staff would become overwhelmed and absolutely butcher the food beyond any salvageable level, because I have eaten here before and the other occasions weren't such a disaster.

I will say after I sent back the meal, I was pretty much invisible/dead to the servers and that was quite amusing... because we generally leave about 20- 30% tip, but due to this they got their designated 15% as we were a party off 10 and it was automatically added. The server also skipped the tip menu and stated, well no one ever bothers to up the tip because it's already included on a party. And I honestly didn't care enough to even put the extra $ in cash as we normally would, because I didn't enjoy their service nor their food. Lol

There's certainly room for improvement, but considering the shabby exterior and the equally basic staff... I don't really see this happening.",2017-09-17 05:32:53

The menu is set-up in such a way where you basically choose a meal combo - ranging from about three courses to practically a full-on Thanksgiving. Each of them is meant to be for two people, but the four of us could barely finish the one we got. Considering how much food you get and the quality of the food, this place is a real bargain.

Everything was so scrumptious. The seaweed soup, the sushi rolls, the chicken thingys, etc. But the beef (and shrimp) are definitely the highlight. The cuts are just so perfect. And I even got to try something new - beef tongue. And yes, it was yummy too.

And did I mention the super ice cold beer? It's the perfect accompaniment to the hot cooking.

with all kinds of bitches!

Vendors offered things like grooming, boarding, immunization shots, and even intimate portraits. Fans of the show ""Pit Boss"" even got to meet the Pit Boss himself and there were also obidnence training tips offered on the side stage and exhibitons throughout the day. After watching some dogs go through the training course with their  master, we got to try our luck with Dolce. We paid a $2 donation and we guided him through each task. Once I got his attention with a treat, he went through the jumps and the tunnels pretty easily. The see saw was the most difficult task, but he met me at the end with his hard earned treat after jumping through the last hoop.

We coudn't get more than a hundred feet at a time without being stopped by women, children, and men asking to pet or have a photo with the birthday boy!

On a stop at Last Best for a growler fill, my options were Canadian Pizza, Mac's or Singapore Sam's. Since I was feeling the Asian vibes thanks to multiple Asian airport stopovers, I decided to give this place a go.

I walked inside, and two people were eating plates of typical Chinese (western) fare by themselves, with no staff in sight. But he appeared after a few minutes and in the meantime I'd found a menu (hiding on a lower shelf at the desk if you're in the same position). I was looking for something quick and he assured me that the fried rice would only take about five minutes. Sold.

I chose the Combo Fried Rice ($10.95) with shrimp, chicken and bbq pork. Would I like that spicy? Heck yes. And would I also like some chili oil on the side? I'd never say no. The bonus is that while you're waiting, you get a clear view of the carpark to keep an eye on your vehicle.

A few minutes later he brought out it out ready to go, including chili oil, another spicy sauce and a fortune cookie. The container (typical round aluminum foil) was packed full and there was plenty to share. And it was pretty tasty!

I tried their $5.75 tiramisu and it was maybe 1.5 inches all the way around, but the worst part was the edges of the pastry were crusty hard like day old bread. I'm not a tiramisu expert but I do know that it's not suppose to be crusty. It's suppose to be semi soft and spongy all the way around from the inside out. Wow, this was really the worst I've ever had... kid you not.

Also my hub ordered a coconut sugar covered macaroon type cookie + 2 chocolate chip cookies and he only had a small bite and didn't even bother eating the rest. This comes from a man who will eat anything and everything, so basically it was super bad. If your a pastry shop that can't even make cookies right not sure why your still ""baking"".

We also tried an Irish coffee drink that was pure alcohol and barely any coffee. It was strong as heck and not suppose to be like that, but it was the most somewhat redeeming part of this pastry hell on wheels... lol? I don't know.

Steak skewers - These were fantastic. We liked them so much we got a second order. 

Grilled octopus - pretty good. Not a huge portion but I'm a fan of octopus and it ain't usually cheap so I thought this was a good value. 

Vampiro chicken tacos - Eh I wasn't crazy about these. I'd skip them next time. They were fun to try.

The burgers are good, very large and filling and I like the grilled mushrooms as a topping. Where they fall short: no specialty sauces (just basic mayo) and no combos! This I find very strange. You have to order everything separately. It seems like a little thing to make a combo!

I liked the service though. The woman taking our order told me that only one fry would work or two people and she was right. I appreciated the heads up! But I wish they had some more variety of products.

I'm comparing it to the obvious one: Hero Burger and I guess what I'm saying is, Hero Burger wins!

Newly opened on Eastern near Lone Road they are open 7 days a week from 630 AM to 200 PM. Peg's has been in the Reno area since 1999 and this is their first location in southern Nevada. 

We stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday and although they were very busy we were seated quickly. There is a mix of booths and tables with an open kitchen in the back. The menu is full of all the breakfast favorites: Egg dishes, skillets, omelettes, pancakes, waffles and benedicts as well as some Hawaiian offerings like loco moco and spam & eggs. 

Our server was over quickly to offer us coffee and drinks. For breakfast we chose the traditional benedict and the turkey patty & eggs plate with cinnamon apples. We both really enjoyed our choices. The benedict was served with a  large helping of crispy hash browns and the poached eggs were cooked absolutely perfectly. The turkey patty was far better than expected. Although it was thick it was moist and flavorful and not the least bit dry. The warm cinnamon apples were delicious, soft and full of cinnamon flavor. 

I can't wait to come back for lunch. The two current lunch specials sounded wonderful; Teriyaki short ribs and a prime rib philly...mmmm. So happy to have Peg's open here in Henderson and look forward to returning soon!",2017-11-27 17:10:48

I'm always a bit apprehensive because it's one of the few bars in Pgh that meets the threshold for allowing smoking, so the place is always a bit smoky.  

But...

You can't argue with what I call ""comfort bar food.""  The pizzas are greasy, yeh, but they are tasty.   And there's nothing better than PHI's steak sandwich and fries.  The fries, especially, are a wonderful guilty pleasure.

Can't speak about the beers because I'm not a beer guy.  I've come to avoid liquor there because the drinks never seem strong enough, even straight whiskeys.  I'm NOT accusing them of watering down the beverages, however.  

Even if you're NOT a regular, the staff treats you well.  And it is what it is: a dive bar.   But it's a good dive bar!

We've had a few mixers there for students and they always go out of their way to make us feel welcome.

My friend invited me out here for dinner. Don't get lost looking for this place like I did. It's around the corner at the edge of that really long strip mall with places like Pho Kim Long and Lee's Sandwiches, and the signs merely say ""Noodle House.""

There isn't anything truly spectacular about the decor or ambiance, but I had absolutely no issues with it unlike some reviewers whose words I just read. You can see photos of the interior of this particular location on their web site.

I mostly deferred to my friend's recommendations. We ended up sharing three dishes.

Roasted duck curry ($8.25): this was supposed to be duck fried rice, but we ended up with this instead due to some sort of miscommunication. Ordered as a spicy level of 3 (out of 10), which ended up not being bad at all for me. Decent amounts of duck, sweetness bolstered by the pineapple chunks. I've decided that I'm not a fan of this level of sweetness, but nothing wrong with this dish.

Yellow curry with chicken ($6.95) - spicy level of 5, but actually not an issue with my normally sensitive palate either. Potatoes were better than I've experienced in other yellow curries. Well-executed overall, and my personal favorite of the night.

Rad-na with beef ($7.25) - actually the first time I've tried this. Enjoyed the savory gravy quite a bit. Flat noodles, Chinese broccoli, and beef were all delicious as well. Glad I listened to my friend instead of defaulting to pad see-eu.

Overall impressions: good portion sizes for the price, not as spicy as other Thai restaurants. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying that duck fried rice.",2014-11-26 22:20:41

We came on a Saturday night, after calling and being told that although tables inside were all reserved for the night, there would be seating in the bar and outside 'first-come first-served.'  So, willing to wait a bit for one of these famous-view tables, we went up and were fortunately able to immediately get a seat at one of the tables in the bar area.  No view of the city from there, but there was a good view of the Buccos game on the big TV, so we were happy with that.

Our waitress brought our drinks right away, and she took our order shortly after.  We were off to a good start, but things started to look a little dismal when the mushroom soup that we ordered hadn't shown up after about twenty minutes.  We had decided to split a bowl of the soup, an appetizer, and an entree, and then each ordered our own side salads.  (There was nothing on the menu to indicate you couldn't share an entree, nor was there an additional plate fee for doing so.)

Finally, after 45 minutes, our appetizer arrived.  We got the jalapeno crab dip, which was really good, and came with lightly fried pita triangles.  The dip was served still hot, so we figured that the kitchen was just backed up.

At this point, we noticed that our waitress was not only waiting on her tables, she was making the drink orders for all of her own tables, in addition to the drinks for those of some of the other waitstaff.  My best guess is that she was normally a bartender who got assigned to wait tables when another server called off, but never once did she say anything to indicate that they were short-staffed, or even say, ""Sorry for the delay, your food is coming out soon.""  

Finally, after twenty more minutes, our food arrived.  As in, ALL OF IT arrived at once.  The soup, our side salads, and our 'entree' were brought to the table at once.  The soup was already at room temperature, and for a thick soup like a cream of mushroom, it has to be hot to not overwhelm you with the weight of it.  We each had a few bites and that was it.

We had ordered the grilled scallops entree, and at $26, I had expected more than 5 scallops and half a plate of French fries.  (The menu said 'roasted potato wedges,' but what actually arrived were the equivalent of the seasoned fries from the old Rally's restaurant - don't get me wrong, they were mighty tasty, but for 'roasted potato wedges' they were not what I expected).

We were just upset at this.  We really wanted to enjoy our dinner and take in the sights from Mt. Washington, but poor service and food quality just prevented that.  I am typically very forgiving of slow service during busy times, but I do kind of expect some, 'Hey, sorry, we're really backed up because of ___ tonight, it's going to be a little longer for your food,' from my servers.  Especially for the prices of the Grandview Saloon - the food here was not significantly cheaper than the meals at LeMont, but the quality, amount, and presentation of the food did not even come close to stacking up.

However, all of this said, I do believe very strongly in second chances, and if I were to receive a coupon or have a Groupon deal for the Grandivew Saloon, I think we would return just to see if we were there first on an off-night.  When it comes to paying full-price for a meal though, for now, I will be sticking to the Mt. Washington restaurants I know.",2011-07-18 15:21:53

I came seeking modeling clay and left with exactly what I needed.  But it was hard not to wander the massive aisles picking up other crafty hobbies.  There were very appealing soap and candle making displays.  I didn't even go near the yarn section because that would've been tempting fate.
That said, I have to whine.  Perhaps the massive amount of space explains why there weren't many cute displays up on the walls. Yeah, I guess it'd be a little treacherous not to mention a waste of time putting up a bunch of silk floral arrangements and stuff on the walls but the place just seemed a little bare.  Over the entrance doors in lonely gold letters it said ""WELCOME TO THE HOBBY LOBBY"" and that was it.  It seems a Michael's-on-roids would have cutesy inspiring wall displays on roids too. Meh. 
My other whine was poorly marked aisles.  You're trapped into wandering the store because you there aren't big hanging supermarket style aisle markers saying what's in each aisle, and there weren't a whole lot of employees on the floor (a Monday afternoon, around 4:30).

Tickets are only $5 but it sounds like people are expecting Cirque du Soleil and a talk by Bill Nye the Science Guy.

I stopped by with a friend on a Saturday Afternoon. The weather was gorgeous! Outside there were some food trucks, beer stations, bands playing, and some big metal sculptures. Inside was airy (no boob sweat for me which was awesome) and there were clothing and jewelry vendors, a guy selling homemade loaves of bread, and a couple neat robot toys/figurines? for sale. In another section we saw 3D printers in action and talked to a woman about the specifics behind them. At another stand we learned about Chateau Hough, a vineyard on reclaimed urban land that helps parolees reenter society. There was a section where you could sit and listen to some talk about the community (I obviously was not listening). In another area we saw moving photographs taken by the homeless. In yet another area we sat down to paint a tile with just drops of ink and a straw. Finally we sipped on some beer from Goldhorn Brewery and watched people of all ages enjoy the indoor swings. 

I honestly think a person's attitude has a big affect on their experience somewhere; my friend and I went in with open minds and really just enjoyed a chill day hanging out together and exploring this neat/interesting little festival.

My daughter, and I were tired of the usual, and after a long weekend (Memorial Day), decided we needed to get back in touch with our roots. We got to Dasonii, shortly after opening time for lunch, and noticed a few changes to the interior since our last visit, closed off kitchen, and only one waitress. 

We were seated promptly, and ordered the mung bean pancake as an appetizer. The creamy texture with different bites of kimchi, and pork, had a good flavor, a little bland, and not as large as the seafood, or kimchi pancakes. 

The Naengmyun caught my attention, as I was scanning the menu over. Naengmyun is a summertime dish of cold buckwheat noodles, in a beef broth, chilled with ice. A nice alternative to hot, heavy foods during warmer months. I couldn't wait to eat! My daughter settled with bulgogi. 

My bowl of Naengmyun was okay, a little too salty for my taste. The noodles were nicely chewy, topped with half a boiled egg. There were a few large slices of beef that were a bit tough. The large cucumber slices looking like sliced zucchini, were the saltiest thing in the bowl. There was no offering of hot Chinese mustard, or white vinegar on the side, which are traditionally served with the dish. (You don't even ask for these at other restaurants they just come with your order). I ate all the solids, but skipped on finishing the broth, which was salty, and had no ice. 
The bulgogi my daughter had was pretty standard, a little sweeter than we're used too, but she enjoyed it. The panchan (side dishes) this time around were average, roasted potatoes were salty, marinated tofu was okay, the vegetables, (sprouts, broccoli, radish kimchi, and kimchi) a little bland, but decent.

fWhtW2kduZeUJNBlc4lz2w,qxmdrMmjTzgQhyHXKuyy3Q,PL3cimEUfNHlenOGSOAdJg,1,10,3,2,"With all the rave reviews and our previous five-star experience at Akira Back's Yellowtail at the Bellagio, we had high hopes for our dinner at Kumi on Saturday night. We had reservations for 8:45 pm after the Michael Jackson One 7 pm show (see separate review), and we arrived promptly at 8:45 pm. We were told by a very sweet hostess that they were running behind and we would be seated within ten minutes.  That should have been a warning for what was to come. 

As requested on Open Table, we were seated at a semi-circular booth in the back room (or upstairs as the hostess referred to it). It could be an incredible room except that the lighting is so dim, you can't read the menu. Thank heavens we had read the menu and already knew what we wanted to order. It was quite disconcerting that we were asked by two different waiters what we wanted to order for drinks, and then we were asked again by two waiters what we wanted to order to start. The waiters were initially friendly, but then they seemed to be rushing us . . . and that was strange because the room was not even remotely filled with diners at that point.  Maybe they were playing catch up as the hostess did say they were running behind when we arrived?!  For a new restaurant, they should have spent a little more time explaining the menu, making suggestions, etc. 

We ordered in stages so that all the food didn't arrive at once. We started with the Japanese Eggplant . . . one Japanese eggplant cut in half . . . delicious, but not worth the $12 price tag.  We followed that with the Miso Black Cod. Now, this is one of our favorite dishes, and we have had this at some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas, most notably Nobu, and my husband and I both agreed that Nobu has the best around. I'd put Kumi's close to the middle of the pack, not just for its taste, but also its value at $29. Then I thought about the portion and taste of the Chilean Sea Bass I had the previous evening at Mastro's Ocean Club ($45 for a huge piece) with the price we paid  for the Black Cod (similarly priced fishes), and we felt rooked!  We took the advice of previous reviewers and had the Hot Mess roll and the 007 Octopussy. Both were tasty, but we have had much better rolls at Social House. And by the way, good luck seeing what you ordered in the dimly lit room.  I had to take a picture with my iPhone flash on to see how the plate was presented!

The straw that broke the camel's back was that we ultimately waiting over 30 minutes to get our check. We wanted to sign to our room at Bellagio and apparently, according to our waiter, their system was down. He came back to inform us that his manager would be taking care of it shortly. Fifteen minutes later, we received our check, and it was inaccurate, so back it went. Our server, looking ever so stressed out, came over to say they were still experiencing issues and that a manager would again be taking care of things.  Twenty minutes later, the manager came over with our check. He did not apologize for the wait, or that the check was wrong . . . he just walked off.  At that point, my husband gave me the bill and told me that he could not bare to fill it out and said ""you do it.""  Neither of us were sure if it was the waiter or the manager who was at fault, but I called the manager over again and explained that we were quite shocked that the service was so poor. He said he didn't understand, and as I explained that we waited so long for the check, he said, ""I'll have a talk with my server. I wasn't aware of it.""  The end. 

Needless to say, I have nothing positive to say about our experience at Kumi. I guess if you are stuck at Mandalay Bay and have a hankering for Japanese, then you might choose Kumi, but if you aren't, there are so many better places . . . including Shef Akira Back's other noted restaurant, Yellowtail.",2013-08-13 00:53:29

A menu was given to me from some employee... We walk to the counter and I order the Diablo bu rger and the Parmesan truffle fries. We don't pay, but are given two empty cups (for water) and a table #. So we look for our table # and we wait....

I thought we had to find water and serve ourselves, but finally some employee came by to fill water for us. Then, we get this waiter of some sort - he asks us if we are ok, our food will come soon, etc. We finally get the food and the burger was a little on the medium side, but packed with so much spice and flavor. The fries weren't bad and I enjoyed it too. This waiter comes by again and we ask for ketchup and aioli, we get that in little plastic cups (kinda tacky).

The scallops in the shell which was previously done with a cream sauce now sits under a mountain of lava hot mayo. The garlic steak cubes was overcooked and the mushroom beef soup lacked all flavour.

For a place which seats 16,000, I must say the space appears small, which has its good and bad's.

The minus is lack of entrances so traffic flow in and out of the venue can become a bottleneck at points. As I was watching the concert I pictured how close my seats would be for a sporting event and I gotta say they would not be that bad.

Super beautiful inside and very popular right now though! Maybe because most people are on summer vacation? There was a TON of little kids on the back slide structure and the haunting smell of stinky feet (since you take off your shoes to get up there) was on the borderline. It was so packed I could hardly find a place to sit and had to share with others. 

The food and drinks themselves are just okay and comparable to any other cafe. The drink concoctions are too sweet and the desserts look great and pretty, but don't taste that special. 

For example, the tofu cheesecake was nice and unique just because it was tofu. It wasn't too sweet and I could taste the subtle tofu, which was great. But the graham cracker crumble was barely sweet or able to be tasted either. Maybe some cinnamon or sugar granules, even sea salt, could have made it special. Another review suggested putting some sort of fruit compote in the center of the cheesecake mound, which I thought was a great idea. As it is, there is just a little more of the same bland cake and crumble in there.",2018-06-06 20:55:01

The eggs benedict had a thick and tasty hollandaise sauce, though the amount of potatoes was much less than the other dishes. The pasta primavera was also cooked quite well. The ham and cheese omelette was salty, but that's only because there was so much ham it felt like you were getting your money's worth, including all the toast and homefries.

Our meal took quite a while to come out, and the owners pro-actively offered to reduce our bill by a meal and a coffee. The owners (both!) did come out and apologize for our meals taking so long - they had a large group, and a worker didn't show up that Sunday.

But when you're used to serving people fast and impersonal in a food truck, it makes sense that without real planning you can end up with an awkward dining experience.

So we went on a week night to Rock Lobster to partake in some tasty eating. When we arrived, the gentleman at the door seemed a little put out to greet us and quickly offered us the closest two-seater to the frigid door, despite having more seating just a few rows down. I asked if we could have one further from the door because it was cold. ""Oh, sure, yeah"" he said. He never spoke to us for the duration of the evening, despite bouncing to every table to inquire about the food. Weirdest part? He was the owner.

So, on to the meal. We ordered the lobster roll and a lobster mac and cheese and some drinks to start. To confirm, the beverages were totally worth their price. I ordered the pickled drink and my boyfriend got another, they were well-thought up and really beat the pants off other ""specialty cocktails"" I've had in other restaurants. Definite bonus points.

Now for the food. I really enjoyed the lobster roll, but it was a little small. It was served on what looked like a weeny hot dog bun and came with some cold chips on the side. It felt more like a lunch entree than a dinner plate, but the lobster filling was really tasty. The biggest crime is that my food came almost 15 minutes before my boyfriend's food arrived, with no indication from our server that there would be a time discrepancy. I waited as long as I could but eventually tucked in. I was completely done my drink and meal before the lobster mac and cheese came. 

The lobster mac and cheese left a lot to be desired. It was bland, without much flavour and it was really watery. The cheese overpowered the lobster. My poor boyfriend toughed it out but he didn't appear to be very happy.

The part that really perturbed me was that nobody once asked us how our food was, despite the fact that the owner was literally talking up every table except us. He didn't even say good-bye when we left. At one point, he even told people on the waiting list (while we were still eating) ""Those two are leaving soon, so just wait inside."" I was pretty miffed. Our server was also distant and it's a major pet peeve of mine to have our food arrive at such grossly different times. At least warn us. 

I won't be returning to Rock Lobster the restaurant any time soon. If I see the food truck around, I'll perhaps grab a roll but not all food trucks are meant to be restaurants.",2013-01-18 19:12:40

The BFF and I visited Havana Cafe for the first time and hopefully not the last. We went for lunch on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy. The place is pretty small (and cute!) but there are many tables inside and out. They had festive Cuban music playing which added to the atmosphere.

Since neither of us know much about Cuban food we decided to go with the tapas sampler. Perfect for two people, it was loaded with 6 of their tapas. I'll murder the names, but there were plantains, chorizo, a tamale, black bean fritters, cod fritters and one other meat item I can't remember the name of. We also got a side of Sun Chips (sweet potato fries) and a half pitcher of red sangria because that's how we ladies roll for Saturday lunch.

Everything in the sampler was delicious. My favorites were the plantains, the black bean fritters and the tamale but I really did like it all. The sweet potato fries were good but I've had better. That's the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. Nothing in the sampler was spicy so it's a good option for just about anyone, except vegetarians.

The sangria was good, more wine tasting than some sangrias. i'd like to try the white sangria next time.

The service was great. Everyone was friendly and they didn't try to speed us along or anything as we took our time chatting and munching.

Showed up and the people at our table were still not done... It wasn't that bad, but we did have to wait 10 mins. which is sort of annoying when we already had a reservation. 

But I still give Campagnolo 4 stars because the food was SO good. I had high expectations and I was worried it might not live up to them, but thankfully I wasn't disappointed! 

I had:
- Cocktail that was basically a gin & tonic with fresh mint and cucumbers. Simple perfection. Nice and refreshing. 

- Brussel sprouts with pancetta and pine nuts -- love at first bite! The creamy sauce was divine. Luckily we got the house made baguette, so I could dip the bread in it. Good portion size. 
- Had a bite of the burrata and grapes. So fresh and tasty. I am definitely going to order this next time. 
- One person got the prosciutto which was nice but it didn't come with any bread or anything. The prosciutto looked a bit lonesome on that long plate... Another ordered the fish chowder. Looked hearty and he said it was really, really good (so good he wouldn't share!). 

- Spaghetti all' Amatriciana - I was so excited to try this because it is a quintessential Roman dish that I discovered recently while traveling in Rome. Campangolo's version was just as good as the ones I tried in Italy. Perfect al dente noodles and the sauce was spicy but not exaggerated. 
- We didn't really share entrees, but the person who ordered the boar was raving about it. And another friend got over his psychological barriers to eating rabbit (bunny!) -- and enjoyed the pappardelle dish. 

- Peppercorn panna cotta - interesting idea and mix of flavours, although after a few bites I found it way too pepper-y. 
- Salted caramel budino - I'll echo what everyone else has said, one of the highlights of the meal. 

Despite my frustrations in booking a table here (why have a phone if you don't pick it up?!?), Campagnolo has won me over. Really authentic Italian food done right -- simple dishes that let fresh ingredients speak for themselves and a small but always changing menu (luckily favourites like the burrata and the caramel budino are almost always on offer though). Knowledgeable and friendly staff plus a warm, inviting space are the cherry on top.",2011-04-10 22:31:42

Just passing through to have a night out with friends on the strip. A buddy of a buddy was in town, so we did the strip thing. After valet'ing my car I walked through the casino, and decided I needed to have a beer. There was a bar I walked by, I think it was called the lobby bar, and asked how much a beer was. The bartender told me the prices and I opted for a Hefe in the complimentary Miller lite football glass. It was 16 oz, and I got to keep the glass for $6. Not a bad deal for the strip. I walked down to Bill's Gambling hall where my friends were playing cheap roullette and we had a fun night. The casino stinks like smoke, it was overpacked with a bunch of touristy idiots, and all the tables were full that were open. And there were plenty of tables not even opened, on a saturday night!!

My friend loves the AROY-D Tom Yum soup in a can. I prefer to make my own, but they did have a big selection of AROY-D products, which I find to be among the best for Thai or Malaysian cooking.

I was underwhelmed with the fish section, which was described as being clean and separate from the other departments. I thought it smelled and their selection of fish was restricted mostly to whole fish or streaks with bones. I suppose one could ask the fishmonger to butcher it for you, but I'd like to see the fillet I'm getting ahead of time. They had some pretty sad looking Tuna. The salmon fillets were the only product that looked any good.

Food Court section looked pretty greasy-- similar to T&T with heavily cornstarched sauces and fried meat. The addition of an Indian Food counter did little to entice me, as I'd rather go to a proper Indian place, sit down and not have to eat in the middle of a grocery store.

Bought some Oxtails and they made a nice stew last night, but not the best oxtails I've had. Good selection of Asian veggies.

I do like the fact that you can find anything Asian that you want under one roof. T&T is great for most stuff, but when it comes to extensive selection of Indian groceries, they don't have much of Al.

It was worth the wait.

First of all, we arrived about 15 minutes before open (5:00 for dinner) and were able to find parking in the lot adjacent to the restaurant.  The door was opened about 10 minutes early so we were able to go right in and sit at the bar (we had no reservation).  I strongly recommend this if you do not have a recommendation as it guarantees you will get seated promptly.

The decor and ambiance are enjoyable, and the dining area around the bar is cozy, but not crowded.  On a return visit I hope to see the rest of the dining areas.

My wife and I shared two margarita samplers, and there wasn't a bad one in the bunch.  I will warn regarding the spicy mango - it is SPICY.  The mango also takes on a very tomato-like quality when combined with the spices.  I imagine it's what a bloody mary tastes like (I don't drink them).  All beers are Mexican/Latin, mostly familiar names.  The Brazilian lager was light yet had a nice flavor, and I could easily picture myself taking down a six-pack on a hot summer day.

We ordered some standard guacamole and some pico de gallo, both of which were pretty good.  We also tried the queso fundido, which my wife believed was the highlight of the night, food-wise.

We ordered, but only sampled two different taquitos - the machaca (braised beef) and chancho (wild boar).  Both were tasty and came with superb condiments.  We also ordered a side of green beans on the recommendation of the bartender, and she was spot on.  The green beans were extremely flavorful, and represented what Momocho is about.  STRONG flavors that you will take home with you, but in a very pleasant way.

Well, I guess you could ask for good food, but that is a given when you come to eat here. There is so much to try and not enough time! I haven't been able to eat the rice due to a gluten allergy - they did not feel confident that the pilaf was OK for me to eat (it rarely is), so I had Feta Fries instead. They were terrible. Never eat them! I will suffer the torment and eat anyone's orders if they don't want them! They're simple, overloaded with dressing and cheese - just delicious with herbs and feta. For $13 you get a Greek Salad with delicious good quality Olive Oil dressing, Pita (if you're not GF), 2 Chicken Souvlaki Skewers, Feta Fries and happiness. Could you ask for more? Their steak is also always cooked a perfect medium rare, and their shrimp are so delicious I could eat 4 skewers and still want more!

Their Avgolemono Soup is my favorite...ever. This is made with just white rice, no pilaf. Their hummus is homemade, smooth and delicious, just like everything else on their menu. What's not to love?

My husband has had the gyros and the rice bowls and loves them both. The gyros meat is good, not as salty as the meat we had back home in Chicago. He says the rice could be eaten in pounds all day long, the rice bowl is great because when you mix everything together and add a pita nothing can go wrong! 

I would call ahead if you're ordering take out, or if you want to know their daily special. I've had their grilled lamb chops, and I assure you, it is worth every last dollar spent on that dinner.

The menus are on old records which give new life to an otherwise dust collector. (I say that though I have a record player and love them oh so much.. But let's be honest). 

The coffee keeps flowing and the music is awesome. . You won't regret going to Harlem.",2011-04-12 18:39:57

I need to put a quick qualifier on this and say that this stops being true pretty quickly if you are committed to meat with every meal. Adding ""protein"" is a pricy proposition here, but it's also 100% not necessary. You'll be full with chicken or without, so I would say skip it.

Very clean, very friendly (counter) service.  But the food just...well let me explain.

I ordered a gyros.  Combo of beef and lamb and that's fine.  But the meat had way too much pepper in it.  60 minutes later I still tasted pepper.  The tzatziki was ok,,,something was missing - maybe a bit more cucumber? 

My partner ordered chicken schwarma.  Her complaint was that the chicken was chopped up - heavily chopped up.  Hard to eat because the sandwich kept falling apart. She expected and would have preferred thinly sliced meat and more garlic in the garlic sauce.

We split a small greek salad.  Again, just ok.  The dressing was mostly oil and vinegar - not enough spices except oregano and probably no dijon in it at all.

Menu?  Basically a bunch of sandwiches in the $5-$7 range or add $2.50 and you get fries or rice or a small salad and a drink.

So would we go back?  Probably not.  If I start seeing better reviews, we might try once more.  Sure would like them to add a bit to the menu...like taramosalata, pastitsio, moussaka, or maybe souvlaki?  And for goodness sake, one of the fun parts of a greek restaurant is watching them shave the meat off the revolving spool.  Maybe Gyros Town doesn't do that, but if they do, they ought to bring the spool out from the backroom, so people can watch their sandwich being made.",2013-01-12 19:04:36

I came in today with my dad for a bowl of pho. However, we can't finish two bowls, so we got a large assorted meat balls with seaweed pho for $8 and the leek dumplings for $4.25. 

We wanted to place our order when the lady came over (she speaks Mandarin) and told us that there was a posted sign that said we needed to order 2 bowls of noodles. We were pretty dissapointed because we each HAD an order, and basically were forced to order two bowls of pho. So we got two small bowls of pho, one for $7, the other for $6.50. That's literally $1.25 more than the order we had earlier...

We read the sign again (which is in Chinese) and technically it says that we needed to have an order per person..which we did. We literally wanted to walk out of the restaurant cause we can't eat a lot and ended up not finishing half the bowl of one of the pho. Nor did we want to take it home in a container because the pho will turn soggy. Also, we still had another place to go, so in the rare shining sun in the car today of autumn, it won't be as fresh. What a waste.

The food though is delicious. The soup is HOT and remained hot the whole time I ate it, hard to find places like this now where the soup is hot. Yes, there was MSG in the soupbase, but it was GOOD. The beefballs, fishballs, squidballs were good. For the food, honestly I'd probably give it a 5 star.

However, I'm not sure I would come again because we literally needed to get one bowl of pho per person.

I really don't recommend businesses forcing their customers to get a large meal each. I mean, I understand that it would be okay for each person to get something (which we were doing originally), but to force your customers to get a whole main each?! Some people just can't eat that much, and like me, I don't plan to come back cause it's such a waste of food.",2015-10-31 00:16:18

You can order certain items such as entrée from the Staff. The order will arrive on a train like machine above the conveyor belt. Or, you choose plates from the conveyor belt to eat. Each plate's color represents a price ranging from $2.50 to $9.99.

All You Can Eat (AYCE) is another choice you can pick. For lunch, 11:30AM-3:30PM, the AYCE price is $21.95. The Dinner Price, 3:30PM to 12AM, is $25.99. You can add Dungees Crab to your AYCE for an additional $6. My friend and I only got the Dinner AYCE price.

The food was delicious and fresh. You can see the Chefs working on the fresh sushi. They have rolls, Salmon, Cooked Eel, etc. There didn't seem like a lot of food on the conveyor belt, and if there was something you wanted, if they don't have the plate on the belt, you would just have to wait a while as the Chefs prepare more to place on the belt. This can represent how fresh the seafood is as they cook for the best quality.

Afterwards, enjoy a nice dessert. My friend chose a Melon Bar, while I picked a Crunch Bar. The Crunch bar flavor was Vanilla, Strawberry, and Chocolate. The food was delicious and the staff were really nice and helpful with our order.

I held out for as long as I could, the day before my birthday, saturday; this was my deadline. So, before I left my house which is 5 minutes away, I used the DASH PASS (via texting), but not entirely sure how the whole process worked. When I got there, I was lucky to find parking in the last lane of the regular parking lot, and there was about 300 in line (I'm not exaggerating, either). As I was headed into the long line (almost reached the other side of the fence to the rear of the DMV office property), I heard someone else in line, say, ""It says my wait time is one minute."" 

The line moved rapidly at 8 am. The security guard asked me if I used the texting/ Dash Pass, and when I said ""Yes"", he told me to sit down (inside). Once I was inside, there were few seats available. All counters were busy with people, and the information line was really long, too. The short line was the Kiosk line. Anyway, the automated female voice was calling out: ""Now serving Text- and the last four digits of your cell number. (BTW, you have to respond via text, or else you lose your space in line.) It seemed to happen for me really quickly. When I got to the counter, the lady tells me about #1, which I knew about from the website (had my current DL, birth certificate, SS card, and she gave me a form to fill out), but didn't know about #2- the REAL ID conversion in 2016 (allow access into federal buildings, the standard ID does not; this is a country-wide conversion) so, she suggested that I go home, get my marriage certificate and two bills with my name and address, not older than 60 days. This way, I wouldn't have to come back and pay an additional $8.00. So all this new stuff about the REAL ID was not on the website. I decline. Tells me to fill out the form. So, I'm given ten minutes to do, except there aren't any pens available, so I go to the counter again (was really fast), and there I decide I will just go home and get all the stuff I need, and I have an hour to do all that. My line is rebooted into the system. I get home and I head back. I enter ""J"" to join the line again. I don't do this until I am fairly close the DMV office. Because I have just enough time to park, and boom, my number's called a few minutes after I re-enter the building; but at this point, there are no seats available, it's standing room only (told you that it was fast). Once I am at counter #3, that is the bulk of my visit, but I was so happy to get it all done. The lady, Joy, was very nice, and probably one of the nicest DMV clerks ever.

I would highly recommend that if you must go to the DMV, you use this Dash Pass (via text); so, now, that I have this information, I am passing this along to you.

When the pizza arrives I call the place and say I ordered no olives, her response ""no you never said no olives""?  Really???  You are going to argue with a paying customer???

They did give banchan, which was interesting. They had Vienna sausage as one, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about that. It felt kind of cheap. 

We ended up just getting a spamusubi and shared chicken katsu. The spamusubi could have used more sauce, there was very little and it just felt like eating spam and rice. My friend ended up just dipping it in the sauce of the banchan. The seaweed seemed like it was harder to eat than the ones I usually get at other places. The chicken katsu was okay, nothing amazing.

Was invited to RC by a few friends since we're always game to be social and drink new beers with friends. As you would expect on opening week, it was very busy with the locals but didn't take long to get drinks with them having roughly 6-7 bartenders. 

We all decide to try all the beers so we went with the flights which were well priced and they had wine selections as well. With it being extremely hot over the weekend, we were all a little uncomfortable with the inside temperature. We eventually moved towards the back where the barrels were and the temp was an immediate 10 degrees cooler so all was well.

We eventually found a table and the temp started to cool down. The bar staff was very insightful, helpful and cordial so we will definitely be back.

The only negatives were the inside temperature and they had no beer flight trays so took a few back & forth trips with the various flights we ordered which according to the locals we met this was a rush opening.

Regardless of everything we had a great time, will come back again and look forward to more great beer.

The strengths: very large portions of food, all of which are appealing even to people who are not familiar with middle eastern cuisine; low prices; an ethnic grocery attached which is a pleasant diversion while you are waiting for your food.  

The weaknesses: virtually everything is underspiced, so you get tired of it after two or three bytes.  Apparently, lemon and garlic are spices-non-grata in this kitchen, and even salt and pepper are used sparingly.  For $2.60 you get enough hummous for two, as an appetiser, but you won't want to finish it.  It reminds me a lot of paste.  And the pita (bread) was going stale. Exceptions: their take on a meat-stuffed eggroll, and, believe it or not, the gyros.  Also well-spiced: a variety of sauces which helps offset the blandness of the food.  I must also comment on the tabouleh (which here means ground parsley) served as a huge mound on most plates; it would feed a baseball team, but it, too, is tasteless.  Other, much smaller, issues: it can get crowded, the ambiance does not exist, and they have an odd system for paying your check which puts you in a line with the people buying groceries and can be slow.

Hints:
1.  Order the Combination plate.  For $12 it is definitely enough for two average appetites and you don't get bored so easily.  
2.  They have a large grocery using the same name 3/4 mile east. The restaurant is a smaller place hidden away in a strip mall.",2012-03-22 19:59:24

Today, there was another girl that walked in right after me and we were both waiting to get signed in for a yoga class. I was waiting for the older blond lady to greet me at the counter. I had my wallet out on the counter and ready to go. The girl was in line behind me.

My friend was really craving Caribbean food so I did research on yelp and decided on this place because of the high rating. I was SOOO very disappointed. First of all, LACK OF selections, maybe this is an American thing to want to have a couple more options, but to be fair, you can see the menu that is listed under the photos section here, you get like 3 choices. I got the vegetarian platter as well, maybe that's why it's not very good. But I always prefer vegetarian and I've had MUCH MUCH better food elsewhere. I got some kidney beans mixed in with my rice...I feel like I could have cooked myself this with a can of beans dumped into my rice? On top of the kidney beans the veggie platter also comes with string beans...ok they are the best on the my plate. And then it was another selection of veggie that I am not quite sure what it is but this place kinda just reminds me of badly cooked southern food to be honest. But hey, I am going to go back and maybe give it another try on the meat product. As far as veggies goes, not tasty is for sure.",2013-04-04 02:34:05

Also was really nice the semi private dining area for dinner. We had a large group, and the space was perfect for us to mingle and be loud on the large communal table.  Outside are smaller tables, all with the same rustic wooden tables and feel. 

All the pastas are the same type of noodle, something that looks house made. I got the sausage, pistachio, in cream sauce. It had a mild flavour and was really good. Although, I did prefer my friends mushroom version a bit better. 
We also shared the Patata and Panchetta pizza which was really tasty, even better with some spicy chilli flakes on them. The pizza was thin crust and perfectly crunchy. No sogginess here!

The service was really good. On a tuesday evening it wasn't super busy, but there was a decent about of customers.  All out food came out piping out all the same time with a good quality. I was impressed for a group of about 20, they were able to pull this off. 
Our server was friendly and although not able to do separate bills, let us just pay for what we ordered at the cash as we were leaving.

-They will not pick up people downtown after dark because they assume you are either drunk or a drug dealer. If you are in this position come up with a good sob story. Or lie to dispatch about needing to go to the airport.

Prior to my membership at H&S, I frequented hotel spas, day spas and educational/school-based massage therapy centers on a sporadic basis. I tried one visit to Massage Envy, but was turned off by the weak massage techniques from the therapist there. Out of all of these types of massage locations, H&S has proven to be my reliable favorite.

H&S is less expensive than hotel and day spas, and their therapists are more versatile. You can easily get a pure Swedish relaxation massage, or you can get therapeutic (albeit not as relaxing) deep tissue work. It's completely up to how you're feeling at the time. I also appreciate that their therapists take the time to demonstrate stretches and techniques to help with tension and pain between visits.

Honey sesame pan fried short rib- last time I ordered this, it was a tad chewy. This time, it was perfect! I couldn't stop eating it!

Har Gow- can't go to dim sum without ordering this, and these were quite delicious.

Pan fried chives and conpoy dumpling: I really enjoyed these dumplings, as they were very juicy and full of aromatic chives! 

Deep fried dough with rice noodle roll: always a favourite of mine. This time, the deep fried dough was super crunchy, even more than usual. Perhaps they were over-fried? Regardless, I loved the addition of conpoy. The dipping sauces, however, were rather bland.

Dim Sum: the sui mai was ok but the har gows was good! 
Chicken Wings: one of my favourites, really crispy.

And I'm glad to say that it didn't disappoint! We thoroughly enjoyed our first dining experience here!

Our dinner started off well with some complimentary samosas! Who wouldn't want that? The outside was crisp and flaky, the inside--a rich flavor, packed with potato and peas, and it had a good amount of heat! If you're not too into spicy food, they're really nice about toning it down for ya. Our table had the garlic naan, saag paneer, tikka masala, vegetable rice, and mango lassi.

The garlic naan was just as expected! Light in texture, but flavorful. The saag paneer was probably my least favorite, but the tikka masala made up for that. The paneer was a little bit harder than I was used to, though it was great in flavor nonetheless. I would definitely order it again! The vegetable rice went perfectly with everything we had ordered, and the mango lassi was creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness!

The space is clean, well decorated, and customer service is great. Our waters were always refilled, and specific requests didn't seem to be too troubling.

The food was so fantastic that the bench comfort level did not cross my mind during the meal but in my mind comfortable seating counts for rating as well.

the food: what an act! loved every bite!

Appetizers:
1. The buratta with roasted grapes 
- the cheese was so fresh and so delicious with the fresh bread and the roasted grapes - i fell in love with grapes all over again!

2. Bone Marrow with ox tail
- this was my first time having either of those. Not really very adventurous with my food i gave this a shot - great bet! I can't comment how well it was made because i personally do not have anything to compare it to but it was delicious!

Entrees:
- the gnocchi just simply melted in your mouth. The simple but ever so flavourful ingredients made for a great meal

- Spaghetti - the veggie version
again a simple dish and so flavourful!

I ordered the: Roasted Veggie (the only item in the Veggie Section) my order come quickly. Unfortunately the ""Baguette"" was just a soggy unfroze piece of bread who as nothing to do with a French baguette, it was stuffed with some overcook veggies and cover with a can tomato sauce. After a first bite , it tasted like a ratatouille in bread. I was so hungry, I finished it. The french fries were nice but when I asked for mayo ( yes I am one of those who eat french fries with mayo), I was surprise to get some ""mayo packet"". The service was good since a trainer was behind the server to check what she was doing. I asked about desert, the lemon key pie was not homemade but deliver everyday from another company. My only reason I add one star was the service. Maybe my expectations were much higher, but if you go down the street next to the freeway, there is a famous chain diner restaurant open 24hours a day who is better than ""Metro Diner"".

In fact, if you read my previous reviews,  I often update and continuously lower the stars on a yearly basis.

This time it got pretty bad, for some reason the UNLV Parking and Enforcement sold 19,000 parking passes when there is just over 12,500 parking spots at any given time on campus. Local news coverage have covered this story in detail, such as KTNV and ABC 13 Action News (dated September 15th, 2014 available online ""UNLV students peeved over packed parking lots on campus""). 

To add fuel to the fire, for the first month and still ongoing, a majority of the white lot, that was meant for US, the PAYING STUDENTS who bought the passes, has been hijacked by tourists who take up hundreds of parking spots... MEANT FOR US, with semitrailers, Greyhound Bus Convoys, etc. 

Not only do we have to drive around wasting gas looking for a parking spot, but we often end up parking farther away from our classes that WE BORROWED AND SPENT TUITION MONEY ON, suffer from dehydration (I saw one lying on the ground on the first floor of the library being helped by cops and paramedics), and almost every lot is FULL. 

I drive a stickshift, and preferably I would NOT LIKE TO park inside the parking garage located next to Flamingo Road because of stop-and-go driving UPHILL and the extremely tight turning clearances we all have to make to get from one floor to another or to drive around a idiot student that is holding up traffic waiting for someone to back out. All of you fucks are contributing to the destruction of my clutch. 

We have to endure the shit parking spots on a daily basis, even during our first exam week. We were the ones who paid to come here, to put up with incompetent teachers, lousy parking spaces, overzealous parking enforcement, and all of these tourist convention shitheads that want to make UNLV basically their semester residence, which displaces the rest of us from getting to class on time, or even to class at all. 

Nowdays I advise just showing up on campus about 1 or 2 hours earlier. Just skip breakfast and your shower and just get to campus. Your going to lose your hygiene anyways from all the sweat pouring out your body from the miserable 20-30 minute walk out in 100+ degree fahrenheit weather. Just go shower at the Student Recreation Center instead.",2014-10-06 18:58:49

Well lit with lots of natural light.  Decor is heavy on stainless steel and IKEA-ish feel. Typical patrons are from all ages but seem attract the Vegan-Vegetarian-Food Intolerance crowd. 

Food: Great selection of hot/cold sandwhichs and salads, with most selections being Veggie/Vegan although they do offer some meats: tuna melt for example. The veggies used in the sandwich's and salads are some of the freshest I've had. They appear to source most of their food locally. Everything tastes extremely good and you can tell a lot time and expertise goes into the food.

Service: Everyone was extremely helpful, courteous, and respectful. Good vibes.

Price: Quit pricey. Most sandwich's are in the 9 to 10 dollar range. Portion sizes are on a appropriate scale for a health-conscientious person, but might be considered small for the price for others.

Overall: Restaurants geared toward the Vegan-Vegetarian-Food Intolerance crowd are becoming more common. Even if you don't find your self in the above categories you can appreciate the healthy/fresh/culinary-expertise factor in places like Oliver's. The only down side about Oliver's for me is the price.

It gets packed here at lunch so get here early or have a late lunch to avoid the masses. Overall, pretty quick and service is efficient. While the staff has limited English, the menu is pretty user-friendly if you can't decipher what you are craving. 

I highly suggest the pork egg rolls for the starter. I cheat on mom here because they are perfectly crispy and hot, best eaten wrapped in lettuce. I prefer the steak, meatball and/or shrimp pho depending on my mood. Rule of thumb, you should always sample the broth before you doctor it up. For me, I always need the spice level up a notch or two. I will say, they do add sugar to their soup base which is not traditional but helps if you put too much sriracha or chili sauce. Insider tip, mix a bit of hoisin, sriracha and the chili paste for a dipping sauce with your pho. I tend to put more chili and sriracha for extra heat. My second go to dish is the vermicelli noodle bowls, particularly the grilled pork. You get so much goodness in the veggies and an extra egg roll. The banh mi (referred to as french sandwiches on the menu) is decent. I haven't really tried the other specialty items since noodles are my focus.

Reading one of the previous reviews, I ordered the Siniyeh tahini... I have to say, I was pretty disappointed.

The Siniyeh itself was alright, but the beef patty seemed overcooked, but the creamy and overly heavy tahini sauce made up for that.

Seafood buffet's in their name - pretty good cooked seafood. Crab legs are there. Some sort of clam dish. Raw bar with oysters and mussels, some seaweed salads. Seafood featuring soups. All pretty good.
But their sushi is terrible. Their fish is really grainy, horrible texture and flavor. I mean, nothing sketch smelling or anything, but just bad quality fish.

1.) Fantastic ever changing dishes made with fresh ingredients which are more often than not local to Arizona (supporting our local farmers here is very important)

2.) The culinary menu is varied enough that seems to have food for the healthy, the carnivore, the vegetarian, the light or heavy eater. they also have one of the best kid's menus I have ever seen

3.) Their cocktail list seems to have a bit of a theme but varied enough that anyone who enjoys their libations can find something they'll like

4.) The wine list is awesome... they again support local vineyards here in Arizona and have a special HH dedicated to promoting them. as for the other varietals, they are varied from new world to old, from the common to the exotic and of course they make sure that there is a price range that anyone can afford

5.) An ambiance that makes you feel like your family member or close friend is right over that expo kitchen counter cooking just for you. The seating is openly arranged in a way that it is cozy but spacious as well. The use of wood almost everywhere can only be pulled off by certain types of places and this is one of them. Kudos to the designer

6.) Last but not least, the people that work here seem to be just the types of people I would hire myself. Knowledgeable, sincere, gracious, and hard working, the majority of this staff knows that they are not novices (reason I say most is because there is one server that is ""full of himself"" and it shows).

My grandmother is a vegetarian so it's my job to scout for the good veggie places and Zen had good reviews so I figured I'd give it a shot. My family ordered my fave from KC, the deep friend seaweed wrapped Enoki (E43 $14.99), Teriyaki Cutlet (E44), and a plated vegetarian noodle dish, bamboo soup, and imitation duck. Unfortunately I don't remember what the last 3 dishes are actually called so that's just my description of them :( 

E43 and E44 were good, but you will definitely want some tea and rice on the side because they were too salty for me. I think KC makes the enoki wraps better, and perfectly balanced. My cousin really enjoyed the Teriyaki Cutlet. Some of it was crispy on the outside, while some pieces were softer. The noodles were great and my favourite dish as it was well balanced salt wise, and had a variety of vegetables inside while maintaining the seasoning throughout. The soup was also a welcome dish. As for the duck imitation, my family loved it, but it was my least favourite dish because it was too sweet. 

Washrooms are single stall, very clean, and pretty accesible. Service was very attentive throughout our visit. To feed a family of 5, and for some unfinished takeout food that could feed 1 whole other person, our 5 dishes came to almost $80 after taxes.

Ever since it moved upstairs into the larger, but blander space, the food has gone down hill. I went in for lunch the other day since my friend who used to live here had chosen it for old time's sake. 

This lunch was actually within 12 hours of my late night visit to another pho joint just around the corner, so I opted for some snacks instead. The deep fried wontons were just that - way deep fried. It would've been nice if they were more crispy and less borderline chewy from all the oil. The shrimp salad rolls were trusty as they have always been. One thing that Xe Lua has always done well though, are their shakes. My first ever avocado shake proved to be super creamy with just the right hint of sweetness. 

My friend really enjoyed his ridiculously large bowl of pho. I generally don't have that much to complain about when I order pho either, but I did notice that the plate of bean sprouts and basil accoutrements were much less lively than the ones at the restaurant the previous evening.

I guess it was a busy lunch, but the large dining room is hardly ever less than half full, so I often wonder aloud why the service is so non-existent sometimes. We had to wait forever to even get a sheet to order with and basically gave up on getting our tea pot refilled. 

On this last visit, I also witnessed a pretty funny thing. When another patron wearing a red shirt was leaving the restaurant, he was mistaken for a server and was flagged down by a frustrated lady trying to pay her bill.

I don't know if she was new, or just didn't care, but man was she sloooooow. It took her almost 10 minutes to bring our drinks, and never offered us refills. Our food came in a good time frame, which was great.
After we finished eating, we sat and waited for 15 minutes for the waitress to clear our plates and give us our bill.

There were four of us on this sunny Saturday afternoon. We decided to visit Funk's. We were all hungry and knew we wanted an appetizer for sure. We started off with the Creamy Spinach & Artichoke Dip. We all felt the dip was a bit too runny and the serving size was a tad too small. 

On to the entree's! 

One family member had the Brie & Apple Burger, it was a   1/2 lb. steak patty with fig jam, apple matchsticks and a cider reduction on a Kaiser roll. He ordered it with a side of pub chips. At first he enjoyed the burger. He said later on that it made him feel queasy later that day. Maybe it was a combination of the ingredients that caused this? IDK... 

Another family member ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap Grilled chicken breast tossed in buffalo sauce, with chopped romaine, fresh pico de gallo, cheddar jack cheese and ranch or bleu cheese dressing. She chose the bleu cheese option and said the wrap was ""good."" 

I ordered the Southern BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, Spicy house-braised pork shoulder with provolone cheese and BBQ sauce on a grilled ciabatta bun. It was good... I have declared this the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. This beats Smoky Jon's #1 BBQ in Madison, or Bob's Bitchin' BBQ in Dodgeville.

""We have high standards for how we source our ingredients, choosing a proprietary blend of freshly ground, 100% all-natural Angus beef, which is served on a non-GMO Martin's Potato Roll and contains no hormones and no antibiotics. Our crinkle cut fries are made from Yukon potatoes that are free from the artificial ingredients that so many fries include. Likewise, our 16oz shakes are made with frozen custard that is spun daily at our Shacks. Our vanilla and chocolate recipes use only real sugar, no corn syrup, and milk from dairy farmers who pledge not to use artificial growth hormones.""

Jake also provided me a card so I came back for a second visit. The gluten free bun and burger were good, and the crinkle fries were crisp and hot. The lemonade was also delicious.

dxguSEVOtdir9Roqup18yw,hAi-sBBQF43tQqVMmEqVew,9T9A2gli0C539vI_zknuRw,3,2,0,0,"Sweet Note Desserts is a small dessert establishment offering milk bottle desserts, meringue melty, cupcakes, fresh butter cookies, and more. It's located in a rather busy plaza with a ton of restaurants and tea shops, so parking on the weekend might be a little difficult. A little after 8:30 pm, we entered the bright and cute establishment, and were greeted by the server. She was friendly, and told her that the soufflés take about 30 minutes to prepare. We per-ordered two and paid, and left our cellphone so she could call one of us when it was finished.

A majority of customers that Friday afternoon got their packaged desserts to go. However, there is a small sit-down dessert area where customers can enjoy their desserts and chat. Their sit-in dessert menu is rather limited but these desserts are freshly made upon order (soufflés and crème brûlée). I have a major sweet tooth so even on a full stomach of KBBQ meats; I still wanted to try out the soufflé.

Sweet Note Desserts offers two kinds of fresh soufflé; vanilla or chocolate. Additionally, you have a choice of one sauce from the following list: chocolate, raspberry, mango, strawberry, or guava sauces. Each order of soufflé is $8.75, which to me is a complete steal.

I opted for the chocolate soufflé + sauce ($8.75) - strawberry sauce. DISCLAIMER: mine got deflated because I was too busy trying to take a decent picture of my friend's item -___-"" So it wasn't because the dessert was poorly made; I just took a little bit longer than I expected. I enjoyed the soufflé as it was airy, and fluffy. Before mine was deflated; it looked visually appealing and it was quite large. I didn't think it was overly sweet, but I liked the balance of sweet and sour that the sauce itself added to the flavor.",2016-04-19 20:59:43

This location was a little disappointing but they still managed to put out a great product. The drive thru seemed to move at a steady pace but the inside was extremely slow compared to other locations I've frequented that were much busier. The inside of the restaurant was about 30% full so the wait time was ridiculous in my opinion I understand they make the burgers to order but 15 minutes for a double double was frustrating. The floors were in the process of being mopped by several employees and were slick and greasy the tables needed to be wiped down and the trash needed to be emptied after all it wasn't like they were trying to recover from the lunch crowd it was about 3:00 PM on a weekday.  

No manager in sight so no one was directing the employees or managing the operation. My next trip I will stop at the one off the strip at the bottom of the I-15 ramp off of Tropicana Drive ( I think that's the correct location of the great In-N-Out Burger).

I liked that everything in the salad seemed fresh. I got the optional Mad Spice added and I thought it went really well in this salad against the fruit in the salad. The chicken in the salad was pretty good but it seemed like something was missing. Maybe a few crunchy pieces of broccoli would have made the salad more interesting to me. It was an OK salad, nothing bad about it but just ok to me.

My husband had the Edgar Allen Poe Salad and I tasted one piece of beef. It was good beef that was prepared nice but it was cold. Cold beef in a chunk is unappetizing because of the texture of the cold fat in the beef to me.

I will be posting pictures soon from my last visit.

I make my appointments at her SW salon where she has a private salon room, I don't have to worry about a busy annoying salon with tons of people talking etc. It is peaceful and her full focus is on me.

I will never have anyone else color or cut my hair!

Bh6ou2fk0HUaCWCcGy0k0Q,bLNhF5cDTczxLi0ydufzqw,ft5LUuDwmS8ONnI7AooLjQ,4,3,1,2,"This location seems to be fairly new (if it's not on Yelp, it has to be new, right?) but it definitely didn't disappoint.

The first thing I noticed is that this place has a full bar. Having not been to the Bayview Ave location, I'm not sure if this out of the ordinary. Either way, there is whiskey, there is vodka, there is beer, there is ample opportunity for, ""Gimme choclit.. Choclit, b'nana 'nd freroche!"" And you know drunk people and anything that melts is always a good combination.

It was pretty crowded when I was here, but there was plenty of seating and there's a little patio out back for enjoying your dessert in the sun. I will say the line was insanely long, but with the Taste of Little Italy event going on, this was to be expected.

They serve three sizes, small, medium and large. Small will get you two flavours, medium is three and large is four. I say flavours because these are NOT scoops. If you go in here thinking, ""I don't know if I can handle three scoops of ice cream ... Maybe I should get a small?"" you will change your mind as soon as you see the little cups on the top of the counter. You probably get a half scoop per flavour, so the medium isn't that big at all.

Between the three of us we had blood orange, lemon, pistachio, Ferrero Rocher, coffee, Nutella, chocolate and coffee. 

-- The Nutella isn't as rich as you would think. They opted for a plain ice cream base with Nutella swirled through it, sort of like a rasberry ripple, so it's definitely easy going. 
-- The pistachio is actually their best selling flavour, along with chocolate, and it's insanely good. I say this as someone with an honest to God *problem* with nuts/peanuts in desserts. It toes the line, for sure, but it's on the right side of wrong, in my opinion. 
-- The blood orange and lemon were both refreshing and zesty. I would say the blood orange was nicer than the lemon, but really, they were equal.
-- It's hard to screw up chocolate, but they do have numerous different kinds (including sugar free), so if you want something specific, make sure to check out all the flavours they have. Similar to the way I order coffee at Starbucks, I just ordered ""chocolate"" and let the girl behind the counter figure it out for herself. It was rich and creamy but there was no compromising of the chocolatey flavour.
-- The Ferrero Rocher was similar to the Nutella, what with it being a chocolatey hazelnut affair. I can't really elaborate on that. It tasted like the fancy chocolates everyone but me seems to have a hard on for.

One thing I like about this place is that they have a dedicated cashier who just hands out 'small' 'medium' or 'large' receipts. Do not tell this man your flavours, he does not care. All he wants to know is if you're having a small, medium or large and whether you want it in a cup or a cone. It makes it feel more efficient, and it means the person scooping your ice cream isn't also handling money (hello, pet peeve! Want to go for a walk?). You just give the scooper your ticket once you've paid and tell her what flavours you want.

The scoopers are pretty happy too. They like to sing and dance in unison to the radio. It was pretty cute!",2011-06-20 01:12:24
pVNbBVEs8Ngo6NCO_tTXQA,iCMGR_a7BuFPqZBw-IPNiA,9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg,4,1,1,1,"Overall, my group had a positive experience at Scaddabush. Service was very friendly, thoughtful, and reasonably patient and attentive (we had a medium sized group which experienced difficulties coming to a consensus as to what to order; I also broke a plate, whoops). We ordered the buratta, a couple of sociables, a pizza, and pasta.

The buratta was lovely and I would say is a must-order; I only regret not ordering the bomba buratta which is its larger brother that comes in a spicy pepper/tomato sort of hash in a cast iron pan. The calamari and polenta tots were good, and satisfied my craving for fried food. The bruschetta wasn't terrible and was actually attractively plated--- however, I found the balsamic glaze a little too much, and overwhelming the other flavours I expected of the other toppings on a bruschetta. The same could be said for the diavolo pizza, which I expected more heat from (at least that's what I thought it should be for something named after the devil)---the crust was acceptable.

Special mention to our waitress who without being asked, tried to split two of regular-serving pastas into two plates apiece (we tried to arrange the bill splitting when we ordered); in hindsight this made our lives more difficult as we decided after the fact that we would split all our pastas four ways, whoops again. We shared pesto pollo, shrimp spaghetti, fettucine capri, and lobster spaghetti. All were memorably delicious except perhaps the lobster spaghetti for which I would not order again; the lingering fishy undertaste, to me, indicates it was no longer fresh. The noodle itself had an acceptable bite to it (but then again, I'm rather indifferent to al dente pasta). Would love to try the spaghetti with stuffed meatball with Sunday sauce, the bolognese, and the ravioli the next time I visit.",2017-03-23 11:28:09

We did have two appetizers, the lettuce wraps, which were better than PF Changs (and I love those), and the guacammus. I eat hummus all the time, and this was good, but the lettuce wraps won. 

My wife had the chimichanga, which was a lot of tasty food. However, one of us in our party had the blue corn enchiladas, which might have been the favorite of the group. However, I had the pork chile verde enchiladas, which I claim was the best during our four person taste testing. We did sample the pork verde mac and cheese, which was tasty if you like mac and cheese, which I don't. 

Even though we were stuffed after licking our plates clean, we indulged in the peach cobbler (yes, don't even hesitate, just order it, you will not be sorry). The daughter and her hubby had the empanadas, which they loved! My taste buds definitely favored the peach cobbler, however.

The vegetarian tamales were almost like a rite of passage through every farmer's market we've been at - Ahwatukee, Downtown Phoenix, Chandler & Gilbert. They have always been masa-heavy but the salt and spice in the masa is just right that the flavors come off well. 

But since 2008, we feel like the size and quality have been going downhill. Today we bought half dozen, and four of them were incredibly dry and crumbly, and the other two were not because they were cheese-based. The outside looked like they had been sitting open for days, so there was a dried out layer that I mistook for husk. Also, we bought some frozen to take home after a long time, but I just noticed ""natural flavors"" in the ingredient list. Not quite the small home-style vendor anymore, eh?

 For an out of the ordinary thrilling meal this is it! BUT only if you ignore the service (if you have the same server we had) and the Americanized menus and ONLY order from the Black menu. (other wise this is 2 stars the food is that different)

 You might not get offered the black menu and you have to ask for it or pick one up as we did. We were slightly offended by this,maybe they do this with good intentions but it isn't right to offer some guest certain dishes,you just don't do this in business  and if my companion was doing the Yelp he'd only give one star for that reason. One menu with an Americanized page(s) would be right.

 We ordered the Szechwan beef, from one menu (Americanized) ,spicy cucumbers and water boiled fish from the Black Menu. We received water we were going to order beverages but our server dashed away. 

We received the cucumbers and (Americanized) Szechwan beef platter that were dropped off by our server running as fast as the Bugs Bunny Road Runner almost splashing at us with a big thuds on the table and jerky movements reminiscent of WW2 Nazis.

The Americanized Szechwan beef was just OK , and not as tasty as others we had before but not bad, but not so great lacking seasoning and taste.

The spicy cucumbers (black menu) were special, first bite I thought slightly oily but tasty and so crisp and then you have to just keep eating them like pistachios.

Maybe 10 minutes latter she  (the WB Roadrunner Nazi)  dumped water boiled chicken INSTEAD of the water boiled fish I ordered.  (I didn't complain since it was the same dish but chicken)The dish sounds bland but was extraordinary in taste that smacks you with an ILLEGAL DRUG LIKE EFFECT were each bite gets better and better and you have to keep eating it. The water boiled chicken came piping hot in a well made seasoned stock with napa cabbage. Oil and the right amount of  Szechwan peppercorns float on the top of this large enough for two meal,it was addictive and delicious ,not a building hot spice but completely different . My companion had to eat half along with me after he ate his plate. (the water boiled chicken really was that good) and I think it only cost $9 and also came with a big pot of rice.

As soon as we finished the check was dropped off and plates were NOT cleared.

IF you order from black menu I feel this place is a Gem of Phoenix! (food only not service)",2011-11-15 13:11:30

As mentioned by several people, they do add an automatic 20% tip to your total which I was fine with.  Also, when you call they do let you know that you should show up at least 1/2 and hour before your scheduled appointment time to get set up in the locker room.

I was waffling between the Cosmopolitan spa or the Mandarin Oriental spa for my birthday but I decided on the Sahra when I saw they had the bathing rituals.  I tried the Red Flower Bathing Ritual which included a scrub, a soak in the personal bubble jetted tub in the room, and then lotion application.  This was 50 minutes but there was also an option for 80 minutes that included a massage which I did not try. It was very relaxing and everything smelled wonderful.  They do scrub and lotion your midsection but I'm sure they would skip it if this was an issue with you.  

The only complaint I have about this is that the tub could have been much warmer.  They run the water while you're getting scrubbed and it was alright temperature wise when I got in it but when she turned on the jets it cooled down quickly and felt like cold water from the jets.  It was a little too late to say anything because the tub would have had to have been drained some to add more hot water.  While still plenty relaxing, if you like a hot soak then make sure to mention it when you get into the room.

As has been mentioned in reviews the spa facility itself is small.  Not Rio Spa small but probably a little smaller than Red Rock.  The hair and make-up room was off the locker room which was just a little past the attendant desk.  Then the restrooms, showers, and waiting room were along the hall to the main spa area that included some loungers, a large single hot tub (which was a great temperature) and then the dry sauna, steam room, and a cool mist room.  While nice and clean I was about done with trying everything in about 45 minutes.  I then had some tea and waited for my service.  While you have access the entire day, I did not stick around after my service.  It is clothing optional which was good since I did not see a spinner for bathing suits so you would need to make sure to bring a bag for your wet suit if you wear one.

To sum up, I'll probably be back for services and to try the Hammam but this is not a ""get a spa pass for the day"" type of spa like Caesar's spa.",2015-03-15 19:49:38

I'm a bit overdue in writing this review, but I still have fond memories of the fun evenings and happy hours spent here and couldn't keep this to myself any longer. 

One of the great things about Kelly's is that they have happy hour EVERYDAY! Monday to Saturday from 3-7pm and ALL DAY Sunday you can enjoy 50% off appetizers, $4 drafts/wine/well drinks, and $4 off signature cocktails. 

The appetizers at Kelly's are delicious and the happy hour menu offers a number of great drink options! 

Our favorite appetizers are the Haloumi Stuffed Cherry Peppers ($4, HH) and Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($5, HH). These are so good we ordered them every time we came! Definitely recommend trying these two dishes, especially at the happy hour price you can't go wrong! 

For heartier appetites, I recommend the Short Rib Tacos - very tasty and great value at $6 during HH! And of course, Kelly's Original Four-Cut Burger ($14) is not to be missed for dinner. My friend raves about the perfect combination of short-rib, sirloin, chuck, and brisket, served with onion relish and Comté cheese. Try it and see what you've been missing!  

The bartenders have a heavy hand - good news! Except if you like a sweeter drink (like me) take note! My Old Fashioned ($8, HH) was so strong I had to ""water it down"" with club soda.

My husband and a few friends used to come to this place every week on Tuesday night for Trivia. Every night, we would order food and at least one of us would drink.

Recently, we showed up for our normal trivia night and upon asking what I wanted to drink I said water. It was cinco de mayo and I was probably going to have a drink, but hadn't made a choice yet. The waitress then told me that they are only serving bottled water after five now.

WHAT? YOU WON'T SERVE ME WATER?

I didn't get irritated at the waitress, she didn't make the rules we just wanted to talk to the manager.

While waiting for the manager another tabled ordered water and were told the same thing. They also wanted to speak with the manager.The manager visited their table first and we listened in. After talking with them for a bit he said, ""Well one of your party has ordered 3 margaritas, it's ok for you to get water. From now on whenever you guys come in you can have water.""

The manager then finished his conversation and came to visit us. He talked with us about how he didn't like people coming to trivia and just ordering water. (That is completely understandable) However, when I told him the situation of us being frequent visitors and that we always ordered food, he didn't seem to care. He asked if we were sitting in the same area last week and I replied yes. He then mentioned how he noticed we were drinking water and said this is a bar, you can't order food and get free water.

Later that night, my fiancee had the... ahem, the runs... which then continued the next couple of days along with the cramps. I should have realized that something like this was going to happen cause at the end of the meal I went to use the bathroom, and I was appalled at the conditions.

The woman who did my nails was distracted the entire time. When it came to my pedicure paint and my nails being filed, each nail was different and the paint was not cleaned up after so the polish was either lacking on the sides or was on the cuticle.

When it came to my manicure, before we sat down I had explained to her that I had gel on my nails. When we sat down, she started by trying to use basic nail polish remover and then was shocked that it was gel First example of the fact that she had no idea what was going on. From there, she attempted to rush taking off the gel, scraping it after only seconds in the foil and cotton. When it started lifting she got most of it off, key word: most. She proceeded to start cleaning my cuticles and I figured she would clean the rest of the left over polish in a few moments, which never happened. As she was cleaning my cuticles she was very distracted by a co-worker counting her tip money and cut the side of my finger, which a few days later started to become infected. After she used a cleanser on it, which took her more than an appropriate time after I had mentioned it was bleedingbleeding, but she tried to say it was residue from the gel polish she unsuccessfully cleared from my nails.

From there the bleeding stopped and she finished my nails, putting polish over the left over gel polish and I was left with specks under my polish so the coat looked terrible.

I will obviously not be going back, because after ALL of that, I ended up being over charged $5 when my card was taken while I was waiting for my nails to dry in front of an out dated fan. After a long week of work and wanting a relaxing and pampering time this three me through an awful loop. I hope it never happens to someone else.",2016-07-03 01:48:35

The moment I walked into this place, I knew it would be authentic... I was the only white guy there!  I ordered the Rad Na (Lad Na), and the green curry fried rice.  The Rad Na gravy was a little more bland than I am used to, but the taste of the wide noodles made up for it.  They were yummy with lots of flavor for noodles!  Also, the freshness of the Chinese Broccoli was 5 stars, and this definitely made up for the average gravy sauce.  

The green curry fried rice was not greasy, but it was a little dry.  Still, the curry flavor was very good, and I would recommend it to those who like spicy Thai food.

I will definitely be coming back to this Thai place.  I want to try their curries and see if they can compare to some of the authentic, delicious Thai curries I have been lucky enough to taste.

DAMN. TIME. the salesguy is all ""Oh, we JUST sold that one, but here's this other much $nicer$ car/bike/boat/taun-taun""?

I had pinged Western about a new 2015 CB500FA, looking at the previous model year because it had a sweet discount. John Lloyd immediately got back to me to come in and check it out. When I got there, I didn't see it; I did, however, see a couple of non-ABS bikes. John checked further and admitted that he'd screwed up, it wasn't ready. But if I wanted to try a less expensive non-ABS bike, he'd cut me a deal - exactly the opposite of the usual car/bike/boat/taun-taun shysters. ABS has saved my arse a few times and was on my gotta-have list, so I turned him down. After a bit of back and forth, he mentioned the 2016 CB500FA. The OTD price that I had figured for the 2016 was right at the top of my budget (hey, I'm cheap - you ride a BMW for two years and you soon learn to pinch pennies), but John came through with a fantastic deal on it for me. None of this ""Weeellll, let me run this by the boss and see what he says"" bullshit, just ""Here's what I can do for you to make up for our mistake."" Negotiations took, IIRC, 15 minutes. Seriously.

USAA had already approved my loan, so all we had to do was write up the purchase order and call them. We nailed down the last few items, USAA overnighted the check, and the next morning I had my shiny new precious with the shock preload set to my specs and everything just perfect.

So on a Saturday morning, he snuck away to Priory Fine Pastries and surprised me later that day with a sampling of goodies. I had never had anything from this bakery before, so I was excited to try it. He bought me a burnt almond torte cupcake and a vanilla thumbprint cookie to try (plus a chocolate thumbprint and lady lock for himself). Apparently when my husband was at the bakery, the baker decorated a burnt almond torte cupcake specifically for him, as they didn't have any in the case yet (it was early in the morning). And let me tell you...it was one of the freshest, tastiest cupcakes I've ever had. I hate to say it, because Prantl's is my everything, but I *think* I might have actually liked Priory's burnt almond torte cupcake better?! Priory's frosting is a touch airier than Prantl's (but still sweet), which I think I have a slight preference for. The vanilla thumbprint cookie was also super fresh and had the perfect consistency (soft but still retaining a bit of shortbread-like bite). Although lady locks typically aren't one of my favorite bakery items, I stole a bite of my husband's and thought it was delicious...it had a nicely crisp shell and a creamy filling that wasn't too sweet. 

Overall, my husband's mission to cheer me up was a rousing success...not only did the influx of sugary carbs make me happy, but I've discovered a new spot for securing fresh, tasty baked goods (not that I need ANOTHER bakery to be addicted to, but what can you do?) :)",2017-03-13 19:23:46

We have been planning on purchasing a washer and dryer online and have it delivered. I just had a few questions and I also wanted to ensure I had the correct plug for our outlet. So I took a pic of the outlet with my phone and made my way over.

I was quickly approached by a salesman in the appliance section and asked him which wire I would need. He said I'd need a three-pronged cord and showed me where they were. I grabbed it and then looked at the pic on my phone and saw that it didn't match up. So another employee approached me and I showed him the cord and the picture. He didn't know, and he found the first employee who helped me and asked him, and he was perplexed. This second employee then took me around to three other employees in an attempt to answer my question. By the time we reached the fifth employee in the electrical section, our party had grown from two to four, as each employee who didn't know the answer joined up so they could learn. The electrical guy was able to answer my question, and I left with what I had come for. To make my trip complete, after I had paid at the self-checkout a cashier nearby gave me the same comical ""farewell message"" that the register did, in the exact tone. I got a kick out of that for some reason.

The reason I wanted to bring this up is because of the overall friendliness of the employees and their genuine concern that I got the help I needed. If I had gone to any other store I doubt I would have gotten similar attention unless I tracked down every employee I could find and explained my problem over and over again.

Shrimp alfredo linguine (very yummy because the alfredo sauce was very rich)
Key lime pie (yum)

I was stuffed halfway through the linguine, but needed to make room for dessert. Needless to say I was uncomfortably full.

For endless shrimp, I tried 4 options: garlic, garlic and cheese, teriyaki, and breaded. The best was the teriyaki. On reordering, we asked to skip the rice that comes with the teriyaki. Although you probably can consume more by only ordering the garlic, I thought it was too garlicky. The breaded shrimp was also tasty. Skip the shrimp linguine, since the carbs will make you full.

Some of us have grad school finals to study for, unlike you, who could go somewhere else to look cool with your skinny jeans and beanies. 

I digress. the Mr and I left and drove up central, looking for a nice DT phx alternative to Sbux. And we saw Lola. True, the evening/weekday hours may suck (7pm - btw, most OC coffee shops close at that time OR EARLIER!!!!), but on that Saturday afternoon, Lola was EXACTLY what I needed. And since I was only in town for the weekend, those hours don't really bother me much.

Huge and roomy, tons of cool seating options and tables, plugs for those of you that need your laptops, and *freeeee* WI-FI, Lola is truly a MUCH BETTER study option. I decided to forgo my usual: small Soy Hazelnut Latte *gasp!*, and ordered one of their specials, the Matador. I can't even remember exactly what this is, but something like a mocha with cinnamon or some magic dust? I dunno, but this sucker was goooooood. A little sweet, but I would do it again. The baristas gave me a tip - bc it is sweet, it's actually better to get a small, since they add in less cream/flavor, versus the larger sizes. I know that sounds common sense, but I guess they don't upgrade sizes proportionally? Whatevs, it was gooooood.

And the whipped cream? OH MY. I usually turn down whipped cream without a blink of an eye, but those sneaky little baristas conned me into getting it with the whipped cream. i caved, after they offered to make me a little espresso cup of cream, since it was that good. WHICH IT WAS. I know they infuse some espresso in it, and something else - again, perhaps that magical crack dust? Do yourself a favor and get your drink with the whipped cream. Pretend it is fat free.

And honestly, I thought the service here was MUCH muuuuuuch better than at Lux (maybe my jeans weren't skinny enough?) and most other coffee shops that I've been to (and I have been to quite a few, believe me. it's almost a hobby). The baristas were super friendly, taking the time to explain the drinks to me, seduce me into trying the whipped cream, etc. If I were to move back to Phx, this would be one of my go-to study spots, for sure.

I had actually been in the mood for Indian food that day, so a Curried Fish Taco sounded like just the thing.  WRONG!

All while the rest of us were getting our rice and side dishes, you hear my dad muttering to himself (outloud) ""We da hawaiians and we HUNGRY!"" -ya a bit restructured from The Klumps, however our family is pretty big...so you get the picture? lol. That grill was going with kalbi, pork belly, beef tongue, gochujang chicken, bulgogi...oh the list goes on. 

Now my personal faves here in the beef tongue, pork belly, kimchi, the fruits and the japchae(stir fry glass noodles). If you are in the mood for a drink, pair up your BBQ with some Soju. 

The staff is attentive most of the time but sometimes you have to get their attention for some drink re-fills. However they were on their game when it came time to switch out the grill. 

Overall it was a great first time experience and frequent here with family and friends when i get the chance.",2010-07-28 11:57:44

This past trip my brother and I finally broke down and decided to give this place a try. This might be because we'd really built up our expectations, but the end feeling we were both left with was, ""Huh - well that was good, but really nothing special.""

We were seated promptly upon arrival and greeted by a very friendly and helpful waitress. She introduced us to the menu, talked about their different cuts, and took drink orders. While sipping on our manhattans, we placed our meal orders, both ordering the same thing - clam chowder, their signature NY strip, and the garlic mashed potatoes.

The clam chowder was spectacular. Thick, creamy, chunky. The mashed potatoes were good, but a bit too whipped for my liking. The steak - the signature wet and dry aged steak - was, well, tough and not all that flavorful. The waitress did recommend the ribeye (saying it was her favorite), and hindsight being what it is I'm thinking we should have listened to her.

There are many better places in Vegas than this one, including one of my favorites (Mon Ami Gabi). The place is decent, but for the price you can do much better elsewhere.",2009-12-04 17:37:38

It took him forever to sit us at the table even though we were willing to go to the bar ( that was strongly discouraged), so we were wandering around the place in a scattered pattern of a lost herd of hungry cows for ten minutes at least.
After our server learned that only one of us will be eating and the rest will only have drinks, he completely lost interest in our group and vanished. Literally fell out of this planet having promised us all kinds of good things like an ashtray, drinks and food. 
Then he came back with a poison - the worst Moscow mule I ever had in my life. And I would have loved to send it back but alas, he said :"" I'll be right back"", and disappeared again like April sun in Cleveland.
 By the time an ashtray arrived, my friend finished two cigarettes (she had it instead of the appetizer) and I gulped the remainder of my drink that tasted like Lysol. 
As a person who actually recommended the place to my friends, I felt incredibly guilty. I generously tipped the waiter hoping that my five bucks will be a downpayment for never seeing him again in case I ever decide to come back.",2012-04-17 06:47:18
QXgyfYhZWomQ-wlATU3sew,FRvKvr1-AsUaCBuxaoxnCg,ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg,4,0,0,0,"We mosied on into Copper for restaurant week. I've heard great things about Copper but had never tried it, and while I like Indian food, it's not something I normally gravitate towards, so without the Queen's feast encouragement, I'm not sure we would have gone, which would have been tragic!

Every person was a great representation of the restaurant - friendly and a pleasure to interact with. We were in an extreme rush, and they were very understanding with providing to-go boxes and trying to expedite service.

I started with the Cabbage-Black Beab-Asparagus ""Tikki-Chole"" - sort of like a bean burger. It was a good combination of flavors. 

Next, I had the cod-bay scallop ""caldin"" - this was like a coconut curry soup with onions, snap peas, grapes, and baby scallops. This was delicious! I love coconut anything so it wasn't a surprise that I would order and love this dish. The scallops were a great accompaniment to the curry, and the side of rice gave a nice starch to help soak up all the flavor. 

I wasn't crazy about the desserts - maybe because they weren't super sweet like I usually gravitate towards. I had the cacoa-chili kulfi, which I would describe as a mixture between ice cream and sorbet. It wasn't super creamy like ice cream, but had the texture of sorbet. It was more of a nice way to cleanse the palate, moreso than offer a sweet dessert. Not my thing, but it was one of only two options during Rest Week. My husband had the Tandoori T bone lamb with red wine mushrooms and Indian curry sauce. IT WAS SO GOOD! We ate every last piece around the bone, not wanting to waste a single bite. The manager shared that they were thinking about replacing the lamb chops with this T bone option. I don't think they could go wrong because it was so tender and flavorful. He mentioned they marinade it for 24 hours before cooking it. YUM!

I'm so glad I took the opportunity to try Copper during restaurant week. I would definitely recommend it to those who are more verse in Indian food and enjoy the flavor and spice combination. Beautiful atmosphere, in an older house too. It's so intimate and romantic, especially if you grab a seat by the fire with a bottle of wine.",2016-01-28 14:10:33

I am on West 25th Street a lot, but I had never been to SOHO until last night when I came with my parents, and I was absolutely blown away by my dinner.

When I came in, I was struck by the energetic and modern ambience. The restaurant was dimly lit, with exposed-brick and dark walls, and cool bluesy music playing. There was a diverse cliental seated around, from hipsters to a group of women on a bachelorette party to older, well-to-do looking people. 

After we had placed our orders, three beautifully puffy, warm biscuits arrived at our table with rosemary butter and apple jam. I am a sucker for a good, buttery biscuit, and these were great! They set a good tone for the meal, since they was the first of many tasty treats to come.

To start, we shared a special New Orleans style shrimp which came atop a piece of grilled bread. The shrimp had a smoky, flavorfully spiced sauce which the bread soaked up! I ordered the duck Gumbo soup, which thick consistency and was deeply rich and well-spiced.

As a main course, I got the Sweet Potato dumplings. These dumplings made me think of the most perfectly prepared, oversized sweet potato gnocchi. They were lightly grilled on the outside and the insides were soft, smooth, and velvety. They were tossed with cranberries, caramelized onions, spinach, soft cheese, and goat cheese in a maple-brown butter sauce, which was the slightest bit sweet and played well with the savoriness of the butter.

My father ordered the fried chicken ""mornin' style,"" which came atop rosemary waffles with maple syrup on the side. This dish was fantastic. The fried chicken was delicious and not at all greasy. The savoriness of the chicken is offset by the sweetness of the maple syrup. But unexpectedly, it was the waffles that stole the show! They were pillowy soft and the rosemary and a beautiful savory, aromatic flavor. I think this was a fabulous, unexpected spin on waffles! I think I am going to copy when I make my own!

My mother ordered the shrimp and grits, and this was again a great dish. The mellow sweetness of the corn in the grits when well with the perfectly cooked shrimp and the sausage.

For dessert, we ordered the pecan pie as per our server's recommendation. Some pecan pies are way to sweet and can get a gelatinous texture, but this pecan pie was amazing. It was not at all too sweet, had a delicious buttery crust, and came with a generous scoop of bourbon ice cream.

This is rare for me to say, but all our dishes were flawless and were well-composed in terms of the balances of flavors and textures. I know I will be raving about SOHO to my friends, and I will definitely be coming back here soon!",2013-11-10 08:33:15

I went with several friends and upon entry (valet parking is available) I saw that it was two floors, sadly I didn't get to see upstairs, but there is supposed to be a full bar and more tables. I sat downstairs right next to the huge salad bar which had so many selections I wasn't sure if I should have ate more or less. But, to counteract the amount of meat I was going to be eating I ate a plate of salad mixed with a little of everything they offered at the bar. Which had a very decorative overhead, made of wood boards that dangled from the ceiling and lights from them.

There was so many things I ate that I didn't know the name of lets just say that the majority were good. I did however enjoy their soup, which was sort of a squash or pumpkin bisque. It was creamy and it melted in your mouth. Users could add parmesan and I believe chives on the soup which made it even more delicious. It kind of reminded me of the lobster bisque i had out in San Francisco.

Next, I ventured into the meats and the main course. I flipped my token to say ""More, please"" and immediately servers came rushing to my side offering things from Chicken wrapped in bacon to parmesan encrusted pork. I believe I tried everything they offered except the sausages. The waiters were very friendly, however I did feel a little rushed because of their energy of serving you and making your dining experience one of a kind. They did however make a lasting expression on me as well as the quality of the meats that were presented.

The steaks, you would just ask what kind of cut you would like and they would slice you a piece. The steak had all sorts of cuts (well done, medium, medium rare, and I didn't order rare but I'm pretty sure they could have found it). While they were cutting it, you would take the prongs they provided and take it from them and put it on your plate. Note, a bottle of wine goes a long  way with eating all these meats, preferably of course red wine. For me, we drank a bottle of pinot noir to wash down all these delicious meats.

Once I had my share fair of meats, I definitely saved a little space for a nice dessert. I ordered the Fruit Passion with Chocolate Mousse. The mousse was in a rack that was heated by a candle so the chocolate was warm. Take a little of the fruit passion and mix it in the chocolate mousse and you get a sweetness that is hard to explain. I kind of felt that the passion actually had some kind of carbonation in it, but I can't be certain.

Overall, this was a wonderful restaurant and an experience in Charlotte when others come here around the surrounding area to try something new. I highly recommend it if you like meats and a good time.",2012-01-27 18:22:20

Pizzas looked good, ready to go, and we were hungry so this was our first choice. My friends and I each got different slices of pizza. I got the special (prosciutto, onions, spinach and cauliflower) while my friends got cheese and the other, pepperoni. The slices vary in size.... DRAMATICALLY. My slice was the equivalent to two of theirs.. and for the same price. The customer in front of us was complaining about the size differences too. And there was another girl behind us that got two slices of cheese.. and one was definitely bigger than the other. They need to fix the way they cut those slices because it isn't very fair for someone to pay the same price for a much smaller slice. 

The pizza itself was pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of thin slice but it was good. The special pizza I got had a good amount of toppings. No complaints on taste! 

The staff was friendly. My friends originally wanted to order some beers but the girl taking their order warned them that each bottle was $21 before she rang them up. I'm glad she did because that is way too expensive IMO. She asked if it was okay and they opted not to get it. That was great because I know most places wont even tell you.

the food was latin flair...chips/salsa, street tacos, burritos. all very tasty and moderately priced. their happy hour deals looked great.

the music venue is just off the restaurant. it's a great little space, mostly standing room. if you get there early, you can snag one of the wooden bleacher seats. there is a full bar in the music venue, along with restrooms. the sound quality was pretty good i thought, but since it's a small area, i highly recommend earplugs (i'm over 40 and that tip was for all the youngsters out there).",2014-04-12 13:00:21

I didn't really like having to sit at a large shared table, some places do that and I don't care for it. I prefer my own table or booth, but considering how busy it was I didn't find it necessary to complain.  The menu was unique, a lot of seemingly authentic Mexican offerings.  A welcome change from the average menu of every Mexican place in a 50 mile radius (wet burritos, grande burrito, chicken quesadilla.....you get the idea.)

The price was fair and the portions were on the large side.  I'll always have a spot in my heart for the classic Mexican joint (can't go wrong with a Grande Burrito) but Casa Reyna will be my spot when I want something a bit more interesting.",2016-04-06 02:49:15

I couldn't watch the live show, so I don't know if the music is good or not. There were plenty of seatings on a saturday night.

We joked wondering if the server even worked there or if it was just some guy that was messing with us. Long story short I have never waited more then 10 min for water, and don't like to wait very long for my beer especially when it was this slow.

The table was well-set and the decor on the inside was under-stated and neat.  I liked it fine, and there seemed to be a lot of space, unlike other restaurants where you feel like you're crowded into other people's tables.  

The servers were always well-dressed (especially the ladies..  All of M's ladies are very well-dressed, aren't they?).  Our main waiter was good, as well, and refilled the water glasses as quickly as we could drink them, and poured wine for us as well.  Very impressive was the tray of different kinds of breads, which a nice female server gave to each of us.  After sampling most of them, I liked the green olive and the sourdough the best.  

The menu was actually quite affordable, ranging in price from $20 to $40 per plate, depending on what you ordered.  I myself had the lobster with shaved truffles and corn, and it was excellent.  The lobster was fresh and just the right (non-rubbery) consistency, and the accompanying sauce was amazing.  I almost wanted to drench everything in it, but thought better of it.  The lobster was pretty much the whole lobster, but the claws were missing...  Apparently they use the claw meat mainly for the lobster risotto, which someone else at the table got, and was stuffed full of lobster claw meat.  I had a taste of the lasagna as well, which was good, but not as good as my lobster, of course.  I did not sample the wine, but something i thought was odd was that they don't automatically provide lime with their Pellegrino...  I thought that was understood already, but I guess some people do like it without....  

Someone had a birthday with us, so they gave us a free dessert tiramisu, which is to die for, and plenty to share with 3 or 4 (not too greedy) people.  They even gave us a candle, which is a nice touch.

It's a country bar...not a hip hop club. I guess that's why the dance floor is not crowded, because not to many people their can country dance. The drink prices are pretty insane, I think it was $9 for a tall blue moon eek!

Finally got to try this spot out and ordered the following:

Poppy Fries with Kim ""cheese"" sauce - I ordered this because I thought the Kim ""cheese"" sauce would add some bold, Korean flavors.  What I got were cold, soggy fries with Jalapeno-flavored Cheez Whiz.  No kim chee flavor, not really even any cheese flavor, just....salty.  Also, as wrong as this sounds, I'd probably choose regular Cheez Whiz over Poppy Den's version.  

Fish Fritters -  Essentially, one small step up from Gordon's fish sticks.  The only highlight to this dish is the sauce....which tasted like thousand island dressing doused in dill.  It was a very dim highlight.  The presentation was also terrible.  Little fried balls just chilin' in a bowl of dressing. Pass on this, for the love of god.
  
The Crispy Pork Dumplings - Essentially extra thick fried wontons.  This was such a lame dish it actually pissed me off.  I paid $11 dollars for something I could get in the freezer section at Smith's .  Actually, that's an insult to freezer-section dumplings.  These dumplings lack any redeeming quality - boring flavors, no creativity, forgettable all around.  At this point in the meal, I was ready to peace out.

I was greeted pretty promptly and handed some menus. They have a separate vegan menu, so this made me really excited. I ordered the papaya salad, the avocado curry, and basil fried rice at a number 8 spice to go. Everything came out delicious. I've never had an avocado curry before and It was really interesting.

Luckily, it wasn't very busy when we arrived and were able to order immediately. The process is simple and even for a first-timer, it wasn't intimidating.

I opted for the Try 2 Combo ($8.79) with a sandwich and half bowl of soup.

California Turkey Sandwich: Turkey, avocado, tomato, sprouts, cucumber, mixed greens, Muenster cheese, and housemade sun-dried tomato herb spread. The ciabatta bread was nice and soft. I really like all the ingredients of this sandwich, but it lacked the salt to bring out its flavors.

Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup: Cauliflower, cheddar, and pepperjack. This is a wonderful option for a soup with a creamy feel without all the guilt! The amount of cheese isn't overwhelming and although you don't get that super smooth chowder-like feel, it still tastes great. It wouldn't be my favorite soup, but I love that it's low-carb.

With every meal, you receive a piece of bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry. It makes the price even sweeter. Both accompaniments are decent.

Food/Drink:  Had nachos, a couple specialty cocktails, and a fried ice cream.  The nachos were plentiful with a nice blend of toppings.  I didn't necessarily love all the cheeses in their blend, but it was good.  They sprinkle on cojita cheese which should be mandatory for all nachos.   I had a alcoholic version of an Arnold Palmer which had fresh mint, which was refreshing, along with a new berry based drink which was also great.  The topper was the fried ice cream.

My wife and I shared two entrees...a bacon cheeseburger and the chicken (two ways) paprikash.  Truly this is one great burger with a TON of flavor and an excellent bun.  The burger had fries served on the side, which had been tossed in a herb mixture that rocked.  The chicken paprikash was tasty, but (as mentioned above) the best part was dipping the pretzel breadsticks into the sauce...delicious!

The menu was extensive and everything sounded delicious. I saw food that looked really good being served to other tables.

Unfortunately the food was not as good as it looked and certainly not as good as the restaurants interior would have you believe.

I got a taco and enchilada combo, the taco shell was a generic hard shell like those found at Taco Bell, the chicken inside ( I Kid you not) was the exact same chicken used at Taco Delmar  and the meaty enchilada sauce well, it must have been by  Hormel.

Everything had a different kind of peppery tasting spice that did not work well competing against each other.

Either way, I was looking for both of those things. 

Now, they do have a lunch menu, it is on the back of the menu. BUT if I took a little bit more time I would have realized that they actually have TWO lunch menus. Kind of confusing since they are in different places on the menu but still it is good to know for my next trip here. 

I ordered the Chicken Mee Siam. I initially ordered it to be a spicy level 3, but at the waiter told me I had to bump that up. He said that their spicy levels are not as bad and a 3 is really a 5. I was apprehensive, but ordered the 5, and he was right, it was about the level that I wanted it to be. Thank you waiter man for that! Total price was around $8.50. The portions were large, I put half in the fridge for tomorrow, and there was a lot of chicken in the dish. Sometimes for lunch they skimp on the meat, not this time. I was impressed. 

I would have liked to get a drink for the price, not just the meal, but you can't win them all.

The restaurant was quiet for a Saturday evening with less than 10 diners the entire time we were there. Though clean and modern, the restaurant was sparsely decorated. Our waitress was very attentive and did a great job of explaining several dishes as we are not very familiar with Korean food.

The meal started with a little sampling of tasty treats, including kimchi, bean sprouts, and cucumbers. We ordered the Sweet Potato Tempura which was incredible! I was almost tempted to order a second portion of the appetizer it was so delicious. Finally, I had the Sweet and Sour Chicken. Though good, it was not exactly what I was anticipating.

In fact, it was the first ""nice"" meal I had in Pittsburgh, before I even made my official move...I celebrated my 21st birthday here! Although it's not one of my very very favorite spots in the 'burgh, the food is consistently good and the Carribean-inspired fare is something that I normally wouldn't gravitate toward, so it's nice when I want something a bit different than the standard ""New American.""

I mostly come here for their brunch, and one of the big reasons is that it's served until 3pm! The only thing is, make sure you show up at least 15 minutes before that...the ""brunch kitchen"" closes at 3 o'clock sharp, unlike sister restaurant Casbah, which seats for brunch until 2pm but won't rush your ordering. Anyway...my favorite thing on the brunch menu is the roasted pork benedict with grilled pineapple. The Chilaquiles (basically, breakfast nachos) are also delicious, weird as they may sound. And the Kaya Burger is always a safe choice.

The dinner menu changes, so I've never ordered the same thing twice here. But everything I have had has been great. One of my favorite apps is the corn and lentil beignets--if you like spicy, get them! They also have a pretty large and super fun (read: girly) cocktail menu, and since they are tropical in nature, it's totally okay to imbibe at any time of the day! That's how that works, right?

You really can't go wrong with a place that lets you choose your own ingredients and have the chefs build the salad in front of you - this is typically the way I go, adding nuts, blue cheese crumbles, avocados and lots more. You top it with your choice of protein, which I usually just go chicken or salmon. Extra tip, have them do the protein with pesto - brings the flavor to another level! And your salad comes with a cheesy crostana... mmmmm.... 

If you are feeling lazy, they have a pre-fix menu as well - just decide which of the salads they have listed and they will whip it up for you. 

The beverage and side choices are minimal but the salads are entree sized so I typically just go when I am looking for a healthy, tasty salad.

The food: I ordered a breakfast combination of two eggs, bacon, grits, toast, and a short stack of pancakes. I asked for the eggs to be over medium and they were perfect. They asked if I wanted cheese grits instead of regular grits and I said yes: they were amazing! Just as good as New Orleans! They also asked if I wanted to have any fruit added to my pancakes so we added blueberries...These additions were at no additional charge. The toast is made with very good bread, whole-wheat, and fresh. The bacon was absolutely delicious. Please know that my friend got the sausage patties instead of the bacon and she thought it was just OK so I would go with bacon if you have a choice. The pancakes were good... I cannot say they were outstanding as I have had way better pancakes at other places, but they were good. In the near future, I would not order the pancakes with the rest of the meal.
Coffee, hazelnut coffee, is awesome. This place rocks! We are so going back for breakfast repeatedly and I would recommend it to anyone. I have heard that the chicken and waffles are amazing and I have also heard that they have an amazing Charleston shrimp and grits dish.

Toronto has their fair share of places where people are willing to line up and wait for brunch on the weekend and don't take reservations because really, they don't have to.  WBK is one of those places.

On a very cold Sunday I arrived around 10:40ish to see that there were 3 groups of 3 or more in front of me.  A person came in looking for a table of two and was seated immediately.  All of the seating in this place is only 2 or 4 seat tables.  There was one table at the front window that can seat 5.

Upon check in I was given the choice of leaving my number for my place in line or just to wait there.  The place and the list is simply written down at the front counter.  Anybody can see it.  That's how I knew how many were ahead of me and I was given the option to leave my number so I could leave and come back but since it was so cold outside, no - I wasn't going to take a stroll to Christie Pits.  It became crowded pretty fast.

They have a curtain at the doorway leading to the entrance so it sort of helps keep the heat in when the cold wanted to creep in.  It became awkward however when more people started to show up and line up inside because it was cramped.  Understandingly so nobody wants to be outside when it was this cold on a day like that.  Still, the staff here are great, friendly and accommodating.  Anybody observing to can how challenging it is to move around in this space and when there's people waiting sort of impeding the way to tables it makes the degree of difficulty even more.

The food is the reason people are lined up and coming in however.  Brunch is not something that is taken lightly.  You can get breakfast anywhere really but weekend mornings are a bit different.

Brunch = drinks (alcohol) served strictly after 11am.  I watched while waiting in line as beer was being poured and had to sit there until the big hand hit the 12 and it became 11am.  Now it's legal!

So between beer, mimosas and Caesars, I ended up getting the large Caesar which they make with 2oz of Stoli and rim the glass with steak spice instead of celery salt which is a nice change actually.

The Caesar wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but it had a good taste, mild but the steak spice rim was more like a salt and pepper type season rather than a hot pepper overall tang.  Still good, just different.  Just a pickle on top, nothing wacky or different, just standard.

I ended up ordering the 8 piece chicken (tenders) and waffles with a side of bacon and real maple syrup.  I would have preferred real pieces of fried chicken but it isn't offered for breakfast.  The chicken was battered, seasoned but nothing standout-ish.  I mean the chicken seemed just plain Jane standard, not spicy and sort of bland.  It was good but just good.  It wasn't as risky as say the Stockyard's offering.  My friend had asked for some hot sauce and I thought they'd bring a bottle but it was a tiny paper cup with maybe 5ml in it.  He didn't use it all and I used some of it to spark up my chicken just a tad.

I was sort of disappointed I had to ask for and pay for maple syrup (2 bucks).  I mean this is chicken and waffles and we're in Canada.  I'm not really interested in Aunt Jemima's or some sort of maple syrup alternative.  Not to mention this dish is almost 20 bucks.  As for the side of bacon the pieces weren't measly small greasy diner type bacon but it was only 2 slices and it was 4 bucks.  Emma's I believe uses Sanagan's meat at least for the pepperette they do.

The waffle was good and light but it was sort of small, maybe 6 inches in diameter?  It wasn't very thick either.

Overall the service is really good at WBK.  The chicken and waffles I have to say for me was mediocre.  While the chicken (8 tenders around 4 inches long each) was decently abundant it didn't wow me.  I need to be wowed because I'm sort of a lover of fried chicken.  The waffle while good was lacking in overall quantity.  There was no butter offered and the maple syrup had to be paid for which is sort of a turn off.  I suppose I could have asked for butter but I didn't necessarily need it.  I would have used it if it came.  I can't say that I've ever paid 2 dollars for a slice of bacon (x 2) ever and the Caesar while tasty wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for or expecting.

WBK is a good place.  I've had others tell me tales of how good this or that is, mainly the chicken.  While I didn't have a chance to get bone in chicken pieces these tenders that came with the chicken and waffles for me were just meh.

Overall I can't say I was too impressed with this place but then again I've only had one sit down there.  For a place that's known for their fried chicken and it seems to be talked about a lot - honestly I just don't see it.",2018-01-09 16:20:31

Biggest, almost inexplicable change - NO MORE WAFFLE FRIES!! I cannot understand this. They are just no longer on the menu. These were like angel tears in the form of fries and the reviewers raved about them so I just didn't get it. I asked the kid behind the counter why no more waffles and he said they kept having the waffle fry cutter machine break and it cost too much to fix it. 

Ok, I get it, being a business owner is about making tough choices, but sorry, you've taken away a major plus about your menu. Those waffle fries were SO DAMN GOOD! Total bummer. Also the kid today didn't offer us the little scoop on top of the ice cream as usual.

As usual for 95% of the clubs/pool parties here the guys at the door were not very friendly. I ignored it because a few in my group were in Vegas for first time and I wanted them to have a good time. 
So 9 of us go in and get walked to this little box they call a day bed. This thing at the most can fit 4-5 small people if they are all bunched together. There are no other chairs around our day bed but we don't complain because everyone got right in the pool. Not much of an atmosphere there other than that is a LOT more laid back than douchey Tao Beach which is a plus.
Drinks are waaaay expensive as expected. $21 for a beer and a vodka cranberry. They also have food service at the pool which is great but we had all just eaten lunch so we passed on that. 
I think there was a bachelor party in the section near us and they were pretty cool. The DJ was ok. Nothing special.
The staff was hit or miss. Some were friendly and very nice, some were stuck up and mean.
We would have been better off at the regular pool. The only good thing about all these pools is they are 21+ and you don't have to deal with screaming kids.",2010-06-21 17:17:26

No sample cups, no indication of what ingredients are in which flavors, and the topping bar is just ok. The only flavor I really remember is the strawberry and all I can recall about it is how much I disliked it. 

Another thing I don't quite understand is why these kinds of places are so expensive. I feel like I can get double the amount of ice cream anywhere else and pay half as much.

Nevertheless, after four dinner visits, I can now declare with some confidence that this establishment is still a great purveyor of other well-prepared comfort food.  

For appetizers I sampled delightful mayonnaise-based Deviled Eggs with tiny Gherkins inserted in the whipped yolk, creamy Crab Bites with Chipotle Cream Sauce, and fine doughy Garlic Knots except for slightly burned bottoms.

Soup or salad is included with entrees.  On two occasions Albondigas Soup was a big hit, with celery, tomato, and just slightly spicy triangle-shaped meatballs dunked in a very tasty and hot broth.  French Onion Soup is very sound.  And the New England Clam Chowder I enjoyed here contained numerous pieces of clam, potatoes, and celery, and packed a nice spicy back bite.   

Grilled Salmon with Citrus Butter was moist and  accompanied by excellent mid-sized Asparagus Spears and very good Rice Pilaf.  A generous serving of Fish & Chips presented me with three moist and tasty batons of deep-fried fish and an ample supply of tapered French Fries.  I saved one fish fillet and some potatoes for lunch the next day, where both fish and fries held up very well.  I also learned that Elixir handcrafts a superior-tasting Tartar Sauce and quite tasty Coleslaw..

Food Emporium 
Grocery Galleria
Majestic Market

Call it whatever you want, this place makes AJs (a high end grocer in Arizona where I've been living for the past 6 years) look like ye old five-and-dime. Now I'll be the first to admit I'm barely breaking into the grocery scene here in Madison, and I know there are Co-ops and farmer's markets galore. But what really gets me going about this place is that most every meat, dairy and grain product has a sign with the distance in miles that product traveled to Metcalfe's. WHAT? Eggs from 40 miles away too far for you? Grab a dozen from the farm that's labeled 8 miles away... no yolk! Care to chomp cheese that doesn't drive more than 5? They've got it. Add java, pasta sauce even tortilla chips bagged 1 mile down the street at the local taqueria and you have a geographically conscious way to stock pantry fridge and freezer. 

Oh and Chef Lea Caplan... I have no idea who you are, but I want to know who you are. She is Metcalfe's resident food expert, writing books, leading cooking demonstrations and showing up to festivals and fairs to teach Madisonians about how to take home Metcalfe's great local goods and start using them in rad recipes. Add to this the fact that the place is run on 100% green energy (that's like the wind y'all) and their bag program that awards you .10 for every reusable bag you bring in to pack your picks. Don't dig dimes? You can donate that savings to a local charity. 

Metcalfe's you're a sign of the times.",2012-08-02 04:50:05

I was trilled to try this place, and left completely underwhelmed.  For how much they talked themselves up while I was in there I was expecting something at least at the caliber of other establishments around the CLE. 

Answer: No.  Didn't live up to the hype.   

It tasted like something I've made in my own kitchen, and I nearly smoked out a party cooking for them the other week.  Had to open up windows, open doors, literally smoked them out - and these cupcakes just didn't taste like anything crazy out of the ordinary. 

If I were to recommend one, it would be the Cookie one.  The snickerdoodle was dry and just disappointing.

I thought Cavo was just a nightclub, but after reading some awesome reviews on yelp, I knew I had to check it out. We visited this past Saturday around 7:00pm. I was surprised to see that we were the first ones in the place. I've been to Cavo before, and was reminded of the beautiful décor and relaxing ambiance as we were seated. Our waiter was really friendly and provided us with excellent service throughout the evening. The menu is small- only two pages, and I was a little disappointed in their selection of appetizers. I decided to go for the grilled filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My boyfriend ordered the burger. Our entrees came out in good time and were stunning. The lighting is very dim in this place, so it was hard to take a good picture (yes, I am one of those people). My steak was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were super tasty and the asparagus was delicious. The boyf's burger was AWESOME- there was a TON of bacon, which I loved (I snuck a couple bites in) and it was cooked wonderfully. The chips were SO good. They were long like French fries and tasted super fresh. Delicious!

Also, my foodie relatives love this place, so I knew it was going to be good. And it was.

We were there for breakfast, so we didn't have their famous sandwiches, but their bakery items were fabulous. Perfect croissants (regular and almond), wonderful (and big!) muffins, fresh scones. The coffees were also excellent. 

As we left, they were putting out their lunch pastries: unbelievably gorgeous cupcakes and cookies and brownies. All looked amazing. 

The restaurant interior is really welcoming, with long, warm wooden tables, comfy wooden chairs, wide open big windows (in the summer), chalkboard-covered columns by the entryway with menus and cartoons drawn on it, funky twig decorations hanging over the tables..... The whole place reminded me of some funky, hip hang-outs I used to frequent in my McGill days (in the early '80s). I guess you'd call it a post-hippie kind of vibe. I liked it.

What I wasn't so keen on was the whole system of ordering and paying. When the place is crowded (which, I gather, it often is - especially on weekends), it just doesn't make sense to have such a chaotic, inefficient system for diners to order and pay. So many queues, so much waiting, so little room in which to wait. Some older relatives asked me afterwards if they'd like this restaurant and if they should go here, and I had to say no: they'd love the food, but they couldn't handle the process to get their table and order their food and pay.

They provide complimentary soft drinks, water, or wine while getting your nails done, and if you are not offered a drink, feel free to ask for one.

I believe their prices are totally reasonable, and the quality is good.  Manicure/pedicure is $35 (total) and a gel/shellac manicure is $30 (and lasts 2+ weeks, no chips).

Phoenix Palace I have tried before
To replace as my Dim Sum place

Cause I've eaten in the past
That hunger will always be without you

Phoenix Palace is an old school Dim Sum joint located in the heart of what I call little Chinatown.  Off Dobson and Warner this little corner in Chandler is a mecca for Asian businesses, aside from your LA Fitness on the Northwest corner.  Phoenix Palace is in the same corner as Lee Lee's Market; where you can explore all food ingredients from the Orient.  

I'm a dim sum lover and I wish I could go every weekend, but that would totally destroy my diet!  Needless to say, Phoenix Palace is one of my favorite dim sum places in Phoenix.  They offer up some traditional products like Siu Mai, Nai Wong Bao, Phung Chows, and Cha Sui Baos.  Moreover, they also have some newer products and I gather it's for the more American guest like fried noodles, fried rice and calamari.  All good, but some times I wish they would just stick with tradition.  

Overall, the dim sum is pretty good and one of the best in my opinion of what we can get in Phoenix.  It'll get the job done as they say, but don't expect it to blow your mind away.  Service here has improved through the years and afterwards you can always stop by Lee Lee's to get your Asian groceries.  Just a skip and a hop away is a Boba place so you might as well get your entire Asian fix on and done! - Enjoy",2013-09-24 16:14:44

Seating available inside and outside. 

Past few times I have tried this place, it is the owner who has been taking my order. SUPER friendly and really knowledgeable... think i remember someone telling me he is a school trained chef? ANYWAY. Very nice greeting and always suggests their daily specials. OH also another note about this guy.. He will secretly take note of your name if you pay by credit card, and he will give a personalized good-bye as your leave ! very surprised ! Also ! they do not do numbers or what not to ""signify"" where the order goes. If you tell them where you are sitting, it will get to you in a timely manner. 

One of their most popular sandwiches is the Chicken Curry Sandwich. Past 2 times, that is what i have ordered. Spice level made to your desire. Moist chicken, melted cheese, and a nice yellow curry sauce super flavorful all in a nice toasted ciabatta-like bread. 

Both times that i have sat at the restaurant, i have paired with my sandwich, a hot Mocha Rocha. HUGE cup (with a tiny handle) topped with a drizzle of chocolate sauce and whipped cream (if preferred). Nice flavor. Not too sweet, not too strong (for the not-so-much coffee drinkers)

We strolled in and were seated promptly, ready to order since we were starving. My wife picked the quiche, while I went straight for the chicken and waffles that a lot of my Yelp friends were raving about. The waiter asked if we wanted a mimosa, and I blurted out yes. I don't usually order and drink mimosas, so I'm not sure what happened.

I was probably just in the moment during brunch. At any rate, the mimosa was good -- as it better be at $12.50 a glass. The complimentary baguette was as hard as a rock, and even the waiter was scratching his head over why many people loved the baguette. Any food that cuts my lip and/or gums just isn't a good sign.

My chicken and waffles arrived, and the chicken just looked uber juicy and tender from the outside. I could only imagine the inside. It didn't disappoint. Well seasoned, full of flavor, and wafting with aromas, I licked every bone squeaky clean. I had no shame in picking up the chicken with my bare hands and eating it finger lickin' style.

The waffles were okay to me. I was kind of disappointed the exterior wasn't as crispy. But it was the accompanying whipped butter and syrup that really amplified the waffles. I had a bite of the quiche and that was good as well. Overall, a bit of a splurge but a nice brunch.",2012-07-11 04:08:57

Given our past enjoyment of his cuisine, we decided to try his newly opened FIVE50 Pizza Bar.  Our decision was made even more palatable since we'd gotten coupons for a free slice and beer from MGM's myVegas game on Facebook.  

We arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday night.  There was no line at the slice counter where pizza by the slice was sold.  We noted immediately that not all pizzas available in the sit down part of the restaurant were available by the slice.  No matter, since the Gotham ($5.50 per slice/$28 for a 16"" pie), a meat pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano was what I wanted and it was on the abbreviated slice menu.  FIVE50's slices are taken from their 16"" pies, which are divided into 8 pieces, so slices received aren't very large.  Also, since they're pre-baked, there's no telling how long they've been sitting on the counter.  My slice was plucked off of the counter and slid into the wood-fired oven at what I'm assuming was 550 degrees to warm it up.  A few minutes later, I received my slice.  The crust was decently flavorful, crispy at the edges, but not necessarily chewy throughout.  I attribute most of the lackluster quality of the crust to the fact the pizza was pre-baked, had cooled down absorbing the grease from the relatively ample amount of meaty toppings, resulting in the crust becoming soggy and limp.  I was pretty unimpressed.  My fiancée didn't fare much better with her selection.      

The beer selection at the slice counter was also abbreviated with only two beers available on tap and a handful of bottles.  It was also surprisingly unimpressive with only one of the beers available (a bottled Dogfish Head) sounding remotely interesting.  Unfortunately, they wanted $13 for it, which combined with the slice of the pizza, exceeded the value of the coupon.  I could've paid the difference, but as a matter of principle, I'd never pay $13 for a 12-ounce bottle of beer.

My parting thought was that FIVE550 may be a very good pizza joint with a solid craft beer selection.  Perhaps our luck would've been much better had we sat in the dining room, ordered a whole pizza, and tasted a freshly baked pie.  However, you won't get that experience by the slice at the walk up counter.  It's overpriced...expect to pay $16 for a beer and a slice, and it, sadly, underdelivers.",2013-07-29 22:08:37

Perhaps she was just trying to leave us alone, recognizing we were there to chat.  Not feeling very adventurous, I went with a green tea which was great.  I also ordered a butter croissant, that unfortunately I would not recommend.  It was very dense and overloaded with butter; I would've preferred light and fluffy with just a taste of butteriness.

Even given the heavy croissant, I'd rate this place highly based on the ambiance and teas - that's really what you come here for, right?",2010-02-11 18:55:57

Their cafeteria or food court had a lot of options. Everything was very clean. I like that they weren't standard fold court chain restaurants. I did notice how busy it was but then remembered that this mall is right in the middle of the business area.

The restrooms are clean which is a big plus. Free wifi which was amazing for someone who was relying on wifi heavily during my trip.

Had:

Starter borscht soup - free. Each person got a bowl. They were out of Chinese soup. That's fine. I like borscht. Tomato based, slightly spicy, filled with cabbage, carrots, celery, etc. Nice and not watery, just the way I like it.

Fish noodles Chiu Chow style ($9.95) - all the noodles in this dish are made of fish paste. These noodles are then stir-fried with sprouts, shrimp, slivers of pork, onion, bits of egg, etc. It's savory, but has a hint of sweetness to it. I really enjoy the chew of the noodles. Tastes even better with a touch of chili oil (one of the condiments provided at each table).

Pork tripe (actually stomach) and chicken in hot pot - can't remember the price or the actual name of this dish. It's fairly obvious which one it is though. Served in a metal wok atop a burner. Broth has a nice white pepper taste. Pork stomach was not too chewy, but still chewy. That's a good thing, by the way. Also came with pieces of corn on the cob and dul pock (bean curd skin? Chinese bean curd pockets? I'm having a brain fart right now). This dish really warms the stomach and throat up in a very pleasant way.

Fried beef brisket with curry sauce - The brisket is marinated in five spice and anise and other things, then cut up, battered, and deep fried. It adds a very interesting textural component to an otherwise standard dish. The beef is tender and flavorful. The batter is really crispy. The curry has a nice aroma that I don't expect to find in Chinese curries (Chinese curries have the tendency to disappoint me). The only downside to this dish is that some of the pieces of brisket are really big. Bite-size would be nice, please.

Snow pea sprouts with king oyster mushrooms - snow pea shoots were fresh. King oyster mushrooms were tender. Sauce was well done. My dad and my grandfather were thrilled.

Red bean sweet soup with sago - also free. Just sweet enough. I would have preferred cream in mine, but I'm not a fan of red bean sweet soup to begin with. This was done a more traditional way than I like. The red beans we were told came from Japan. They weren't overcooked, so they still had a bit of a chew.

For those of you who are interested in VIP discount cards, they have one here. $10 for a year. You get 10% off everything on their regular menu (if I'm not mistaken). I bought one.

I was really excited about the meatballs stuffed with cheese, but sadly they must have forgotten to stuff it with cheese :(  The service was the part that was most lacking. I called the meatball issue to the attention of the waitress but she didn't seem concerned and just walked off, not to return again.   I would've been ok if they would have just brought some cheese to put on top at least.  She also forgot one of our drink orders we had to remind her of, then she still brought the wrong thing even though she had written down the original order.We had to get her attention many times before she could finally bring the check. It took about 30 min from when we first asked her to finally get it.  She seemed to have trouble using the machine to check us out and there was only one machine that could be used at a time.  She didn't apologize at all (not about the meatballs lacking cheese or about the delays or forgotten drink orders) until the very end when she finally produced the check and she took the meatballs off of it.

The youthful energy, the progressive vibes, and especially the eclectic food scenes.  Something about college towns makes them a haven for food experimentation.  My college town of Flagstaff in particular was awash in Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, and even Latin American restaurants.  All of which served interesting food at prices that even poor college kids could afford.  Cafe Lalibela is the perfect example of such a college town restaurant.  Interesting unique food with lunch and dinner options that won't break most college student budgets.  I've never sat down for an Ethiopean meal before but I've encountered Cafe Lalibela at a couple of food festivals over the last year.  I also had one of their 20% off coupons that was about to expire.  So on a Sunday late afternoon, I chanced an early dinner here.

Located on the southeast corner of University & Hardy in Tempe, Cafe Lalibela sits at an intersection where a number of restaurants popular with the ASU crowd reside.  Cornish Pasty, Harlow's Cafe, Thai Elephant, Taco Shack, and Cheba Hut are all a short walk from here.  Dozens of Ethiopian and American flags fly proudly outside Lalibela's doors in case you get lost finding the place.  The interior of the restaurant is a pretty simple setup with a few Ethiopian photos and artifacts on the wall but little else that stands out.  There's seating for probably a max of 60-70 people inside, but I was one of only a handful of customers at the time so I got sat right away.

First timers should probably study their menu online in advance as there's a lot of food lingo that takes awhile to get ahold of.  There are also a wide variety of combination plates to choose from for one or for a whole group.  But first, gotta have an authentic beverage to start things off.  I went with a glass of Tossign.  Basically an Ethiopian herbal tea that you can order hot or iced (its 116 today so iced, duh).  A very light tea with a ever so slight herbal perfume.  I imagine this would taste even better hot, but maybe when the weather is cooler.  For my food, I decided to go with one of the Individual Platters, a combination of foods supposedly meant to feed just one (more on that in a bit).  Being the wimpy white guy I am when it comes to spice, I played it safe and ordered the aptly named Mild Combination.  There are five components to this dish.  A salad, a mild beef stew, a mild lamb stew, a green bean & carrot stew, and bread.  The bread however isn't just any bread.  Injera bread is a thin spongy crepe-like bread made from a mixture of two types of flour.  And they serve you ALOT of it, and with good reason.  The combination plate is served atop injera and you're also given a sizable portion of injera on the side to use, essentially, as a utencil to pick up all that good stuff.  Yup, no forks, spoons, knives, etc.  Just you peeling off chunks of that injera bread grabbing as much of those stews with the bread pieces as you can muster.  Admittedly this can make for a messy meal (or at least messy fingers), but that injera soaks up the seasonings and picks up those chunks of meat and veggies pretty efficiently.

Let's talk about the individual stews.  Both the beef stew (known as Alicha Sega Wat) and lamb stew (known as Key Sega Wat) are simmered in clarified butter, onion, turmeric, and some relatively mild spices.  The green bean & carrot stew (known as Fosolia) is cooked with mild spices, tomatoes, and onion.  Each of the stews were delicious and the injera bread was a perfect delivery vehicle for that goodness to my mouth.  Who needs utensils when you've got bread?  Now, remember how I said this was supposed to be a dish for one?  I can pack away the food with the best of them, but this was ALOT to pack away.  I think by the end of the meal I'd eaten my body weight in injera and the stew portions were very generous.  If you're coming here for a dinner for two, I can assure you one of the so called ""individual platters"" will feed two people no problem.

Total price for the tea, platter, tax, and tip came to $24 (prior to applying my discount).  Delicious food, huge portions, friendly hospitality, casual atmosphere.  In addition to the individual platters, they have a bunch of smaller entree options for just $6 each as well as large platters you can order for groups for about $60 each.  Either way, plenty of good food for meat eaters and vegetarians alike and with prices accessible to ASU students and pretty anyone passing by.  Check off another one of those perfect college town foodie adventures.",2017-06-26 02:34:48

As a party of 3, we got one of the few tables in the restaurant tucked away in the Chinatown area on a Friday night. 

Levetto is a half service restaurant so you typically walk in, get seated, order, pay and then food is served to your table. 

My friends and I all went up to order on separate bills. We started with sharing a romaine salad which was very generously portioned (as is all their menu items). 

My friends both got the carbonara which arrived as we were finishing the salad. However, my rigatoni did not arrive for the next 10-15 mins. I decided to go up and check on my order and as it turns out, they had missed my pasta so they had to make it as I reminded them. 

At this point, my friends were done their pastas and I was still waiting but I was luckily not as hungry since I had some of the salad. 

As we continued to chat and wait for the rigatoni, we saw one of the waiters pick up a pizza and rigatoni. However, they didn't realize I was still waiting for mine and gave my rigatoni to another table. Having noticed us looking, he quickly realized that the pasta should have gone to us first. Due to the large mix up, they refunded my meal and also quickly made a fresh rigatoni for me. They also offered us a coconut cake on the house. 

Overall, I thought they dealt with the situation well and as always the pasta was exceptional (al dente and super flavourful). Had it not been the mishap, I would've given full 5 stars.",2017-02-04 21:38:55

Located at The Center, this cafe serves up delicious sammiches guaranteed to leave you satiated and satisfied. One of my friends went to order and I ran to ""the john"" as soon as we got in, which were clean. Then out I went to get some grub.

There are so many options to choose from, and I couldn't choose one.  I knew I wanted something savory, and asked for some help from behind the counter.  The Guac & Mole was suggested which had avocado, vegan mole, carrots, cucumber, alfalfa sprouts, vegan ranch dressing and lemon vinaigrette all on ciabatta. I ordered the watermelon juice with chia seeds with it, too.  

One of my friends had got her food already and I waited patiently for mine.  My food came out and it was presented so nicely.  The sandwich was cut so perfectly and the salad looked so fresh.  I took one bite and could not stop. The mole to guacamole ratio was the bomb! Everything was paired so nice and the bread was toasted to perfection! My savory craving was met and surpassed. There is a certain temperature when eating sandwiches, sound silly, but not too cold, and not too hot like I'll be coming down with something in a few hours.  My teeth are also sensitive to extreme temps.  Luckily this was just right. I can't complain the slightest as I was completely happy with the temp. The juice was very refreshing as well.

We were all loving our sammiches! I didn't want my sammich to end, but unfortunately, all good things come to an end, and my sammich was gone.

I was going to give the place a solid 4 stars, but then the final sushi plate came out, and it went to 5! It was the best sushi I've had in Montreal - seriously, I would come here over Park any day.

Comparing the two stores is night and day. I was shocked at how crappy the layout was and the equally crappy selection of items. Stuff we routinely pick up at the Legacy location either weren't there or were hiding themselves pretty well. For example, the Legacy spot has lots of nice belts and wallets for guys. This place has one teeny rack and all the same stuff on it over and over. No Smartwool socks, no Calvin Klein undershirts for men. These items you can get anytime at the east side store. 

If the Legacy Rack is like a Taj Mahal of cheap shoes, this one is a Mumbai slum. Sure there are some decent brands, but you'll see the same 10 pairs of shoes over and over - especially in the mens section.  I did grab a pair of casual Nikes for 20 bucks but nothing has really grabbed my eye in the few visits I've had here so far. 

We were super pumped for this location to open and with how long the renovations took, we were sure the layout and selection would be awesome. Alas, this place pretty much blows.

The place is beautiful, simply beautiful.

We are sure that the inside was open for this event, but we had no idea how to get inside, no idea...Meaning with everything roped off, it was not a place to dance this evening, which kinda sucked since the DJ (William Reed) was killing it with the down tempo beats.

The serving staff and bartenders were also really nice and accommodating, but again this was a New Times Event and not a normal evening.

We also had a bowl of cold noodles, lettuce and shrimp paste/ soybean wrapper fritters with slices of pork. The dish was pretty bland and the pork was overcooked.

Their grill foods are generally really tasty. In a previous review someone had said that they were serving 'leftover"" parts and the portions were small. I guess it depends what you expect. An izakaya is primarily a sake bar (drinking establishment), it's not suppose to be a restaurant with full meal sized dishes, which is why most of the menu items are small portions and grilled. It's customary for izakayas to serve snack portion foods that are usually easy to cook and grilled. As for the ""leftover"" parts comment, these are normal Japanese food items that are often served in izakayas because they're easy to grill and eat off sticks - similar to a pub/finger food environment - this might not be everyone's cup of tea of course.

For lunch, my co-worker and I enjoy the black cod - it's cooked perfectly with a tiny bit of soya sauce, it's actually my bench mark to compare black cods when eating at other restaurants. 
The chicken wing stuffed dumpling is really good, we order it all the time. it's always juicy and seasoned just right. 
The pork cheek and pork belly are also really tasty. 
Their salmon terriyaki is really good as well but not as good as the black cod.
My friends and family also enjoy the Curry rice immensely - for some of them, it's a go-to item to order. 
The reason I haven't given this place all 4 stars is because the service is not good. It's slow and sometimes the waiters forget things like refilling water or the bill. I think this is primarily due to the small space confinement which doesn't allow them to have more wait staff at once. Last week they were under renovations to expand and take over the space next door. I'm hoping they're open for lunch today to try out this new environment and extra large kitchen.

The first time I went was with my man friend and we managed to find a 2-top with no issues. I ordered the egg white omelet on the menu and it came with toast.  One of my gripes is that the omelets only come with potatoes on sundays (same price....hmmm, interesting). Toast was hearty but the omelet was on the smaller side. 

The second time was with the larger group so they said they would call us in 20 min when our table was ready.....50 minutes later we get a call.  Service was slow but the place was busy.  The specials impressed me more on this sunday.  I ordered the egg white frittata with goat cheese and sweet potatoes. Yum.  We also had some pumpkin pancakes for the table also great. 

Pros: Cute interior, sunday specials, interesting omelets, friendly service, Lawerenceville location

Cons: Long waits, slow but friendly service, no potatoes during the week, trendy can mean pricey 

Overall: I like pamelas, and square cafe better but this place is good. Given the location I will definitely be back!",2011-12-25 03:17:09

As noted always a Best of Vegas breakfast contender. Not really that good but consistent and CHEAP. $2.99 Pancakes & Eggs, $3.99 Steak & Eggs, $2.99 Strawberry Shortcakes!

BEST spot to eat after drinking, YES! Fast,Cheap & Filling.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with scrambled eggs,hashbrowns and wheat toast.

The wife had the NY steak and scrambled eggs with hashbrowns and a biscuit w/gravy(instead of toast)

Mine was real iffy, too fried-gravy was too thick & lumpy, hasbrowns were good,eggs were a little runny, toast was soaked in butter.

Steak is a little fatty-NOT real New York Strip steak, biscuit was tasty & flaky but again gravy was too thick.

The service was a little slow only got 1 refill the entire time & it wasn't very busy at all at midnight.

We found the food very flavorful however our request for less spiciness was ignored. We ordered seafood + kimchi tofu pot and kimchi + pork tofu pot. The jajang myeon is quite good and one of my favorites to order. 
We were seated in an obscure location and the call button was handy but service wasn't prompt like others say. 
The little dishes that arrive just before the meal is standard with Korean meal. A plate of grilled fish and 4pcs of kalbi shortribs were included (to our surprise). Server realized it's a mistake and took it away even though we had already ate some. I thought that was a stingy move since it was their mistake to begin with.

It was a pretty decent burger and good size as well. I ordered a salad to go with my burger. I was surprised at how fresh the salad was, and the tomatoes were nice and ripe. I had the white lightning beer, it was really good. I could not order a wine, they only offered cheap wine by the glass. 

I did not know that they had rooftop seating until I looked at the website, I will definitely go in this summer and sit up on the rooftop and have a beer and split a burger with my husband. The burger we had was way too much food for me. 

The server was very attentive but she was also very forgetful, Michelle said be nice but... She forgot our waters, she brought my husband a 16 ounce beer instead of a 25 ounce beer, she offered me balsamic dressing and brought me ranch, she forgot the mayo for my burger, she charged my husband for two 25 ounce beers when he only had the 16 ounce beers, she kind of argued about the price on the bill but then took care of it.

Proven story line, three stories in fact - Moulin Rouge, Great Gatsby, and Romeo & Juliet. Talented performers - they can dance, sing, run around, look sexy and beautiful! Live music performers. Immersive bright lights! Decadent costumes. I thoroughly enjoyed the show and experience. 

Tickets
I bought a pair of theater-seating tickets at Tix4Tonight for a Tuesday (5/30/17) 7pm show. The tickets were $52 each. They also offer another tier at $64/ticket which is closer and offers drink service. Note that the show has a main stage but is performed all throughout the theater. The actors run around and use much of the theater as their stage. So if you want a broader view, theater seating is perfect. If you buy with Tix4Tonight, you have to pick up your actual tickets at will-call at least one hour prior to the start of the show. When you pick up your tickets they will ask you where you prefer to sit (center or aisle). 

Showtime
After scanning your ticket, you enter the theater through the ""VIP Seating"" door. I think that's the only or main entrance. But it makes you feel like a VIP... lol. The theater is not big by Vegas standards, probably holds about 200-300. There are ushers that will guide you to your assigned seats. When our usher looked at our tickets and seats, he said ""oh no, you guys are ALL THE WAY up there. This won't do."" He asked if we would like to sit closer; the show was barely 50% full. We accepted the offer and he started to guide us towards the stage. As we walked towards some of the sweetheart tables, I was thinking that's cool we get to be closer for the price we paid. Then we passed all those tables and the usher started to walk up to the stage. I was thinking are we being punked or added into the show??? He finally stopped at a table ON THE STAGE, there was another couple already sitting in a similar seating. He said ""here you go."" We were puzzled and all the while excited. We took our seats wondering what's going on. Luckily nothing but good things were about to happen.

Performance
Show starts with the ringmaster giving a little guidance to the audience. Photo-taking and video-recording ARE allowed, but no use of flash for obvious reasons. It is highly encouraged to share on social media using #BazPalazzo. Lights dim. Music starts. And ACTION!!! The three stories are introduced and are interlaced throughout the show. They all follow the drama from falling in love, the adversity of being together, and the tragedy that falls upon each couple. Each story line was differentiated by colored lights - Moulin Rouge (red), Great Gatsby (gold/yellow), and Romeo & Juliet (white/blue). Again very Baz Luhrmann style cinematics. The singing was magnificent. The actor that played Daisy sent chills down my back every time she sang. She held some very high notes. Absolutely fantastic! Because we were sitting on stage, we were used like extras. The dancers would come over and make small talk during scenes. It was a blast! If you enjoy dancing there's that too! They have a very talented pair that performed many different styles of dance. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

ayJfTvKzP1eEsYoUoWEQ7g,o2_eBLxCdS54IcSEjzGrZw,44a_evCaWZ63cPA1kWPJOw,3,1,0,0,"Nice to finally have an alternative to Banh Mi Boys (BMB) outside the downtown core, but it needs work.

To start, the location in my opinion is definitely not ideal for a brand new restaurant. Located at the back of the Commerce Valley Drive restaurant plaza, ""It's a Bao Time"" (IABT) set up camp at part of the space which was once occupied by Go For Tea. If you didn't know that Go For Tea had closed in that location (like I did) and didn't stumble upon the restaurant by accident, you'd probably have a hard time trying to figure out where IABT was located. 

The restaurant itself is nice and very clean with a very modern and casual vibe to it. Menu board on top of the register/pick-up window with lots of seats. I visited on a Friday night and it was fairly empty save for another family dining in. I hope it was only busy due to them being a new business..

Selection was just what I'd expect from a BMB style joint, with pricing I believe to be relatively close to their Toronto counterparts. I ordered the Pork Belly Bao ($4.69) and a Beef Bulgogi Banh-mi ($6.89) as well as a Jarrito ($3) and waited about 5-10min for my food to come. 

The bao was first and I felt it was a fairly decent size. It was definitely packed in nicely with the toppings as per the menu board, however I did find that the meat was clumped together fairly tightly. Same thing happened for my banh-mi, as I ended up finishing all the meat before I could finish the rest of the sandwich and its other toppings. I do believe that a single banh-mi alone could've filled me up though, as I had some slight regret eating two sandwiches around halfway to finishing my banh-mi...

Overall not a bad place to go check out if you're craving baos or banh-mi's if you've got cravings you need to cure AND don't wanna travel downtown if you're not from the area. I'll probably be back once my cravings return!",2016-01-28 03:46:22

I knew they would be a bit pricier but I was willing to pay for quality work since this was my sister's wedding and I am the maid of honor.

I was told that the alterations would take about a week, which is a pretty quick turn around time. When I arrived to pick up the dress, I tried it on to see if the alterations were okay. They were fine...but to my horror and disgust, I notice what looked like two grease stains on the skirt of the dress. These stains were not there when I dropped off the dress. My husband noticed that two more large grease stains on the back of the dress. It looked like someone was eating a hunk of KFC when they were working on my dress and decided to use it as a napkin.

Kim was in the store that day. She apologized and offered to send it out for dry cleaning which took another week.

I picked up the dress tonight and the stains are still visible. They were unable to get the stains out with dry cleaning. Kim's employee insinuated several times that the stains were there before I brought the dress in for alterations (completely untrue). I was still charged the full price for alterations but the dry cleaning was complimentary.

So now I am left with a never before worn bridesmaid dress that already has been stained before the big day. I'm disappointed and don't want this to happen to anyone else. Think twice before you bring your clothes for alterations here.",2010-08-16 22:24:52

My hubby ordered the Pad Thai, medium. It was a nice spice level, although he can take it hotter. I tasted it and the noodles were cooked nicely. He enjoyed it. I ordered the Thai Basil chicken mild- I like some spice but not too much. It was not spicy at all. It comes with white rice with black sesame seeds on top which was a nice touch. There is a small green salad with a peanut dressing that was tasty. There was a fried wonton and a small ""eggroll"". One bit of the eggroll was all I was going to eat.

Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit

Blueberry Pancakes 

First off, the drink was pretty good. It wasn't too sweet and refreshing. When the food came out, the portions were HUGE! The corned beef was fresh (not the mushy kine you get in the can) and chicken benedict was very filling with layers of fried chicken, scrambled eggs, fried pasta strings, cheese, and biscuits. FYI, order the sauce on the sauce or else your fried chicken and grilled potatoes will become soggy. The only thing that was a negative was that there weren't enough blueberries in the pancakes. The pancakes were like small pizza sized so it would be nice that the filling/toppings are a little generous as well to balance the dish.

There was one incident that happened that I wish there was a way our server should have dealt with this issue.  We were seated about 15-20 minutes before these two couple who were seated right next to us in the front patio area.  The couple was in their 50-60s(not good looking at all), super PDA type of couple, touching and making out at the table at 2 PM.  The lady kept saying to her guy why are you sitting so far away about 10 times until she decided to move her seat over to sit next to him.  Which her seat was touching our table and she kept shaking our table since she can't sit still.  From the way she's sitting, it's a fire hazard for me since there isn't a path for me to walk out of the restaurant if something happened.  The server should had moved them or asked the lady to move her seat back where it belong.  My husband and I were super uncomfortable.",2018-03-23 04:37:42

I loved the Strawberry Lime Cider over ice, kids both had huge shakes that could feed 2, calamari, risotto balls, and the Gotham pizza.

There are some great sound systems in the city, and I would hardly call someone living in Toronto for one year an expert on it.

Would you say i was an expert on New York after one year? Doubt it.

Here's the run down on the MOD club:
Not the best club in the city, but then again, College is not known for the best clubs.
The sound basically becomes garbage when you get to the top floor ad the layout is like a theatre.
The bouncers are some of the worst in the city, BUT, when they hit it, they hit it right.
The bookings are great, and definitely reflect their distinct personality.

Gary Numan was fantastic at the MOD club. The show, the music, the sound, the everything. But I saw Tegan and Sara there and hated it, and I love that band.

Mark Holmes really gives it the personal touch which transfers into everything they do. If you're a concert goer, don't go on the weekends for club night, and if you're more of a clubber, don't go for the concerts. The crowds are never the same.

And Vanessa, most bands bring their own sound and lighting techs (if they're real pros), maybe your music tastes needs an adjustment?

Just a suggestion.",2008-10-02 21:01:56

Tried this place today, and got here at about 5:00 pm. I was the only one here.

1.  Service - Not bad when you are the only one here. However, the servers must be busy, because there is a ton of grease on their shirts. I may suggest to wear aprons however.

2.  Selection - Very nice - good choice of sauces, flavors, spice levels, fries, chicken fingers, boneless and basic wings.

3.  Size of wings - Well, we all know that Grade A USDA Wings are plump and very meaty ""well to moderately fleshed"".  We also know that Grade B wings have a sufficient amount of flesh to prevent a thin appearance.  Guess what, we got a B here. You want your humans beings Grade B, and your wings Grade A.  COME ON FOLKS.....

4.  Price - The price for 50 wings is 29.99 which is not bad, if it were grade A wings. you  would expect 50 wings to be somewhat heavy, I felt as if I was holding a bunch of ballons. Served in a generic container in a generic bag, not sure how this helps with their branding.

6.  Taste - edible!  The polynesian style had an odd dark color, yet the flavor was acceptable.  The Garlic Parmesan, well, there was garlic taste and parmesan taste, just unfortunately a smattering and not well covered.

7.  Tables - Plenty of room in this place, you can sit and eat as well. Odd that people just walk in and out of the back room without any uniform or acknowledgement. You don't know who works here or not.  I don't plan to eat in anytime soon, a bit dodgy if you ask me.

Overall, I would say that for a  hungry person, these wings are definitely acceptable and you can compare it to ordering a hamburger at McDonalds.

Most of everything else is standard fare at best.  They offer a omelet bar, so you can get fresh made here.  The food was all fresh.

However, they change over at lunch looked pretty good and we decided to go back for dinner.  Good thing it was free!!!  Please don't pay full price for dinner.  The best of the dinner menu was pork ribs.  The prime rib was very bland, country,  fried steak was dried out, and most everything else was bland over overcooked.  Mac & cheese was good and may be high watermark for buffet for entrees (is that a sorry statement?!).  Again if you go, hit dessert hard.

That was probably one of the only good things we liked about this restaurant. Since we had made good time the two of us each decided to order the same thing. We had a 3 egg omelet that comes with potatoes and your choice of either and English muffin or sourdough bread.

We opted for hot tea to go with our meal and our waiter showed us an assortment of tea bags to chose from. We got our food fairly quickly and I noticed that part of my bread which had been sliced was burnt. My waiter said he would replace it. When he returned all I got was the portion of the bread piece to compliment my other two slices. Talk about not replacing the whole piece!

When I ordered I asked for egg substitutes which I learned they don't serve here. The omelet was okay as were the potatoes. The sour dough toast was too tough. Our waiter did come by frequently to check on us and we had to ask for more hot water for our teas and additional tea bags.

The thing that broke this rating for me was when we got our bill we were charged for 5 teas at $3.00 a piece! My girlfriend was furious about this and asked why. He said that he assumed we knew. There was nothing on the menu addressing beverages nor did it talk about the fact that teabags were extra. He told us since they were custom teas than they would lose money if they charge for them. It was not this way with coffee. Duh what's the difference? Guess if I ordered one coffee blend and found it not to my liking and asked for a different one I would have been charged for that as well.

Regardless, he took of the cost of 2 of the teabags. He really should have taken off 3.  The food was okay which would have created a 3 star rating for this place however with having to absorb this extra cost without being told up front made our experience disappointing.

Parker's is a small restaurant bar in the Kimpton Schofield hotel and has a nice view of 9th street. It is an easy walk to Playhouse square we liked the fact we could utilize their garage so we would be able to walk to the theater. It is also not far from Progressive field.

The place has the feel of a true French bistro, except that it is huge.  The hostesses have the l'attitude parisienne down cold.  The service staff are very good, except for the trainee who dropped everything he brought to tables around us, pistachios, knives, plates.. etc.  You get the picture.  Back to the hostesses.  One came by our table every 15 minutes with a clipboard, a pad and a pen to check where everyone was in their meals.  I understand the workings of a restaurant and the need to know what tables are close to being finished so you can project your seating.  But there is something VERY offsetting with a clipboard hovering over your table taking notes.  I would have preferred someone with some discretion.

NOW all these things would not be a huge deal if I wasn't at a KELLER restaurant.  I honestly expected to be WOW'd and I wasn't.  So I was super hyped for the food, I thought for sure that would put all this to rest.  And yet I was disappointed again.  Yes the food is good, but nothing to really bring attention too.  The escargot was palatable, the puff pastry on top very floury, so I had to push those aside and only have the escargot.  I have had better in small non notable cafes.  My husband's steak was just ok, and the truffle fries were horrible.

I am so sad as I write this review.  I was positive that THE Keller would have a lock down on the French experience and then some, but since this is the only restaurant of his I have been to, I am greatly disappointed.

WHAT YOU MUST GET IS THE MOELLE ROTIE- my introduction to bone marrow, which is now my new absolute favorite thing in the known universe. Words cannot fully capture the flavors but as Michael put it in his recommendation, it's ""stupid good!"", no joke. 

OEUFS MIMOSA-delicious and delicate deviled eggs, damn good with crispy capers and a perfectly creamy texture.
SOUPE a L'OIGNON- true French onion soup, with beef broth and day-long-sautéed onions, topped with two cheeses. It's like drinking a steak, it's so rich.
ESCARGOTS a LA BOURGUIGNONNE- snails in parsley-garlic butter and puff pastry, heavenly and delicate, will be craving these again soon.
STEAK FRITES- upgrade to truffle fries and thank me later, this is the classic french take on steak and potatoes and it is phenomenal.

Pay attention to the specials, as they had a lamb chop that blew our minds with a fabulous ratio of juicy meat and flavorful fat with just a touch of char, served on a  bean and veggie blend that perfectly balanced the richness of the meat.

Also got a dessert special, brownies shaped like wine corks served with coconut ice cream and a chocolate covered cherry and a smear of sauce. Perfect with cappuccinos.

I'm a little embarrassed to confess how many times I've ordered from Joe Mama's this month, but they have some pretty good grub.  Their pizza is pretty good - a decently thick crust that doesn't fall apart in the middle, good sauce that is not overly sweet, and a good amount of toppings.  The garlic knots are buttery, soft, and have plenty of garlic.  I like the chili on the chili cheese fries.  It's pretty mikd but smoky - I really like the spices they use (the fries are typical crinkle cut and pretty standard).  Their stromboli is probably my favorite thing and I really like it with pepperoni.  It's a flaky crust with a ton of cheese and pepperoni inside. 

I have not ever dined in, so I can't speak to the interior.  However, we have gotten it delivered and ordered carry-out and it's been ready to go fairly quickly.  On a Saturday night we got it delivered in less than 45 minutes and everything was still hot and tasty.

Also, the cupcakes were pretty and cute.
This may be the first time in history where I liked the cake part better than the frosting.  The cake was moist, not to large and easy to eat (that's what she said HA).  It was great.  The frosting though, wow it was way to sweet for me.  I tried the strawberry margarita and could only have a bit of frosting because it was just too sweet.  Same with the lemon.  The chocolate frosting was ok.  The peanut one is good if you like peanuts.  
Great Scott bakery is still my favorite place for cupcakes.",2011-02-09 05:19:32

Newcomers may be turned off by the shabby decor, outside-only dining, and cheap-o exterior but this is truly a great greasy spoon for burger, fish, shrimp and chips.

The prices are right- 4 piece shrimp and chips for $4, monster burgers for less than $2, and cheap sodas (Pepsi products). Please remember this location (and most all Pete's locations) is CASH ONLY. Expect some lines in both the walk-up order window and drive-thru.

I meant it is nothing wrong with it, and some people favouring a bit heavier taste can add some spices on the table to enhance the flavour. The taste and the quality of the beef and the noodles are at average. My friends also gave me the similar comments based on their choice. We also ordered the Japanese Deep Fried Tofu as well as the Black Pepper Beef Tenderloin. The tofu was so-so, but the beef was fairly tendering and juicy.

Last time I went during brunch, and although I loved the food, the atmosphere (which is different from other venues here in Vegas, it had an east coast vibe that I love)I also loved the concept of an all you can eat Brunch that you can order fresh. I am not a buffet person so this was a nice change being able to try different things in small portion. The food was really good but the service wad lacking to me. 

Well I went for the second time for dinner. I sat at the bar and the first thing I noticed was the bartenders really knew what they were doing! It wasn't just a bunch of good looking girls who didn't have a clue. They were good looking and knew how to make a proper drink. My fiancee is Irish and they made his black velvet perfect! He kept commenting on this fact, and how it's hard to find someone who makes it properly. My martini was perfect as well, perfectly shaken and served. They were very attentive and knowledgeable. 
So any way we ordered an appetizer to start, the sliders that consisted of pulled pork, short rib and lastly a seared ahi tuna. I don't usually care for tuna but that was my favorite by far perfectly cooked, the slaw was amazing it was just plain delicious! I did notice some of the negative reviews, but being there before I can say they really stepped up their game. The owners are really concerned about addressing anything about their service and food. So I suggest if you didn't like something say it and they will do their best to improve. That says a lot about a business. 
For our main course we had a Cobb salad which I have to say was the best Cobb I've ever had the chicken was so moist and flavorful! One earlier review stated that the salad lacked dressing, well I feel that if you have fresh ingredients you don't need your salad swimming in dressing, and you can always ask for more. We also had the lobster pot pie, the crust was flaky and buttery and the lobster was very fresh. I had to refrain from finishing that delicious buttery crust and the filling was so rich and comforting. All in all it was awesome! They also have a great happy hour and reverse happy hour.

I ordered some rolls and they are about $11 each.  The quality is sub par and they are thrown together hastily.  I would expect these to be in the $8 range for the size and quality.

One of my rolls didn't come out correctly and I asked about it.  I was told it was correct so I asked for menu.  I never go that menu but the waitress looked at it and told me one of my rolls didn't come with scallions, although she was correct that wasn't the roll I complained about.  She was really set on pointing that out.  Then the roll I was pointing to, well she admitted it had scallions.  She asked if I wanted a bowl of scallions or for them to make it again.  I asked for them to make it again.  She came back a few minutes later with a bowl of scallions.  We already has this conversation.  She asked if that was alright and I told her that I wanted them to make it again and that I had also already asked them to make it again, so now I am again asking them to make it again.  She did finally return with the roll made the way it appears on the menu.  The sushi rice was warm, unlike my food friend across the table, I don't like warm rice.

Regardless this didn't end better.  I had to wait for my check and then I had to chase down the waitress for my check.  We had a movie to see and didn't have time to wait another 10 minutes for her to return.  Our water glasses stayed empty after being filled because of lack of service.  I tried to rush the door and pay at the counter so I could wrap up this disappointment.  It took much longer than I wanted.  I did get a roll for almost free (I had to pay for the two original rolls and got almost a 100% discount on the remake of one of those two original rolls).  I thought the waitress wanted me to be grateful that I didn't have to pay for the remake, unfortunately I am not that charitable and expected that when you mess up food preparation, deny you did so, make the customer repeatedly point out the mistake and repeatedly demand the fix that I am not thankful after all that for getting what most restaurants deliver on the first try.

Parking is free but can get packed. The ice rink next door allows parking, or so it seems. 

People cannot bring in any food/drinks, except for water.  Many families pack coolers and leave for a bit to snack on their own foods. Snack bar prices are high but as expected.  Lockers are $7 for a day rental.

Meats: Um, all were dry with no flavor...they put the BBQ sauce there to make it seem less dry and to overpower everything, but it's ultimately a horrible cover up for horrible food. Only meat that was passable was the veal. Very soft and yum.

-unique rolls to this establishment

I am getting a bit sentimental with this review.  So lets get to the food.

Shumai= BOMB!!! I can eat this all day and all night.  I just love Great Wall's dim sum.  The only place that beat out their dim sum is a place in San Francisco- that tells you how great Great Wall is. 

They recently remodeled their bathroom - thank Confucius!  It is now nice and clean.  Hopefully stay nice and clean.

We just got done with the never-ending halls at the Christmas show.  I was defying all traffic laws and regulations just to make it here before 3 (brunch is from 11-3). 

As I was dashing into the door at 7mins before 3, they sat us at one of the loungy couch area immediately.  The waiter knew we were to order brunch and took our orders promptly and calmly.  He was very attentive and helpful through our meal.  Definitely thumbs up on the service (I forgot to catch his name)

We shared 3 dishes: shrimp and grits, chicken and waffle, and southern biscuit with gravy and sausage (added an egg for $1).  Here is my verdict on the food:

Best dish is chicken and waffle.  3 small pieces (2 pieces of wings and 1 thigh meat) fried super crispy yet moist (at least the wings I was eating). The waffle is fluffy. All for $9 which is quite reasonable. 

Best side item is sage rope sausage. Very tasty. I can probably eat an entire plate of them. Not too salty, the casing is just crispy enough. Just simple pork greatness. 

Worst side item is biscuit.  I guess I am used to flaky buttery bo biscuit. This is a little chewy and doughy.  

Least worthy dish is the shrimp and grits.  It wasn't horrible, but for $12 it was disappointing. It looks and smells like awesomeness in a bowl, yet it was more bland than I would ever imagine.

When you first see the restaurant, you might get a little confused. The front of the restaurant is a pawn/jewelry shop of sorts that make you question if you are at the right place. You entire this shop and there is a door in the back (which looks like an employee entrance) that leads to the main restaurant. The restaurant is dimly lit with different shaped mirrors all around the walls; it has the ambiance of an old-time European royal's mansion. 

We started off the night with drinks. I had a Ruby Iced Tea, a virgin cocktail, which was highly refreshing. The red currant tea was flavorful and the lemon juice gave it the hint of acidity that the drink needed. The mint leaves also gave the drink it the refreshing kick it needed, especially with the weather being over 100 degrees outside.

Most of the plates here are served tapas style, so our table of four got a total of 7 plates and 2 desserts. To start the night off, we had a half dozen East and West Coast Oysters. The oysters may have been small in size, but they were fresh. Next, the Steak Toast came out. This had a slight kick to it from the serrano pepper. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, allowing it to be juicy. It was lightly seasoned, allowing the Malaysian spices to be the star. 

As the night went on, we had Grilled Double Cut Lamb Chops, Short Rib Mac & Cheese, and Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta. The lamb chops were also medium rare and was very tender and juicy. It  had a delicious wine glaze and was served over creamy grits. The lamb cut like butter and was flavorful on its own, but the glaze accentuated the natural flavors of the lamb. The grits gave a different texture to the dish, which it needed. The Mac & Cheese was delicious; though it was not the best I've ever had, it was still good. It was filled with chunks of short rib, not just small, thin shreds, which was impressive. The Mac & Cheese tasted like it was made of a Parmesan base, with hints of truffle oil. With the creaminess of the Mac & Cheese, the cornbread crust that topped it gave it a different texture that the dish needed. The Mushroom Pizzetta was also very tasty; the crust had a nice crunch with juicy mushrooms that topped it.

After these 5 dishes, we were still hungry, so we got BBQ fries and Garganelli. These two dishes were both mediocre. The fries were heavily seasoned, making it hard to eat many of them at the same time. The Garganelli's sauce was very rich and sweet; and though I like meat sauces, this sauce had too much meat since it felt like there was more meat than pasta. 

To finish the night off, we had ""les nyc"" Doughnuts, which were fried perfectly and not too sweet. It came with caramel, chocolate, and berry sauces. The caramel and chocolate sauces were good and very rich and sweet, while the berry was lighter and did not overpower the flavors of the doughnut. We also had the Root Beer Shots, which was dangerously good because it tasted like a regular root beer float.

All in all, the entire experience was amazing. Though some of the foods had some short comings, most of the food we ate were delicious.",2017-07-17 19:58:58

We have been going to Tommy Bahama's about twice per month since then, and each time has been good, with the exception of this last time.  

Things started off okay, we got our table, got our appetizers, and all was good.  But then the steak came.  My girlfriend just thinks it was overcooked, but it tasted like much cheaper meat to me.  The filet was bland and stringy.  And the sweet potatoes were actually the same, tasteless and stringy.  Odd, but true.  The whole meal was sort of so-so.  

The service was okay, but there was something not quite right.  The staff seemed on edge.  It was a weird feeling, like they were just not happy to be there.  And then the topper; my girlfriend put some sweet potato on a smaller plate to try them out, and some women came by and snatched her plate of food away.  She still had her food on it, and the woman never asked if we wanted it taken away.  The woman was wearing a pink polo shirt, so she looked more like one of the managers than a server.  We thought about complaining, but it just felt like maybe it wasn't worth it.  

Not to look to much into this, but I wonder if the place is having financial issues, so the food is not as good and the people are on edge.  Either way, it's a shame because this was a regular place for us to hang out for a nice dinner out, and we would usually grab some stuff from the store after the meal.

Last night my husband and I went for our anniversary.  The staff was super as usual.  Barry  was a great server and helped us pick.  Everything looked so good.  I got the pan seared sea bass and it just melted in my mouth like butter- the corn grits and blackberry were the perfect touch to complete the dish.

The place is very simple.  Not stuffy at all but just enough- class and casual.  Even though it's a smaller dinning room they have it sectioned off well that you are not hanging out with the table next to you.

******* 

like any true french restaurant (and italian), the moka was served to complete a meal. a miniature french pressed coffee for me (cappuccino and espresso are other options) and a pot of white chinese herbal tea for the hubby, accompanied by a complimentary surprise birthday cake, were presented to us. the coffee was quite delicious and strong but never with that bitter after taste. by then we were full, but this cake was phenomenal, the BEST THING I EVER ATE! this white cake was layered with fresh cream, passion fruit filling, mango sauce and meringue. i don't eat mango and i am partial to the sweetness of meringue, but the moment this cake touched my mouth, i knew i could die happily. 

there are some notable things to elaborate in this review; the much talked about carts. there are 4 different carts being wheeled around throughout the dinner. all servers memorized each and every item on all 4 carts (that's like over 200 names)...quite a challenging task. 

the first was the bread cart which seriously had more variety than any bakery i've visited. once we selected our choices, the waiter warmed them up before bringing them to our table. they were very generous with the bread and we enjoyed a few different types, but our favorites were the bacon epi baguette and cheese brioche. also, the french butter and olive oil were nothing like we had before, even in europe. 

the mignardise cart which was stationed in front of the entrance ever beautifully was presented to us. we let the waiter use his magic and knowledge to pick the best for us. unfortunately, we could not consume more than 1 out of 10 pieces after that BEST EVER cake. our waiter kindly packaged these tiny, bite-sized desserts to take home along with two boxes of citrus and berry marshmallows (i can tell you that these are not your every day marshmallows!) and a colorful booklet showcasing joel robuchon las vegas. 

the cheese cart which we did not partake in, looked quite impressive. i could smelled the pungent cheese a mile away. they were paired with nuts and pieces of fruits. 

the last was a cart designated for tea. not only did this house a variety of dry tea leaves, it had live potted tea plants, from lemon grass to mint. all i could say was ""omg...unbelievable...omg!"" the waiter would cut the leaves of your choice, wearing white gloves, and serve the tea in a pot, heated and stayed warm by a candle. 


another food item we were impressed by was the mashed potato which was served with our main course. this was pure butter (i don't want to know how much of butter was used here), and we could've had a bucket of this and more. 

one last thing that made our experience at joel robuchon more memorable and unforgettable was the people who were dining around us. a table of chinese family in flannel shirt, fishing vest and white shocks (this is 100% true although i would not recommend this attire), paying everything in cash, a table of two jewish businessmen in fine italian suits sharing their experiences at pierre gagnaire and alain ducasse in paris, taking pictures of every dish for their wives, a table of a lone lady with french accent gormandizing the degustation menu ever graciously, a table of persians with their colorful ties, talking and laughing about how much they were down (i admire their good nature even when they lost so much), and a table of older couple congratulating our celebration of birthdays, envying the BEST EVER cake.  who's counting the michelin stars and aaa five diamonds?  this was a place that never tried to display an air of snobbishness you often face in other restaurants of this caliber. everyone talked to each other no matter where you came from. 

at the end of the meal, we were escorted back to the mansion where a silver limo was waiting to take us back. the driver asked, ""did you take a picture with mr. robuchon?"" WHAT? the man was there? i guess it never hurts to ask. we found out the chef of the century usually shows up for long weekends when vegas gets busy. 

i cannot wait to take this journey again. we cherished every minute of our dining experience here. we were treated more like friends surrounds by people who enjoy lives as much as we do. when you are here, take a look around the restaurant. amidst the ritzy extravagance, you'll see and appreciate the personal touches of joel robuchon everywhere.",2011-02-28 17:15:22

It wasn't busy when we went it, a few peeps at the bar, but all the booths at the back were full.  We settled at one of the tables near the front, then scored the window table after this couple had left. 

Drinks:
We ordered two ceasers. They came literally within 4 mins. They were tasty and had horseradish and a nice kick to them.  After moving to the window table, we ordered a pitcher of cider... it's $20 for the pitcher which I thought was decent.

Food:
I was torn between the nachos and the burger. Since I didn't want anything super heavy, I opted for the nachos which the server said were really good.
My bf ordered the fried chicken with the side of mac and cheese.

Food came at a decent speed.  I ordered the guac on the side for $2 extra.  I would not do that again. There was nothing special about it and it was kind of brown. The nachos are home made, which was nice. They also do the layer thing with the cheese and toppings which is essential when getting nachos.. but I didn't feel like the first layer was baked long enough b/c the cheese wasn't completely melted. But I didn't really mind, I love nachos and cheese so I'll pretty much eat anything with that combo. NOTE: the jalapenos ARE HOT. They are fresh and weren't soft or brined out of a jar. Great - but hot. Thick slices too. 

The fried chicken - 3 big pieces including a huge breast.. it also came with a side of mac and cheese which was steaming hot and a little cup of broccoli slaw which was dilly and delicious.  More of that please!

The chicken was cooked perfectly, not greasy and had a rosemary gravy with it.  Not personally the flavour of gravy that I would have chose to go with fried chicken, but I have never ordered it before from a resto. I thought maybe a peppercorn gravy would have been good. The chicken was nice but didn't necessarily have any flavour that jumped out at you. Know what I mean? The mac and cheese was awesome and garlicy.  A must order if you love mac and cheese. 

Needless to say I will go back and try a few other things on the menu. The food was good, the service was attentive and I like the atmosphere and the mugshots on the wall.

Like most awesome popular places, be prepared to pay for it...especially in Vegas.  I went with a buddy and we split the steak and lobster tacos.  Lord those lobster tacos were little as hell! They definitely serve small portion apps to get you to the higher prices entrees.  Nonetheless, they were both amazing tasting.

I paired my dinner with a top shelf margarita, which was fabulous and strong.  Service was pretty good.  All in all...thumbs up Flay! I'll be back.

You were able to watch your food being made in front of your eyes which I thought was unique and that brought in some specialty to your food. The overall food quality of the food was great, however when it came to dessert I picked up a waffle and when I ate it, it was ice cold. I complained and they offered me a hot one..I wasn't too concerned because maybe the woman forgot to throw this one out. It wasn't such a big deal.

I really liked how the servers were attentive and consistently took our plates away. And brought our drinks fast and prepared right.

I know they just took tables apart and just put two chairs together in the middle of the section. It was a FIRST DATE too..so we both laughed at the awkward seating.

We dined here a few weeks ago and left feeling...underwhelmed.  Service provided by the brother and sister duo was friendly; however, the food, although decent, was a bit too Westernized for my taste.  As another Yelper has mentioned, the portions are too small for the advertised prices.  

We ordered the following (shared between five adults and one child):  1) beef noodle soup (similar to the Vietnamese pho / $6); 2) lok lac beef (marinated pan fried cubes of beef / $8); 3) chicken fried rice ($8); 4) pleah (beef salad $10); 5) bbq platter (shrimp & beef skewers, chicken wings / $14); and 6) pork/pate sandwich ($5).  

The good:
* entrees were presented beautifully on green plates reminiscent of banana leaves
* with the exception of the pleah (beef salad), the food looked good and tempting
* with the exception of the lok lac beef, food arrived in a fairly timely manner 
* the beef skewers were delicious (can really taste the flavor of the marinade, especially the lemongrass)
* iced coffee I ordered was good (albeit a bit weaker than the Viet kind / $3)
* basil seed drink was good (and interesting to look at / $2)
* as previously mentioned, service was friendly
* the restaurant is decorated appropriately with Cambodian items

The bad:
* while the rest of the entrees arrived within 20 minutes after ordering, my lok lac beef was brought to the table an HOUR later
* the portion size of the lok lac beef is more indicative of a lunch serving, not dinner 
* the flavor of the lok lac was decent, but not as robust as usual (perhaps the beef cubes weren't given enough time to marinate)
* the pleah (beef salad) was TOO tart and had us thinking, ""where's the beef?"" (it did not look nor tasted like the traditional pleah we're used to - Cambodian beef ceviche) 
* bring your sunglasses because the lighting in the restaurant is bright!!!

I know it makes sense to tone down some of the Cambodian flavors, but it's too toned down for my taste.  With that said, if you've not had Cambodian food, Sekong would be a good introduction to the dishes of Cambodia.  Sekong is to be commended for offering Cambodian food to valley residents.  

For authentic Cambodian cuisine, you'll have to go to the LA area.  They don't care about toning down the flavors there to suit Western tastes, because shoot, there are loads of Asians to fill up their restaurants.

(In addition to the food pics from Sekong, I also posted a pic of lok lac beef I ordered from one of the LA restaurants...for comparison.)",2012-04-21 04:04:10

What exactly makes this the nicest, most luxurious mall in Charlotte?  The stores.  How would I know?  Well, although, I'm your typical, red-blooded, football tossing, American male, I also have a mom and that mom loves to shop.

The bread service was good with a whipped butter. My Caesar salad was good as the salad dressing had a great flavor.

I ordered the filet which was accompanied by green beans and mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the fish and chips. We both really liked the potatoes .

For dessert, I ordered the blondie brownie. It was accidentally served with cinnamon ice cream instead of vanilla, but it worked and was tasty. My husband ordered the chocolate lava cake and really enjoyed it.

""Firmly bite down on the edge of the cap with your rear molars, but don't try to pry it off, not unless you want to break a tooth. Instead, bite down firmly, then  simply lift the bottle toward your cheek and voila, you're a human church key.""

I've spewed this wisdom for years, and now, here I sit with one missing molar and another in need of a tug. 
Go figure.

Dr. Daches, much to my chagrin does not do implants, but he did recommend the same guy he sent his daughter to.
Diane, my hygienist has to be one of the happiest people I've ever met. She routinely hummed a beautiful melody throughout my cleaning, and the funny thing was how no music was playing in the office...only her. 
At one point, I felt like a swarm of bluebirds were about to swoop in and assist her, like  a scene from a Disney movie or something.

I enjoyed my brief visit with Diane and the doctor. Diane actually gave me hope once again.....
That the world isn't such a bad place after all.
That some people are truly happy.
And, that with a little practice using an actual bottle opener, molars #17 and #18 might have a happier ending than did their counterparts, #31 and #32.

Disclaimer: Routinely popping off bottle caps is in direct conflict with the ADA's guidelines for proper care and maintenance of your teeth. I strongly urge you not to try this.

We enjoy the feeling like we are on vacation even though we are in our own ""backyard"" and it's a fabulous way to keep cool and enjoy some family time together.  I saw Big Surf on Arizona Highways TV Show and was so glad we decided to give it a try this summer.

My only complaint is that if you do not arrive early, it can be hard to find chairs/lounge chairs to use to put your stuff but for the most part you are in the water and we have on occassion put towels on the grassy area and left our stuff, it's always pleasant there and even though it's old it's fun to imagine what it must have been like when it opened up in the 1950's.  It can use some updating but it's very clean, the water is always very clean and they have a lot of staff all over and free life vests for the kids, the rentals for rafts are so reasonable and they even give you coupons when you buy the season pass for discounts off the food, ice cream as well as the rental fees.  I think if you live in AZ it's a no brainer to pick up a season pass, even if you only go a few times you will get your money's worth.

To finish our meal, my boyfriend and I had the Coconut Cake. Yum. Decadence in one bite kind of yum. It is a moist cake with coconut sided with coconut pudding and dark chocolate swirled around. Need I say more? Our friends had the Smores: smores with peanut butter and chocolate dipped bacon. I think its a bit weird and not a fan, but they loved it.

I've actually been to D One twice but all that is on my mind is their Ox Tail Pho!  Now for most stereotypical asians paying more than $10 for a bowl of Pho is insane unless you are at the TI on the strip but this bowl is worth every penny of its 11.95 price tag.

On work days when I'm having an ox tail soup craving and can't make it out to the California with an 11pm Ox Tail start time, I'm S-O-L but now I get to go to District One for the best of both worlds - Ox Tail and Pho.  Genius - yah, i know.

The soup is so rich from all the fat tender ox tail goodness falling off the bones as you gently prick it with your chopsticks. Im getting off thinking about it as we speak.  Anyhow go check it out.

Oh yah they do have other things like the Shaking Beef Salad, or Shaking Beef Steak and Eggs, Cornish Hen.  Everything here is pretty good but the first thing I'd order is their Ox Tail Pho!",2014-11-25 07:03:46

And you know my Yelping style, friend or not so friendly, I'm candid in my writing. 
In addition to their wonderful and immense collection of art, they will also be teaching art classes in their upstairs area. 
And participating in First Fridays with vendors, live performers & vendors.

I was looking for a great place for a first date/birthday celebration, and I was torn between Rokerij and Hillstone. I contacted Gabi, to ask her what her expert opinion would be, and she was kind enough to recommend Beckett's Table (BT), and put me in touch with the manager to get a good reservation (Gabi-you rock!).

Arriving at BT at 7:30, the reservation was there with no problems, and we were seated at a cozy table off to the side. Our server, Josh, was great and explained the specials and got our drink orders. I had the Palmaire, and it was very, very good. So good, that I started thinking that my car might spend the night in Arcadia, while I cab it home.

For dinner, I had the short ribs, and my date had the green chili stew. Thanks to Yelper recommendations, we added the mac&cheese side dish. All the food was outstanding, and my date was awesome, she was beautiful, smart, and funny (in case you were wondering).

I found the prices very reasonable for the portions, and the quality of the food. I am confused by complaints that it is pricey, it is easily less expensive than Houston's, Rokerij, etc. There is a reason this place has so much buzz, and it is well deserved. 

The one thing I would suggest as an improvement, would be to do a little something when people make reservations and note a special event. A good example is Durant's when you make a reservation, they always ask if you're celebrating anything, and if you are, Durant's is kind enough to provide a comped dessert of their choosing. Don't get me wrong, I am not dissing BT, just making a suggestion. If you've been to Durant's and experienced it, it really is a nice, classy touch that keeps everyone coming back.

I went on a Sunday afternoon.  I really should've read Teej's review before doing that, but alas, I did not.  I'd been there briefly sometime during a weekday to pick up comfort food (garlic bread and cookies) after a particularly traumatic afternoon of state employment testing and the DMV, and it hadn't been that bad.  But Sunday?  Oh, god.  Oh, not Sundays.  I swear that people were actually trying to aim their cart into mine.  Everyone ambled around slowly and aimlessly like zombies on barbiturates.  They would plod along at .001mph and then stop and stare for 5 minutes at the rack of tomatoes.  They wouldn't move when you tried to reach around them for the tomatoes you also needed.  Take this experience at the tomato stand and multiply it by every place you needed to stop and get something.  I wasn't one of the zombies, and my Sunday-Meijers experience took me over an hour to escape.

Also, I had the bad luck of happening to need things that were on sale, so they were out or almost out.  Like Prego and tofu.  And why didn't they have any bricks of Mozzarella?  That wasn't even on sale, it was just inexplicably absent.

Came here to catch up with a couple friends, so the ambiance and environment was pretty good for that (though the music did get a bit loud at times!). 

Came here a little earlier than our reservation time, but the hostess was super nice and seated us right away. Went straight upstairs to a more open area and had nice seats with the sun coming in through the windows!
We were also waiting on one person to show up, as they were a little late, but our server was extremely patient and accommodating, waited and explained the menus to us (you're awesome Diane)!

I was personally not as hungry as I normally would be at that time of the night, so I just ordered a pasta. The Farfalle was amazing! We actually ordered 3 for our table as we each got the same dish! The mix of the bowtie pasta with the tomatoes and wild boar bacon was inspiring. The different tastes and textures came together in perfect harmony, making the dish complete with parmesan cheese on top.

Good selection of beers and wines, and even had half priced bottles on special! Server was knowledgeable, explaining each drink you had questions about, and giving an easy to understand answer.

Once you finish your food, you can raise the small flag at your table and ask the server for anything you like - definitely be sure to try out the sopapillas!

I had the stewed lamb shank & my wife had the eggplant borani.  Both were served with the traditional Kabuli brown basmati rice.  The food was good.  The only thing that I would note is that it was a little excessive on the butter, but otherwise good.  

I never expected an Afghani restaurant in suburbia, but even I am now convinced (perceptions are not everything).  My wife and I were originally skeptical at the view from the street (hidden inside a strip mall just South of the hospital).  It looks very casual, like a sports bar.  This was not the case.  I am guessing that prior to this restaurant, this location was some kind of bar or some kind of fast food restaurant.

Interestingly, my wife and I had a Groupon for this restaurant, but in the end we decided to just pay the check and not use Groupon.  Usually we only use Groupon when the restaurant does not show promise (as the restaurant is effectively selling at a loss when they use Groupon).  In this case, we believe the restaurant to be of good value, and using Groupon would not be fair.  

Since the food is slightly unique, as it is Afghani (a combination of Middle East / Persian + Indian subcontinent) I would like to see some decorations hinting at the Afghani culture.  Perhaps a poster or enlarged photo of Bamiyan (or a Kabul or Kandahar street scene), or of former King Zaher Shah, would be a nice touch, if done tastefully. I have no doubt that Afghanistan is a wonderful country with a deep and rich culture (despite the turmoil and war it has seen).  This restaurant would be a perfect place to show some unique cultural things on walls.  

I say this because Afghani culture and food is unique, and you do not want to get lost in the ""sea"" of other Middle Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants in The Valley.  This will help with market distinction in regard to competing, and showing what is different.  And attracting new customers.

I definitely hope that this restaurant is a success and continues to succeed moving forward.",2014-08-22 14:41:54

The dish was heavily influenced by both Chinese and French cooking. Rice noodle and spices were imported from China; the French popularized the eating of red meat. It is believed that ""pho"" is originated from ""pot au feu"" a French soup. Vietnamese cooks blended the Chinese, French and native influences to make a dish that is uniquely Vietnamese.

Stopped in to Bowl of Pho with my co-worker today and we learned how to say Pho correctly.  It's pronounced, 'fa'.  Anyway, I ordered the Com Chiên - Fried Rice with shrimp.  Mark ordered the Pho Tái - Beef noodle with beef eye round.  Mark liked his Pho and after he added some of the sauces into the Pho, he liked it even more.  My fried rice was sticky and tasty.  The five shrimp were perfectly cooked and delicious, but the portion could have been larger.  I mean, you get a ton of Pho in a bowl dishes, but not a ton of rice in the stir fry dishes.

Anyway, the quality of ingredients is outstanding here.  The food is really good and the service is solid.  With tip, lunch was $13.80 with water to drink.

I'd heard of it before, but hadn't ever felt like making the trek out here from Glendale.  On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.


Yes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.

There was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.

The place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.

The food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.

The Salmon Sashimi was really fresh. Its thinly cut but each piece was really big. So it has this nice sweet taste to it. 

The toro was nice. I found it cut too thin. Unagi sushi was amazing. The unagi was so big. Flames roll was not bad. I liked the fact it had sweet chili sauce. Chopped Scallop roll was yummy. Lots of scallop but I did find it too much mayo. I think they kind of over did it. 
The sashimi pizza was delicious. I loved how the rice was fried and so it had a really nice crunch to it.  BC roll and spicy salmon roll were ok.

I was looking for something sweet, something French, actually, and was heading to the Herb Box to see what kind of goodies I could find to take home to supply my brain w/ much-needed glucose (the organ's favored source of sugar!) when the Yelp app alerted me of the ""seasonal"" bread pudding at Tryst.  I called to ask which variety was available today and was told it was chocolate chip.

As soon as the plate arrived, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=lmo2yH4mjOSzbhlZ0Vyi_w I remembered it was an item I had tried on the first visit- I felt disappointment at the sight of it, so I knew I must not have enjoyed it that much the first time around.  Well, I'm usually all about second chances, so I dug in.  It's alright.  I like the crispy-crusty bits that also had chocolate chunks the most.  The caramel and chocolate garnishes were just OK, as well.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=OPYRdqh1SVyR_nc7cWrWSw
Was hoping the caramel would remind me of the wonderful goodness I experienced last week at Citizen Public House.  No such luck, but really, how could that even be a realistic expectation?

I've just placed my order for the BBQ Bacon burger, minus the BBQ sauce (it contains mustard, and the gluten-free version contains corn syrup).  Happy hour (4p to close) subtracts $3 off all burgers on the menu!  Drink specials sound good, but I'm forgoing alcohol, as I've already consumed a lot of sugar by eating all the great bits of one of the bread pudding triangles.

Stay tuned for my burger report (and photos).

Update:  The BBQ bacon burger, w/ the BBQ sauce on the side, was OK.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=CFaFmlACU4OzZ7XVZt5flQ
The pecan-smoked bacon added some flavor to what would've been an otherwise  bland burger.  Too bad I couldn't try the sauce, as server Ryan made it sound like it tasted really good.  I liked the brioche bun best when it had that toasted texture.  The beef is all-natural, no hormones added, but isn't ground in-house (the patties come from Washington, I believe).  No matter- it was good enough.  Ask for medium if you like your burgers tender and pink throughout.  I requested the accompanying sweet potato fries (you get a choice of side) to be extra-crispy.  I first found them a bit boring, but I grew to like them as I ate more pieces.  Not the best I've had, but certainly not the worst, either.  The crispness was perfect.  As a Yelp friend noted, after seeing the photos, that the burger looked better than the bread pudding, and that the serving of fries looked a bit skimpy.  My sentiments, exactly.",2012-02-22 01:02:33

The pavilion holds a good amount of seating along with the general admission lawn seating.  Like every other event center, the concession prices are a little high but we can all expect it.  The staff at the concessions were all friendly with generous pours for mixed drinks.  

The security team didn't like the fact we had a GoPro recording some of the show.  It's hard to understand the difference with people recording with a phone.  They didn't have any issues with phone recording...  or pot smoking.  I didn't see one security man tell the people around us to put it out.

The food was fantastic. The concept of consistency is ever present in Wolfgang Puck's restaurants. There are never anything too crazy, but it is always solid. My friend and I decided to split a few dishes to try everything out. The buratta and proscuitto is decent. I was hoping that the outside of the cheese had more of a consistency. Instead, the whole piece had the feel of ricotta. The gnocchi in tomato sauce is splendid though. The bite sized pillows of potato flour and cheese are heavenly. The grilled octopus is melt in your mouth tender. At this point, I was full, but we keep pushing on. The pork chop and pork belly with apple compote is amazing. So is the osso bucco. Both main items are the best offerings on the menu. I was stuffed to the brim, but dessert was ordered. The cheesecake was light and I could have polished one off in state.

I wanted something asian for lunch and was on my way to the wonderful dim sum place down central when I saw BOGO sushi.  So, I stopped and went in.  The fish at the sushi bar looked good, so I decided to eat there.

The ambiance felt like it was recently something else and they just painted over it and added a fountain.  It took a second for me to be seated, but my waitress was quite responsive.

I opened the sushi menu to see that most of the rolls were about twice the price they should be(at least for this side of town), so this BOGO was really ""you have to buy twice as much to get it for the normal price.""  I tried to order some hand rolls, but they said that wasn't included in BOGO.  So, then I tried to order some nigiri, that wasn't included either.  I asked, why does it say BOGO sushi, and the waitress told me sushi meant rolls.  I quickly corrected her and stated that no, sushi means rice.  I probably shouldn't have done that, but I don't like misinformation.

I was feeling kind of cheap but was really hungry so I went with the hibachi chicken.  There were many other options, and I guess I chose the worst.

First I got my salad, nothing special, but not bad.  Then came my food, a nice sized plate of food.  Little bits of chicken and such with a nice sized order of rice.  Oh, it was so dry, I really didn't enjoy it at all.  I guess I should have gone with the over-priced sushi, but I doubt I will return to find out.

This place had been the local Domino's restaurant, closed, and now a hot dog stand.  They were still working out the kinks but from what I experienced, this place should be a hit.  The restaurant looks like an old gas station with Gulf fuel pumps as trash cans and lots of metal sign graffiti on the walls.  Inside, there is a small place to sit with high top tables, another gas pump and that's about it.  The servers and chefs yell out ""Welcome to D-Moes!"" kinda like they do at that other Moe's.

They have various combinations of hot dogs and burgers.

One sauce was extra spicy, their was a mustard flavor, and then a regular bbq sauce. I think they could do some improvement with their sauce flavors. The brisket and Mac came out next. I really loved the Mac n cheese. It had a good flavor and the crust on top was a perfect crunch. The brisket was pretty good. It was a little dry and did come with quite a bit of fat but it had a pretty good flavor. I will come back again to try them again with a few different things from the menu but hope the bbq sauces change maybe in the future!",2018-07-02 21:51:53

Tintoretto is located at the Grand Canal Shoppes inside the Venetian.  There is also a restaurant inside, but we were here for the bakery.  When you walk inside, the baked goods look so very inviting inside their display cases.  Everything looked so good.

I finally decided to give their pecan tart a try.  It did not disappoint, and it was one of the best pecan tarts that I have ever eaten.  Probably the second best that I have ever had the pleasure of trying.  Even the price of $4.75 was affordable.  Being at the Venetian, I expected the price to be much higher.  The portion was just right.  Not big, but not small either.  Three of us were able to share it.  The pecan tart was not overly sweet.  Crust was so yummy.  We thoroughly enjoyed sharing it at one of their tables outside the shop.  People watching while snacking made for an awesome combination.

Well, I cannot give my opinion on any other of the food items here because I only had that awesome pecan tart.  I can say that the bakery was very clean and organized.  The service provided by the woman who helped us was exemplary!

Amazing where life takes you at times. We found ourselves in the area without a vehicle thanks to ours getting a flat tire today. Too icy to walk around where we ended up so a business across the road had recommended this restaurant to us. Upon looking at it, one could be quite certain due to its name that it is something similar to German but you would not know how quaint it is inside until you go in!
It was not too busy initially but almost a full house it was when we left. That has got to say something!
This is a family run business with the emphasis on Austrian food. Normally, I would not choose to come here unless invited as I usually love my food to be bold, spicy and in your face. But, fate ruled, this is where we ate and I am so glad for it!
The owner was our server and host - she could not have been more kind, welcoming, thoughtful or intuitive of our needs.
Wine was needed on a this hectic day and the house red (Castillo) was fantastic at $10 a glass. We had to take a cab home so what the hell, I had 2 glasses. Hubby had Dab, an Austrian beer that he had never had before and loved it, said it was nice and light.
We ordered the Haus schnitzel with fries for him ($24) and I got the traditional wiener schnitzel ($21). Mine, pounded ever so thin was larger than the plate (pic to follow!) and I got fries and salad served on the side. Man, the food was good here. I can never eat a whole plate of food, but I did on this date! The fries were perfectly golden and the salad was interesting in a good way. Purple cabbage, potato salad with dill, lettuce, coleslaw, cukes, all in one little bowl. The pork schnitzel was so good with lemon wedges. The breading is very simple, just bread crumbs (the meat is seasoned, not the breadcrumbs), but done right. All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked SO good! Hubby`s pork was not quite as pounded out as mine and was stuffed with Swiss cheese, ham and fresh mushrooms!
The water for the table (no charge!) had an herbal flavour to it - it was like a basil or mint leaf in it, something like that.
I love family run businesses and this place was just so out of the ordinary for us, it was a welcome change!

Located on Queen W, this place looks smaller from the outside.  There is decent enough seating inside so you don't feel crowded.

The brunch menu is pretty simple - a few egg dishes, a special (it was chicken stew the day I went).

My friend had the East meets West egg dish. It's braised lamb, eggplants, herbs with eggs any way you like it.  All the egg dishes come with bread and jams/ricotta spread.  I'm not a big fan of eggs but wow this dish was flavorful from the lamb and herbs they used - melt in your mouth delicious- my friend wiped her plate clean.  The ingredients all blended in beautiful to create a hearty dish.

I decided to go with their special that day - chicken stew with fennel.  It comes with rice and bread.  It was yummolicious!  The perfect stick to your ribs stew on a cold day.  It reminded me of almost a Moroccan stew.  The nice touch was the hint of fennel - gave it some depth of flavor without being over powering.

So of course after brunch we had to try their gelato!  They let you sample their unique flavors as much as you want.  The day we were there they had such flavors as grilled cheese, Mexican chocolate, strawberry/Thai basil/juniper; pad Thai and fish sauce (was surprisingly good with a nice kick at the end, no fishy taste at all !), blackberry/cocoa (I had this one and it was a nice fresh palate cleanser) and several other interesting flavors.  I believe the selection changes every once in awhile and you can buy pints at their location to indulge at home.

Staff here mostly seems to be college students themselves, as are most of their customers- not a bad thing, just an observation. Bummed that this location doesn't have margaritas the way some others do, but that probably again goes back to their primary customer base being at a college.

If it's in the winter, I don't know if you would want to wait out there...granted this winter was warmer than usual. The layout and display of the whole joint is pretty cool and colourful.

Desserts...weeellll they have a full variety as you can see from the other reviews and pictures. Waffles, crepes, ice creams, cakes, sundaes and drinks both hot and cold. Interesting names too. They taste great within the first few bites and then they become overwhelmingly strong and super sweet. I wouldn't say I'm a dessert addict but I never say no to desserts and I do love them. Coming here is like a meal in itself though; a dessert meal. I always finish my plate but boy am I stuffed and do I feel super horrible like I gained 1000 calories just for that. But all that aside it's a nice place if you want your dessert craving to be cured in one shot! Prices are reasonable as well.

I come here once in awhile but I don't hate it or love it like it's to die for.",2016-02-29 13:21:54

Super pleased I went here today!! I got the pulled chicken sammy and the sweet potatoes.  Honestly- at first I though it was too expensive ( $14 with tax) for a quick lunch but it was SO worth the money.The portions were a perfect size too!
I went at lunch time and I was worried it would take long but I ordered my food and only had to wait about 3-5 min even though the place was packed. 
The food itself was really tasty- The chicken was moist and the toppings on the sammy were all fresh and OH MAN that bun-- I can honestly say it was some of the best bread I have ever had. 

Over all I am super happy I went and I will be back for a salad bowl next.

Now go on and flock to flock! ( sorry I had to)",2015-08-06 19:00:48

PRO: 
-Comfy ass bed complete with thick memory foam. Oh baby.
-Kitchen in suite! That includes a stove and a fridge! Pretty snazzy.
-Art books on the shelves to read and interesting art sculptures. 

CON: 
-NO casino. The friends that I went with wanted to stay in a hotel without a casino because of the smoke. The hotel was cool because it didnt smell like cigs, but no casino? :[ I was a sad panda. What is this asian girl supposed to do when its 3am and you cant sleep? Le sigh!
-While there was a full kitchen, the toaster in our room was broken (RIP my poptart).

Definitely a clean hotel and the service was great. The rooms were very spacious and well taken care of. While this is not usually my go to place when I go to vegas, it is not bad for the price.

Let m break it down - bread is delicious and fresh. 

Hot Table - it's bland, looks reheated and greasy. They serve arancini but they are so unauthentic they call them rice balls and if you do call them arancini they girls behind the counter just stare at you. I've had almost everything there and one of the worst things there is their meatballs with taste like pulverized meat without any sort of seasoning or fat.The pasta are incredibly bland and the sausage has an odd mealy texture instead of being hearty and juicy. 

I always get the chicken parm and potatoe wedges. 

The coffee - is terrible. The barista is adorable and incredibly very very nice - he's the young guy who just looks like he can't wait for his break. However even on his break he works and is always lending a helping hand. 

The cashiers are genuinely nice and happy to see you from my multiple experiences. 

However I will not be returning. The last time I was there, a middle aged man took it upon himself follow me around the store and refuse to give me my purchase or coffee till I finished at the cash register. That's not how I've ever been treated prior to and I felt very aware that I was the only coloured person in the store and he only did that for me.

The décor / ambiance reminded me of all the reasons I moved away from Idaho.  Immediately when you walk in there is a giant painting of a barn - and scattered bales of hay covered in grandma's quilts... if that doesn't remind you of home cookin' I don't know what will.

We were seated, and as I perused the menu, nothing was sticking out as appetizing.  Finally I settled on the reuben, which was recommended by our waitress, a lifer, who was actually really sweet and funny.  In regards to service, at least her service, I would give this joint five stars.  

The corned beef on the sando was delicious, and the kraut was well seasoned.  Overall, it was one of the better reubens I've had here on the west coast.  The other item our table ordered that got rave reviews was the chicken fried chicken and club sandwich.

I think, in this case, I just cannot get past the decor.  It looked exactly like the majority of restaurants that Chef Ramsey walks into before making Kitchen Nightmare makeover suggestions.  Random shoddy wooden chickens and dusty relics you'd see in a thrift store for good reason.

We were the dupes that didn't know some of our friends were gonna be here, so we came earlier than the large group, and another Yelper came with his family. It was accidental Yelper takeover time or something. Hehee. 

While the $20 menu is just this week, all these items can be had a la carte on their regular menu so it'll still be a relevant review even after. And if you live under a rock like that Geico commercial, Restaurant Week has participating restaurants have pre fixe menus with a portion benefiting Three Square that happens twice a year (spring and fall).

Starter-
Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup- it's a interesting tomato soup in that it doesn't taste predominantly of tomato, but had a sort've tom yum flavoring to it which was different and exciting. 
Watermelon Goat Cheese Salad- watermelon makes for a refreshing salad and that's all good and fine, but what did this one up was the crunchy candied wasabi. It wasn't expected and the tiny bit elevated it. 

Everyone got the monkfish entree over the burger. Monkfish was cooked well, had nice char on it for a bit of flavor and crunch. If you've never had, it's meaty and chewy sort've like how lobster or shrimp is. The carmelized onion jam was sweet, a bit tangy and there were a few surprising bites with mustard seeds. There was a pile of dill on top which added extra freshness. It's a lot of flavors going on, for me not a bad thing. I would have liked some starch, but perhaps I should have gotten a side. 

Dessert- 
The ice cream with chips was decent. The lemon poppy was good, but wish it was a bit more lemony. Toffee miso was interesting. I tasted the miso toffee stronger when it went with the salty chips so I guess that was what it was for. 
Strawberry shortcake you can definitely taste the sake in it, which was also a reminiscent beer flavor with the berries and the bread reminded me a bit of cornbread. I liked the pepper whipped cream. This was alright, but would say while good desserts were the weakest point for me. 

Service was friendly and decent. Apparently they were doing training and there were some lulls and our server apologized for it, but I didn't think it really was anything noticeable. We had good company so a bit of wait isn't really the worse thing to happen. 

This is one of those restaurants I can see fierce love or hate for though. The food has so much bold flavors which can be too much for some or not in their taste. I for one, am a fan of being bold. I will be back for the regular menu soon.",2013-03-11 07:48:00

Need I write more?

Oh alright, but only because you like to read my crazy quips.

I get the Ruben but prefer mustard over thousand island dressing.  I like corned beef with thousand and pastrami with mustard (just for your knowledge).

The salad bar is amazing.  Different types of lettuce plus spinach.  The normal round of vegetables, beans and fruit. Plus, green olives, I really like green olives.  Many dressings to choose from.

I could swim in their soups, but I wont; for many reasons.  They are thick and flavorful. Hot out of the kettle, no semi-warm soup here.

Itls a sandwich place so do not expect linen table clothes and suited servers.  You pay, get a number and find you're own place to hunker down.  I'm cool with that.

Even now, I'm sometimes amazed at how they make the mock meat look so real and taste so good!

What you MUST order (or in my opinion, the best thing on their menu): ENOKI MUSHROOM BALLS. It is this savoury fried crispy thing that is as addicting as chips... so yummy.

I am not one to complain, but they just made their second strike with me last night. My first time I got the oxtail loco moco and my boyfriend got the shrimp with the D1 goodness sauce. The loco moco came out in 10 minutes. It was super flavorful and came in a big portion. My boyfriend's shrimp came out 20 minutes later which makes the cooks or servers seem really inconsistent. Not only did he wait 20 more minutes, but the shrimp was cold, not cleaned properly, and the sauce was tasteless like some unsalted vegetable broth. Luckily, we got it off our check since we were dissatisfied. We came in last night and ordered the wings as our appetizer, the oxtail fried rice, and the braised pork belly. Our server asked us if we wanted to have the appetizer come out first or have it all come out at the same time as the entrees. We asked to have it come out first. After waiting, we both receive our entrees both from different servers for whatever reason. Our wings came out 10 minutes after the entrees which wasn't a big deal, but it made the server look bad. All the food was so delicious, but we noticed that our server just seemed to act like she wasn't even serving our table anymore which is funny because I don't know how hard it is to serve ONE table. She would walk by and avoid eye contact and we kept trying to get her attention by raising our hand and etc. We ended up having to ask other servers for a to go box and the check since we were waiting for almost 20 minutes to grab her attention but she was too busy talking to her friend/co-worker who was standing right near our table. Since the other servers didn't bring us what we needed my boyfriend stood up and acted like he was about to leave and she still didn't give two shits to the point where we could have dine and dashed. He had to basically ask her loudly for a to go box and the check since she started walking away from the area of our table after she was done talking to her friend then she asks us if we want dessert. Are you kidding? She is a fucking joke of a server. Serving is such an easy job especially if you only have ONE table. I don't like tipping badly because I'm a server myself, but she didn't deserve the normal 20%.

Customer service, which was previously top notch seems to be slipping. They used to have a guy who did nothing but run around and make sure everything ran smoothly. He worked hard and did a wonderful job. Not sure what happened to him. Now it seems chaotic. Our waiter (who was new and inexperienced) didn't take back the menus after taking our order. Apparently they ran out of glasses (although everyone else had them?) so he our served drinks in styrofoam cups and one leaked all over. When we were finally able to catch the server's eye to tell him about the leak he replaced the cup but never even thought to wipe up the obvious mess on the table. We had to request their famous breadsticks which are usually brought out immediately, and when we asked for seconds they took our used plates up to replenish (community tongs touched our dirty plates; one that included a wad of gum!) rather than just bringing a fresh plate like they usually do. The ingredients in the calzone were tasty, but they weren't spread equally throughout so the ends were mostly bread while the middle was overloaded. I ordered my usual, the fettuccine alfredo w/chicken and asked that my side (broccoli) be cut up and added to the pasta. Instead of cutting it up nicely like they normally do, the chef just plopped huge clusters of broccoli on top, and the alfredo was lacking in flavor.

But their vegetarian spicy lentils (I'm pretty sure it's the Miser Wat, but could have been Miser Alecha) are to die for (5/5). But I love spicy. The collards and the injera ""bread"" that is really like a tangy pancake are also delicious.  I did come one time for lunch to get the lunch buffet thinking it might be decent (because after all I, like Tonya P, have an affliction known as buffetphobia) but that day the buffet was broken.  

Anyway, to me the spicy lentils are the best thing on the menu and I taste tested friends' chicken and beef dishes that were only OK.  I could definitely see why some people might not like 1) eating with their hands or 2) the mushy consistency of many of the items. But it's different.

Service is funny- helpful, but very hard to understand and only will give you your bill if you ask for it. So act in a hurry and you will get normal service. :)  There are also a few times when I've driven up during their normal business hours and the place is closed. Huh?  Eh, whatevs...  

I had a really hard time deciding how many stars to give Meskerem. After all, it seems like great Ethiopian, and is different. Good value ($8.75 for my meal). But apathetic, unreliably open service and definitely specialized. That said, I've not been able to get The Stud to try it out.  How about you try it and let me know how you like it?",2011-04-10 17:31:30

I ordered a cold brew, which was delicious. Their pastries are good, too. The vegan brownie was light and tasty, and my friend totally loved her scone. We'll be back to try some more of the fuller breakfasts.

Ritzy Palace Chinese Cuisine opened up sometime last year at Woodbine and Denison where a previous Chinese restaurant, Spring Villa Chinese Cuisine, used to be.  

When we walked into the restaurant for our dinner (where we had made a reservation for 7:45 p.m.) and we were waiting in the foyer area, I looked at their business card and that's when it showed that Grandeur Palace was their sister restaurant.  When we got seated and I looked around, no wonder the decor was so familiar!  The owners had overhauled the place to look exactly like Grandeur Palace's interior.  The only difference was that Grandeur Palace was a bit bigger and had many large windows.  Here, there weren't any windows and the space was a bit smaller.

Since my relatives dine at Grandeur Palace often, they also recognized a few of the staff that work there who are relocated to this location to work.

That night, the 15 of us ordered a set menu to share.  It was a lot of food and I was really impressed with how big the portions were.  It seemed like the portions here at Ritzy were bigger than the ones at Grandeur.  The tastes of the dishes were very good too.

Occupying the former home of Cravin' Cajun and serving up modern Vietnamese cuisine in a room one part hipster-industrial and one part sports bar it was with a group of five that I sat down at District One Kitchen & Bar just minutes after noon and focusing our order on variety the results proved 'variable' at best.  Clearly untrained and understaffed to handle a restaurant nearly 3/4 full by 12:30 it was with a trio of appetizers that our meal began and with beverage refills scarce as servers ran in circles perhaps it was fortuitous that none of the first round proved remotely spicy, the hamachi tacos bright and crisp at $3 each while dull, limp wings and the vinegar tinged salad proved entirely forgettable...and not particularly 'Vietnamese' at all.  Moving next to larger scale items, a duo of pho dishes would prove respectable if not particularly well presented; the supple oxtail imbuing long rice noodles with a meaty sapor while an enormous proximal femur laced its broth with fat to balance ample scallions, though heat remained mute even in the presence of sliced jalapenos.  Moving finally to the items that showed the kitchen's promise, suffice it to say that tender pork belly first braised then rendered soft in coconut milk proved by far the most complex option of the afternoon despite its unexpected sweetness and although a seemingly odd choice, the throwback 'get down n' dirty' shrimp finally delivered in the spice department, a pound of the snappy shell-ons again leaving my water-glass empty while wondering why we hadn't just gone to Crab Corner or Hot n' Juicy instead.",2014-04-13 21:32:41

We decided to do brunch here, because it's almost half price, and after checking out the website, I thought it was almost the full experience, anyhow(just not as many meat choices).

The minute we walked in, I was totally in love with the interior. A little dark, with rich colors and nice design...and PLENTY of seating. We were immediately seated, and our waitress came over soon after. Although the drinks looked tasty(I would imagine that a place like this would do kick butt mojitos, and the mimosa selection was fun), I decided to just get coffee. Our waitress explained how the experience worked, and left us a basket of Po De Queijo, which is almost like a cheesy popover, with bits of spicy peppers...YUM. 

We started off at the salad bar, which is much more than just salad. For brunch, they had Yukon gold potatoes, and a variety of grilled, steamed, and marinated veggies. There was also a variety of fresh fruit, and a parfait bar with yogurt and oats. If this isn't enough, you can also grab some delicious Spanish cheese and roasted nuts to top your plate off. I can see why they offer a salad bar only option at night, you could easily make a nice meal out of just that!

BUT, we were going full out...so bring on the meat! After we finished our first course, we flipped our ""pillar of meat"", and soon after the Gaucho brought us our first selection, which was a spicy sausage. We also tried the flank steak(delicious, although I wish my cut had come from further in the slab, because I like it a bit more rare), and the leg of lamb was AMAZING. There was also a country ham, which we didn't try. Another favorite of ours was the cinnamon-sugar crusted pineapple that they grilled. So good. 

My only complaint was that I had been looking forward to the jazz music they advertised, but the band came in to set up just as we were finishing our plates.

We were seriously stuffed...and I had to laugh when the waitress came to apologize that she had not told us that they offer fresh waffles(blueberry, plain and chocolate, I believe). I also overheard her telling another table that they make scrambled eggs, too. It didn't matter, because there was NO way we were going to be able to eat anything else.

All in all, Samba has a great atmosphere, delicious food, and attentive staff(even if the waitress DID forget to offer us a few items). I think that it was well worth the $20 a plate price. Is it somewhere I'll go every Sunday? No, but I'll definitely be back!

We walked into the warm room, and thankfully it did not smell like bikgram. It's the weirdest thing to me... Everyone socializing, on their phones, before the instructor entered. I found it weird, because there were still students in resting position, still actively practicing.

I felt completely out of place. There was just a crazy flow to it. We sat in the back. The instructor was playing music. And it was random. Drake, pharell, reggae, rock and roll. I could barely hear any type of instruction.

Some of these girls looked like they belong on the pole. Seriously, they would make millions with the moves they were pulling.

You come across the funnies, you save Family Circus for last because it is a classic and surely will not disapoint. You get through everything else and at long last come to the Family Circus and after finishing, you remember that in fact; you have never read a funny Family Circus. In fact the only ones you find slightly enjoyable are the ones where little Billy is running around all hopped up on drugs and there is a dotted line left in his trail and you don't really get them either.

I am sure you are wondering where I am going with this. Sugar Bowl posts Family Circus comics all around the establishment and it is fitting as they are similar, in that you really think that you are going to enjoy both but both are huge let-downs.

I would really like to give this place one 1 1/2 stars but you know how it goes; I am a positive guy so I will round up. 

The thing is, sugar bowl is just the kind of place that a Yelper WANTS to like. It has been around for 50 years, locally owned and operated, it breaks the Scottsdale douche mold/stereotype and it is old school. It just doesn't manage to be charming and here is why.

First and foremost; the service sucked. When I went in, there were as many teenage kids working as people in the place and though I received a water super promply; giving me false high-hopes; I was then forced to wave down kids walking around avoiding eye contact like we had woken up together after a too-drunk night; in order to get water refills and order a burger. 

Secondly the food was meh. Really meh. Yeah I know it is an icecream joint but an old ice cream shop like this should have some tasty old-school burgers. You know who has better burgers? Dairy Queen. I swear to YHWH. Even the ice cream was very, very run of the mill.

Even the decor, while I enjoy the old soda shop sort of thing needs a little help. There are creepy old people houses and there are charming ones; figure out the difference really.

I am going to go beyond my jurasdiction here and give some suggestions hoping someone takes them to heart. I mean I don't know much; I am just a consumer but as a jumping point...
I hate to say this but Sugar bowl needs to let the theme run a bit with the Scottsdale atmosphere. Scottsdale wants to be LA and Sugar Bowl should also but they should do it better!

Scottsdale needs a hip late-night diner! Think about it! Get some great food stuffs, make your own toppings stay open late and charge a little more. And for the love of god take down the comics and paint the damn place or something! It could be a swingin joint where rock-stars, porn-stars and sport-stars meet up with the after club crowd. Look at how far people go to make it to Five and Diner and they aren't truly that great. Out-do them!

Sugar Bowl could do it. They really have the potential but as is I would have to be pretty desperate to hit this place up again.",2009-09-08 23:30:44

It was my birthday and I just finished doing a 12 hours shift. Tired and hungry, wouldn't really care less driving to other Thai restaurants in the Chinatown area. It took a while for the two of us to get seated. No one was waiting in line, but the one hostess/server was busy serving the tables and taking take out orders. Hence the wait for a table. 

We ordered wings of angel which was boneless chicken wings stuffed with a combination of minced pork and clear noodle, green curry chicken, pad thai, and duck noodle soup. The stuff chicken wings were excellent with just a perfect blend of seasonings in the minced pork and rice noodle. The duck noodle was also delightful. The soup had very nice flavor to complement the duck. The spicy green curry (even though we ordered it mild) was a little bit too hot for me. The pad thai was bland. Couldn't figure out why the pad thai (a staple in all Thai restaurants) was so tasteless. It wasn't until I got the bill that I found out the waitress put the order down with special instructions that said ""no spice"". No wonder it was bland. 

I would definitely come back and try some more of their other dishes like the yellow and green curry. Well worth the money, especially since we had the restuarants.com coupon. When we arrived there wasn't too many tables seated, but when we were about leave the restaurant was quite full. Pretty good business for a Wednesday night.  I deducted one star for the pad thai.",2010-10-28 18:38:00

There were ""love"" locks on this bridge, similar to Europe, and also i was using this bridge on a game night, so it was a pedestrian zone with no cars allowed, which was great. It was really cool walking on a game night because at one point there was this great roar and when I turned back to look, I had this perfect view looking into the baseball stadium!!

Its a very picturesque walk, and I recommend it!

It was around 5pm and the bar was pretty filled, but were quickly seated in the dining room area. The server must be new and made really awkward interactions with us, but he did provide good service overall which was of course most important. 

I'm guessing because this is a downtown location, they limit their specials. Usually tuesday specials include 1/2 off reds and whites 6oz or $5/6 for their amber and blonde house beer. However, this was only limited to house red and white. Both are just alright, nothing worth mentioning.

We also ordered fries and calamari which were both good. Also be mindful, unless you want to pay $7 for sweet potato fries instead of $4 regular fries, don't order it. We ordered it once and had no idea there would be such a big difference. Usually restaurants only charge a $1 more and the server last time did not mention that either.

It's a convenient location for commuters as it is close to union station, but otherwise I would suggest considering other restaurants nearby.",2016-03-25 02:21:55

Arrived at 12pm, expecting the place to be emptied, but there were actually a good amount of patrons in there!  My friend's Thai, and I'm Taiwanese (yes, we are from different countries).  Anyways, this was the first time for both of us there, so we had the waiter give us some recommendations for what to order.  As soon as he told us the crab fried rice was good, we both glared at him and give him the ""oh come on, do you want to just show us where the nearest panda express is?""  So after he embarrassingly apologized, and my friend started to speak Thai, he recommended something, and that was when my friend got very excited, which got me excited (although I really have no clue why).  My friend said they got some kind of squid with spicy dipping sauce, and it's really good.  So we put in the order, along with some kind of specialty beef noodle soup and an order of mixed vegetable.  In all honesty, my friend put in the order, and I was just going along for the ride!  I am the Thai food apprentice =)

When the squid was served, my jaw almost dropped! And the reason was, on the plate were two giant grilled squid.  And why my jaw dropped? Because this is the first place I've ever been to that served grilled squid like the way you find it from street carts in Asia!  The squid were grilled to perfection, slices into rings, tentacles and all!  The dipping sauce was good, and the only way I can describe it is a thick kind of spicy fish sauce. YummmmOOOOO!

The beef noodle was excellent too (after my friend mod it to the spiciness of our preference).  Its a none creamy sweet and spicy dark broth with green veggies, beef meat balls, beef tendons and steaks, and bean thread noodles.  The bowl is huuuuge, enough to serve 2 to 3.

The most mediocre thing we ordered was the stir-friend mix veggies.  Its just your everyday stir-fried mix veggies with chili peppers.  But we gotta get those veggies in somehow =)  The order was kinda small comparing to the other dishes.

For dessert, we ordered Roti (Indian pancake) with condensed milk drizzled all over.  You can never go wrong with that! We also got the fried bananas.  We were expecting it to be egg-roll wrapped then fried.  Instead, its thickly battered and fried.  The batter also had shredded coconut in it, the aroma was nice, and the taste was good, but overall just taste like banana in a giant donut hole.  If you're not into fried food, like we weren't, don't order it.

All in all, we'll definitely come back again, especially for that grilled squid!!

Of course, this is the first time to see a drag queen show on the strip. So I was very skeptic about, what to expect. But quite honestly, its no different then any other amazing shows out there. It has its own twist on putting a smile on your face, making sure you are enjoying yourself and the show was beyond amazing. They are here to entertain you, and that, they did. 

Located in Imperial Palace, the theater itself was a nice setting. A bit uneasy with the fact that the seating was more like a picnic style sitting then an actual row sitting. But from the looks of the show, it was kind of appropriate in a way. They did have booth sitting, which I thought was kind of odd with picnic table sitting. But, it sort of made sense in the end. Now the tables were cloth covered, and very nicely set up. Just didn't like keeping my head over my right shoulder, majority of the time. It was a good view, I did like where we were seated. I'm sure where ever you sit, will be a good view. Its not as big as some theaters, but at least your able to see the faces clearly. Unlike some theaters where you sit in the back, that the performer looks like a size of an action figure from far away. 

A bit bummed with the fact that Frank Marino wasn't hosting. But Bill Keith on the other hand, who hosted for Frank, did not disappoint. He was very entertaining and funny. He made the audience laugh through out the show. The performers themselves, which is sometimes unbelievable how close these performers look so much like the actual performers. Of course, they didn't disappoint the crowd either. Even though, I really don't think that they were really singing. Sometimes they do make me wonder if they really are singing, with a voice changer, to make them sound like the real thing. But either way, they were right on que with their performance. There were times that I was laughing a lot, there were time that I smiled a lot. Overall, I did enjoy watching these people entertain us to the best of their knowledge. They do come down off stage to great people. They even perform in the middle of the room. Which gives me a better understanding with the picnic style sitting. It was very nice to see that they take advantage of the layout of the theater. 

Overall, its probably the best drag queen show on the strip right now. If your looking for a good drag queen show, then this is one of those shows I would recommend. Its nice to sit up close, but I believe sitting is good anywhere. Even after the show, you'll be able to meet and greet some of these performers. Totally Amazing!!!

Also, just a heads up, unfortunately we missed out, but this is one of those shows where YOU CAN TAKE PICTURES.  We thought, its a vegas show, that we're use to not bringing the camera. Next time, I'm bringing the camera.  Still no video or audio, but cameras are acceptable.",2011-02-24 20:07:37

There is fake sea gull poo. There was a live band and lots of Wast Valley folk getting down. There are plastic palm trees and two over-the-top levels of Caribbean ""paradise.""

The reason I just have to give this place 4 stars despite all it's ridiculousness and awful kitsch, is that  our server was awesome- and for me, service absolutely makes or breaks an experience. He was incredibly cool and patient which is pretty amazing considering how flooded this place gets with patrons after shows. All I wanted in the world was a blue cheese burger & they don't offer one. So, I (annoyingly I'm sure) chose a random burger off the menu and substituted all the toppings to make exactly what I wanted and the server didn't even blink. When I got my burger (quickly too!) it was just how I had ordered it, PLUS cooked correctly AND even remembered that I wanted onion rings instead of french fries.

I ordered the thai cashew quinoa with chicken. It was super delicious. I am usually not a fan of quinoa. All the ingredients blended well together. I could totally have it everyday.

Got coffee and walked back to my vehicle.  After, getting in, this Tahoe aggressively backed out...in the wrong direction, and screeched their tires heading toward WF.

They have a wonderful coffee shop at this location. However, I went in on Saturday and it is gone. It has shut down forever. 
Bummer. they made some really great drinks. I am sorry to see them go.
It is a huge store, with every book that you could find at  Barnes and Noble even.

They have nice restrooms that are clean and decorated nicely. 
Records, DVDs, books on CD. Music CD's and the list just goes on.
They also have a wonderful housewares dept. You never know what type of fun you can find there.
This Christmas I found some really great ornaments that were no longer being made and they were ones that I collected.
They were still in the box. I was sooooo happy.

You yourself can bring in your items. Of course they must be clean and in good shape. They may or may not take them it just depends on what they are looking for this day.
They will give you cash or trade. The best thing to do is get trade because, then you can shop with it. 
parents a really ,really good thing is that they have musical instruments.
 Yes, we all know how expensive that can be when your child plays an instrument.

When I tried to book online ahead of time I noticed you could not use the voucher so I crossed my fingers and called twice to make sure they really would be running shuttles to the airport at 4:30 AM and that I wouldn't have to wait at all. While it worked out just fine I noticed booking online offered additional discounts that make parking extremely reasonable ($3-4 per day), so I really didn't even need to buy that coupon ( I save $4 or $5 ultimately). 

We didn't have to wait for our shuttle at all, it picked us right up at our parking spot on time in the early morning hours and returned us to the same spot a week later around midnight. They run two shuttles and are truly there around the clock. We spoke to a pilot who said he now only uses Park N Go because it's so easy and reliable. The service of both the person driving the shuttle and the lady at the booth was impeccable (she even offered us some bottled water for our trip home). 

My only minor complaint is that it's located right off the highway and so the lot accumulates a lot of dust and our car was really dirty after a week. If you factor in the necessity of a professional wash it can make the deal not so great.

Overall though I will be using the service again as it was super reliable, fast, easy, affordable, friendly, efficient...you name it!",2012-10-29 20:41:27

Had the grilled cheese and meatball for appetizers ... those are AWESOME !!! Good way to start a meal.. (these are where my 3 stars come from)

Tried the fishes from my friends, a bit toward the fishy side.

I used Yelp to find a place to have dinner before the book club meeting and up popped Chart House.  It turns out that I've walked by it a number of times and never knew it was a restaurant.  I only thought it was a bar/lounge.  But, behind that large fish tank is another side and that's where the restaurant is.

I was seated promptly right along the glass of the fish tank.  It's a great place to sit because you are almost constantly watching the fish swim when you're not eating--eating seafood even.  I wonder if anyone would like an enclosed, sealed calf range in a steak house.  

My server was Haley and she was good.  She took my order after answering a few questions.  I was brought my iced tea (blackberry, bottled Republic of Tea) and a runner brought some bread and butter.  The bread was OK.  The rye roll was good.  It was brought warm.  The flat bread, soda wafers were quite dry and not as good.

For a started, I ordered the ménage soup.  It's a trio of small cups of their three soups--lobster bisque, gazpacho, and clam chowder.  The gazpacho was hands down the best.  The clam chowder was good.  The lobster bisque was average.

For the main course, I got their spicy yellowfin ahi served with a ginger soy sauce and wasabi cream and accompanied by wasabi mashed potatoes.  The ahi was cooked very rare--just seared and off the grill.  It was excellent and the wasabi sauce was very good.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were also very good.

For dessert, I had ordered the hot chocolate lava cake.  The menu states to leave 30 minutes prep time for specialty desserts and when I was ordering dinner in the beginning, Haley asked me about this.  I ordered the cake then so there'd be plenty of time to make it at the correct time during my meal.

The cake was excellent.  Chocolate goodness topped with Heath bar crunch and vanilla ice cream.

The meal and service were very good and the fish tank is lots of fun.  It was a hoot watching the people watch the fish.  The tank is 75,000 gallons and has dozens of fish.  Haley told me that a diver is in the tank daily for cleaning and feeding.  The only drawback was that I was at the first table in from the lounge and some of the happy hour people were quite loud when they got some alcohol in them.",2014-04-15 20:21:51

Feels like your back in Japan as their sushi fish is flown in weekly every Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday straight from Japan. And so is their special Wagyu beef. Something to die for and extremely tasty. Quality over quantity in this low key Japanese restaurant that's comfortable and far from pretentious like most high-end over priced restaurants in downtown. This place is nothing like that. It's so comfortable the staff are very friendly and well mannered and offer an easy explanation for each course/dish. It's comforting yet presented like a beautiful piece of art work. Each dish is highly thoughtful and decorated like a Japanese painting. And the dishes are such high quality. I highly recommend the sake tasting if you like to sip. Go with the cold sake instead of hot as it gives a refreshing taste to the palette after each bite of sushi. If you want to come with a group of more then 4 people, please do make a reservation at least 5 days in advanced because it's a small intimate place and sometimes hard to get the time you want for dinner. Do arrive early as it messes up other people's reservations if you arrive late. Like I said, the place is small and you really need to make a reservation for dinners.

I won't get into any of them! If you are ever interested to know, for whatever weird reason, feel free to ask me at a Yelp event and I'll tell you all about the saga of Arbor Room! 

To begin, this is still one of the better places to eat within U of T. If it was anywhere else, I probably would not give it more than 3 stars as there seems to be a serious issue with consistency. A lot of items on the menu, from the Shawarma to the Pizza could be absolutely amazing and fresh on some days and make you question your taste on others! In addition, to reaffirm another reviewer's experience, I also remember finding a bone or two in Shawarma a while back! The issue of consistency also exists in terms of the portions you receive, and they can vary ridiculously day by day! 

On the bright side some of the staff are quite nice! This is particularly true about the people who greet if you visit earlier in the day! Hart House serves up a pretty decent breakfast, and I would recommend the cinnamon French toast with eggs and sausage! Most of the ingredients are very fresh and in fact the syrup is produced at the Hart House farm (this was at least the case back when I was in the 'know')!
For lunch and dinner, I would recommend the 'chickens of the world' items. If you are getting something from the baked section, I would go for either the Pizza or the patties! The calzones, Greek cheese pockets, etc are not too impressive at Hart House!

Another great point about the Sammy's is the seating space; For one, Sammy's/Arbor Room has become a pretty good space for watching sport events within campus and you can usually find a good crowd gathered for the major games. Even better, you can still walk in to find the stage occupied by a comedy/hip-hop or some other cool campus group, and enjoy a free show while you eat! Finally, if you are in the mood to read in a noisy place, the Arbor Room is a great option and you know you can grab something at the same time. That being said, it's probably not a good idea to show up at lunch for casual reading as I have seen the manager get a bit aggressive with students in the past (even though technically Sammy's does not have control over the seating space).",2011-01-28 23:19:23

Her argument in general, to paraphrase, went like this. Yes, Starbucks is a global chain, but they have decent drinks. I like that they have non-dairy milk alternatives now and more tea drinks. And I appreciate that they're not afraid get political, like hiring refugees and veterans. The employees are usually nice, even if they butcher your name.

We stayed at the Vdara and because there's not much food option at Vdara, decided to order pizzas for carry-out.  Went for the Gotham, which is sorta like a meat-lovers with a spicy kick, and the North Beach, which is a pizza with clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano.  

Gotham's tasty, just as expected, especially if you're a fan of pepperoni and/or salami.  The North Beach was sort of a gamble since we wanted to try something different and man, we lost.  We expected a pizza with clams sprinkled onto the pizza, but what you get is actually one clam in the shell per slice.  Yup, 8 slices, 8 clams.  After you eat the one clam, it's just a cheese pizza essentially.  The smoked mozz and sweet onions was very tasty though.

We also ordered an order of wings after the girl on the phone said it was very delicious, and she was right, it was very tasty!  Not really a buffalo sauce, but it does have a slight kick and sweetness to it.  We were quite glad we were convinced to order it haha.

Now, for the price, each pizza is close to $30 (why we also thought there would be more clams), and for some reason the wings aren't on the online menu when we ordered so we didn't know, but our bill was $90+ with two cokes after taxes.  We knew Vegas was expensive but man, $90+ for pizza and wings was sorta crazy.

Jerk Pork Belly - green vegetable piccalilli, turnip, summer pollen

MAIN:
Squid Ink Chitarra Pasta - squid, octopus, black garlic, parsley

This was so delicious - I was very impressed with this dish especially coming from a non-Italian restaurant. The pasta was perfectly aldente and the squid ink flavour was spot on. The squid and octopus pieces were fresh and good. The black garlic and parsley mixed amazingly well with the pasta.

It's very rare to find squid ink dishes in Toronto so I was very happy they served this.

John was knowledgeable about the vehicle, he knew the features and the specifications. He was patient and engaging.

My friend and I made plans in advance to have brunch here. Unfortunately, we later discovered that brunch is only served on weekends. Instead, we chose to have a late breakfast. Bouchon only takes reservations for dinner, so it's first come, first served for breakfast and lunch. We arrived at around 11:00am on a Tuesday. The restaurant wasn't busy, but we did have to wait for about 10 minutes in their sectioned off wait area. 

APPETIZER
Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard (2.5 oz) with toasted baguettes: I hate liver. Naturally, I had some qualms about trying foie gras, but I was still game for it and kept an open mind. The foie gras' flavor really surprised me: It's smooth, buttery, and it didn't taste anything like liver with its irony ""twang."" I really can't describe its flavor other than it gets better with each taste. Spread it  on a slice of toasted baguette and gently rub some of the accompanying salt -- your taste buds will thank you. The amount we ordered was more than enough for the two of us.

BREAKFAST
Croque Madame: Although located on the lunch menu, it makes for a great breakfast entree. Basically, this is the ultimate ham and cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg. What really makes this sandwich awesome is the mornay sauce, which is a white, creamy cheese sauce that's poured on top. To really push your carb intake to the edge, a large serving of french fries comes with this order. 

For caffeine junkies, order the coffee. I like how it's neither too weak nor too strong. What I also like is how you can have your coffee to go.

OVERALL
Future brunch and dinner plans were discussed between my friend and myself during our breakfast. I think that's suffice to say that we'll be returning. Bouchon is as close to Europe as you'll get in Vegas. There's no rush to finish your meal. The server isn't going to place your bill on the table minutes after your food arrives.

The ambiance of the place is nice and better than most family style Italian food restaurants.  We were seated immediately by who we assumed was our waitress and she immediately asked if we wanted some cocktails -- we ordered and she went to get them at the bar.  Then another waiter comes over and says that he is our waiter and will serve us tonight.  He takes our appetizer order.  Then the waitress come back with our drinks and we tell her that the other guy took our appetizer order.  She says OK but can she take our dinner order.  So we order our salads and entrees with grilled vegetables (an optional and extra charge item), and tell her that we don't want to rush and that we would like to have our cocktails with our appetizer before our dinner elements start to come out.  She says, ""No problem"".  A few minutes later our salads arrive and my GF's salad comes with no dressing on it---WTH??  I also ask, ""where's my antipasto platter?""  So I guess my appetizer order never got placed.  We ask for salad dressing and wait.  Finally our apps come out and we get two baskets of bread -- one whole loaf which I assume comes with our salad and dinners, and another basket with baguette slices for which I assume is for our antipasto platter.  By now I am a little confused and annoyed, and I have to ask again for salad dressing for my GF.

Oh and BTW, I order a Kilt Lifter Ale and it comes to me and it is a little flat.  I am a craft beer nut so I know flat beer that has been sitting in an open keg for a little longer than it should.  So for my next beer, I order an IPA.  It take some time to get to me and the waitress says, ""sorry for the wait, but they had to tap a new IPA keg"".  I can tell, and that is good for me -- the IPA is nice and cold and fresh and very tasty -- I am happy with this mug of suds.

The antipasto platter is OK -- some nice cheese, especially the chunks of bleu.  Nice proscuitto and salami; nice pickled artichoke hearts.  And a hearty sprinkling of dried cranberries which is OK and on the menu description, but sorta out of character for this platter IMO.

Our entrees arrive -- mine was veal marsala and a side of pasta.  The veal entree was again OK, but not as rich and creamy as I would have liked.  The gravy is thin and weak IMO, and somewhat underseasoned.  The pasta side is overcooked spaghetti with marinara.  

My GF orders ravioli with marinara sauce.

Our grilled vegetables never arrive.  And the marinara sauce is not very good IMO.  Now I realize that marinara sauce is made is a zillion different ways and everyone tastes is different.  So maybe this marinara sauce is good, but we did not like it.  I sorta pick out the overcooked spaghetti from the sauce and eat it, but my GF eats only one ravioli and quits.  She says she will wait for a big breakfast for tomorrow morning.  The marinara sauce is overpowering -- very, very thick, and seemingly like canned tomato PASTE, flavored with a little Italian seasoning (oregano, cumin, basil).  So again, it might be good in some other peoples eyes (mouth), but for us, we did not care for it.

So my review here may seem very critical, but in reality, it is just a detailed and an honest expression of my opinions.  All-in-all, this place is OK, I guess.",2016-01-24 14:00:33

We've had tilapia and French chicken sandwiches, the burger, and the children routinely have their chicken fingers.  All were prepared as ordered and very tasty.  I love their fresh cut fries and Coke products.

Guess Tapino just isn't for her. Out of the three small plates we shared, she only enjoyed the lamb kabob over quinoa ($9). It was the second-best dish of the three I enjoyed.

I'd wanted to try a glass of rose ($7), since Mom is a fan, but she was ""too tired"" to have wine, so I'll have to bookmark that for next visit. We started w/ the butternut squash ravioli w/ sage butter ($8; mmm... I adore brown butter and sage... My Mom, however, doesn't). I appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli. The sage butter added just enough salt to the dish, while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch! How I wished I had all three pieces! (She ate one and didn't even enjoy it! How infuriating! LOL)The second dish we tried was the baked escargots w/ butter, parsley, lemon, and puff pastry ($7). Compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish, this was a bit disappointing. While I enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered (TOO crunchy, if you ask me! Those babies were bordering on hard! Where's the ""puff?,"" I ask.), the butter and parsley treatment fell flat. Mom again only had one. I believe there were 6 total. Don't misunderstand- I still ate all the rest... I was hungry!! :D

Last, but not the least, came the skewer of lamb kabob (3 pcs; $9) w/ bell peppers and onions, served over cold saffron quinoa w/ cucumber sauce (served on the side).  Thankfully, the lamb pieces were savory enough not to have needed the sauce. Loved the quinoa.

Our estheticians were very nice, and I really appreciated that they don't try to sell or push additional services/products on me - the last thing I want when I'm trying to relax is a sales pitch. They have a pretty limited color selection, and a lot of their colors are dried out.

I got a pretty solid manicure - nothing to call home about. There wasn't much pampering involved - I'm not sure if the spa manipedi includes a massage, because there really wasn't anything happening in that regard. Pretty basic soak, file, polish. The manicure was the same - soak, file polish. I feel like I could have gotten a little better for a little cheaper (if you're really going to count pennies) but honestly for what it was, it was good enough. 

They were pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon - not busy enough that anyone had to wait, but busy enough that all the estheticians were all very working.

A plain dog will cost you $4.99, with the fancier stuff going more toward $6-9. ~$8 is a little much to pay for one hot dog, but hey, I could tell they used some quality ingredients into my dog, so I'll let it slide. If you are more of the ""quantity over quality"" type, you may have to sit at a nearby casino cafe and order a gigantor hot dog that they usually serve for a couple bucks.

Price point aside, the hot dog I got was very good. I got the Crunchy Dog - a hot dog concoction with all sorts of crunchies all over it (bacon, potato chips, fried onions, etc.). It's also topped with nori (seaweed) and sriracha mayo to give a bit of an Asian twist. I wasn't necessarily blown away by it, but it was still good.

Would I come back? Probably. The price point is something that I'm starting to see from all renovations going around east downtown. There are times that I crave a hot dog and go out of my way for it. Cheffini's does one good and it's definitely some of the best in the area.",2014-09-06 06:37:10

It was so good, I could've poured it on a flip-flop and eaten it. Sadly, the Fuego sauce is no longer to be found. And I was hugely disappointed in the quality of the condiments available in the salsa bar.  Upon my most recent visit to this particular restaurant, I found the salsas to be watery and flavorless. I had stopped in to try their new fish tacos and was disappointed. Not only were the fish tacos unappealing and tasteless, but the equally unappetizing salsa couldn't do anything to improve the flavor.

I also ordered a individual piece of chicken and found it to be as I remembered... delicious! So I don't know what is going on with El Pollo Loco's menu nowadays, but they can still do their chicken right.

You almost forget you are in Arizona, because of the green grass and aged shade trees. It was a nice change without the zeroscape gravel or cactus landscape you commonly see all over the Valley.

There was a line out the door. Grab a menu while you wait in line under the Easy-Up tent.
There was only one cashier, then a second cashier showed up for about 5 minutes, then it was back to one cashier again, even with the perpetual long line.

Place your order, pay, they give you a pager, find a table and wait until they buzz you. When they buzz you, your food will be waiting for you from the pick-up window, but show them your pager and place it in the basket.

There were flies while I waited in line. There were flies near the beverage station, flies inside, flies near the restroom. Flies everywhere. Gross!

I had heard great things about this place, so I pretended not to notice all the flies. All of the swarms of other people eating there must not had been bothered by all of the flies either.

Seating is available inside or outside. They had unisex restrooms just like their other place, Liberty Market, but at this location, there were only two restrooms. However, there were sinks for hand washing available outside, in case you just want to washy-washy.

I love onion rings and  don't eat much salt, but I though that the onion rings were a little of bland for being some sort of panko flavored o-rings. They weren't greasy. It was $4.99 for an order. I think I would order them again if I ever came back.

BBQ Chicken Salad was pretty tasty. The greens were fresh, I guess from their farm? Dressing was made from scratch. 

I think most entrees are about $8-$10. Three entrees, plus o-rings was about $36. I think their menu items are made of fresh ingredients, so I don't mind paying more for fresh.

1)  When asked about the punch, don't take it personally if someone doesn't want to order it. 
2)  Your response, ""No one in Madison would ever say that"" to a customer who stated that his wine ""had a nice nose"" was completely off the mark.  Plenty of oenophiles in Madison. Seriously, if you weren't working here, you couldn't afford the price points.  Leave the attitude at home.
3) When we give you a heads up that we need to put in an order so that we can still make the show, don't explain all the reasons why you made us wait to take the order.  Acknowledge it and make sure our food is expedited.

With that rant over, let's focus on the food.  We ordered beef tartare as well as the scallops.  The tartare served with an egg emulsion really was a one note dish.  An acid or a crunch of some sort would have helped tremendously.  I would not order it again.  The scallops were prepared well but the overabundance of fennel fronds that were laid on the top, like straw, was off putting.  

The space is nice, chic, and inviting.  I enjoy the small plate approach that seems to be gaining momentum in Madison.

But anyone who is willing to give this place a shot will be in for a treat! 

I imagine this place is busy during lunch hour from workers in the building and nearby offices. But I came on a Sunday evening and it was nice and quiet. We got a table without a reservation. 

The address says King St., but there is no sign on the entrance on King St. (an office building with a large parking lot in front). Just look for ""260"" and enter the front door. Alternately, there is an entrance on Ontario St. (And after 6pm and on weekends, the King St. door is locked, so for sure go through Ontario St.). 

FOOD: simple, homemade Italian staples. You will find a selection of antipasti, paninis (lunch only), pastas and pizzas. Unlike many other Italian restaurants, there are no 'primi' (or meat-based entrees). 
My party shared the Bufalina ($14) (vine tomatoes, bufala mozzarella, arugula, basil, olive oil) and the Funghi Nordica ($14)(sauteed mixed mushrooms, shaved parmigiano, arugula, olive oil, balsamic vinegar) to start. Both were spot on. 
For the pasta dishes, they don't specify the type of noodle because I think it changes from day to day. On this day, they were making all the dishes with fusilli. I had the Norma ($14) -- eggplant, fresh basil, and a generous dollop of ricotta cheese, with a tomato sauce. The pasta was really firm. Definitely al dente, but I actually would've preferred it just a tiny bit more cooked. The sauce was really flavourful and fresh. The ricotta on top was cold, which made for a nice contrast. Had a bite of one DC's pizza (the daily special -- which had artichokes, onions, and porchetta), and it was delicious! 
For dessert, they only have one offering. But when that offering is an impeccable tiramisu ($6), you don't really need anything else. The tiramisu is one of the lightest I've ever had. I don't know what they mixed in with the marscapone cheese, but it is celestial. The cake at the bottom is drenched in grand marnier without being soggy, and has just a hint of orange flavour. I smile just thinking about it...

WINE: good selection available by the glass/half litre/bottle. There are a lot more reds than whites. 

AMBIANCE: the space is cozy and warm with vintage Italian posters on the exposed-brick walls. There is a huge rack of magazines at the front, presumably for those waiting for takeout or solo diners (or I guess, couples who have run out of things to talk about:P). There is a separate room off the one side that looks like it would be a great place for a small private party. At the back, you can see (and smell) pizza coming out fresh from the oven. There's a TV at the bar, locked on TSN. When we arrived, they were playing the hockey game and it was kind of noisy. But shortly after we ordered, they put it on mute and started playing some music (some bossa nova, then Adele's CD).

SERVICE: our waiter was relaxed and friendly. He was able to give some advice to indecisive diners about what to order (everything sounded so good!). I like a waiter with an opinion. He almost brought us our tiramisu without the cocoa powder sprinkled on top, but right before he got to our table, turned around to correct that. So we had a good laugh about that! The back of the servers' t-shirts says: 12"" uncut. Referring to the pizza, of course. 

ETC: the women's washroom is actually outside of the restaurant just across the hallway in the little alcove. You need to push #1 and #4 to unlock the door. Just make sure to lock it behind you too!",2011-05-16 02:16:49

The only downfall is the layout of the restaurant.  They don't have much of a lobby.  When they have a large wait - if you are sitting by the front door you are blasted with cold or hot air depending on the season.  Also, DO NOT allow them to sit you at the booth that is just adjacent to the hostess desk - people that are waiting for their table lean against that booth and are basically hovering over your head.  Coughing, shouting and basically being rude as you are trying to eat.  I will say, once I brought the issue to the host's attention he quickly asked the patrons to move which I greatly appreciated :)

If you have a small home garden, this is the place to go!  I frequent this place for my garden needs such as organic compost, mulch, top soil, organic fertilizers and even seeds.

I'm a big fan of Dave the Garden Guy, even though I don't watch Channel 3.  With over 20 years of ""extreme gardening"" experience under his belt and his own line of top notch organic products, you can't go wrong with his sage advice.  You can find most of his products here.

I grow most of my veggie plants from seeds, but certain ones need to germinate before the frost (or do not germinate from seeds at all).  

They have a variety of organic vegetable plants:  ichiban eggplants, tomatoes, peppers,  onions, strawberries, etc.  Prices range from $2.19 for 6 pack up to $4.99 for a gallon size.

I've also purchased some landscape flowers, plants and fruit trees that I had been very happy with.

The employees seem to have successful personal experience with their own garden they freely share with you.  

When you decide to put on your garden gloves, check this place out first!",2011-04-14 00:21:24

Wow! What an amazing place. From the second we arrived to the end of dessert it was one of my favorite meals in a long time. To start I had the passion fruit margarita which was sweet and spicy and plenty of tequila. We ordered the chips and the homemade guacamole which was with out doubt the best I've ever eaten
Then we had the queso fundido which was spicy and rich and very tasty, two perfect apps for a table of 4.
Then we all had the tacos.... I had the bestik which was waygo beef and spices outstanding my wife had the mushroom which was incredible and my kids both had the pollo which may have been just a bit too spicy for their tastes
Some of the best tacos I've ever had, but the atmosphere made the meal!
Cool music, cool art work and exceptional service. Our waiter Damian knew every bit of the menu and was super helpful this being our first time. He was fast and friendly and very knowledgable.
Reservations are a must unless you sit outside on the sit up bar which fills up fast

Chic ambience outdoors, though they could use some more umbrellas on the patio on a 90 degree day. (It would be nice to have those wonderful outdoor air conditioners, but  I realize this is Toronto).

The restaurant itself and the private room where very chic and nicely decorated. The two servers that were working our room were great. Super helpful, very friendly, and super accommodating. One friend has a severe allergy to all nuts, which we had informed them of before hand, and they were eager to make sure everything was good from him. On the day they also spoke to him personally to discuss options and make him feel comfortable that they were all aware. Great service in that regard as it is often hard for him to eat out and obviously a worry for him. They were also accommodating of the kids in the group and offered them a different menu. 

We had a three course menu (which was apparently about $35/person) with salad (I choose Cesar which was one of the best I've had with great flavourful bacon and obviously homemade yummy dressing and croutons), main (I had shrimp and scallop linguine. The sauce was a nice pesto/white sauce mix. there were only a couple of shrimp though and the scallops were the teeny, tiny baby ones. Ok but not great) and dessert (butter tart - really good flaky pastry and gooey filling, but seemed to minimal or simple, could have used ice cream or a chocolate garnish or something). My boyfriend had the same except the turkey club as main which was very simple and not that great. Very basic bread, nothing special, we could have been at Casey's or Kelsey's or any other number of basic chains. 

The house red wine we had was good, but there was a confusion with the alcohol. There was supposed to be a limited number of bottles to share included and then a cash bar. However the servers made a mistake and told guest it was an open bar and were pouring the wine like it was water. This lead to a bit of awkwardness and discomfort for the bride and groom who had to go and talk with the staff and fix it. 

Overall we had a great time, and it was a great venue to continue the beautiful day. the service was stellar but the food didn't overly impress. Also bonus points for cheap underground parking in the building. Only $2 when you got validated from the restaurant.",2012-06-18 15:59:18

To get to the outdoor pool, drive your car around the back. You can park in the front, but it's a long hot walk to the entrance. (The entrance in the front takes you to the indoor, year-round lap pool. That pool is $3.)

There are lockers in the dressing rooms. They are only $0.25 each, and only take quarters, but once you reopen the locker you have to put in another quarter. Lockers aren't even really necessary bc lots of people just leave their stuff out by their chairs or loungers.

Not too many umbrellas or other shade, but if you come early when they open at 11am you should be good. We got there at around 1pm and were still able to score two loungers, but had them in the sun.

They have two waterslides. The green enclosed tube one is faster but shorter, and there's always a longer line for it. The white one is open top and the longer slide but you don't go as fast; there's also a shorter line for this one. We went on the green slides about 10 times. It's so much fun! Lay down flat and arch your back to go faster!

There's also a mini lap pool that goes from 3' to 5'. But kinda hard to swim laps bc so many people in there. On the other side there's a huge kiddle splash zone.

You can bring coolers and food with you. I even saw people bringing in Little Caesars! The snack bar has hot dogs and sandwiches ($2), nachos ($4), even pickles ($0.50), ice cream, and Twinkies. So if none of that appeals to you, bring your own food or go out and eat and come back. There's a large shopping mall closer to the 515 fwy and Sunset that has every imaginable chain restaurant you can think of; we had In N Out. :D

My husband and I started our dinner off with ordering three tapas. We ordered the shrimp in olive oil, the sauteed jumbo shrimp and the parmesan scallops. 

The sauteed jumbo shrimp were not flavorful at all. I felt like it needed salt and I never put salt on anything. The jumbo shrimp were also pretty tough, almost like they were overcooked. The sauce on them was bland and just didn't wow me at all.

The shrimp in olive oil came out sizzling hot and were definitely cooked well. Again, the flavors were lack luster and I wasn't really impressed with it.

The parmesan scallops were my favorite. Although teeny tiny, the scallops were cooked to perfection and the accompanying sauce and cheese made for a delicious combination.

For our entree my hubby and a split the seafood paella. It was good. I have had better paella. I felt that the clams were overly fishy tasting, however, the calamari in it was to die for! Overall the paella was good and the price was right for it as well.

We ended our dinner by splitting the chocolate/white chocolate cake. That was really good, but by that time I was way to full.

We had a great Girls' Night Out dinner at BLT Steak ... wonderful food, great company ... one of those really fun nights.

I was surprised when we were seated and immediately served bread with chicken liver pate - not as good as my mom's (hi Mom!), but it was made with red wine, and it was quite good. Meanwhile, we perused the menu. Most of us opted for their special Prix Fixe meal of the night, which was a great value. For $50 you had a choice of appetizer, entree, side and dessert. I opted for a seared ahi tuna salad, a bone-in jalapeno-infused filet mignon, and baked artichoke. This was an amazing deal considering the a la carte price of each item. For example, we're still reeling from the Kobe beef on the menu that was listed at $26 per ounce. Per ounce?!?! I'm sure it's amazing, but ... wow ...

My tuna salad was delicious, and my steak was really great. I ended up coming home with half of it (yummy burritos for husband the next day!). The baked artichoke was just OK. My friend had the fingerling potatoes, which were really fabulous. 

For dessert, we each chose something different and shared. By far, the favorite of the table was the apricot tart. It had a blackberry sauce drizzled around it and a small scoop of pistachio ice cream. Something about the apricot, the flaky tart crust, the tart blackberry sauce and the sweet (yet salty) pistachio ice cream was just wonderful. We also tried the chocolate tart (VERY rich ... almost like eating straight cocoa powder), the strawberry souffle (honestly, just OK, despite a rave review from our waiter) and an angel food cake item with raspberry sauce that just paled in comparison. 

Their wine selection was quite extensive ... Oh, I almost forgot! After we ordered, we were served popovers that were so wonderful. The fresh butter and sea salt on the eggy, crusty dough was delicious. AND, we were also served espresso petit fours that were so good, we really didn't need dessert after one of those. Yum!

Almost every single review that I read mentioned the amazing service and I gotta tell ya... They were correct! The service was ahhhhhmazing! My server today was Finn and she was totally on point! From refilling our drinks to checking on us about the quality of the food to getting us to go drinks because it was really HOT outside today to giving up extra napkins to well pretty much anything else that you would expect. She was right there! 5/5 and the hostess was on point as well. She greeted us right away and when I asked for booth... They only had one open since it was 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed... Another person promptly jumped in and said... I'll go wipe it down for you guys right away! And literally within an minute or 2... We were sat with menus. Such great service!

My bf ordered the all American burger which came with a mayo based lettuce slaw and pickle spear on the side and a side of Mac n cheese. He said he wasn't hungry but he scarfed that thing like it was going outta style! He ordered it well done... He said they it was still very juicy which to me is mind blowing cuz anytime I've ever tasted a well done burger.... Well they normally are like trying to swallow sandpaper. Dry and scratchy. Which in my book is always YUCK. But his was juicy and seasoned just right and that's why it gets a 5/5. And the Mac and cheese... To die for!! So creamy! 5/5

I ordered the chicken and waffles dish and it comes with a sweet and spicy sauce... Little did I know that it was made table side... Finn came by and explained what it was...Their Maple syrup with some of the Louisiana hot sauce mixed in... And then proceeded to make it at the table for me to do my chicken in. So cute! I ended up adding more of the hot sauce... And it was a perfect condiment to my chicken.

Onto the chicken...ok... It's been a while since I had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's in Cali... But I gotta tell ya... The chicken here was pretty darn close! It was crunchy on the outside and omg so juicy and flavorful! If I had to guess... I'm going to say that they brine their chicken cuz it had so much flavor and the juice just leaking out of the meat! 5/5 I will definitely be back to get this chicken!!!

The waffles on the other hand were not that great... They were crunchy on the outside but it lacked flavor even with the strawberry butter. But really I didn't care at this point cuz the chicken was like WOWZA!! 3.5/5

I also got the sweet and spicy chicken tender sandwich. This a perfectly cooked chicken tender on a house made biscuit! This biscuit was to die for. It was so crunchy on the outside and yet so fluffy and soft in the center! And yes the chicken was amazeballs as well. Very crunchy on the outside and so juicy and tender inside. Totally get it again. 5/5

It was a very cute little joint. They had a black chalkboard that had their specials on it and their specials rotate from breakfast, lunch and dinner. And their kitchen was open as well so if you wanted to you could look in and watch them cook. As we were getting ready to go...I sat one of the staff members cleaning the floors with a wet Swiffer.  Very clean but it did get a little loud at points... But hey... Good food always seems to draw up more lively conversations! Lol 5/5

There is outside seating with fans but it's definitely still too hot to enjoy this facet of the diner.

They did a great job on dinner classics. Definitely be back!!",2017-07-16 23:41:10

Honestly needed a church close to home since I no longer live on the Northwest or East side of town, and we need to attend on a regular basis to be considered for the ceremony. Today was the first Sunday mass we went to...
The area and church is pretty attractive, and I was honestly a bit intimidated and nervous, but the previous reviewers were spot on about the staff and other parishioners being friendly and extreme welcoming. There were greeters on the way in, and literally everyone I saw had a smile on their face. LOL. Smiles are contagious, and this place just had good vibes. 
During mass, I got to see an actual baptismal take place. I only bring this up 'cause I thought baptisms were more private ceremonies - maybe another family baptizing their child with yours, but not with an entire congregation. Boyfriend corrected me though and says it happens more often than I witnessed. 
Side note: I couldn't help but enjoy the music and the twists the parish singers did. 
I also have to commend the church on having a user-friendly website that posts all the general information on how and who to contact at the church for  registering with the parish, ceremonies, etc. We got to register online, and I'm hoping we get any newsletters and our contribution envelopes soon. 
LOL. I have yet to get my formal proposal, and we have yet to meet with the staff for specific information/planning, but I have strong feeling that we're going to have our ceremony here. Gah... I'm getting anxious XD",2016-06-19 18:51:57

My girlfriends and I didn't plan on going into this bar but the man at the door was chatting with us and said, from what I heard, ""free shots because it's a birthday"". So at 12 am, after drinking all night, we decided to go in. We sat at the bar and told Brian what the guy at the door said and Brian laughed at us and said, ""we do not give free shots at this bar, sorry."" I was kind of mad and low on patience due to drinking so I walked to the door and asked him why he said that. He said, ""I said free shot for the birthday girl."" Fine whatever, I figured maybe I was drunk and misheard. As I walk back in to explain to Brian, he is still laughing about it and just ignores me! Terry then talks to me and is incredibly nice and said sorry about the mixup and gave the bday girl her shot. I understand that working as a bartender can't be an easy job but being rude and ignoring customers in a dead bar just doesn't seem logical.

It was super busy (waited about 10 mins per order) and the order did not come accordingly. 
Example 1: We ordered beef platter and it did not come after our 3rd round so we had to manually tell the waiter. 
Example 2: Luncheon meat comes in 3 pieces per order. My friend ordered 3 so 9 pieces but only 4 pieces came.

And there were some minor error here and there but these 3 examples got me pretty annoyed. 

I would personally stick with the lamb or beef, not the garlic chicken and garlic beef because they were so salty! It made soup super salty and I had to add water to it.

I was really nervous about going to this place after the Smashburger disaster. The Smashburger disaster of course was when me and the rest of Tempe getting super excited that a supposedly legit burger place was coming to downtown Tempe, then I got there, and it was horrific. A patty and bun essentially served in a pool of grease, horribly over-seasoned fries, and a stomach ache that ruined my afternoon.

Needless to say, I was a little hesitant to get my hopes up for a new over-hyped burger chain near my office.  That said, I was actually pleasantly surprised with Five Guys when I went there for lunch today. Yes, like a moron, I went there on their very first day open, always a dangerous move mind you, so of course it was slammed. However, the place was very well staffed and they handled the crowd no problem.

Basically the deal is you get hamburgers, cheeseburgers, or bacon burgers, one or two patties, and a large selection of toppings, all which are free of charge. You also can either get Regular Fries or Cajun Style Fries.  The burger was juicy and flavorful. The Cherry Coke was as magical as you'd imagine, and the Cajun fries honestly kind of sucked. No real flavor to them and they were a little limp but boy did they give you a ton of them.  Luckily for them, I was still mesmerized by that heavenly Cherry Coke, but I digress...

Five Guys is by no means gourmet or fine-dining, but it is a very welcome addition to my DT Tempe lunching routine.",2009-12-04 22:26:29
Bq7PBXRaI8qgWQXeJx7XEQ,mrru6hbeQLvagU4vkfuqmw,ynmTXY9yJDiNkO4HUmxRSQ,3,3,1,2,"Alright, so I went to a Yelp event at KaKa AYCE and met some mighty fine Yelpers.  It was a fantastic tasting event, well organized and lots of food, however many of us Yelpers have reserved our opinions that night because we realized that the restaurant was just opening and the owner seems really enthusiastic about the opening.  The owner shared his vision of this downtown KaKa AYCE location to be a more upscale version as compared to the Markham location.  I can see where they are trying to go with this as it has a prime location and the renovation of the restaurant is quite nice.

The combination of the food and drinks was awkward.  I can see the intent behind some of the items trying to be more upscale, but it was like the chef who designed this menu got a little too creative without actually tasting some of these dishes.  We gave some honest opinion about the lychee mixed drink being too sweet (lychee liquor is already sweet, add grenadine for some nice pink colour, but then you're just drinking sugar).  I also grimaced at the dish with truffle oil drizzled on top of sashimi that did not look so fresh.  I'm not even going to get into the roll with asparagus, mayonnaise wrapped in sashimi.

It still seemed like a fine establishment that can recover, so I decided to host a lunch for my work team here.  I was curious about the AYCE torch sushi.  They did not take reservations for groups of less than 6. 
 When I came back on a weekday lunch I found out that they no longer offered an AYCE lunch menu.  We ordered a la carte, and the one roll that I would recommend would be the Chef Frank's roll.  We also had the poke roll and that was good too (pictures shown).  If you go here, definitely order these.  Don't order anything with truffle oil, or anything that sounds creative (coming from someone who is a very adventurous eater).

I was disappointed that they charged for regular green tea that would typically be free anywhere else.  Usually when sushi restaurants charge for green tea, it's something a bit more upscale and they would usually leave the tea bag in.",2018-04-10 22:12:33

I was no exception when I stayed here from 7/26-7/29 of 2013.  I knew that I DID NOT want to spend a tremendous amount of money on a room, and I also knew that I wanted to stay near Freemont St.  My usual hotel, the Nugget, was booked, so I had to choose something else - I ended up at the Plaza.  

The room I had (room 305) was not perfect - It did have some ""issues"", but for the money, I thought it was a good value.  Once again, however, I was just looking for a place to lay my head, have a shower, and call ""home base"" for the weekend.

The room was clean and neat, but the air conditioner leaked quite a bit on the carpet.  An initial call to the front desk upon checken yielded NO RESULTS, and no technician ever came to investigate/repair the issue.  The following day, I personally went to the front desk and spoke to Connie (dark skinned receptionist with tight braids in her hair) - She was AWESOME, FRIENDLY, and SUPER-HELPFUL.  A technician came almost immediately.  Although the problem was not totally resolved by the time we checked-out, it was ""better"", and I was impressed with their concern over this issue, as well as with Connie's customer service.

The bathroom was small, but like I said, I was not there to spend a lot of time in the room.  It worked for me.  

As far as the hotel goes, there were some nice parts (newer), and there were some run-down parts.  The elevators, stairways, parking garage, and ice machine areas were pretty old and ""needing help.""  The large confrence room area where the bingo hall is located was deserted most of the time, and downright scary at certain hours due to the ""interesting"" people that were loitering about.  One guy looked like he was on drugs, and another pair looked homeless.  I saw no security up there, and wondered how ""safe"" it would be if I were to have an altercation with someone of a ""questionable"" nature.  Yes, there were security cameras all around, but who knows if they are actually being monitored.....

The casino area was spacious and busy, but the drink service at the bars was so slow that I actually had to go over to the ABC store to get a drink!  The pool was nice, but they had recently drianed & refilled it so it was cold!  The area around the pool was a bit old & ""dated"", but I can see that it has a lot of potential for the future.

Would leave 3.5 stars if I could - 4 is too many, simply because of the few negativities that I experienced.....Final decision is 3/5.

P.S. - The Plaza IS charging a ""resort fee"" - This covers wireless internet access, parking, etc.  I believe this is pretty standard with most hotels these days, so BE SURE TO READ THE FINE PRINT WHEN YOU CHECK IN!!!  I knew about this fee ahead of time, but saw some other guests arguing about it when they were checking out!  LOL",2013-07-31 23:55:33

After debating a few eateries participating in Cleveland's Restaurant Week, we decided on Johnny's on West 6th for a late Friday night dinner. 

A maître d' to check your coat and assign customers to a white linen clothed table was the first order of business upon entering Johnny's. An old timer at the piano played cover songs throughout the night. 

An almost drone-like waitress with limited personality to take your drink order was next. No smile, no drink menu. They have wine and a full bar to make all the basics though as we were informed. I opted for the house Pinot Noir. Poor, poor Merlot. After that Sideways movie with Paul Giamatti, ordering Merlot seems like a culinary faux pas. My accomplice, not nearly the drinker as myself opted for the Earl Gray tea.

A few short moments after our drinks arrived, the near machine-like waitress was back to take our order. We opted for the 4 course menu. I started with the Baked Risotto with garlic sausage, duck confit, spinach and gruyere cheese. It sounded phenomenal, right? How could one go wrong with any of the above ingredients? And it was passable, but this risotto was dry, bland and lacked the knockout punch I was expecting. Next, I had the French Onion Soup, which I was later informed they were out of. How? It's onion, gruyere cheese, bread and stock. Oh well, Butternut Squash Soup sounded like a decent alternative. As with the first course though, it was bland. I was beginning to see the trend here. For the third course, I chose the Roasted Lamb rack en croute with port reduction. It was served with a butter knife, not nearly the piece of cutlery required to slice through the medium rare meat. Again, not impressed and pretty much underwhelmed. The lamb was cooked to a proper temperature, but it lacked any noticeable seasoning. The port reduction was over caramelized and bordering upon burnt. For dessert, a slice of Chocolate Mousse Cake, which tasted like it came out of the freezer earlier on in the day. 

On surface value, everything went according to plan. Both the front and back of the house appeared to run like a well oiled machine. Between each course, we were courteously asked about our meal. Nothing went unnoticed. Except for any sort of personality. The food was as bland as the servers and ambiance of the restaurant itself. A lot of the patrons appeared to be wealthy older professionals and their trophy wives. Perhaps this is what appeals to the old money in this town? Perhaps this is where the current 20-somethings humping the night away in the nearby Warehouse District clubs eventually come to die? Perhaps their cigarette and Four Loco destroyed palettes can't detect properly seasoned food? Who knows.

If you've ever stayed in the cookie-cutter Hampton Inns across North America, you know them as 3 story, light beige boxes.  Sure they have updated most of them recently, and I like their quirky sense of humor with sayings on the elevator doors and hipster vibe around the front desk & lobby area.  THIS location takes it to a new level of comfort for an inn (pun-intended)...

Isabel at the front desk was awesome - ssshhh don't tell anyone but she gave me two packages of Gummy Bears upon checkin.  She was super helpful in explaining the hotel layout and amenities.  This is such a BIG property it could easily be called a Hilton or Embassy Suites.  Check out the pictures previously posted by other Yelpers and you'll see how nice the lobby and the rooms are.

Isabel also gave us a great sheet of dining options that are within walking distance (although being January, this Texan-in-Wisconsin drove to the restaurant).

One of the best things about the new HI rooms is that there are tons of electrical outlets.  On either side of my bed were nightstands with lamps that double as electric outlets for my iPhone, iPad and MacBook Pro (Yes, I am an Apple fanboy!)",2014-01-15 09:58:19

So, does this place live up to hype?  Absolutely not.  The only thing I can say about why it is so popular around here, is, ""it must be a Utah thing.""  It's part of their cultural identity... But their cultural identity is play-it-safe, don't-do-anything-too-different, and bland.

The food here is fine.  The soup is fine.  The sandwiches are a little mediocre.  The drink bar is fine.  But the soup is not to die for.  The drink bar is not to die for.

THE UP-SIDE:  Technically, you can shop here if you try.  I mean, the place does have a bunch of stores (albeit, an odd and faltering collection) along with your average mall fast food selection.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  Like a reconstructed skeleton of a museum T-Rex, Tower City stands as a loosely held together collection of business that could topple over at any minute; all the while, recalling the days when it stood proud and roared.  What used to be shiny, high-end, and way over-priced shopping, has been replaced with all things ""lesser.""  This provides for a less than satisfying shopping experience, and stands as a testament to all the wrong things that have been done to reinvigorate the Cleveland economy.

THE SUM-IT-UP:  Tower City is nice looking place with a jumbled identity.  It's fighting to stay alive as all the yupsters abandon it for the faux-neighborhood shopping at Legacy Village and Crocker Park.  It's a losing battle.

It's too bad it had to end this way, but until Cleveland can find a way to invigorate its citizens on the ""low-end,"" all these ""high-end"" appeals to the yupsters will continue to fall flat.  The city is dying, and right now the only thing that will stop the endless exodus is to rebuild from the bottom up; giving the poor and middle class people here a reason to stay and feel proud.

Steelyard Commons is a good start.  Now, the average person doesn't have to vacate the city to tend to their daily needs.  And, they don't have to pay for parking - another giant difference.  Let's hope there can be more good steps in this direction.

Either way, Tower City's days are numbered, and I couldn't care less.  If I wanna see a the bones of a dinosaur, I'll hit the Natural History Museum.  It costs less, and is far more satisfying.",2007-11-26 18:37:48

To start, I love the ambiance of this place.  I was skeptical parking in the strip mall, but the low lighting, dark atmosphere, and chic decorations transport you away to...well, Burgatory.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful in explaining some of the different options on the menu.  He didn't seem to mind at all that we were taking our time.

We started off with the Gorgonzola fries, which were awesome even without the yummy cheese.  They had the perfect crispiness if you ask me.  The Gorgonzola was delicious and complimented the fries well.  They were careful in making the dish not to put too much of the strong cheese over the fries.  Nicely balanced Burgatory (+1).

I ended up getting the ""Meat your Maker"" medium rare as per my waiter's recommendation.  Let me tell you, he was right.  This thing was awesome.  At first, I was a little disappointed--expecting the greasy goodness that I sometimes demand from my burger--but this one was different.  This one was...divinely refined.  All of the subtle flavors started to come to together and sing in sweet burger harmony.  The dry aged wagyu beef started the chorus with its sweet onion crust playing the harmony.  The beef alone had amazing flavor and texture.  It wasn't before long that the roasted tomatoes and Gruyere joined in the delicious melody.  Then, out of no where, the truffled shallot aioli burst on to my taste buds to steal the show.  It's like a choir of angelic burger fairies were dancing and singing on my tongue. 

 Ah yes, Burgatory, you have raised my bar on what I can expect out of a delicious, refined, perfectly conceptualized burger... I shall return.  Perhaps to raise my bar a bit higher ;-)",2011-12-20 01:26:20

The service is where they lose a star! My husband waited far too long for a refill on his soda, I would have loved to order one of their famous margaritas midway through our meal, and would have also liked to have another piece of their delicious asiago bread. I love bread and I can now consider myself a connoisseur after trying so many different types and this asiago bread at Mesa Grill is amazing! We waited a super long time for our entrees, but after our meal he was quick to pick up the payment. Hmph! I tipped generously regardless. It was pretty busy in the restaurant and I think they could have been understaffed, there is a possibility that our poor service wasn't entirely the waiter's fault.

I came due to a raving recommendation from a long time Phoenix resident. Fortunately, I've come to take Phoenicians culinary suggestions with a LARGE grain of salt. Having grown up outside Boston, and very close to the coast, I've found that locals have a difficult time recognizing good food.
Until recently, Phoenix seems to have been accustomed to very bland and boring food. That has obviously changed but there are still many stubborn hold outs.

That said, The Prime was among the absolute WORST chinese food I've ever had, along with Sing High in downtown. That's another story however.

The condiment containers, the table etc are all coated with a layer of grease. Bad start. The place was empty. Another bad sign. The most basic dishes were ordered. Sweet and Sour Pork. Tough, overcooked, inedible.

RIght!  We were actually given many options on the beer which I did not expect.  Hubby had Guinness and I had a Stella.  Good deal so far.
We shared a calamari appetizer which was generous, not oily with a very good spicy marinara sauce.  Really good deal.
Two entrees were Fish and Chips and Grilled Chicken breasts with veggies and a choice of potato.  There were two fish filets which were thick and juicy.  Fries were well done as I requested.  The tartar sauce and coleslaw seemed homemade and both were delicious.  Slaw was not mayonnaisy (is that a word?)  Chicken breast was ample and fresh but hubby thought it needed a bit of seasoning (perhaps marinating it would have helped). I tasted it and agreed.  A lemon or lime marinade would have done wonders.  Veggies were ample and not overcooked while the fries were extra well done as he had requested.  There were plenty of hot sauces on the table to choose from.   I must pay my compliments to the female server (sorry, I forgot your name) but she was soooooo attentive to our order and to our needs throughout the meal.  The owner came by to see how everything was during our meal and we gave him positive feedback.  This is the kind of restaurant/bar people should be going to because the owner deserves a chance to make it in this economy and because he gives good food, good service and an excellent value.  
Ventura Grill offers  basic american style menu items (some of which no longer exist as indicated by them being scratched off the menu) prepared well in a clean environment.  Nothing gourmet or fancy but with quality and attentive service. 

To the fool (a customer) who was giving the waitress a hard time over his mis-use of the coupon, STOP IT.

""They've been open a while now,. You have to give them time to get the kinks worked out. Let's just give them a chance.""

So we've been wanting to try this place for a few months now since we always see it on the drive home. Hoping to be pleasantly surprised, we made the 30-second drive and stepped into the restaurant. It was pretty busy, which was initially comforting, but the absence of a host(ess) for the first couple minutes brought my hopes back down. The hostess arrived and looked stern, stating that it would be a few more minutes before we would be seated. No welcome, just a firm statement. Okay.

Service was definitely slow, but our waitress arrived in a few minutes. I ordered wine and watched in a panic as she haphazardly reached across me to place it on the table, spilling wine down the sides of a tiny, but very full glass. My date and I placed our orders and I made my usual ""ew"" remark as he ordered his steak rare. The waitress picked up on it and shared an anecdote about her daughter and son-in-law--a strict vegetarian and a meat-and-potatoes guy. Totally us. We had a laugh and looked forward to our meal.

The crab stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, but there was a long wait for entrees, so we ordered another round of drinks. My wine came out in an even smaller glass (!?) than the first and my date was given a different beer (the first was still on the table, so I'm not sure why there was confusion.) I ordered a pasta dish, which was generously sized, but consisted solely of cooked noodles, blobs of cheese, diced tomatoes and shriveled spinach. It lacked sauce, flavor, seasonings--everything that would make it into a $15 bowl of pasta. The boyfriend's steak was disappointing enough that he didn't even bother taking home the leftovers. 

The waitress noticed I didn't eat much of my pasta and must have told the hostess, who came over and asked if I didn't enjoy my meal. I told her it wasn't what I expected and she walked away without another word. The server then came over and told me she was ""fixing"" the bill, which had already been presented. She then gave us the new copy of the bill with the pasta dish taken off. It was a nice gesture, but I'm surprised that the hostess never apologized, told us that she was offering a comp or took the opportunity to ask how they could improve the dish. It's like she knew what to do for customers in terms of service recovery, but not how to actually recover. It left me more disappointed and uncomfortable than if she had not done anything at all.

I'm glad that we satisfied our curiosity about the new Italian restaurant down the street, but this was definitely one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've had in a very long time. I would recommend stopping by Serafina's next door instead if you're tempted.",2013-09-16 22:43:37

I do give credit to the owners for trying to make it right (and it did help some), but still not the experience I was hoping for.

The first thing that was off putting is that the tables are extremely close to each other.  It wasn't bad when there was no one seated next to us, but when they did seat the next table, it made it difficult for them to get into the table and us to leave at the end of our meal.  It also was a little awkward because it was almost as if we were sitting together as one party and were a part of each others conversations even though neither of us had any desire to.

The second thing that was off putting is that there are signs everywhere for a three for $30 menu.  On the door, on every table.  When we inquired with our server about what the options were for that menu, she said they ""decided not to do it that day""  We asked her why and she said she would find out.  Apparently the executive chef was ""away on business"" and they ""didn't have the capacity"" to serve that menu.  I suppose that should have been a clue as to the experience we were going to have, but with a number of other appealing options, we ordered.

They were out of one of the appetizers I wanted to try, so I started with the escargot.  It was tasty and just as I expected.  Although so hot that when I took my first bite (several minutes after it was delivered to the table), I nearly burnt my mouth.  My fiance and I both had the pumpkin bisque, that day's special.  The bisque was tasty and we both really enjoyed it.  

Both of our appetizer dishes came out fairly quickly, so we were expecting the same for our entrees.  The restaurant did get more crowded as we were waiting, so some wait time would be expected.  But 15 minutes went by.  20 minutes.  25 minutes.  And not even a visit from our server.  As I was getting ready to flag any restaurant personnel down, our server finally returned to let me know there was a ""mishap"" in the kitchen and that they ""had to do some scrambling because they were out of arugula"" and that our entrees would be up soon.  It  was another 5 or so minutes before my fiance's ravioli were delivered.  She indicated that since they don't have a warmer, they brought his out so it didn't get cold.  

My Paris 66 Galettes came out about 5 minutes later.  I hadn't had galettes since a visit to Brittany in college, so I was extremely excited to try them.  It didn't disappoint.  Very tasty and met with expectations.  the mushrooms were perfectly flavored.  I just wish there had been more of them!

The owners of the restaurant came over while we were eating our entrees to apologize for the delay and offered us free dessert to make up for it.  It was a nice gesture and we enjoyed our desserts but it didn't quite make up for the extreme delay.

When we ordered desserts, we learned that they were out of bananas for the nutella crepe, so my fiance had it with strawberries instead.  (which turned out to be amazingly tasty).  

Now - the desserts were amazing.  In fact, it may be worth a return visit just for drinks and dessert.  I especially enjoy that they have a huge selection of macrons.

Will I return?  Probably not, unless it is just for the desserts.",2012-11-01 17:12:06

Or some of those crunchy tortilla chip pieces would definitely up its game. My stuffed french toast was awesome sauce. Didn't even need any syrup, I ate it with a side of whipped cream.

They do close for a few hours; closed from 3pm and reopens at 5pm (before they close would be considered lunch and after would be considered dinner). With lunch, you will get a slightly smaller portion but with that- free salad and soup. Ugh, don't get me started on the AMAZING peanuty-like dressing for the salad, IT IS SO GOOD. 

I ALWAYS get the Chicken Pad Thai and Beef Drunken Noodle. Honestly, I'm not just saying this but every single place I eat Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle with, it's never as good as Yupha's. I always compare my Thai food with this restaurant's because it always comes out SUPER flavorful and bold, no ingredient is ever skimped out on, and the texture of the noodles are great. We occasionally get the Pad Woon Sen which is like a plate of clear noodles (with veggies and all that) that come with a bowl of rice and your choice of protein- that dish is a great neutralizer to all the bold, savory flavors that you're getting with the Drunken Noodle and Pad Thai.  If you're ever not a fan of bold, savory, flavorful kick in EVERY bite, get the Pad Woon Sen to cancel it out.

That was when princess Olga travelled locally and was looking for perfect everything in not-so perfect country of America ( outfits, boyfriends, food, grades, teachers)...
Those days are long gone. I was thrown off my throne of High Expectations onto the cold ground of real life, got to my feet looked around and realized - if this world is not perfect, why would the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport be?
First of all, airports are not meant to be the equivalent of your couch or local coffee shop. They are just the transient stops on the way from point A to point B.  Second, you are thrown from your comfort zone of your fast decisions and purchases (your pants are falling without the belt but bra's metal is still making you an outlaw!) onto the common playground of terrorists and outlaws.
 Your dignity is gone along with your prohibited shampoo and oversized perfume (perishing in the garbage can, good bye, Channel, good bye). You are basically being kept hostage in the desert of misunderstanding, with $3 water and $10 sandwiches, but oh well...
At least all Hopkins wants from you is the mutual acknowledgement of the unpleasant situation: you are their burden (no, not the customer), they will help you get where you want (hundred years ago it wasn't possible!), you better be prompt, apologetic, grateful and with carry-on of appropriate size!
I love Hopkins with all my heart and simply by comparison to other monstrous airports:
1) Parisian Charles de Gaulle International Airport discriminates everyone by not speaking English ( C'est la vie mon ami),  being openly hostile to foreigners ( as if they are rarity in INTERNATIONAL airport) , and by harassing passengers (once I witnessed in horror how the local French Police was undoing the cast of the elderly American tourist; the grandma with a broken limb (prototype of the terrorist I guess) was in tears and police was chuckling)
2) Russian Moscow Airports (all of them!) charge you a bloody murder for any food or  luggage carts, speak broken English , delay flights mercilessly, and provide very doubtful security (robbery within airport is a common occurrence). They also don't discourage smoking in the bars of the airport and have very few non-smoking signs.
3) The  airports I travelled through within America - Atlanta, New York,  Chicago were also one hell of a disorganized mess- they don't announce change of gates in Chicago, they are rude to you in New York, they don't acknowledge you in Atlanta....plus does anybody really enjoy taking a train from one terminal to another?
So yes, I will take my little comfortable Hopkins with convenient local shops where you can buy anything last minute, comfortable sitting areas, and polite customer service any minute over any airport in the world.  
Plus it's almost always empty which gives you that false pleasant reassurance that you are the only one in the world travelling and you do matter (which will be taken away from you literally on next connecting flight).

The Champagne Delice is pink and pretty (great for a girl's birthday or bridal shower) and apparently it is made with real champagne. The flavour is very subtle and nice.

I recently visited Windsor for the first time with a guy friend who is also a big foodie. He and I were really excited thinking that their happy hour would end at least by 6 pm like most places, but it ends Very early at 5 pm. That is something that does not make sense to me especially since most people's work days do not end until 5 pm. 

Moving on...

We were seated on the patio, which at first was awesome and beautiful and comfortable since they had the misters on. Then as the sun started to disappear, the mosquitos started to appear. I was badly eaten up around my ankles and on the top of my feet by the mosquitos on the patio. My guy friend had to request that they bring over one of the citronella candles; that helped a little but it was already too late.

Now the food...

The beers that they have on tap were delicious and I truly enjoyed them. I had the Windsor Style Backyard burger without the bun, wrapped in lettuce. It was perfectly prepared and the toppings complimented the flavor of the burger. I had their Mac-Cheese as a side and was pleasantly surprised. When I think of Mac-n-Cheese, I think of only getting this dish as soul food restaurants normally when I am back East or down south, but they actually did a very good job with the flavors. :)

My friend ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, which on the other hand was not as culinary pleasing as my dish. The salad lacked flavor, dressing, and excitement. The Ahi tuna was prepared very well, but the salad portion lacked on various levels. He told one of the servers about his lack of culinary orgasms with the salad and the manager Lisa came out and talked to us and also removed it from our bill. We were not expecting that, but it was a pleasant surprise and I appreciate a customer service driven and involved establishment. Lisa was adorable, professional, and a great listener. 

With that, I will be back. I am overall impressed with their establishment and the service.  Next time I will sit inside and arrive prior to 5 pm to enjoy their happy hour as well.",2014-10-05 20:01:31

It starts as soon as you walk in the door. You pay a ridiculous amount of money. My total was over $13 for lunch and a drink. (Instead you can have the much healthier, local-sourced ENP soup and salad buffet as an add-on to multiple $10 entrees plus a drink while your kids eat off the bar for free.) You get a dirty tray that's wet--they say they just washed it; don't believe them. I took a napkin to wipe it down just so it wouldn't be wet, and it made the napkin all dirty.

The disgusting food is laid out in several sections. Gross salad with fattening, wilted toppings, fried things, sauce-covered things, etc. There are 3 vegetables, but you have to have a secret password to eat anything that might be good for you. Items are not exactly ""pure"", e.g., my salsa had a glop of butter dropped into it. Yummy! (All jokes aside: The rotisserie chicken was really good. If you can get $13 worth of that, go for it!) About 1/3 of the items are in the dessert section. There is a chocolate fountain, but that is only to cover the crapiness of the items you dip in it. I tried to eat one of the rice krispie treats without the chocolate, and I nearly choked. Also, the chocolate is luke-warm. 

EMT crews are available for heart attacks.

Anyway, thank God I brought ""Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models"" by Gelman & Hill because at least it gave me something positive to say about  my experience today: ""I love how Gelman sees problems from multiple angles and builds flexibility into the models.

Several weeks ago I wrote a scathing review of my ex-breakfast diner. (Sorry, but I feel strongly about my bacon and eggs.) I vowed never to return there after yet another botched breakfast. I had to find a new diner-style establishment close to home. Not a fan of the brunch buffets. I was looking for a no nonsense reliable place where I could enjoy a couple of eggs over easy. Not as easy as it sounds. A few places looked promising but they were closed on Sundays. Finally I went to the one place where I knew my search would end - right here on Yelp. Lots of great reviews on breakfast nooks in the area really helped me to narrow it down to a few places.  

Eighty8 caught my eye. Cool name for one. Plus they scored high in value and good home style cooking. I decided to give them a try. The trek from Markham to Thornhill is a short one on a Sunday morning. The restaurant is tucked away in a little plaza on John Street. As soon as we walked in, I knew this place would be perfect. Quaint decor, cheerful, friendly staff and great coffee. We were off to a good start. Simple menu, check. Low prices, check. WiFi, check. The final test was the actual meal. Eighty8 passed with flying colours. A simple breakfast served hot and quick and free coffee refills.

Their beer selection has also decreased remarkably. Their selection isn't bad but it's not noteworthy or distinct from other Lakewood beer stores like Rozi's, or Cap n' cork. They still have 5-6 coolers of singles - organized by style (nearly American micros, but nothing that uniquely distributed) and heavily focused on IPAs with some more expensive bottles $10+ from the Ohio breweries but their overall selection still had decreased from the past. 

Their selection was great but now it's a-okay. If I cared enough, I'd argue Chas that Rozi's or somewhere probably has a larger selection...

Another weekend, another HK style cafe to try.  Blue Ocean offers more than your average HK style cafe in terms of dishes and is a pretty good place to try out if you're in the area.

Pros:
Menu is more extensive than most HK style cafes
Prices are good

Cons:
Service is a bit slow

Reading past reviews one would think to avoid this place.  However, after going myself I didn't see most or any of the problems the previous reviewers experienced.  We came on a Saturday night.  It was busy but the turnover was fast and we were seated within minutes.  Blue Ocean is situated in a plaza with a ton of other HK style cafes.  If the wait time is huge, you can always go to the other ones here so it's no biggie if this place is too busy at any given time.

One look at the menu and I see items offered that I don't normally see at other HK style cafes.  They have 10 oz rib steak dinner here!!  I didn't order it this time but I will be back to try..  maybe.. lol.  There's also Japanese inspired pastas a la Shiso tree.  I ended up ordering the Hainese chicken on rice and my GF got the pan fried chicken steak on pasta with cream and tomato sauces.  Both items were on a seperate special menu dinners which all come with soup and a drink.

The food came out rather quickly.  My Hainese chicken rice was pretty standard.  Nothing special, nothing amazing.  One thing to note is that it was all boneless.  I don't know if I just got lucky or if this is a standard for thm, but it's a good thing.  My GF's pasta was alright too.  My little one loved the pasta and she's rather picky now so that's another plus.  The tomato sauce wasn't tomato-y enough though.  It tasted a bit watered down.  All in all, the food is good for HK style cafe standards.  You can't come in to this place and expect 5 star cuisine.  You shouldn't be going to HK style cafes if you do.

The prices here are standard and at times pretty good depending on the dish in question.  You get pretty good value to.  The portions could be bigger, but it's not downright abysmal.  The service can get slow at times when it's busy, but it's nowhere near as bad as previous reviewers say it is.  I saw a table beside us order a baked pasta with spaghetti. It came out with penne by mistake and tbe customers really wanted the spaghetti and they took it back for them no questions asked and made them a new one pretty quickly.  

All in all, Blue Ocean was a pleasant experience for us.  It wasn't amazing but it was nowhere near as bad as previous reviews make it out to be.  Either they've really cleaned up their act since those reviews are it was never that to begin with.  Either way, it's a decent place and I can totally see myself coming back when I want a cheap meal.",2015-07-14 11:54:24

If you continue straight through to the corridor there is a patio which has darts, corn hole, the bathrooms and stairs to the right to get to the 2nd level. Take the stairs up, then walk across the rooftop patio which has some seating and you will finally reach the club. 

The 2nd level houses a small indoor dance club very similar to Smashboxx. The DJ played a mix of hip hop and EDM and the bar is pretty large so you don't have to fight much to get a hold of a bartender. The VIP booths surround the dance floor and the light effects are mediocre. 

There's another set of stairs right in front of the dance club so you don't have to go all the way around to the initial ones you took to get there. These lead straight to the bathroom from the 2nd floor down to the 1st. 

The age group and ethnic mix was extraordinarily diverse. Probably the most mixed group at a bar or club I've ever seen, even more so than Las Vegas. Ages ranged  equally from the 20's to the 60's and a fairly equal number of men and women as well. 

Overall, the layout is interesting and there's some free seating as well as games to play. Ideally, this isn't where I'd like to spend my Saturday night, I'd rather be at The Mint or INTL. I would take relatives visiting Arizona, or friends that just want to ""chill"" and not party, here, or even a date - that would be fun. But if I really want to have a good time, I want to hit a proper dance club with my friends. But that's just me. This place isn't for everyone but it does have a lot to offer.",2014-07-21 07:24:29

As soon as I walked in, I was immediately greeted and the guy at the cashier asked if it was my first time there. I was offered an explanation of the different teas. Then a girl came over & he tells her to give me some samples. 

Upon trying the bobas, I asked what is popular and she suggested Jasmine Latte with Sea salt creme. I addded boba to it. She says they use honey instead of sugar.

It took only about 2-3 minutes for my tea. It was unique, earthy but was perfect, not too sweet and definitely not bland.

When we discovered that it now has a location at Weston/Rutherford area, we decided to give it a try.

The first few times the wait times seemed abnormally long, but this has gotten much better. They are still longer than at Mucho Burrito, but there it is more of a ""cafeteria style"" (you follow your order down the counter and they ask you want you want on it). Here, you order what you want and they prepare it to your specifications.

I've had the burrito (Chicken/steak) and the quesadias. Both are excellent and filling. They've changed their quesadias and I prefer the way the used to make them compared to how they do it now (portion size has shrunk), however, it remains tasty, just not as filling.

This tiny restaurant on Pecos, in a massive parking lot has a variety to satisfy the taste buds.  I guess you either like it or you don't.  The kebobs are not sitting out, but in it's own refrigerated section.  The skewer is a decent size and I would consider it a generous portion for the price point.  

I'm totally into their chicken curry here.  It's a bowl of coconut milk, spiciness with thin strips of chicken and all the fresh parsley my bowl can hold.  The basmati rice is so fluffy, I'm glad it's all soaked in my curry sauce to make it that much more satisfying.  My husband really enjoys their chicken shawarma bowl, with some free added ingredients and some for an up charge. 

Their nachos are made with fried pita bread and their seasoning for their chicken is totally on point with me.  I really enjoy their tzatziki sauce, so I don't mind throwing that into the mix of it all.  They have their own version of hot sauce, a bit too spicy for me, but a little would go a long way.  

Prices are fair, but the running Groupon deal makes it that much more sweeter to try a new place.  The workers were nice, super patient and it made our visit quite pleasant on both occasions.

But then I saw the menu options and was quite relieved that this is a completely different place and decided to give it a shot.

This is a tiny restaurant with about 10 booths and 3 tables in the middle.  The menu consists of standard greek fare with Souvlaki, Pita sandwiches and salads for which the dressing is on each table.

I asked my server for a recommendation and he asked how hungry I was.  Since I didn't want to go back to work in a food coma, he suggested a pita sandwich.  Some of the people around me had the dinner plates and there is no way I could handle that even at dinner.  The pita sandwich was big enough that I just managed to finish it and the side item.

Side items consist of rice, fries, and roasted potatoes and 2 options that cost a little extra.   I opted for the roasted potatoes which were plenty and flavorful.   The chicken pita I ordered was tasty also, with seasoned chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and an awesome tzatziki sauce gently covering everything within the pita.

Service was good.  One of the cooks came out and greeted some of the customers during my visit so that's a plus for them.  It shows that they really appreciate their customers.  

Prices are very reasonable.  $4.99 and up for pita sandwiches.   I added a glass of tea and still got out of there for under $7 (without tip).

I've also noticed that the spice level isn't consistent. Mild is really spicy, medium is really really spicy.. and I'm afraid to try ""hot"". This is from a guy that loves pretty spicy food.

My least favorite item that I thought I would love was the ginger chicken. Really spicy.. but otherwise bland and not a whole lot of chicken. Lots of veggies, which is nice.. but not allot of meat. 

I've been a fan of their wonton soup however, and the crispy veggie eggrolls are good. Overall, I would prefer the fusion style Thai of places like LeThai on east Fremont.

Although the yelp listing claims Deagan's is not for kids, I called ahead just to make sure since it was mid-day. They said it was great. And sure enough, almost every table was half-filled with rugrats, so we were in the clear.

I couldn't not drink beer. Even though it was a bit early. So I had a Leine's Summer Shandy (one of my faves, which they happened to have on tap). My husband had something seasonal too (forgot what the name was).

I started with a cup of one of their two soup specials, the butternut squash. It was AWESOME. Delicious! Probably the best butternut squash soup I've ever had. It had some olive oil and microgreens on top; a nice touch.

Then I had the pecan-crusted chicken salad, which had baby greens, grapes, goat cheese, dates, and a miso-plum vinaigrette. Very large, really tasty. Two minor complaints: the chicken wasn't seasoned very much at all. The pecan crust was very crispy and would have been PERFECT with just a little more salt and pepper. Also, the dressing was kinda heavy and I would order it on the side next time.

My husband had the veggie sliders, which were unique in that they were made with smashed chick peas (are we saying ""smashed"" now instead of ""mashed,"" btw?). They were good, and just a tad spicy. They came with really good fries that unfortunately had way too much sea salt on there. So, some seasoning issues here. Heavy-handed in some dishes, too light in others.

Service was stellar. Seriously, everyone working here is so nice! And I loved the atmosphere -- wood paneling, brick, and hardwood floors. It was cool.

Daily specials seemed cool too. I will be back!

Having the Pink Taco on site was a perfect remedy. Collected my chips from the blackjack table as the sounds of Jimi Hendrix roared overhead and headed for the restaurant. 

Entering the place you can't help but notice the cool custom made low rider bicycles hanging from the ceiling, the funky star shaped lights draped over the bar area, and the modern Mexican - meets retro chic decor with all types of knick knacks, old radios, and items strategically strewn about. As the place was packed I went for seat at the bar and immediately ordered an ice cold Negra Modelo. What is terrific is that you get a free metal bucket of crunchy crispy tortilla chips with three different salsa's to dip into. This stuff is like crack when you are hungry and have been drinking! Lakers vs Spurs was playing on the bar tv's and rock music was blaring throughout. Yes, this is a man's paradise!

Started with the sweet corn tamales with pico and sour cream. Three tamales came on this plate and it was actually a good amount of food. Sweet and buttery corn flavored. Ordered the fish tacos baha style. Fish battered and lightly fried with serrano-cilantro salsa, shredded lettuce, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Refried beans and rice accompanied the meal. The fish tacos were very good, not the best I have ever had as I still have had better in NYC and CA, but tasty with just the right amount of batter and not over fried. I love refried beans too, and these were smooth goodness.

My one complaint is that they brought out my main plate a minute after I got the appetizer. I literally had to eat both at the same time. I hate when restaurants do that. Time management people in the kitchen! Learn it!

Our meal began with a bowl of flour tortilla chips (fried) that were simply tasty and memorable.  The salsa was a green (tomatillo) and a slightly hotter red salsa.  The salsa and chips cannot be beat!

I ordered a Hatch chilli and chicken combo that was true New Mexican in taste.  The one thing that I truly love about the food is that the sour cream is on the side, not all over.   I have a problem with dairy and sour cream can easily ruin my meal.

The server (part owner) was attentive and knowledgeable.  My son decided that he wanted to play with a small armor suit in the background (sans the knight).  The mask fell apart, but the restaurant and management were supportive and light hearted about it.  He had a smiley face pancake and fries, quite the meal for a four year.  My wife had the fajitas.  It was served with the hot peppers on the side, not to overwhelm someone who does not cherish the finer qualities of chiles.
The restaurant is small and has a romantic/quaint setting.  The price for a couple dining (no alcohol) is about $30.00 per couple (before tip).

What excitement - like the Grand Bazaar but different, and now sadly very different. With their impending closure deals are to be had during the current liquidation. I stopped in and grabbed a few items in the dry goods section for 10% off. No fresh produce of any kind is on offer - the many rows of fridges are bare and very dark.

Be prepared for a bit of sad scene. They aren't even playing elevator music. It's dead silence apart from the shoppers milling about price checking the items for deals. The staff is equally low on the energy scale too, as they are nearing the end of work as well, at least in their current capacity. One stand out was customer service, which is still pretty upbeat and trying to carry the happy flag until the white flag will be waved.

By chance I was looking for a deal on a hair dryer, which I figured they'd have a pyramid of. Turns out they sold out of them in the first days of their liquidation sale. Who knew that was an item that savvy shoppers run out for the minute the vultures gather.

My girlfriend was having her birthday here but was only allowed to order a choice of 4 different apps since I guess it would be hard to take individual orders in the kind of setting they have.  So 2 of my girlfriends and I decided to come earlier to order food and join the party after.

Service was horrible.  We were seated and then waited forever for a server to the point where I had to ask one of the people working there, if we even had a server?  10 minutes later someone was assigned to our table.  She was very friendly, so I give her that.  The food took forever once again.  Probably close to 30 minutes.  I ordered the chicken wings, and my friends got the regular poutine and surf and turf poutine.  My wings were supposed to be saucy but they were not saucy at all.  My friend didn't eat any of the steak in her surf and turf.  She said it tasted weird, like it was a frozen steak.  That's exactly how I felt about my wings, like they were frozen wings.  Even Pinty's frozen wings were better than these. The food is definitely not something they excel in.

We didn't play once we joined the party because we weren't really interested.  My gf that was having the birthday got one of the private rooms in the back.  They should've really re-thought the design because many glasses were being broken throughout the night.  The balls  were being kicked everywhere hitting glasses that were on the tables that lined the room.  The room definitely does not hold a lot of people so the extra seating they have in the back was pretty convenient.  I do not have plans to return at all.

CzNyRYifsdtXmqPchckhcg,nHxQfB9CRettoPKJmkDx_A,ESzO3Av0b1_TzKOiqzbQYQ,3,3,0,0,"When I went to Rock Bottom, I didn't know what to make of the restaurant.  Is it American food?  Mexican?  European?  There are no defining characteristics on the menu (or in the décor) that can help with this conundrum.  After eating at the restaurant, I did some research.  Rock Bottom is considered to be a brewery first, serving ""American style"" food.
Upon entering, we first noticed the large bar, and pool tables at Rock Bottom.  It was a Saturday afternoon, so the bar wasn't hopping, but you could tell the staff was preparing for a busy night crowd.  Before lunch I decided to wash up (as I always do).  The bathrooms are located in the back of the restaurant, past the bar.  Behind the bar sits an enormous room containing large copper vats that ferment and produce their homemade beer.  I was amazed at the mammoth containers; how much beer can these things hold?  I sat and watched for a while as the brew masters checked gauges and temperatures- what a cool job!
I returned to the table and looked at the beer menu; Light Lagers, Wheats, Red and Amber Ales, Brown Ales, Pale Ales, and Darks....how can you choose?  It was too early for me to drink, but my brother-in-law chose Ale.  I tried the beer; it was clear (no cloudiness; a trait that often eludes home brewers) and crisp, with lots of hoppy flavoring.
The lunch and dinner menu is a labyrinth of different cultural cuisines.  Some of the appetizers include Brewery Nachos, Quesadilla Rolls, Guacamole and Chips, Spicy Spinach Cheese Dip, Buffalo Wings, Firecracker Shrimp, Seared Ahi, Ball Park Pretzels, Titan Toothpicks (chicken and cheese in tortillas), Edamame, Onion Rings, and a Sampler Platter.  Now, just try to explain to me which culinary avenue Rock Bottom is exploring here.  We chose to forgo the appetizers, but had small dinner salads that were fresh, with homemade dressings- very good.
I ordered a standard Cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, cheddar and onion.  You can now choose your patty at Rock Bottom: try chicken, turkey, or ground beef, not a bad idea!  Also ordered were; a Reuben, Chicken wrap, Brewery Chili, and Steak Salad.  My burger was good; cooked medium with sharp cheddar cheese, and a fresh bun.  My Mom had the Reuben, and thought that the meat was very lean.  Believe me, if the corned beef wasn't to her specification, she would have let us know.  The bread was toasted nicely, and Swiss cheese was abundant, as it melted all over the sandwich. My sister thought her steak salad was good also- the meat was tasty and fresh.  My brother-in-law enjoyed his chili; not too spicy.   
To me, Rock Bottom is an enigma; I'm not really sure what to make of it.  I need to put my reviews in classifications, but I can't with this one.  So, let's call it a brewery house with a diverse menu.  The food at Rock Bottom is really good, the portions are generous, the price is right. Also, the servers have always been courteous when I've eaten there.  I hear from reliable sources that it's a good place to go on Friday and Saturday nights.  
Rock Bottom isn't a particularly expensive place to have lunch or dinner.  The food is well-prepared, and there are many choices if you have picky eaters in your group.",2010-04-16 00:19:07

We ordered the bambu special and the bambu favorite. It looked exciting but my husband felt bambuzooled. Lol. I think it just wasnt our kind of treat. There was so much going on in it that i didnt really enjoy the whole package. I knew in other circumstances id enjoy each ingredient but not in this way. The bambu favorite was more to our liking than the special. The special is supposed to have coconut but my husband didnt see coconut nor could i taste coconut. 

Anyway, bottom line...it is an aquired taste. Very interesting treat to try and id probably go back to just have a do over. But not anytime soon.

While most of the choices bring home flavors straight from the tropical island there are a few that will appease even those that don't much like the sweeter side of life.  As odd as coconut, mango and pineapple, served on hawaiian sweet bread, may sound it's something everyone should try at least once before giving judgment.

For those who know natives of the island, you know spam is ""the other white meat"" to them and one will find such a culinary delight here in their famous (at least to every co-worker I've brought here) spam sliders.

Went in to get a seat, as expected from a low end Chinese restaurant I was just overhand pointed to my seat by the waitress.  Is it just me or the more attractive physically the Chinese waitresses are the more unattractive their personalities tend to become when they are working at a restaurant.

Anyhoo, after doing the pattern matching between the Chinese order checklist and the menu which had English; I couldn't get someone to provide me the English checklist and their menu does not have numbers to correspond to the checklist.

So just a fair warning to potential customers, don't expect good service from here, at least unless the one that looks like the owner (some middle aged Chinese guy) is around.

I ordered two dishes for myself.  An stir fry eggplant with ground meat dish.  The dish itself was quite good, though it was a bit on the salty side, I think they can do with less, the taste is quite good already and masked with the salt they had put in.

The other disk I got was the pork/leek dumpling.  The wrapper is good again (or at least better than what I had tasted last time) otherwise this would've gotten them one star less.  The dish itself was good except for the high salt content.

I think they may want to to get some rice in order to buffer the salty taste, but I am not a big rice fan so I just had to drink more tea to flush the salt down.

If they fix the salt level, make it more non-Chinese friendly and get rid of those waitresses that do not really want to be there, they may end up with another star or two from me.",2011-08-21 17:12:42

Our waiter was polite and actually pretty helpful in explaining our options and apologized when he delayed once on the way to our table. I ordered the Tuk Mandooguk and Pajun as an appetizer. I found the spice level(for my tastes) on the Tuk Mandooguk satisfactory. I actually low-balled it with a ""2/5"" spice level and will probably try for 3/5 on the next visit but I've gone to chinese restaurants and ordered 6/6 spice and felt like I was having french fries or something...so I'm glad they actually put HEAT in their food. I find it hard to commit a higher review until I try something with tofu and more spice but I'm pretty impressed so far.

A menu suggestion - I'd say, in general, it'd be better to simply have a ""vegetarian section"" of the menu rather than have the ""can be made vegetarian"" option or underneath each menu item, have something like [Vegetable $11 Pork $12 Beef $12] or whatever. Without either, when I instinctively see the green broccoli and don't see a meat listed in the item description, I assumed it's a vegetarian item and didn't require an additional request to make it vegetarian. Fortunately the helpful waiter came back and double checked, likely because I was ordering previous vegetarian appetizers, but on a typical day, I'm worried it would cause problems for other vegetarians who come. ( I know there is a ""key"" also that says ""item CAN be made vegetarian"" but again, I don't think many study menu details that much in restaurants.) Its just better to be ""safe than sorry"" because I know I would have a 0% chance of eating an item with meat which results in me having to trade with another person at the table or having to send it back which upsets staff.",2013-10-15 03:38:47

We shared a large Tom Kah soup, ordered it medium spicy, and it was perfect.  We also shared a Pad Thai, a Satay dinner (3 chicken, 3 beef), and Asparagus with Shrimp and Mushrooms from the Veggie Lovers section.  I checked the menu online before we went, and was surprised to find that the soup was a lower price in the restaurant than on the website.

Six satay skewers don't divide equally by four, so I only had the beef, and it was terrific - tender and moist, with a great peanut sauce on the side.  

The Pad Thai would have been fabulous, too, but our friends wanted it mild.  The waiter (owner?) brought the hot stuff on the side, which served the purpose, but I like it better when it's cooked with the food.  Still, it was delicious.  Next time we'll get it with a kick.

The asparagus dish was also wonderful - the asparagus was done just right, the shrimp were a decent size and properly cooked.

Panna has beer and wine.  I had the house Riesling, which turned out to be Chateau Ste. Michelle, not my favorite Riesling, but a known good brand.  The guys had Singha, the Thai beer.

The service was impeccable.  The waiter returned several times to make sure everything was okay.  A waitress came over a few times, too.  The restaurant is pretty, with nice soft lighting and beautiful wall decor.  

One thing that really impressed me:  we were the last people to leave the restaurant, so they were doing some closing cleanup on the other side.  I didn't see it, but my friend told me that they were spraying and disinfecting all of the menus.  I appreciate this, since I'm a bit of a germophobe, and don't like handling menus and then eating.  I also think it shows a concern that many restaurants don't have.

I went here on a recent Saturday night with fellow yelpers Dion L. & Simone M. We arrived around 7 PM & due to the first night of college football, the restaurant wasn't too busy. We were seated in the lounge area. Our waiter (wish I could remember his name) was absolutely fantastic. So friendly, knowledgeable, funny, & witty. 

We started out with the tuna mango bruschetta, which was AMAZING. I really think I could have had two of these & been happy. It had just the right amount of ""kick"" to it & the tuna was perfect. It all tasted very fresh.

I ended up getting the crazy roll & shrimp tempura roll. Delicious! The crazy roll was my favorite.

You'll probably recognize one of the bartenders, Bob...he recently left Soul Gastrolounge.

Drinks are exotic & they'll even craft you up one if you tell them what all you like.

Service is top-notch, friendly & the place is clean. Prices are what you would expect.

I'll definitely be back!",2013-09-18 16:53:01

Their pho is reasonably priced but lacking in quality.  Came this afternoon for a quick bite, had sugarcane shrimp and bun bo hue.  I don't expect them to make very authentic bun bo hue because many Vietnamese restaurants Toronto couldn't make authentic bun bo hue, but I do expect the quality to be at least average.  It was an disappointment as bun bo hue didn't come out hot.  It looked cold and lukewarm, and the broth was just not good.  It's so mild I can hardly taste any spice.  I also did not taste any shrimp paste and I think they use a little bit curry instead.  Sugarcane was fine but no dipping sauce at all?  Anyway, I've requested some dipping sauce and clearly they had forgot.
Overall I think probably the experience would have been better had I ordered pho instead, at least they don't skimp on the ingredients.
Overall, for me I find it hard to like this place.  They clearly don't know how to handle the service although the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, and they are not understaffed at all.  The food quality is also very mediocre at best.",2016-06-19 19:37:01

I got the sirloin steak lunch combo and it came with
-soup and salad
- 3 California rolls, 3 spicy salmon rolls
- fried rice, pretty good. Very oily but good lol
- fried veggies, mushroom and zucchini, I liked them as well. Wish there was a bit more.
- your choice of meat, I got steak, that was really good, really tender and flavorful.
- dessert which is ice cream 

I guess since it's freshly cooked in front of you, you're paying for the service which is why price is a little higher for the amount of food. I do enjoy the experience though and eating my courses when they're hot.

* Beef pad see ew ($8.95) - fat, phat, noodles done right! Everything was moist, seasoned well and the beef was also super tender. 5/5

* Chicken and beef satay with peanut sauce, egg fried rice and cucumber salad ($12.95) - we were able to get a mix of 3 beef & 3 chicken tender skewers. Great flavor. I also loved the peanut dipping sauce!  Get extra. So good. 5/5

* Bang bang shrimp appetizer ($8.95) - this was my least favorite dish. The curry sauce was a little lackluster, watered down and the shrimp flavor was off. My party enjoyed this appetizer, but then again they aren't as critical as I am. 3/5

* Coconut sticky rice with mango (mango sticky rice)($6.95) - a perfect end to an amazing dinner! I always feel like you need a special occasion to eat this, but man, I'll make an exception to have this every time I dine here! They make it exceptionally yummy! 5/5

The place is small but cozy - not uncommon in Pittsburgh - and I admit that when visiting Squirrel Hill I often look forward to the food I can eat at their various Asian restaurants. Unfortunately, my first experience and meal left me feeling exceptionally frustrated rather than satisfied. 

There are a few key reasons for this. Firstly is that I found the service to be slow; granted, I do allow leeway for this when servers are managing a large party, and I came with a fairly big dinner group. So while we could have benefited from someone checking on us more often to at least refill water glasses, I understand we were a large party - a few speed-bumps were bound to happen here.

Far more frustrating for me, however, was the trouble we ran into while ordering dinner - and this is something I am not so forgiving about. We learned as we ordered various meals that the kitchen had run out of key ingredients on the menu left and right, from dumplings to crab rangoon to teriyaki sauce. As a result a lot of us ended up skirting around classic Chinese dishes and choosing alternatives when we learned that key staples on their menu were simply unavailable. And, sadly, the food that came to us after all the trouble we had ordering varied in quality. For example, my order (a standard mix of different meats, vegetables and rice) came out ok enough, but the ""curry"" sauce on a friend's order was basically broth, it was so watery and thin.

Finding an out-of-order women's room in the back before I left did not do anything to sway my opinion in the restaurant's favor. And I admittedly feel obligated here to say that I do get that things happen. Restrooms need to be closed due to unforeseen problems, kitchens run out of ingredients. But still, the experience I had overall was incredibly frustrating, especially since we didn't walk in on a whim: our group made reservations well in advance of visiting. I can excuse some things, but I cannot excuse the lack of preparedness for our party. Hopefully, this is not the norm for Sun Penang, and in the future I have a chance to write a much more positive experience.",2016-10-09 00:00:36

Nothing memorable, just a whole lot of pastrami or corned beef stuffed between two slices of rye bread. Prices are in line with Vegas, $15-20, given the amount of meat included. 

On this last trip, I was starving and settled for a sandwich. The thinly sliced corned beef was severely dry and bland. It seemed like the meat had been sitting out, with all the natural juices and moisture being sucked out. The saving grace was the packets of mustard which provided some much needed flavor.

The included cole slaw was bad. It just had a weird, off-putting flavor. I took a little bite and thew it out. At least the pickle was alright, nice and crisp. Next time, I'll gladly pay the money and take the time to head over to Earl's in Planet Hollywood if I'm craving some sandwiches--at half the price, no less.",2012-01-01 21:30:45

If you're not a huge meat eater, the sides leave a lot to be desired.

Mostly because they cut all my hours and I still need to find a way to pay my therapist.

So for the last week or so it's (haha, proper use of the apostrophe, bitches) been ramen noodles, rice, ramen noodles, peanut butter, and ramen noodles. 

I've been trying to make the most of it. I look up ramen recipes on the internet. I make aesthetically pleasing bentos out of them. I even put pictures of my lunch on my livejournal, perhaps to maintain the illusion that I'm ""challenging myself"" rather than desperately clinging to the edge of poverty.

Alas, no how I try to psyche myself, there is no pick me up for the buzz kill one experiences when eating 15 cent noodles in front of your computer when your stomach and smug sense of culture are screaming for something...more...

Like dim sum. Like Great Wall's dim sum.

This morning I was stewing another batch of ""failure food"" when the insane craving for dim sum hit me like homosexual tendencies striking a fundamentalist preacher giving a sermon on how G*d hates Rastafarians.

On the outside, Great Wall looks like another two-bit strip mall attraction. You know, like all the stores next to it. But inside it's like the dining room of Hotel Awesome, where somewhat discontent-looking servers push around carts of delicious and deliver plates of FUCK YEAH to your table where you and your party can divvy them up/fight over them. Whatever fits your interpretation of Darwinism.

To be honest I'm surprised more people don't fight over the food.

For a mound of their delicious lo mein I would probably break a chair over someone's face. 

For a plate of their pork buns I would falcon punch someone in front of their kids.

This may seem a little aggressive...but it can be a fucking battle royale in there.

Especially when you don't have anyone in your party who speaks the language.

""Uh, yes, I'll take some of that, no, that, yes the thing with the shrimp in it. Oh, and some of that, too. No. To the right. Yes. Oh shit, where'd our ticket go?""

I remember watching a Muppet Babies episode once where the children were eating gruel or something and they suggested trying to imagine it as something tastier.

I tried that. It's a lot harder than it looks.

You swirl those nickel-and-dime noodles around on your fork and you try to imagine crab puffs or plates of peppered shrimp or mango pudding.

You try to imagine being surrounded by all your friends, plus some people you've just met, plus a whole restaurant of people speaking in their cafeteria voices (i.e. screaming at the top of their lungs).

And then you open your eyes and take a bite.

And you realize that you're alone in front of your computer screen with a mouth full of chopstick because in your daydreaming you drop your ramen all over yourself. 

Fuck.

I would crash a mini-motorcycle into someone's groin right now for a plate of their lumpia or shrimp dumplings.

Dammit.

Does anyone need someone to paint their nails and take them out shopping? 

I can't keep living like this.",2009-02-04 22:25:26

Service
Excellent as would be expected for a restaurant of this caliber. Seated quickly with a reservation. Server was professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and down to earth. Not at all stuffy. The server managed the dining experience while others performed the job of bringing the food and cleaning up. Water was always topped off. We were checked on at appropriate times but in a very unobtrusive way allowing time for conversation. Pace of the meal was excellent with just the right amount of time between courses to not feel rushed but also not feel like the wait was too long. 

Ambiance 
Very classy and upscale interior inside the Bellagio. Some dark woods and dark upholstery giving it .. a somewhat ""heavier"" feel inside than the competing SW Steakhouse at Wynn. Upscale without feeling overdone.  

Food
Everything was really just superb. Unique cocktails from the bar were beautifully presented.  The breadbasket... omg!  The pretzel bread was out of this world. The Caesar salad was one of best I've had. And the steaks, of course, are the highlight of the meal. Perfectly cooked. Sides are ala carte - try the mushrooms and of course the classic mashed potatoes!  The baked Alaska dessert was delicious with a passion fruit filling. Such a rare dessert to find in a restaurant. A plate of truffles was also provided since we were celebrating a birthday. 

Mojo
Exceptional. Great service and great food. Slightly more traditional interior design than the competing SW Steakhouse at Wynn but otherwise both are similar in many respects. Upscale dining at comparable prices, but your money is well spent here for an exceptional meal.",2017-05-22 04:50:48

My husband and I both started out with the onion tart, my friend had the escargot and her husband had the pate. The tart was fabulous and huge (perfect size for a light lunch). The escargot were a bit of a disappointment. Nothing bad but not as good as she hoped. The pate appetizer came as two slices rather than just one, a very generous portion. We all tried it and it was good (and it's made in-house). 

For our entree my friend and I each ordered the scallops, my husband ordered the duck and my friend's husband got the steak frites. The scallops were phenomenal. They came on a bed of house made organic creamed corn. Delicious to the last bite. My husband loved his duck. It was pounded thin and panko crusted and served on a bed of horseradish spaetzle. Granted, he loves anything panko crusted, but he did say the duck was good. I had a bite, but the panko crust turned me off (I dislike anything panko crusted). The steak frites was a huge portion and so delicious and bloody. 

For dessert we each ordered something different. I had the macaroon, my husband got the blueberry tart, my friend ordered the beignets and her husband ordered the sticky toffee pudding. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their desserts. Mine (the macaroons) came layered with two different kinds of mousses - dark chocolate and maybe caramel. It got a little too sweet towards the end, but it's dessert. Par for the course. The beignets came a huge pile of them with three sauces (one of them nutella!). 

I will definitely come back here again and I'd like to try breakfast here too. The food was great and the atmosphere near perfect (they need to ditch the TVs - they really don't belong there). Our next Yelp Eats meal at Digestif has a lot to measure up to now.",2009-07-21 14:59:21

The service worker told me if I added a polish then he could get me in immediately. So wait, you can't get me in even tho I PREPAID $100, but if I add a service to upgrade then you can? SHADY and annoying AF. I asked if I bought the detailing right now could they get me in now and the guy said yes. WHAT?! Again, annoying. Then he told me that my $100 pays for the labor to do my car, and if I just use my ticket (that I paid $100 for a month ago) that they wouldn't have money for the labor. Well that doesn't make sense considering you made $100 and I did not get my car detailed that day. He said they had 4 cars that were getting detailed and theirs takes priority over mine because they just all purchased theirs.

I asked to talk to the manager who then came over from the next car and told me that no he couldn't honor it right now but he could give me a free wash and schedule me for a day to get detailed. He explained he had six other cars (wait, the other guy said 4) that were getting detailed and mine wouldn't be done until 6p if I wanted it today (it was 11am).

Service: 3.5/5

First of all, the decor of the place is very nice. The place isn't noisy but has a good vibe. The place has very good selection of jazz music. On the other hand, the washroom has the traditional Japanese folk music which is pretty cool. There is a big screen showing Japanese movie/animation which brings me back a lot of childhood memories. There are game machines at the basement that you have to check them out!

I am very impressed with the quality and quantity of food. Lunch menu has a wide selections of set lunch and appetizers. My family and friends ordered five different sets. The portion is generous. We are all very happy with the dishes and they are tasty. 

Our favourite ones are:

Sizzling grilled eel stone bowl- you can add the soup when it is half finished to make it another flavour. 

Grilled two kinds of fish - fish is very fresh and well done. 

Pork loin cutlet - it is served exactly the way in Tokyo. The pork loin is juicy and flavourful. The sauce is specially good with the mustard!!

Service is a slow. There is only one waitress serving is difficult given half of the dining hall is full. But I have to say that the serving lady is very polite and friendly. She always offers children cutlery without special request. 

Tea is quite expensive. It serves fancy tea and seeing the tea leaves blossom is entertaining but it is too pricy and wish it offer a free refill.

Pretzels are OK. Not the best soft pretzels ever but they do their job. The pierogies, though. WOW. The plate of food is HUGE, but it reheats (or chills, even) well so leftovers are not a problem!

That's a tall order...but they  gave us a lot of options.  I really like that this nursery grows their trees in the desert.  That way, the trees are already acclamated to this environment.

My first visit here 6/8/16. There were no other customers. I was surprised by the small selection of baked goods. In the photo with the bakery items on shelving above greenish cabinet doors, that's actually their entire store. When I arrived it was about 70% empty, I arrived about 8:30am.

The patio is south facing so its nice and sunny but also has big umbrellas for those looking for a touch of shade.  There is also a narrow patio on the east side which is much very shady for those of the fairer persuasion.  They have Strong Bow on tap which is always a plus for me and being a traditional pub its nice to see that they have the appropriate glassware for each of their on tap pours.  This may be a picky thing for me but I like it.  They all pull a decent pint of Guiness which for those who don't know is actually less calories than a light beer and full of iron.  It's practically a meal in a glass!  Drink prices are a wee bit dear but they do have daily specials which are worthwhile.  The food menu is typical Irish Pub fare and decently priced, portions are also fairly generous.  The Joyce reguarly has live music which is often traditional and very entertaining.

The quality of the food and service is just as good as you'll find at the Bouchon in Beverly Hills.

For breakfast they start you off with some magnificent bread (shaped like leaves) and butter.  If you like bread you'll mow this down as soon as it hits the table.  For something hearty try the Hachis de Merguez, a sausage and potato hash served with two perfectly cooked eggs and toast.  The sausage has an earthy, Morrocan-style flavor, but it's not too strong or overwhelming.  If you want dessert for breakfast, the uber-rich Pain Perdu will knock your socks off.

We were greeted by the hostess at the outside hostess stand (good thing it wasn't raining) and promptly seated. Our food was very good. My guest had the veggie scramble (she loved it) and I had the warm chicken salad. Crazy ordering a salad after a race but it's one of my favorite entrées on the menu. Their biscuits are good definitely NOT your typical Southern Biscuit. They are light and fluffy but not buttery, more on the dry side and sprinkled with sugar. They are very good with honey. I can't comment on the Apple Butter because I don't like Apple Butter. I think of AB to be a crime against nature. I like apples in their natural form. So with that being said, we did not ask for it BUT I have heard nothing but great things about the AB, if that's what you are into.

The service was not great yesterday. It's been better in the past. We had to ask repeatedly for more coffee and water. We also had to swipe a bowl of creamers from another table because our waitress was nowhere to be found and we had to ask for honey.

The place has a lovely glass ceiling, and an interior of mostly brick and beam with classy wood tables. We brought a group here and everyone was impressed by it. 

Food wise, nothing was mind blowing but nothing disappointed either. It was a pretty broad menu with reasonable prices and something for everyone whether meat lover or vegetarian. 
Beer menu on their website was better than in person, as their taps were more focused on European brands or brands like Mill Street and Granville Island Brewing which give the illusion of craft beer despite actually being owned by major labels, with the exception of Great Lakes Brewing - but that was a pumpkin spice beer. Some proper craft focus would have really impressed me but thats the beer snob in me talking and I don't think anyone else complained or noticed this.

Aside from the food and drinks, the main reason most probably come here is for the billiards and ping pong. $20 an hour for pool, $25 an hour for ping pong. The tables are all well maintained and top quality. 

While I don't think the Royal York neighbourhood is an actual destination location, I will say that if you're local, this place is a pretty good place.

Great location relative to Fremont Street. Prices are reasonable and the rooms are large, clean, with interesting furniture and carpet patterns. My only issue was the inconsistency of the AC. On a previous visit, the room was freezing. On my most recent visit, the AC was turned to max cool but the room was still pretty warm.

Make sure to ask for a room in the north tower. The elevators for the north tower are right next to the check in desk, so the walk is super short and you can get a nice view of Fremont Street if your floor isn't too high up (higher than the 16th floor).

The payouts at the tables are good, too (higher than many places we visited on the strip). There's a restaurant, food court, and a little cafe that make dining easy.

Whether you're gearing up for a raucous weekend with friends, looking for something heavy to drink alone in your basement (hey, I won't judge, just keep the Dashboard Confessional quiet) or you're looking for an awesome wine to give as a gift to snooty and discerning wine drinkers, Co-op Liquor has got you covered. 

First let's talk about the beer fridge. In fact, let's ONLY talk about the beer fridge, because when it comes to wine I'm not one to be giving wise council. Whether you're a beer fanatic or a casual sipper of God's elixir, you're bound to find something you enjoy here. If you want something you recognize, you'll find plenty here: Big Rock, Keith's, Granville Island, Steamwhistle, Rickard's, Sleeman's, Kokanee and if you're really desperate, Coors Lite. Oh, and if you just rolled in from Saskatchewan, we've got Lucky. You're welcome.

But if you're like me and you want to try new things, this is the best place to do it. Microbreweries? Check. Fruli for the ladies? Check. Delerium Tremens? Check. Sapporro, Tiger, Lucky Buddha? Check. Rogue Dead Guy Ale? You betcha. Red Stripe, Newcastle, Fuller's.. it's all here. And yes, I've purchased every single thing on that list here before - possibly in a single trip.

One time my friend and I came here to look for a suitable beverage for my dad. We chose Zubr because it had a badass buffalo on it. Now every single time I go there I pick my dad up a Zubr. I don't even know if he likes it.

Bonus points because when something is on sale here, it's actually sort of, kind of on sale. Sometimes I wonder if the cashiers here are actually old enough to work there. I like to joke around with them too, freak them out by calling them by their first names. One time, I made a slightly exaggerated series of grunting noises when inserting my debit card into their machine. It made the cashier laugh though, so I count it as a success. I guess these kids have seen it all.

Black truffles, escargot, caviar, live crawfish, dry aged meat and a cranberry preserve made by Trappist Monks of the St. Joseph's Abbey sit next to 5 pound bags of generic Fruit Loops and 2 pound jars of Fluff. 

This is a grocery store unlike any other. It really does have it all. Once you enter the doors to this place, expect to be sucked into perusing for at least an hour, maybe more. Coming here is an event. The mundane duty of grocery shopping suddenly turns into an exercise of sensory stimulation.

Straight through the entrance is the produce section, off to the left is a beverage bar offering coffees, juices and smoothies. Each grocery cart is equipped with a cup holder, so take your frothy drink with you on your venture. Next is a cafe/bar area where you can order food to eat-in or take-with. Pizza's & burgers are made to order. A bar exists here that features a dozen drafts where growlers are filled. You can pay for all of this here, without standing in the regular checkout lines.

Next up is the sushi bar, olive bar, deli, emporium of cheese and charcuterie counter. Again, the choices here are plentiful. Best in the area as a matter of fact. Imported cheese from all around the world with various levels of stinkiness and a charcuterie counter that offers dry cured meats like ""gabagool"" (capicolla), mortadella, sopressata, speck, pancetta and prosciutto. There is no longer a need to stuff your suitcases with delicacies bought in Italy or France. Market District has it all. I was floored with the selection.

The bakery is next on our tour. Breads, baked goods and candy galore. We didn't spend too much time in this area because something else caught our eye. A live food demonstration was going on nearby. I thought I was at the IX Center's Fabulous Food Show. This isn't just a grocery store. There was even live entertainment! 

Then around the corner, the fish department featuring live crawfish (sold out upon our visit), escargot, branzino and other exotic fish I never knew existed. The selection here really was awesome. Next were cases of fresh cut meat. A display of various cuts including dry aged beef caught my eye. The displays were clear, well lit and designed to tempt. Don't come here hungry. The butcher and fish monger behind the counter were more than willing to help and chat about what they offer and how best to prepare said protein. 

After going around the perimeter, this is usually where I hit the dairy (plenty of local products offered including Snowville) and then check-out, but the middle aisles were unusually attractive. We went down each and every aisle. Exotic brands not carried by any other grocer in the area were present. Ever stumble across an unknown ingredient in a recipe? Yeah, they have it here. The ethnic specific aisles were vast and well represented as well. It really was an experience to travel down each aisle just to be amazed at the offerings. Some jars and canned goods completely unrecognizable because of the native language still on the labels. Real authentic shizz.

In addition to food, be sure to visit the beer section. Hop Snobs would be floored with the selection. Single bottles are sold here in addition to sixers. Did I mention they also have a full liquor department? Like I said, this store has it all. Including a children's play area (titled ""Eagle's Nest"") to drop your kid off while you shop. There's also a pharmacy, health/beauty department, bank and dry cleaner here. 

Checking out was a breeze. I counted 24 checkout lines, so they were certainly able to handle the crowd during this opening weekend. Hopefully after the grand opening excitement wears down, it'll remain as pleasant of an experience as it was on Sunday. Despite the crowd, it was well staffed and things ran smoothly. If it's still like this 6 months from now, I'll be sure to bump my rating up to a full-fledged 5 stars.",2013-08-12 14:16:23

The first thought that crossed my mind is where is the golf course? This place totally reminds me of a golf course club house; furniture and all.

The food and drink were awesome! As all of the Vig locations provide that great element. Access is super quick and easy off of the 101. The operation is beautiful and is a fantastic neighborhood. However, I like a place with a little more edge to it.

If I had my golf cleats on and those shorts with the built in goober belt, I may have felt more at home. It feels like a place for wanna be yuppy bikers to pretend their cool. You need to form you own opinions. Mine are just that. I'm sure it's a party when the patio is rocking and a ton-o-fun!

It shows by the way he, and his staff conduct themselves...particularly when it's time to come up with a treatment plan.

Food choices, are your basics. Har Gow, congee, rice noodle rolls, turnip cake etc. Prices range from $2.70-3 depends on size. If you order before 11:30 on Saturday, it's $2.50.

It's a 'limited service restaurant' meaning you generally order your food in the front and pay for it before eating. You then take your seat and someone brings the food/drinks and plates to your table.  You also have to get the cutleries and condiments yourself.

It's neither a large nor small place, more of a cozy place where you can have a quiet dinner with your SO or meet with your friends.

But it's not the ambiance that makes this place special, it's the food. 

The Soppressata Pizza is spicy and salty in a balance way that's completely addicting.

My friend wanted to check this place out for their restaurant week special, so we went late on a Wednesday night. I was surprised that at 9pm on a Wednesday this place was full and lively, but I suspect that is because of restaurant week. The special was chips and salsa, a small plate, and two orders of tacos (4 total, 2 per order) for $35. Seeing as to how we were going to split the bill, we decided it was perfect treat!

As mentioned above, I was surprised that a place this hyped up on Yelp actually met my expectations, especially given that it's a fancy place that has jumped on a new trend (tacos, much like the burger renaissance Pittsburgh experienced years ago). The traditional guac (+ cucumbers for texture--GREAT DECISION) was DELISH. Exactly what traditional guac should be. Chips were decent, and the tomato based salsa was bursting full of flavor and really good. The green stuff was not so good, but I'll get to that later.

We ordered the al pastor tacos and chorizo tacos and split them so that we each had one. I freaking love chorizo, and I freaking loved that taco. It had an egg on it, and it was like the best breakfast taco I've ever had and the sauce was spectacular! The al pastor has always been a personal favorite of mine, and tako knocked it out of the park. Very flavorful, grill marks on point, and again a unique and great sauce to accompany it. 

Service was attentive without being overbearing, but we were a low maintenance table and didn't require much. 

Overall the meal and experience was good! A few things to dock a star for:

The entrance is not clearly marked, and the front door looks like the door to a walk-in refrigerator. Seeing as to how the kitchen is open glass for the public to see, I thought we were accidentally walking into the kitchen, as the people at the hostess stand had their backs to us. As cool, funky, and trendy as the place is, they aren't above needing clear signage as to where the damn door is. 

Our table was directly across from the one person bathroom. While there was (thankfully) no gross smell, the layout of the area (table, lockers, stairwell, server station, and door to the back of the house) caused it to seem a bit jammed up at times and was distracting. Space is crucial and I didn't need a need for them to take up an entire wall of valuable space with non-functioning lockers.

Given how great this meal was, I am appalled at how incredibly lacking of flavor the salsa verde was. It literally tasted like nothing. No salt, no pepper, garlic, cumin, flavor, ANYTHING. It was odd because the red salsa was FANTASTIC, but the salsa verde literally tasted as if they blended up the tomatillos and poured it into a fancy jar. So so so so so so so so so confusing and I'm assuming it was simply an overlooked batch because the flavors of everything else were above and beyond.

Note #2: PBC is strictly carry-out, and there is no need to call ahead. You just walk in, tell the folks behind the counter what you want, they ring you out, and your meal's boxed up for you to take away. Everything's ready to eat immediately. 

On a secret, gravel-studded street off of Banksville Road sits a house of stained wooden slats. Spectral vapors can be seen floating into the air from a tin chimney only to vanish into a powder blue sky that serves as a backdrop for an early Spring evening. A campfire aroma will comfort your nostrils as vehicles race up and down the highway--you will briefly forget that you're in a major Northeastern city. 

The other day, I treated my family to another bring-it-home banquet, finally getting down to trying PBC after years of procrastination.

What we found were St. Louis Ribs that were fat with luscious pork that almost pulled itself from the bone and blushed when torn into. 

Speaking of which, the pulled pork sandwich was tall with protein, crisp skin, and sweet, blackened debris. 

A runny, vinegary sauce with just enough bite to it dressed the smoked animal flesh.

Whatever fires that burned in our traps were extinguished by a fresh, vibrant, crunchy cole slaw. 

A lackluster macaroni and cheese was kicked out for loitering while a serving of baked apples arrived fashionably late, stealing the spotlight with its wealthy, fruity, pie-filling lava. 

If barbecue is a science, PBC should at least be nominated for a Nobel Prize. 

I only wish they'd add potato salad to their menu.

My personal food obsessions notwithstanding, fly down to Banksville and take home some sapid, smoldering Southern fast food for you and yours. You'll win hearts and minds.",2012-03-29 06:23:46
k47KoQQc2VxwdQpkd9QXAA,L8GB1sEXJrVfR-UsDRjI-g,QWbRrFpE-xXAToUbO83Djg,2,4,3,4,"$41.25 for 20 wings, fries, and a pitcher of beer.  This works out to about $54.00 after tax and tip.

Just starting off, you know that Duff's is not cheap.  Even if we pretend that $20.00 dollars were for the pitcher of beer, you're still looking at $34.00 for some fries, and wings.

On one hand, you get celery and some dipping sauce (either dill, or blue cheese.)  On the other hand - you only get three pieces of celery.  All things being equal, celery is not really a loss leader.  You'd think they could have afforded to toss out, perhaps 4, or even 5, pieces.  But no, three.

That alone wouldn't be enough for a 2-star review.  What really let me down was when I asked about the Bold BBQ sauce.  Now, Duff's is not a place with dozens of difference sauces.  I think they had about 12.  Most of them were spices (medium, medum-hot, hot, hot-hot, really-hot, and some ""crazy hot"" things.)  

I wasn't feeling the spice, but I didn't want a sweet Kraft-like BBQ sauce.  I had hoped the bold would be similar to a hickory smoke.  When I asked what it was like I was met with a few stumbling answers, and finally, ""there's not whisky in it.""  Which, you know, is interesting and all - but not really descriptive.

I took a risk and went with it.  It was delicious.  The Bold BBQ wings are a great flavour, and go really well with the large bowl of fries you get with the combo.  

Unfortunately, the wings are smaller than the last time I was there.  I'm sure this is universal, across the board, in order to keep costs consistent, they need to make the food portions smaller.  But, I don't view $54.00 as a cheap meal, even when shared with another person.  

The wings were tasty - but no better, nor any worse, than what you'd find at most wing joins.  The prices are not delightful, but they are pretty much what you'd expect these days.  Unfortunately, it was the lack of knowledge about the flavours that really let me down.",2013-01-14 03:50:06

Ironically, my girlfriend had asked if I had been there before as we passed by heading to nearby Resident Culture Taproom. After a few hours and a few cold ones there, it was time to get the grub on... What came up among a couple other options? You guessed it. Soul!

Parking is a bit rough around the Midwood area, but we managed to squeeze the ol pickup truck in a spot at a nearby closed business. There was a bit of a wait, unless we wanted to sit outside in the covered area with supposed warmers. We chose to wait a few minutes, which turned out to be not that bad at all while they cleaned the awaiting booth for our group. We started with our drink orders. It took quite some time for the waitress to return to start our food order and in that time frame, they ran out of the sushi roll of the day special. That was frustrating since we waited to see her comeback so we could order one. Anyway, we ended up going with a Soul original roll. That was very tasty. We then moved on to the following tapas:

- ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS: First off let me say, I was excited about this because I am not a fan of pork belly .. or should I say, WASN'T a fan of pork belly until the SG version of pork belly entered my life. Combine that with the slight bite from the watermelon salsa chunk... makes you say OOOOWEEE.. like a pig.

- SHELLS & CHEESE: These were ""ok.."" Very cheesy, indeed. Filled with shredded style pork belly meat.

- FRIED MEATBALLS: Very tasty, especially combined with the yummy tzatziki!

- MINI BURGERS: Wow! Very delicious! Comes with three, we added a 4th (with an upcharge) since we had four people.

The fancy creative drinks are just that: fancy .. and pricey! But, you'll have that at a place that specializes in creative cocktails and liquor ON TAP! When you're in the need for the ""facilities"" there are two gender neutral lavatories near the rear of the establishment.

Everything we had was just fantastic and tasted great! We will definitely be back to visit in the near future!",2017-11-27 19:37:00

Ruben and I brought his cousin, Daisy here during one of her Vegas trips. Since there was a little bit of a wait for a table, we decided to hang out at the bar. The whole space feels large with the open-air setting in The Crystals. The beautiful decor and low lighting creates an elegant atmosphere. The bar was pleasant and we enjoyed our beverages, including a couple crafted cocktails. 

We didn't even have the opportunity to finish our drinks by the time our table was ready! We were seated near the edge of the restaurant (near the ""Treehouse""), so we had a view of the shops and open area with half our seating as a booth and the other half, chairs. It was really nice and very comfortable.

We started with Fried Calamari, served with fresh lemon (in a mesh, love it) and aioli. The breading appeared thicker than I normally like, but the squid was fresh and it was tasty. Ruben and I shared the Filet Mignon, medium rare, and Mastro's Crusted Salmon. The three of us shared the side dishes: Creamed Corn, Potatoes Au Gratin, Gorgonzola Macaroni & Cheese, and Steamed Broccoli. The steak was prepared perfectly and scrumptiously tender, the salmon was so flavorful, and the sides were all delicious.

Everything about our meal was enjoyable. The prices are similar to those of high end steakhouses, but the portions were generous. We were able to take home a lot of food!

I was told that there was a bit of water damage, not enough to make the indicator red (which is how they can tell) but it was apparent because the color was starting to change to light pink.  They told me that I needed to pay $99 for a water treatment.

Select your soup base, meats, fish, vegetables,  noodles and tofu.

Get your soup to a good boil and add the food you want to cook and scoop out what you eat.

They do have the option between white or wheat pitas. Just like subway, you pick what ever toppings you want. I choose lettuce, tomatoes, onions, feta cheese, a smear of hummus and tzatsiki sauce. The hummus was gritty like sand, kinda nasty. The tzatsiki was thick but it needed salt and more cucumber, it was pretty much just yogurt. The gyro meat actually had some flavor but it wasn't crunchy and juicy it was oily and soggy. I don't even think it was real gyro meat, sadly enough. For just the sandwich it was close to $8 which was not worth the price at all! I'd eat it again if it was like $5, maybe.

The daily soup specials are interesting and perfectly crafted.  The garden salad changes slightly from day to day to reflect available veggies...also delicious.  And always fresh. We have been here several times for lunch or brunch and everything hits the spot.   We will be back for dinner. 

""Melanie"" (or the owner) is gracious, professional and always checks in with patrons to ensure they are satisfied.  

Our go to favourite lunch is the curry chicken wrap ... One of my favourite lunches anywhere in the city.  

The restaurant is comfortable and casual and if the venue had a more unique character this would be a five star review all the way.  

One of the best on the danforth for sure.


So shortly after posting this review, we went here for dinner.   OMG    Dinner is ten times as good as lunch.   The food is fresh and delicious and the plates are perfectly paired.  Flawlessly presented.  And clearly prepared with great skill. 

I had the shrimp linguine - an instant new favourite for me.  My wife had the salmon.   Both of us raved about our experience.  I truly would have licked the plate if I were alone.   

Unbelievably good food.  Friendly.  Simple.   Honest.   Tasty.  And dessert??? Prepared in house.   Off the charts.   

Decor still needs an overhaul.   A 10k face lift would totally change the experience.   But I'm upping my rating to five stars despite this.   The food and service are just that good.",2015-05-24 20:15:46

Brought my truck in due to an rpm undulation which ended up be a bad tank of gas. 
They had the truck the entire day not bothering to get to me at all. When I finally called after 2:00 the girl was putting a pricing list together on things they ""found"" that they said needed to be done, never even addressing the reason I brought it in. 
When I told them to figure out the problem, they said they would get back to me, which they never did!

I took home a bunch of stuff yesterday. My wallet was sad; my house was happy. When I got home I realized that one of the items I bought was cracked. When I brought it back today, the woman immediately started trying to place blame. It went like, ""um, where did you have this in your car? Who rang this up?"" I felt chastised, like I was being blamed for the entire ordeal. I explained that I suspected it cracked on my way to the car or on my way in, carrying my many bags, considering it was wrapped in one piece of paper and placed in a bag. The employee responded in disbelief, ""We wrap things in one piece of paper all the time and this never happens."" I became tired of the line of questioning and the need to blame someone or something for the occurrence and I just wanted to get my refund and move along. 

It really is fun shopping here for home accessories and decor. It's a little bit of a hunt, which I find fun and exciting. Sometimes I think the things could be better quality, and a lot of items are cheap knock off's of more designer pieces but, hey, we can't all spend hundreds on a vase.

My most recent visit, I ordered a pizza. I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza. For $15, I can definitely go to another place and have something that tastes way better and doesn't lack flavor. Just an honest opinion.

Service was ok, but wasn't amazing. It got busy around lunch time, and always does to my knowledge. For that reason, parking is kind of crazy and hard to find something close. We had to park on the other side of the building. Thats just how it goes though, as there are tons of nearby connecting businesses that are forced to share a parking lot.

Longer version: We ordered three small appetizers (roasted eggplant dip was ah-mazing!); for mains, I had the chicken salad and my date had pasta.  Both dishes were excellent, though not very large.  We would have been hungry with the mains if not for having the appetizers.  Each main was about $14.  Next time, I would probably order 3 mains to split among 2 people, or do the appetizers with mains.

The space is kind of warehouse slash chic; concrete and wood floors, hanging lights, long bars.  One major risk is that drinks can be knocked off the bar on to the table below in the front half of the restaurant; this happened twice while we were there.

I ordered 3 soft tacos that came with a snack size nacho ($6.29).  I chose carnita, chicken mole and fish tacos.  I was allowed to choose any topping except guacamole costed extra.  

The soft tortilla shell totally ruined the taco: it was a flour tortilla not a corn tortilla.  It was thick, tasteless, not soft enough.

The fish taco was the worst:  the fish was completely dry, the outer layer breading too thick and fried to too hard.  It was not enjoyable. 

The chicken mole taco was better.  The chicken was tender and marinated, but I could not taste any mole.  Expect a chicken taco not a chicken ""mole"" taco if you order this.

The carnita taco was the best of the three.  It was juicy and tasted okay.  I wished the flavour was more intense, but as I said, this was acceptable. 

In conclusion, stay away from the fish taco and burrito.  Carnita and chicken are okay.  I didn't try the other types of meat nor any burrito, so I can't comment on them.",2014-10-06 03:58:04

Along in that growth was the opening of this location on Eglinton Ave in part of the Erin Mills Town Centre complex.  We tried numerous times to go and never were able to due to the lines.   Also add to the fact that the Tim Hortons location next door can make it a major PITA to get in and out of this location.

Paramount offers middle-eastern food, featuring exotic foods who's recipies have been passed down for generations.  The decor is ok, typical middle class family restaurant.  There is also a climbing area a little smaller than the climbing station in select McDonalds.  My daughter got into an altercation with one of the other kids in the play area.

My wife would not agree to a family platter with me so we both ordered individual entrees.  I had the mixed grill plate.  I figured that since it was my first time there, I'd sample a few different flavours.  So my plate came with beef, swish tawouk, and kafta.  With some veggies and bread on the side.  For me, the swish tawouk really stole the show - the texture, flavouring were great.  

My wife had a tabouleh salad with chicken schwarma meat added to it.  She seemed to like it, as she paid the bill for this meal.

Also I'll agree with other reviewers on the part about ordering at the counter and paying upfront.  Its a little odd.  You get more table service than you would at Panera, but the business model ensures no dine-and-dash customers, but I can't see it being great for generating tips, as there's no incentive for great service.

It's decorated beautifully, the interior architecture is really nice, pretty exposed stone walls and nice dim lighting, and everyone who works here is sooo nice. Also (and I'm sure people will hate me for saying this but...) the place feels like you're in Toronto.

For starters, the pesto oil that they bring out with the bread before you order food, is very tasty and fresh. We ordered the paesana pizza and the duck confit risotto, and the tiramisu. The pizza was really good, and for a bigger contemporary style restaurant like this, it's still impressively authentic (thin crust Napoli style stone oven pizza)... The duck confit risotto was incredible. There were big chunks of duck confit in it and it wasn't fatty at all but perfectly rich and delicious and the duck confit flavour was really infused into the perfectly cooked risotto - the best risotto I've had in this city yet. I will definitely be looking forward to the next visit here to order it again - and for duck confit risotto it was very reasonably priced, I want to say cheap even, but let's just say, you can't go wrong if you order this dish.

The tiramisu was pretty good, but not authentic at all - but I'm very picky when it comes to tiramisu, and for me it was too thick/heavy.. It seems like the mascarpone cream was either mixed with a butter cream type of icing because it was very thick and very sweet but I still liked it - I wouldn't order it again though unless I was really craving it and didn't feel like making it myself. 

We will definitely return for the pizza and I can't wait to go back for the risotto. I highly recommend this place for date night or a huge birthday party. Just go!",2015-04-26 01:33:28

The entrees are family style so we shared all the dishes. We ordered chicken bai cha (fried rice), grilled pork, and lok lak beef. The bai chia was good and they served plenty to share. The lok lak beef was too bland. The meat didn't really have much flavor and the veggies that accompanied it were just as bland. The best part of our meal was the grilled pork. This is the dish that they are known for, and recommend; and it didn't disappoint! The dish was just strips of pork but the flavor was amazing!  The sauce made it very flavorful and great!

The food was nothing to be excited about, not terrible, but given the price point and the emphasis on authenticity, I found it lacking.

The service staff seemed either pre-occupied or inexperienced. We had to ask for someone to come take our order after sitting patiently with our menus stacked on the table. Strike #1.

When our arancini arrived, the outside was very nicely done, crispy and a nice golden colour from the deep fryer. Unfortunately, the block of cheese on the inside was ice cold. Clearly from the freezer. Strike #2.

When my date flagged a waitress down to explain to her it was stone cold, there was no apology, nor offer to heat it up, nor gesture to take it off the bill. There was just a repeated explanation that the balls are made beforehand in a big batch and then stored so that's why it's cold in the centre. Strike #3.

I'm not sure what happened afterward but our waitress disappeared into the kitchen for a while and I actually had to get up and find someone working the entrance to help me get the bill.

Like I said, this was not within the last couple of weeks. Maybe they had a bad day, maybe they've corrected their kitchen and staffing issues, who knows. I hope so. I'm just sad to have to give such a promising establishment a less than stellar review.",2014-06-02 06:45:52

The crab rangoons were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were the perfect size and shape and the perfect amount of fried. The filling was more cream cheese than crab, which I actually prefer. Sweet & sour sauce included, too!

They offer a lunch special at the cant-be-beat price of $5.75 for your choice 12-14 entrees (all of which include the standard rice and refried beans) and a (soft) drink. I went for the Enchiladas Verdes with chicken. The food arrived so quickly that I was suspicious it would taste exactly like it came out of a can, but the chicken was well seasoned and the sauce had the tiniest bit of kick. The rice was about average, not crunchy but nothing special. The beans were slightly less reminicent of cat food than many places I've tried, and when mixed with some of the stray cheese crumbles they were downright tasty.

The server was cheerful and attentive, but that may have been because there were only about 4 tables occupied in the entire place. On my lunch hour I was able to comfortably run a 20 minute errand, eat at a comfortable pace and get back to work with 10 or 15 minutes to spare.

I ordered the pesto chicken capavatti, which as amazing. I also got a ceasar salad(1.75 upcharge for side) will skip that next time. It was just ok. The gf got the loaded baked potato soup and caprese salad. Also very good soup, again her salad just ok. I tried the soup..will get that next time. Price was avg. $25 for dinner for 2 w drinks.  Overall 4 stars for food

To top it off we were given each a free cookie. They were awesome. Will be back for these! 5 stars for the freebie.

See you next time. Keep up the good service",2016-02-29 05:23:36

Drinks are always reasonable and we've always had incredibly friendly service, but it always comes down to the food here.

Quite frankly, I haven't had something off of their menu that I didn't like. Of course the fried chicken night is amazing - not the best I've ever had but certainly the best in the Burgh. Specifically love when they have coconut rice as a side. The pita with hot sauce is fantastic as well.

I regularly order the Jamaican jerk wings with the cilantro sour cream, the kaya burger, the skirt steak, lobster tacos, or the black bean dip - not all at once obviously.

I've only made it to dessert once or twice, wasn't big on their ice cream as it was more ice than cream.

Let me just start by saying that Raven was always a great dog. She is a 9 month old husky/shepherd mix and I started her off at 2 months old with clicker training and used treats after she completed a command. She was near perfect for commands in the house (sit, down, puppy pushup, place, paw), but I had issues in high distraction areas. She would get super excited and would try to run up to new dogs and people. In addition, she never seemed to want her treats once she stepped foot outside. 

This is where off leash training came into play. After Raven came back from training, I was was surprised at how calm she was. I had put her in heel and walked through one of the busiest areas of the park and she did not try to run off to say hello to the children. She would always look to me for commands and she was quick to obey. She even learned ""place"" on different objects, ""touch"", and door manners which is great. This is definitely an ongoing process so it is up to me to reinforce everything that she has just learned. 

I am very happy with Daniel Clark's work with Raven! I am now confident taking Raven to busy areas without worrying that she will run into the street or jump up to kiss children. I would highly recommend off leash k9 training to anyone that is considering it. I am linking below a clip of Raven in extended heel.

Anyhow, it's kind of nice having this one on one service. I've been waiting for this place to open as it's gone through some transition recently. Now that it finally has, it's nice to see that they have some good Grand Opening specials to take advantage of while they're available.. primarily the FREE MANICURE with purchase of a pedicure. I indulged myself a little with their Deluxe Pedicure for $30 which included some scrubs and a hot towel. My bill, after gel removal on my hands, was $35. Not bad, not bad. 

I've was able to chat a bit with the ladies here and everyone is so nice. My manicurist is Kim and she was very personable and friendly! They have water, sparkling water, and wine/champagne to quench you. The pedicure spa chairs are brand new-- massage is great and there are two cup holders for your phone/beverage. There are two TVs you can watch while you're getting serviced. I also like that nail salons have transitioned to the ""nail bar"" style which makes for more room and comfort. They also have purse hooks built into the bar which is a must have detail. Lastly, they also do waxing if you need that done too.

Side note- they're still waiting for their drying fans to be delivered. I waited about 15 minutes for my nails to dry (gosh Gel spoils you) and I still managed to screw it up.

They do some nail art here and if you have something in mind they can likely imitate it. Unfortunately I'm a bit of a nail art snob when I do gel manicures and like to get Japanese style art which they don't quite available have yet. But they seem to be able to do painted on designs and stamping which is cool.

Gluttony is my favourite of the seven deadly sins. And it's probably yours too. That's why you're going to stuff your face with lamb at a restaurant plastered in cute little white sheep. You may want to pre-watch an episode of ""lamb chop's play along"" if you are feeling extra hungry and evil. My personal choice was Silence of the Lambs.

Be forewarned, the sweet smell of hotpot as you enter the restaurant is the same smell you will be leaving with... on your clothing. You may think that you can dodge the smelly steam vapours that emanate from the pot, but it's better to give up NOW and prepare ahead. You will be engulfed in soup clouds, so dress the part. Possibly appropriate attire: basketball jersey, snuggie, hair net, board shorts, adult diaper (for the hardcore overeaters), hazmat suit.

As a general strategy, I recommend that you load up on lamb slices and beef slices. They only take about 30 seconds to cook. Then intermittently try the other options (see above).

You may want to order the ""wheat gluten"" just for the sake of novelty. It arrives as 3 tennis balls. You throw them into the pot and they sit there for hours. You can bounce them up and down in the pot at first and they just float there. Then they gradually soak up grease until they wrinkle up like the fingertips of an old granny emerging from the sauna. At some point they are finished cooking. I'm not sure when. Then bite into it, and rip some off with your teeth. Chew whatever you can. They taste like the fingertips of an old granny emerging from the sauna. Or something like that. I have no idea what this is supposed to be.

Service is surprisingly strong, especially for china town.

Overall, this is a good hot pot considering the competition in the downtown core. In particular, if you like Lamb, this is a joint to check out.


INTRODUCTION FOR NOOBS (see Menu picture if you would like to follow along):

You probably want the ""Yin Yang"" broth. Each side has a different soup base. One is spicy, the other is herbal.

It's All You Can Eat. There is a dinner section of the menu, which you can only order from if you are paying the dinner price.

Lamb and Beef slices are not marked on the order form, you just ask for more from the wait staff. For everything else, use the the order form. 

You get 3 rounds to order, plus dessert.

Water / soy milk / plum juice are all free. I prefer soy milk.

Sauce. You get a small bowl to make your own sauce at the sauce station. You probably want to start with sesame paste or sesame oil. Experiment with the chive paste and fermented tofu. But there is plenty more... cilantro, green onion, vinegar, chili oil, chili sauce, etc. Don't forget to grab a raw quail egg and break it into your sauce bowl (if that sounds appealing).

BONUS TIP: I recommend fasting to some degree before or after hot pot. You will inevitably overeat. Do not schedule any sort of physical or mental activity or drive heavy machinery after hot pot.",2016-09-15 18:49:21

I've been here about 7 times now and have tried everything from the make your own salad to the sandwiches.

Salads:
I have a kind of love/hate relationships with these salads. I love that you can choose from an array of toppings (from veggies, nuts, eggs, and bacon) and that everything always looks fresh. It allows you to mix things up from day to day as opposed to the habit of 'Santa Fe Tuesdays' and 'Caesar Sundays'. Variety is indeed a spice that can be served up at Crisp. Plus yes, these salads are ginormous. 

Ok, on to the kinda hate side. The protein is very often (but not always) over-grilled. Meaning burnt. There, I said it. I am all about adding some intriguing texture to tofu or having some black grill lines on my chicken. However, I noticed that no matter what protein I get, be it tofu or chicken, it often tastes the same--burnt. Possible carcinogens aside, burnt is a flavor that tends to dominate the palette. My solution is becoming to just avoid getting protein all together.

Sandwiches:
Ok, sandwich. I've only had the Monterrey twice now. It is pretty much cheese, chicken bacon, lettuce, and some sauce. It is actually pretty darn good AND comes with a side (soup, salad, or some other thing). This makes for a pretty complete and filling meal. And when they say bacon, they don't mean no two strips of bacon. No, they are talking every square inch and bread and chicken is covered with crumbled bacon. Like equal parts chicken with equal parts bacon. Bacon bacon bacon. This is of course the less healthy way to eat at crisp, but hey it comes with a salad so you can feel that you've done some good.

My grip about the sandwich is two-fold. First, it can suffer from the same aforementioned burnt issue (however, this is somewhat mitigated through the prolific use of bacon. Seriously, next time I get a sunburn I am gonna rub bacon all over my skin).  

Second, inconsistency. The first time I had the sandwich, it literally blew my mind. It was freakin HUGE. Equal parts bacon, chicken, and lettuce. The chicken was sliced somewhat thinly and easy to eat. Likewise, the lettuce was thick and crispy, succeeding well as a placebo to counteract the bacon-induced guilt.

However, the second time, I literally had an uncut chicken breast on my bread, still generously covered with bacon, but with only one leaf of lettuce that I only discovered by poking around in my sandwich. Without this placebo lettuce, I was left feeling more guilty than I knew I could. A little lackluster.

Oh well. Until next time Crisp!",2012-02-20 18:30:04

After a quick review of the menu, I was very impressed with the selection of lunch combos! You can pretty much mix and match whatever you want. Tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas and more...and it's all for a very reasonable prices. 

I went with Amy C's suggestion and got the chimichangas. One beef and one chicken, the combo comes with rice and beans. 

My food arrived quickly. The chimichangas are pretty small but I did love how they were coated in the cheese sauce. First thing I notice is that they didn't skimp on the filling, both of my chimichangas were packed with well flavored meat. Overall, it was very tasty. The rice and beans (covered in cheese) were just a little blah, but overall it still makes for a good meal.

The service was prompt and pleasant and the orders came out quickly. We ordered 2 wines from the Happy Hour menu. The only disappointment  is that Reisling is only available on the regular drink menu . Consequently Reisling was double the price of the other white wines on the Happy Hour drink menu.

If you are artist, well, selections *can* be limited depending on the medium and quality you use as the store tries to follow the 'everything to everyone but it not amazing at anything in particular approach.' 

Keep in mind there are less expensive places for some items, however Curry's has the option of being very, very accessible, by just being a minute away from College subway station and they are part of my hood. As there are some good stores here are there but are not as accessible. 

They do cover the basics, and they do have specials from time to time so do check their site before you go. For example, right now they have a special on canvases which I will go take advantage off... uh... right now! 

Aside painting, I do write and they almost always seem to have specials on hard cover black sketch (ahem, writing) books which I can go through like Oprah on a Chocolate suffle. Okay perhaps not as fast, more like Oprah on cabbage soup fast. 

If you are buying a gift for a friend, then you are most likely covered and you will find this a great store. Same if you are starting out and buying something for yourself since they will have the basics to get you started. 

Either way the staff all seem to be OCAD art students, or something akin to it, so they are likely more then able to help you out. 

Also, if you have a student card, or if you are like me and are a member of the AGO then you get a 10% discount on all purchases which is always welcome.

The Medium Rare steak was served sliced off the bone, yet it had obviously been allowed to rest before slicing. It was so juicy! The Mac and Cheese was actually a homemade Shells and Cheese with a crunchy topping that will blow your mind. SO GOOD!

My brows were neatly cleaned up - she used mainly tweezing and a little bit of waxing on the bottom of my brow to clean up the excess baby hair. What shocked me the most in the end is that my eyebrows were not bright red after the wax, which usually happens. She keeps her wax at a certain temperature that will not be too hot to burn her customers!

The tempura batter was about 5x the size of the shrimp. As my friend said... 'I've never seen tempura with so much batter that the shrimp doesn't bend anymore'.

A few very bad dishes stood out to me.

1. Red snapper sushi. My friends and I both though the fish has gone bad... It was so sour and disgusting.

2. Spicy white tuna sushi.  I think I saw one little piece of fish wrapped in it. The rest was a huge block of rice covered in the disgusting amount of mayo.

Anyways, sushi was horrible. Tempura was terrible. No comment on the grilled dishes
Nothing special.

Ice cream tasted old... Like it had been frozen for too long.

As mentioned and where my rating lost several stars, the meat were thinly sliced, losing most of it's moisture and flavour after cooking.

My friend and I went on a Thursday evening, cloudy weather and it was basically empty, inside and at the back patio. We decided to dine at the back patio and it looked very unique and cool in its on way. It was filled with neat high tables and high chairs with a bar at the back. You'll kinda wish your backyard looked the same way. Even though we didn't stay inside, it looked very cozy and cool with their neat booths and blackboard wall menu. 

We were greeted and served by a very sweet and cool lady who was very helpful throughout our dining experience. She asked us if it was our first time at Hogtown Smoke and then she told us about their menu, especially their ""Create Your Own Platter"", which I got. Throughout our dining experience, we were checked up upon a couple other employees, not only her, I gratefully appreciated that. All of them were very cool, joyful, and nice and they definitely made me feel welcomed.

On our table were many condiments and other things such as ketchup, mustard, vinegar, moist toilettes, and three of their signature sauces: Black + Blue (Nice and sweet), Hogfather (best of 3), and Mango Habanero (very strong). Throughout my dining experience at Hogtown Smoke, I mostly used Hogfather and then Black + Blue, they both complimented my dishes significantly. 

I ordered a Platter of Burnt Ends, Back Ribs, and Brisket with a side of Sweet Potato Fries. The Sweet Potato Fries came with Chipotle Mayo and it tasted great. The three meats were both beyond succulent, very tender and juicy.  By far the best quality BBQ I have tasted. I loved how the three meats tasted with the Hogfather sauce. Also, these three meats were recommended by our server and she was definitely right.

In the end, we were very full and I ended up taking my leftovers out. A platter is definitely good enough for 2 people.

This morning I had to run to the grocery store to pick a few things and decided to get some major points with the BF by bringing home a breakfast burrito!  I got there around 8:20 and saw on the door that Los Taquitos doesn't open until 9 on Sunday.  No biggie, I thought.  It should be around 9 by the time I'm done at the store.

So I take my time browsing the grocery aisles to ensure a 9 am departure.  Walk in the door of Los Taquitos at 9:00 exactly and am successful in getting order #1 for the day!

Chorizo and potato for him, tacos for me.  As much as I love the breakfast burritos, I find them a little too heavy for me first thing in the morning.  So I started getting two tacos instead.  Usually, I get one carne asada and one chicken, on corn tortillas, of course!  The meat is delicious, the taco is tasty, and it's a perfect way to indulge in the goodness of Los Taquitos without feeling like I need a nap right after breakfast.

The service is quick and friendly, the place is clean, and the salsa is good (I prefer the green over the red, or both)!  As Guy says ""winner, winner, chicken dinner!""  Well, I know he isn't the only one that says that . . . but he does work it in quite often!  Ok, and this isn't exactly a chicken dinner . . . but, you get the point, right?

Stayed here last Friday and Saturday night. We had a huge party of people and someone had reserved a whole floor for everyone to reserve their rooms and we would all be by each other, so we would be able to all meet and party from room to room. We all had our reservations in from about a month ago. 

When we went to check in the hotel, the party was all split up all over the north and south towers, all on different floors. I know of one reservation that was canceled all together from the hotel, and they had a hard time getting a room. Also my husband and I reserved a room with a King size bed, and we ended up with a room with two double beds in it, oh well. 

This hotel is very old, and very cheap to stay at. My room was very run down, the bedding was from the 80's, and the airconditoner sounded as if it were a loud generator. I was happy it worked, because one of my friends said she stayed in the same hotel a couple of weeks prior and she had got a room where it didn't work at all. So my husband and I were not going to complain. 

The floors were a different matter all together. Our carpet was full of stains and super gross to look at, we didn't even dare taking our shoes off walking around in there. The hotel elevators were a fear factor challenge. A couple of times we felt the cables slipping and the elevators to the parking garage smelt like vomit. All and all be prepared this is no 5 star hotel. I will not be staying in this hotel again... I gave this hotel two stars, just because I didn't see any bugs, or murders. Motel 6 is a one star I'd rate against this hotel. A nice thing about the hotel is the location. It's right at the end of Fremont street walking distance from everything downtown.--- that was cool, we didn't have to drive anywhere.. oh and the hotel management didn't say anything to our party about being two loud..which was cool.... and it was loud!",2009-08-31 16:36:46

I will start by saying that you need to carefully choose when you'll be visiting based on what type of experience you wish to have. If, for example, you want to catch up with a friend or family from out of town then a weeknight or weekend afternoon is great. If, as is usually my reason to visit, you are looking for ""something different"" to do with your usual group of friends then Friday or Saturday night in the beer hall is your jam (get there earlier than you'd normally go out to avoid lines). By ""something different"" I of course mean: you still want to get too drunk with your besties but are reaching that stage in your 20s where you wonder should I have stopped enjoying drinking beer at the local watering hole by now? The answer is no and the hofbrauhaus will help you feel better about this. People of all ages, including 70 year olds in matching tshirts, will be drinking liters of beer, dancing with dames half their age, and singing along to drinking songs  while standing on their table benches. Friday and Saturday nights are for this type of activity, not for a quiet meal.

I probably visited a dozen times before ever trying their food. Their beer is good and brewed on site - lager, light lager, hefe Weizen (my favorite, a wheat beer) and dunkel (dark but very drinkable). Be aware the liter is equivalent to three beers! 

When I finally did try the food, I started with the soft pretzel and beer cheese - DEFINITELY DIP IN THE BEER CHEESE. The fried pickles are also delicious. The schnitzel makes for a nice, hearty lunch. The German sausage platters are tasty and enough to share between two people. Recently went for a yelp event and they served the meat and cheese board - had no idea what meats I was eating but they sure were good. This is something id have never ordered on my own, but definitely will order in the future as it is great for sharing over a few beers.

The service at the Cleveland location is still a little slow but friendly. Definitely improving each time I go. The Pittsburgh location, which has been open for years, runs like a well oiled machine so I think the Cleveland location will get their eventually. The outdoor beer garden is set to open soon and I'm super excited - Cleveland is on for a treat!",2015-03-15 19:37:41

They gave us a really big serving of salt and pepper pork chop, which also tasted good. Shrimp mayo had a bit of a mushy texture (maybe because we didn't eat it fast enough).

The two women volunteers who came out had been doing this for over 6 years, are also avid birders  themselves.  My little cutie pie and I are humbly less than amateurs.  

We had the little kiddos sit around to meet the very first bird they brought out, which was a Schreech Owl.  He was missing an eye due to a birth defect.  He was so cute!  The next one they brought out was a Great Horned Owl.  There was oooh's and aaaah's at the site of the huge Bubo.  

Then a huge raptor, a Red Tailed Hawk, came out of the biggest cage. What a sight!  I wonder if hand feeding these kinds of birds are what makes them so tame.  

 ""What are Turkey Vultures good for?""  One of the ladies asked as the red headed scavenger sat there looking at the kiddos.  He was obviously already fed, thank goodness.  ""Thanksgiving"".  I answered.  By the darting look I got, it wasn't the right answer.

Normally when they don't, they have an alternative for you, but this place just didn't have any.  There were other customers waiting saying the same thing.

Wasted about 20 mins waiting for a car to arrive.

Kimberly tried to sell me a protection plan by saying ""would you like full protection or basic protection.""  Normally a car rental place just asks if you want one or not.  So be careful.  She also offered the gas fill up service which is actually a great convenience, but she told me that the average fuel cost is $3.50/gal and they can do it for $3.19/gal.  Well I drove out and what do I see... $3.19/gal at gasoline stations everywhere.

IMPORTANT - Instead of walking with you around the car, they just hand you a piece of paper and tell you to go mark any scratch or bump you see on the car.  Please do this carefully because during the return process, they bugged me about small scratches on the car (which I marked on the paper thankfully).

The return process with Rosemarie was extremely smooth and FAST!  Did everything on an iPad and was off to the shuttle while the other car rentals had a line :)",2013-11-11 07:03:05

The place just recently opened in the Westin Convention Center replacing the Original Fish Market, which closed last November.
 
First off, the place is huge!  I made the mistake of thinking that I could enter it from the outside. I ended up walking the length of the Westin entering the hotel on the east side only to have to walk the entire length of the hotel again to find the entrance. Do yourself a favor if you come here and simply enter the hotel off of the main entrance on Tenth Street. The entrance to the restaurant is right there on your right. Inside you get the feeling of spaciousness. I was left to wonder if they will ever fill all of these seats.  In addition to traditional seated dining, there is a full bar with an impressive beer list and, I suppose as a reminiscence to its predecessor, an eight seat sushi bar.
 
I passed on the sushi in favor of its namesake; a burger and took a seat at the bar. The bartender, Becky, pleasantly greeted me, offered me a menu and gave me a moment to look it over. Wanting to try something unique I went with the Fat Cat Burger and included fries and an ice tea with it. It took only 10 minutes for my burger to arrive. It was two greasy patties with melted American cheese topped with a mound of caramelized onions and butter served on a toasted English muffin. The fries came in a wire basket. Wake up arteries!!! 

No doubt the burger was yummy. Greasy as all getup but what would you expect? The fries were average at best with most of them being ""fry fragments"" (if you know what I mean), hardly worth $4.00. The entire bill for a burger, fries and ice tea before tip came to $18.14. 

The service was exceptional, the atmosphere was pleasant and clean but in agreement with Maurice W. and Dave M. who provided previous reviews here, $18.00 for a greasy burger, fries and a drink is way overpriced for the Pittsburgh market. Especially when you consider all of the options in the Cultural District which offer quality meals for less. I say, bring back the Original Fish Market.",2015-04-27 17:04:17

So after introducing a few coworkers to a Chinese restaurant I frequent regularly today for lunch, I navigated to this Starbucks location on the way home.  Normally I like to place my order via the app, but I kept getting system error messages, so I parked and expecting to brave the line inside. But something was off about this location today. There are actually open parking spots and no mob of taxi drivers outside!!!  I better make a note of the day and time for planning potential future visits.

Anyway, there was no line to place the order inside, the drive thru only has maybe 3 cars, so an unusually slow day at this Starbucks.

My order was just a venti dark roast hot coffee paid via the app, so that made the entire process just that much more expedient.  Adding the packets of sugar in the raw to my coffee actually took longer. Lol.

It's not another typical Asian grocery and take forever to find a parking spot.  Soon as you enter from Yonge St. there are parking attendants getting cars to move along and show you where there are free spots... And Yes! There's lots of free parking spots!

The interior is packed and aisles are small, but you can comfortably walk around with a full size cart.  Galleria is pretty small compared to other Asian groceries. It's spit into 2 sections between the fresh produce (fruits & veggies) and meats/packaged items (chips, frozen food, premade food). I pretty much bypass everything and go straight to the premade food where you have a choice of Korean side dishes, soups/stews, rice dishes and sushi.  I go for a container of side dishes (anchovies, peanuts with anchovies and seaweed salad), chicken katsu, jap chae and decent sushi.... So much to choose from!  Paying is a breeze as they  have lots of cashiers open.

Surprisingly, even with a large number of cars in the lot, there aren't as many people in the grocery itself.  Most people are at the cafeteria area where you can order food from 3-5 stalls... and they all smell soo damn good! Alas, I have yet to try it. 

And when you think you've had enough of the awesome sights and smell of food, there's a bakery stall right before the exit and you won't be able to hold yourself from buying more food.  The round doughnut pastry stuffed with red bean paste is Excellent!

So -- I really liked this place and went again last night.
Not sure if I will go back though.

They took my fav pulled pork toutiere off the menu!  Really????!!! Why??  This was an awesome dish, and this was a real miss for me.
So instead I thought I would try the Chicken Pot Pie that was legacy from the Arcadian Court.  Funny -- wasn't like I remembered and way, way too much tarragon folks.  Totally overpowered the dish - it was the only flavor that came through.

My hubby had the steak and the chocolate ice to finish -- he said his was fab.
I finished with the Passionfruit sorbet which was so tart, it gave me unbelievable heartburn for the rest of the night.

Anyway folks -- if I can't eat a meal and enjoy it and not suffer for it all night -- well -- BIG MISS!

I will say that the bread basket continues to hit the mark and the black bean hummous was great.

Perfect location right off State Street. Best atmosphere. Peanuts shells all over with tons of writing on the wall.Spacious with huge booths. Even I (in my twenty) would fell comfortable coming here by myself getting a burger and Bloody Mary (anytime of day).
 
The bloody was even better then the one I had in Milwaukee. The amazing staff were a hoot trying to bomb our table but kept on missing. The cheese curds are extreme yumminess. Flavorful and perfectly salty. Nice and chewy with a light batter to let the curds from Ellsworth shine. The fries were crispy on the outside but soft inside and seasoned perfectly. No need to ketchup. The Mad Sconnie Burger ""uninspiring"" I think not. Tell me where you can get a burger with Stella's Bakery spicy cheese bread (look at the bottom of you burger when you order there's crispy cheese there) that adds a little heat, then add Frickles yes Frickles that helps to balance it out. Then lettuce, tomato and bomber sauce. The patty is a blend of grass fed beef blended with Berkshire Bacon. Being that there is bacon in it causes it to look pink. So don't think it raw when they serve it to you. The owner Joe Sorge was even there that night. He greeted us at the door and made us feel very welcomed. Talking to us though out the meal. He told us about the pink patty which I would have returned to the kitchen otherwise. Which shows you that he truly cares about this restaurant in Madison to drive all the way from Milwaukee to see the customers and staff. He really is listening to his customers and fixing any issues. Which makes me want  to get a job working for him.

Another time a friend brought oysters from Diana's and it was $100 for 150 Oysters. Pretty much a steal of a deal if you ask me. They were just as fresh just because they were unshucked. Not a big issue for us because we had at least 3 of us including myself that knew of to shuck the oysters. It was just the labour that had to be put in that was time consuming.

Why the extra $1? The movie was only available in one of their recently updated theaters and let me tell you, it was the best $6.25 I ever spent. I had the pleasure of watching the film from an oversized, extra squishy, lay down chair (which reclines at the touch of a button).

You also are able to use their facilities - the pool, work out room, or just lounge in the waiting area. I came a bit early and laid out by the pool. Make sure to get a key from the front desk prior to heading out. They have a lot of good food options at the cafe you can order from as well.

The waiting room isn't lavish like other spas in the area - it's got lockers, showers, and a couch and two recliners to relax in. 

I started with my 60 minute massage with Karen. She is hands down the best massage therapist I've seen in Phoenix since moving here. I'll definitely go back to see her. I picked a mini facial for my 30 minute treatment which was great & felt much longer than 30 minutes. 

Once you're done, the front desk brings you a glass of champagne / wine so you have some time to relax after your treatments. 

I ended up buying the neck/head stabilizer Karen used on me during my massage from the gift shop. Be sure to check in on Yelp - I got a free travel kit with my purchase.

But before Chef Bobby Wilkinson launched me and my unsuspecting palate into a dreamy, hour-long gastronomic orbit above the Old South there was the hello.
Your first impression of this place is the warmly smiling, quick and efficient wait staff that greets you at Bobby Q. 
Bobby is from the South, and it shows in both the people he hires to take care of guests and in a menu that bubbles right out of his native Gulf Coast.
At Bobby Q's, the choices are modest, but good god this man is a chef without barbecue equal anywhere. His meat dishes are so good you don't need the finger-licking-good sauce they give you with each plate (the mark of a barbecue master). In our handful of times here, my girlfriend and I have had both the beef and the pork. Both are excellent.
We also regularly start with the shrimp-and-grits appetizer. 
Everything here is so delicious, so cooked with an obvious love and respect for Gulf Coast-style barbecue (smoked for hours, using the finest meats and spices, with sauce on the side if you want it) you'll want to curl up in the booth and go to sleep before you ever reach the desert course.
Do not miss this place. You'll probably talk to Bobby at some point, as he makes a habit of working the dining room, often sitting down over some iced tea to talk and laugh with guests.
One caveat, however: Don't go on a First Friday. Bobby has a food truck that works that event, and he's usually out of one or two menu items on those days, usually the brisket.",2012-10-21 21:50:17

After trying both, I was more excited about the egg rolls than I was about our pho. The broth is oily and thin, not collageny, the noodles were soft, not chewy, and the round steak, perhaps not sliced thin enough, was a little tough.

The French press coffees, both iced and hot, with condensed milk were the best versions of Vietnamese coffee I've had in Madison, and I've ordered this everywhere. At a hefty price of $3.50 a mug though, I might be better off making this myself at home.

I think my favorite thing about Take 5 is the classic movies they show on the big screen in the bar. The Goonies, Christmas Vacation, Back to the Future, etc. Such a fun backdrop for a movie theater bar. My only criticism is that service can be a little slow, which isn't ideal if you are waiting for a movie to start. That being said, the bartenders are very friendly and good at their jobs.

Am glad we only spent one night here because the Hilton Grand Vacation Flamingo wasn't available on the Friday evening.  I booked Flamingo using AirMiles and this may have influenced the room we got.  When I booked, I requested an early check in and a non smoking room.

The night before we checked in, I went to ask about the early check in.  I was told that early check in would result in a charge of $20-30 (I can't recall the exact amounts) depending if we wanted to check in before or after 12PM.  It wasn't worth paying extra so we went to check in at 4:30PM after their 4PM time.  Be prepared to line up.  The estimated time was about half an hour but at least they offered small bottled water.

We checked in and waited by the elevators.  The elevators are sloooooow and not just during check in (Waited at least 5 minutes at 10PM and 9AM).  There are 2 sets of elevators, with the one set saying it will go down only (there are 4 elevators and they are used by staff but they are faster than the other ones so I recommend going down from your room using these ones).  Some of the elevators like to rock and roll but don't worry, this seems to be normal.

Our room, 10062, was the first one at the end of the hallway.  I wasn't sure how noisy it would be but luckily it wasn't too bad.  Being spoiled by HGV stay, we didn't appreciate there was no mini fridge, no free wifi anywhere in the hotel/casino, and an old room.  The bathoom vanity has paint peeling off, dresser and desk had knicks, and grout in bathtub.  I wasn't sure if we paid the resort fee as we did have to pay fee and taxes booking using AirMiles so I called to ask but we didn't.  I think the fee is only for wifi for one device/room which doesn't make sense.  

The worst issue was the loud hum when it was time to sleep.  It sounded like an engine and luckily I was able to fall asleep with this noise.  When I woke up, there was no hum.  We didn't want to bother lining up again to check out so we did so via the TV system for self check out.

Yes, the hotel room is only to sleep in but when I'm on vacation, I want to be comfortable and well rested.  Makes it difficult to do that when they don't offer the amenities to enjoy the stay.  I noticed the receipt of people in front of us at the bag drop off and couldn't believe they paid more than $170 Canadian to stay in this hotel.  With so many other hotels nearby, I would never stay here again.",2014-11-27 01:18:24

The second visit was with my husband and my father on a Wednesday at 6:30pm. Again, the place was pretty dead but they actually had a few other customers. (Definitely not packed!)

If you haven't been, the concept is you walk up, tell them if you want a salad or a pizza and then they make it right in front of you. For pizza, they ask what kind of sauce (marinara, pesto, alfredo, garlic/oil), what kind of cheese (mozzarella, feta, blue cheese), and then pick your toppings. They have several different types of meat and vegetables to choose from. My perfect pizza has artichokes, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, Kalamata olives, and garlic. We've tried their sausage and chicken - both are good. I prefer the pesto, but I'd like to try to alfredo sauce. Additionally, we've tried the pizza cookie - which is tiny but delicious. Definitely learned our lesson and will order separate desserts next time. ;)

I was pleased to know they were able to accommodate my Almond milk request Therefore I ordered a large cappuccino cute clear coffee cup. Of course I'm about that sip coffee in style life? #Extra The Capp was decent; worthy of ordering again. $4.50

I ordered a slice of Tiramisu to got and smashed most of it in the parking lot. Not a huge fan of the extremely moist bottom (but hey this may be how it's prepared in Paris so who am I to judge). $4

Overall the vibe was cozy and the owner was extremely pleasant and informative about ingredients and his culinary training in Paris.

We all loved it and the waiters were accommodating when we wanted the lamb chops & pineapples which just didn't seem to come our way after over an hour. 
Corn bread (a hit with everyone), cheese bread (meh - more like super dense cheese dough) and fried bananas (deep fried in a cinnamon & nutmeg coating was FANTASTIC) have to be ordered specifically for the table though it is included in the price.

En effet le concept de ce Bar c'est de servir les cocktails dans des bocaux et pour les gourmand il y a des bocaux de grand taille et je pense que l'on n'est pas loin des 75cl !!! Vu que les cocktails sont pas mal chargés et sucré ca monte vite.

Pour ce qui est du bar c'est sur que c'est pris d'assaut et que les places sont chère ! Bon avec de la chance une table se libéré à notre arrivé donc on a sauté dessus. Malgré le fait d'avoir une place vu la population a l'intérieur on est souvent bousculé. Cette population n'aide pas à avoir un service rapide mais lorsque le serveur s'occupe de vous il passe le temps pour vous expliquer les différents cocktails et vous conseiller en fonction de vos gouts. 

D'ailleurs à l'entrée vous avez tous les mois le magazine de la distillerie avec des informations sur l'alcool et la liste des cocktails et même si les doses ne sont pas écrites je pense que je vais en tester à la maison. 

Pour moi c'est un bon lieu pour passer une bonne soirée avec des potes et de l'alcool (mais pas pour discuter car la musique et forte et si comme nous la table de fille a coté hurle vous n'entendrez rien d'autre).",2013-02-14 20:59:34

I took the family to dinner a couple nights ago and used their new Mobil app to order.  The claim to fame for the app is to ""pass the line"".  

So I get there and walk to the pick up area. I then stand there waiting while the cashiers take the orders of the people who are in line and tell me they will be with me momentarily.  So I wait. One they clear out the line of the customers who were in line, they greet me. I tell them I'm there to pick up. 

I wait...and I wait. 

As I stand there waiting I am watching food go out the side door to the customers who had walked in at the same time and after me. 

Once those customers begin eating. Shortly after another mobile app customer comes in and gets her order quickly. She leave the restaurant and come right back in minutes later explaining her order was wrong. The employee collects the food they had given her and says, ""oh it this customers food"".  She then takes the kids meals from the lady and hands them to me. I tell the employee I don't want that food as it had left the restaurant and then came back. She rolled her eyes and scratched her two toned skunk hair. After trying to reason with her that I didn't want to give the food to my kids, she throws the bags in the trash and gets another employee working on the order, while she begins messing around on Facebook swiping through photos and showing anther employee at that manager station. 

I finally get my order after 35 minutes of waiting and the customers who had came in behind me are walking out with full stomachs. 

Won't use the app again and it frustrates me the lack of service here because that's what chick fila is all about. It's too bad because I love those brand and their food. Sad. 

Update:

I took the wife to breakfast and out bagel sandwich was burnt.  Reached out to them on Yelp by messaging the business. But they never responded. I called, left my name.  No call back. So now I'll share with you the horrible sandwiches we had.  This is the message I left:

We have never tried your breakfast. So with your message addressing our previously experience, we thought we would give you guys another chance. I took my wife out for breakfast this morning and one of the items we ordered was the bagel sandwich. To our displeasure, the bagel was burnt. Couldn't enjoy it. I have never tried this sandwich. So if this is how it's supposed to be, I apologize and disregard my complaint. 

I love your restaurant and appreciate everything you guys do for the community.

Let's start with the Fried Oreos....they are A-W-E-S-O-M-E....!!!  The Oreos are surrounded by a fluffy, Doughnut shell and come with a Creamy Dipping Sauce....when you mix the two together and bite into it, you feel a slight crunch from the Cookie of the Oreo....then all of the flavors combine in your mouth to take you to nirvana....yes, it's that good!  Trust me.

The Chocolate Cake is pretty amazing too.  However, I've had great Chocolate Cakes before.  What sets this place apart is the Fried Oreos.  It's so addicting that we stopped here every night of our stay to have them.  It's a must try if you're in the area.

We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and everything was so delicious! The fried eggplant and chorizo ball was super crunchy and flavourful. The foie gras burger just melted in our mouth and the Brussels sprouts was definitely worth fighting for.  For dessert, we ordered the churros, coffee ice cream with wafer and the chocolate pudding.

Everyone is very friendly and very attentive. Secondly, the prices are right! It's nice to see a diner with great food and reasonable prices.
The food: I ordered a breakfast combination of two eggs, bacon, grits, toast, and a short stack of pancakes. I asked for the eggs to be over medium and they were perfect. They asked if I wanted cheese grits instead of regular grits and I said yes: they were amazing! Just as good as New Orleans! They also asked if I wanted to have any fruit added to my pancakes so we added blueberries...These additions were at no additional charge. The toast is made with very good bread, whole-wheat, and fresh. The bacon was absolutely delicious. Please know that my friend got the sausage patties instead of the bacon and she thought it was just OK so I would go with bacon if you have a choice. The pancakes were good... I cannot say they were outstanding as I have had way better pancakes at other places, but they were good. In the near future, I would not order the pancakes with the rest of the meal.
Coffee, hazelnut coffee, is awesome. This place rocks! We are so going back for breakfast repeatedly and I would recommend it to anyone. I have heard that the chicken and waffles are amazing and I have also heard that they have an amazing Charleston shrimp and grits dish.
Highly recommended and this place is going to be huge... There is no doubt in my mind that it will quickly get to the point where you will have to lineup to get a table because it is that good. Highly recommended.

Day 2: breakfast was so good on Saturday that we decided to also come on Sunday. This time, I ordered the Greek omelette which came with three beautifully cooked eggs with fresh feta cheese as well as tomatoes and spinach, with whole wheat toast and cheesy grits. Outstanding! Once again, the hazelnut coffee was a major winner. My friend ordered the western omelette and it was also fantastic. Her son ordered the pigs in a blanket which is pancakes rolled around sausage and he said it was phenomenal, along with hashbrowns. Her daughter ordered the 'Yo Challah', apparently featured on triple D's. It is challah bread with sweet cream cheese and blueberry compote and other ingredients... very sweet and we were not impressed but still a phenomenal restaurant.

The steaks were just alright, I don't care for the fact that they burn the steaks at 1700 degree leaving the crust blackened and very bitter.. the sides were all very greasy.. the celery root gratin was swimming in oil.. the onion rings were so greasy they glistened in the well appointed lighting.. Gnocchi was stuck to the cast iron pan and literally fell apart when you trying pulling some out.. hen of the woods was unseasoned and very dry.

Desserts were dismal.. ordered Pumpkin Pie, Caramelized Cheesecake and Chocolate Torte.. the pumpkin pie could have been from anywhere, though Marie Calendar's makes a better pie. Caramelized cheesecake had crispy caramel on top that was so badly torched it was disgustingly bitter. Chocolate torte gave the cheesecake a run for its money, was covered in the most bitter chocolate powder ever, though after scraping it off it was just alright.

Highlights.. Tuna tartar was amazingly delicious.. Scallop was off the chart delicious.. chicken liver pate was great, some of the best Ive ever had! Popovers.. oh my gawd! The popovers were so good I could have stripped naked and made passionate love to it right there.. hmm, me having popover sex in public, well, maybe not! 

Anyway, if you dont want to spend big bucks on dinner stick with the seafood apps, share a steak and ask them not to burn it, skip the desserts and go to Ice Tango its only a few miles away. How's that for recession dining?",2008-10-26 17:44:20

It's a tiny little shop but full of cuteness and deliciousness. They're primarily known as an ice cream shop but they also have a lovely little espresso drink selection, which I took advantage of the first time I went in. It was a cold day so I wasn't in the mood for ice cream, but a hot latte sounded divine. The coffee was tasty and the perfect pick-me-up as I wandered around the neighborhood.

The next day I was in the area and couldn't get those beautiful dipped soft serve cones out of my head so, since it was a bit warmer, I knew I had to get one. I treated myself to a swirled vanilla/salted caramel cone dipped in dark chocolate. OH YESSSS. The bittersweet chocolate was a nice contrast against the rich vanilla ice cream and the caramel swirl added a nice saltiness that helped ground the whole cone. So simple but so good. There's a DQ across the square but skip it. This is the only dipped cone you need! 

Attn: vegans and the lactose intolerant, you can enjoy this too as they do have a few dairy free sorbet flavors to choose from.

Food:
There are some food items that were prepared well and many that were not. In general, I get the feeling that many foods were rushed and shortcuts were taken in to speed up preparation. The selection at lunch is quite poor compared to other places with limited availability of decent sushi rolls. The green salad was disappointing using thousand island dressing from a bottle. The sushi rose was hard and not fresh, though the presentation of the rose is nice. I wonder if they're made in advance? The spicy salmon sushi was good.

The chef's recommendation rolls were average at best. The rainbow roll was small and lacking in fish. The mango roll had a thick mango sauce on top as substitute for real mangoes. The volcano and sunshine roll had deep fried fish. There was absolutely nothing special about the special sauce in the volcano roll (I believe it's just eel sauce...).

The soba set is different - comes in a tray the same way you'd get it in Japan and comes with a raw quail egg for you to put in the soba sauce (Tip: Egg in sauce, dip soba noodles in sauce and eat). Grilled beef skewer, Matsuda Golden Shrimp and sirloin steak were good. Somehow, the sirloin roll wasn't good (!) and the Takoyaki (""Grilled Cuttlefish Balls"") were dome-shaped - someone forgot to flip them! The korokke (""Japanese Hashbrown"") was too thin and didn't have enough creamy potato filling.

There were many dessert options but they were all typical of AYCE sushi places and couldn't repair the bad impression. Mango yoghurt and mango puddings in small cups, buffet-quality mousses, and ice cream. Deep-fried banana was good and recently deep-fried.

Service:
Service is non-existent. The servers don't seem like they're empowered to respond to your requests (""I ordered 12, not 4"" ""Ummmm..."" *walks away*) and don't tell you what the food is before dumping it on the table. Another server cleaning up dishes knocked over the drink menu into our spicy salmon sushi and didn't notice/left the menu in the sushi. Worst of all, a service charge is already included in the receipt (though at least they had the courtesy to tell you so).

tl;dr Can't find any reason to come back again for lunch. It's also not cheap ($15.99 weekday lunch, $16.99 weekend lunch + mandatory service charge).",2015-11-15 15:39:11
PEzn0B3BHVqu48Lombhn1A,MLf4JUa1uzQkDLrBJ5yJHA,Ul6JwluSTm12PVDIqnNaTg,4,0,0,0,"Came here for dinner as I've had this place on my to-go places for a while, but never really got a chance to follow up with it until recently and sat down at a bar seat to see what to get. The menu is pretty decently sized and judging from the crowds and the buzz when I walked in, I'd say this is probably one of the more popular restaurants in the Strip District as it's also on the cheaper side as well for decently sized portions. Anyways, ended up ordering the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl and the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables entree. As for the poke bowl, it was decent tasting. Ingredients were fresh and tasty, although probably not really worth the $14 I paid as I've had better poke bowls elsewhere for less (and also made-to-order aka I could customize it however I liked). Now as for the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetable ... mmm did this entree really blow my mouth out of the park. Now I will say it's not as spicy as Indian or Asian style curries, but I will say that the spices (mid-spicy), the pineapple (sweet), along with the carbs in the dish (potatoes, saffron rice) and the veggies (peas, greens, mushroom, squash) made for a delightful medley of different flavors in my mouth ... made it so happy haha. I would say the curry itself is actually pretty darn good and was reasonably price as the portion size was rather large for what I paid (my appetite has really declined in comparison to previous years ... prob a good thing). In general? Great place to come and get some great tasting grub. Bar here is also pretty lively and there are many drinks that you can order. I would not recommend coming here if you're planning a date or more intimate gathering though ... place is rather loud with the crowds and all, but for good reason!

The food is generally OK. I'm very impressed w the beef tendons which are really nicely braised and has a jelly-ish texture. The potsticks are good too especially w the ginger vinegar. But the soup dumplings are a little disappointing. I have anticipating having their dumplings due to what ppl say on Yelp. But they are no better than just mediocre Chinese soup dumplings. Despite juicy and flavorful, the soup inside is  too salty and greasy to be appropriate. And that's the reason why they don't taste good when they are cold. The wonton noodle soup is a mixture of PERFECT noodles, mediocre wontons and salty soup that tastes terribly like chicken powder. The shredded pork over rice is OK but also very salty.

Thought the place was cute.
By the time I got the pizza four minutes home it was cold which I thought was odd.

I mean none.
It was like thin crust pizza well done with a THIN barely there later of cheese.
So much so that some bites didn't have cheese on them at all.
The rare bites that did have some ricotta on them were good but again, that's a stretch since it just wasn't enough.
The pizza was quite dry.
However, it was flavorful.
So I'm not sure if I should try them again and just ask for EXTRA cheese. Or maybe just tell them to actually put cheese on it.

While it's certainly not terrible, you can definitely find better.  The quality of the pizza tends to be somewhat inconsistent  and at times can be quite good while at other times we've received a soggy crust with toppings that look like the kitchen staff must have had a contest to see who could stand on the other side of the kitchen and toss the most ingredients onto the crust (sadly, most of them missed).

The veggie salad was good and had interesting ingredients like avocado, green beans, white beans, and jicama that added enough zing to make the salad less than boring.  The caesar salad, however, was another story.  We were about halfway through eating it when we finally pinpointed the source of the strange taste and texture that is unfamiliar to a typical caesar.  About 1/3 of what is normally romaine lettuce actually consisted of chopped celery, which in my opinion, has no place in a caesar salad.  I'm not sure if this was just an attempt at cutting costs by adding a cheap filler ingredient, but the result was anything but delicious.

My boyfriend and I dined here with his company recently. We sampled the bruschettas, which are featured on a chalkboard, and the rice balls, which we shared because they are rich and ample. I had half of one and it was enough. 
For dinner, I ordered the Pasta al Limoncello, made with house made linguine noodles, prosciutto and a creamy sauce popped with a burst of Limoncello. I've just traveled to Italy and fell in love with the taste of Limoncello .. So I was interested to taste how this came together. Rich and amazing! I took half of my entree home. The Squid Ink Pasta with clams was ordered at our table, as well. Perfecto! So different! 

To me the portions were just enough for dinner and a little to take home. The bruschettas were ample servings as are the salads, which two could easily share. 

The Key Lime Pie is delicate and housemade, as well. I highly recommend! It's not a tart, tart taste like some key lime pies, it's just enough.

SHe has only been open about two weeks or so and I have already eaten here twice and I don't even live in Vegas, that should tell you something about this place. My first vist was less than one week from their opening date. I have been around the block a time or two and I know to usually expect a place this new to have the usuall teething pains that most new places experience but I was pleasantly suprised that there was no issues, not even small ones. The place operated like it had been there for years. Our table was ready within a couple minutes of us checking in with the hostess. There were four people in my party, three of whom ordered steaks/filet and the fourth ordered the Sea Bass. All three of us that ordered steak ordered different cuts and requested three different temps of cooking (rare, medium rare and medium well), they nailed all three, everyones steaks were cooked perfectly to their liking. We ordered several sides for the table, side portions were large and good for sharing, my personal favorite was the creamed spinach. Appetizers were great, we ordered a few plates of the baked oysters and everyone loved them. For desert we went with the tirimisu cups, a tray filled with a bunch of little portions of tirimisu served in cute little liqueur shot glasses. They also have some great desert drinks, the best one was the cupcake martini which tasted like a cupcake and had a glass rimmed with frosting and sprinkles. 

Now for the good stuff, and the part that sets this place apart from the rest. As I said the food is amazing but the atmosphere and entertainment takes things to another level. Lots of pretty people, a beautiful(woman) DJ spinning GREAT music in the center of the dining room and a handful of beautiful entertainers up on a stage/catwalk that meanders through the entire dining room. A contortionist and belly dancer were just a couple of the acts performing. Sort of a freak show, but in a good way, something you have to experience, very sexy yet tasteful with just a tad bit of tabu, perfect for Las Vegas in my opinion.

Food was good compared to others and they were running out so quickly that they kept refilling the trays with fresh and hot food. Waitresses at our section were quick to refill our drinks and were accommodating to the crazy kids running around. 

Place was pretty full, but food spread was far enough apart from one another that it was hard to bump into people. Good use of space.

I wouldn't mind coming back and trying some other dishes. The kids flocked to the frozen yogurt section and filled their cones up as high as they would go.

This is a pretty nice place if you want to have a relaxed off strip lunch/dinner and enjoy a view of a man made lake. I'm sure the optimal time to be here for dinner would be right before sunset. Would be a great place to bring friends or family that are aspiring sommelier or ""cork dorks"" as they sell tons of different wine in their lobby. 

First and foremost the food was excellent and a positive experience. Started off with the charcuterie which included a table favorite of pork pate, cured meats, little pickles, olives, and dijon mustard. Entrees included were the crispy maple leaf duck breast, steak frites, and a Thursday special of a 14 oz Kansas Strip steak. Everything was presented beautifully and cooked well except towards the middle the Kansas strip was a bit tough to chew. Bordelaise sauce was delicious, duck was cooked medium-rare with enough rendering on the fat to make it easy to chew. 

Why the 3 stars then?

Well... earlier I mentioned something was to be desired... and the service is just that. The service today was just painfully slow. My server exhibited professionalism, but jeez he was hardly attending our table. He definitely seemed more interested in taking care of the table in front of us with all females.. these are times I wish I had breast :(. Our charcuterie came out maybe 10 minutes after ordering, but I notice the table across from us received their fromage order within less than 5 minutes of ordering with two baskets of bread.  Never really came to our table to see if everything was okay. Made eye contact a few times, but he just passed by. Later on when it came time to pay the server was no where to be seen, so I went inside to pay at the register and even his co workers weren't sure where he was. Perhaps he just had a bad day, but bummer I had to get him on his bad day. Dinner for 3 came out to be $126 after tax, but I felt a bit bummed out tipping more than 15% for service that could have been better fulfilled at an Applebee's... sorry.

We arrived a bit early to take advantage of their Happy Hour and the bartender made the most delicious pear martini's. The bar & lounge area quickly filled up and within a short time it was standing room only. So, if you're looking to enjoy Happy Hour be sure to get there early! 

Once we were seated our server introduced himself and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu items and explaining what items were not available because of quality issues. They also finally introduced a non-seafood appetizer which delighted my husband who doesn't like seafood. I opted for the crab cakes which, although good, it took me a bit to warm up to as they were not traditional crab cakes but more like soft lumps of crab molded into a round cake form but not baked or pan seared like I would have expected (or maybe they were just not cooked long enough). For my entree I ordered the Seafood Jackpot which I always order and thoroughly enjoy. This time, though, I was disappointed: the oysters were super small, my crab claws were still somewhat frozen and the shrimp and lobster tail tasted like they had been sitting on ice too long. The lump crab was very good but certainly didn't make up for the price paid for the entree. For my husband who likes steak but prefers it well done, he listened to the servers suggestion and got a bone-in steak instead of the filet he would have normally ordered and requested to have it butterflied to ensure it was cooked through. He was also disappointed and didn't finish his steak.  He mentioned it didn't have much flavor and was a lot more red than he would normally preferred. He said the best part of his dinner was his baked potato. 

Although we've enjoyed Hanks in the past we're not really certain that we'll be going back for dinner since it's supposed to be a high end restaurant and this time, other than the pear martini,  it was beyond disappointing especially for the price.",2014-01-13 21:28:13

Don't get me wrong, I have seen some amazing shows here (Elvis Costello, Depeche Mode, Oasis, first Edgefest, NIN, etc) but I do not find this is the best place to see a show in Toronto.  

The Forum that was on this spot years ago was much more intimate, excellent seats (the stage revolved - you saw everything!) and great sound.  At the Forum (sniff for memories!) I saw The Hip, Crash Vegas and Alex Lifeson up close and personal while I was in high school.  I also met the lead singer from Blue Rodeo back in the day when he was coming out on stage.

Back to the Molson Ampitheatre....to me it seems like it was created last minute and as a after thought.  The bathrooms are always disgusting and look like they never quite finished construction.  The large sinks I will say do remind me a bit of the old Maple Leaf Gardens.

Even their box seats seem like an after thought.  They are just smack dab in the middle of everything, just like regular seats except they have a little barrier around them.  I have seen a concert from the box before...meh...would rather be down closer to the stage.

It also kinda concerns me a bit that there are only a couple ways out of the place.  I guess my safety self wonders if there was a fire or something....people would just trample each other trying to get off the little island.  Dunno...just seems like it was half planned in my opinion.

We ordered a shaved ice with red bean (pat bing su) which is a trendy cafe desert in Korea. This is the Korean style one which is slightly different from the Taiwanese one. This was godawful. The red bean's flavor was not really there. They added canned fruits to it. It has to be the worst $9 I spent on food this entire year if I measure it from a food quality perspective. It's edible but a far cry from the ""bing su"" I had in Korea. Still...the whole point of this desert is to get a large to share it with your partner which we did. We both think it sucked but at least we can laugh about it so in that sense, it's worth it.

They have board games but they look really beat up. We stuck with chatting over a drink. 

If you're coming here, it's for the atmosphere. This is a nice cafe to chill with a girl. Or a good place for a bunch of girls to hang out. It's not a nice place to chill with guys as that get a bit awkward fast. I'd come again if the chance arises.",2013-09-25 17:41:38

On a whim we decided to check out the Palms. We did some research and consulted Yelp and decided that Palms Place would be even better. Our main requirement of the room is that it had a jacuzzi tub. 

We wanted to stay on Sunday and Monday night and wow did we get a great deal $77 a night including tax. The room that we picked, the studio suite, was just a basic room, but it had a mini kitchen, two flat screen TVs, a couch that pulled out into a queen size bed and best of all a rain shower with jacuzzi tub. I was so excited!

We arrived a little after check in which was at 3pm. The front desk person was very helpful. I was so surprised when he offered us a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite! He said it wasn't ready yet and if we didn't mind waiting it would be ready no later then 5pm. We checked our bags and explored Palms Place and the Palms itself. They have a sky tube on the second floor that you can take over to the Palms. Super convenient.

 
Right around 4:30 they called to tell us that the room was ready. Back to the front desk we went. We were informed there would be a locals deposit of $250 on our card. Which would be refunded after we checked out. They gave us our room keys and we were shocked to be on the 36th floor in room 36302. Talk about a room! It was an apartment! The view was amazing! We faced the strip. The balcony went all the way around, but it was locked due to ""safety reasons"" so that part was a shame. The suite had a full kitchen, full size fridge that makes ice, mini bar, pots, pans, plates, cups and silverware available upon request, a blender, toaster, stacked washer and dryer, a fireplace, pull out queen sofa, huge jacuzzi tub in the middle of the bedroom facing out the window, one full bathroom with a rain shower, a half bath for guests, three flat screen TVs, and a safe. 

The bed was soft, but actually pretty comfy. They also give you tons of pillows. As far as the toilets are concerned they are bad! They don't flush right at all. I was so jazzed to take a bath in the fancy tub, but was very sad when I couldn't get the tub to plug up it just kept draining the water. Even Joel couldn't figure it out. So we ended up calling maintenance the next morning. He actually came in about 20 minutes. He quickly fixed the tub and was on his way. Loooooove that tub! It was awesome! 

The room was great. It was very quiet. We even took advantage of their pool while we were there. When we checked out Tuesday morning they refunded our $250, but then Wednesday morning Joel checked our account and they had taken the $250 out again! So he called to see what the problem was. They said it would be refunded in a couple days. Which it was that Friday. I just find it really odd they refunded it only to take it out again. 

Palms Place had some great aspects and some crappy ones. The toilets need a serious upgrade. Oh and they lied about the resort fee originally it was $25, but later it was $29. The $250 deposit sucks. But the room and being upgraded was amazing! So overall I was happy with my stay.",2015-04-11 01:18:37

They don't have their own parking spots so you may have to drive around to find one. He ordered his usual favourite which is Taro bubble tea with waffles. For myself I ordered red velvet cake and matcha slush bubble tea. 

I'm not a big fan of waffles so I didn't try my boyfriend's dessert. However, the bubble teas aren't very tasty, a bit plain because they put a little too much ice. I couldn't taste the matcha at all in my drink. The tapioca is hard as car tiress!!!! The cake wasn't moist enough and it was extremely sweet that I could hardly finish it. They have limited choices and the price isn't reasonable. 

But the decor is cute and cozy. It's a perfect hideaway for you and your special someone. The sofa/ couch is amazingly comfortable to the point I almost feel asleep. A nice, romantic place full with waffle-ish aroma. If you're there not during their 'traffic hour', you can get some work done or study there. The place is super comfortable! Plus, the washroom is clean!

Soups are always delicious - Carrot ginger is a favourite, and they always come with a piece of bread for dipping.
Cobb salad is excellent, they are pre prepared but come with a creamy and tangy blue cheese dressing on the side.
Quiche with greens - my favourite lunch which I get fairly often from Le Gourmand. They always have 2 or 3 types (ham and cheddar, goat cheese and roasted veg, smoked salmon and dill are all common options). With greens it comes to 6.99 which is well worth it, the pastry is flaky and buttery and the portion size is very fair.

They also always have hot lunch specials (lasagna, curries, meatloaf etc.) and a range of sandwiches that can be put in a panini press.

Finally you can't go without grabbing a cookie, particularly the chocolate chip w/walnut are the best cookies in the city without a doubt. I think they're around $2ea but I would pay 3 no problem. They are crispy outside and gooey inside just like you would attempt to make at home but fail!

Tomo is interesting. There's hookah, hibachi/sushi, multiple floors, a sports bar-ish area, and a creepy basement bathroom.

We could also smell cigarette smoke from the outside patio. I would never expect this from a supposedly high-end restaurant. Which, based off prices, I figured Tomo was. Here's the real kicker. Tomo technically did nothing wrong, but they also didn't do anything right. I made a list on my phone just so I wouldn't forget all these strange things I encountered...

1. The Age Tofu appetizer was fried in tempura batter, as opposed to cornstarch.
2. The sushi size was measly.
3. Avocado used in said sushi was under ripe, making it chunky instead of smooth.
4. The Yellowtail Jalapeno appetizer had fishy flavored yellowtail used.  
5. The salad dressing was basically water.
6. We ordered our steak for the hibachi medium rare, and it came medium well. 
7. Hibachi also came with scallops. There were ""four"" pieces, but in actuality it was two scallops because they sliced them in half. 
8. The hibachi sauce (what I call Yum-Yum sauce) was very ketchup-y.
9. There was no traditional tsuyu sauce for the Tempura Entree we ordered.

Since my original review, I've been going on a regular basis, pretty much weekly, and ordering the ""Bear's Choice"" with biscuits & gravy and the sausage links. It's become my staple, and up until tonight, I'd been pretty satisfied with it, and with this restaurant. 

What happened? Well, for starters, there are three components to the plate -eggs, biscuits & gravy and sausage. I got biscuits that were either stale or overcooked, so that the outside was hard as a rock, with only some usable inside. Biscuits and gravy should not require a knife to be eaten, and certainly not need to be sawed apart! Secondly, and more importantly, the sausage links appeared unevenly cooked/heated, and upon touching them (and even tasting a bite) I confirmed they were in fact cold inside. Not big deal, right? Send it back right?

So I tell our server, Shelby, that hard biscuits and cold sausage is 2 out of 3 and that's no good. She apologizes and takes it back, and so begins our inordinate wait for the remade food. Eventually, after what seemed like way too long (as in at least 10 minutes), it finally comes back out. Shelby brings it, no sign of a manager this whole time, which I was put off by, and I take a look at the new plate. The biscuits are fine, but the sausage links are clearly burned to a crisp. I mean charred black, flaking off burned casing into a pile of ash on the plate. It actually stinks like burned food, especially once I use a fork to probe it and even more of it flakes off and disintegrates. Disgusting, absolutely disgusting. What's worse, I have the sneaking suspicion that it was deliberate, because someone in the kitchen got butt-hurt that I sent food back and said it was cold. 

I flag the server down and show her. She apologizes profusely on taking a serious look at the sausage and realizing how horrifically it is burned. I'm sure she can smell it at this point too. When I tell her I suspect it was deliberate, and out of spite for sending it back as cold, she doesn't even disagree with me at all. She takes it back and says she'll remove it from the bill and notify a manager. The same manager we've seen neither hair nor hide of the entire time.

A short while later, she brings the bill. Says the manager is on the way. Waited a couple minutes, but figured ""heck with it"" and went up front to pay and leave. No manager up there either (surprise!) so we paid and were on our way. 

I called to talk with the manager as soon as I got home. She informs me that the server, Shelby, must be a liar, because the manager was not notified either time our food went back and she was never coming to our table (good thing I didn't wait!). Furthermore, when I press for the name of the person that spitefully and deliberately ruined my food, she confers with her kitchen staff and then returns to tell me, ""Nobody fessed up to it, but Joe is in charge back there,"" and furthermore, states that according to him it was cooked that way because I sent it back as cold. Yes, you read that right, she all but confirms my hypothesis that it was some deliberate, spiteful act by the kitchen staff. Unreal. 

So there you have it. A manager out of touch with what is happening in the restaurant, a server (Shelby) that lies to customers and hides issues from her manager, and a kitchen staff run by someone (Joe) that thinks it's perfectly okay to spitefully burn someone's food when they have the apparent gall to send it back for being cold to the touch. 

I'm planning to reach out to the head office first thing tomorrow morning to pass along my feedback, since I doubt very much that management at this restaurant is going to do anything about it. I'm also going to get in touch with the franchise owner for this location and speak to him personally regarding our experience. I have no tolerance for people that deliberately ruin my meal to teach me a lesson about sending their food back.

In a nutshell, stay away from this place or at the very least, make sure you never send anything back because the head chef (Joe) can't handle criticism without lashing out and burning your food deliberately, all while hiding in the kitchen. Shameful.",2016-02-19 02:57:01

Pro-tip: seating at the bar is first-come first-serve, so if there's a wait, stalk the bar. Works for me and my boo all the time. 

We tried the Grouper Ceviche first which was great quality fish and a good sized portion, but the dish was a little plain for me as far as the flavor. Next, we had the Charred Shishito Peppers, which was really flavorful and yummy! Plenty to split between two people. My favorite was the Potato Croquettes which were fried, cheesy, and had an awesome tomato based sauce. All of this shared between two people plus a beer was actually enough to fill me up! If you are super hungry though, you might need a bit more.

I kept seeing this place pop up on yelp so decided to give it a try. Turns out, pho so 1's owner's son runs this place! My family and I have been going to pho so 1 for years so when I found out, I was super excited. My mom got to the restaurant first and she was waiting outside.  As soon as Khai saw her, he ran out and told her he'd get a table started while she waited for the rest of us to arrive. What awesome service. We felt like VIPs :P

Not your typical vietnamese pho place. They have the common pho combos and also offer a variety of other fresh seafood items. I got the oxtail pho. It was ~$12, on the pricey side for pho... but totally worth it. My bowl came out with 3 huge pieces of oxtail! It also comes with a side of dipping sauce for the meat. Mix them up and squeeze a little bit of lemon and its delicious!

My sister got Mi Sate. It came out and looked delicious but it definitely was not. It tasted like someone took half a jar of peanut butter and mixed it in with her soup. Way too peanut-y and sweet. Not a fan.

One other minor complaint I have about this place is that my very Vietnamese mother had a difficult time ordering the specific pho combo she wanted. Their menu had the basics. She typically gets pho chin tai nam... not on the menu. Totally not a problem but when she tried to order, both my mother and the waitresses were confused. Neither of them spoke Vietnamese. I don't mind this at all but I know my mom wasn't too happy. She'd be more comfortable with going to a solely Vietnamese speaking establishment so I probably wont be coming here with my family but I know for sure I will be back with some friends! I really wanna try the Lobster Pho!!!!!",2014-04-07 16:44:12

I have heard rave reviews of this place so I MIGHT consider trying it again.  With a party of 12 they force you to chose from a small, boring fixed price menu ($20).  There were 2 types of omelettes and a basic eggs benedict.  You can also choise beignets or a side salad.  

For $20 I would like more of a choice than a breakfast with 2 eggs and a small salad.
Second, I asked a server there about the menu and why it was that way.  She acted all douchy and said twice ""as your hostess about that.""  Well, who the hell is the hostess?  They sent about 8 people by and no one introduced themselves.  

Service was good except for that BUT they gave themselves 20%!!! What?  First of all, I hate automatic tip taking but second, 20% is what i pay when i have good service and that should be left up to me...especially when you're charging $5 for an egg. 

I would have contacted this place directly through email but their site does not have an easily accessible email address.

Our waitress has the weirdest attitude. She took forever to take our order. When she finally came she was already starting to walk away without asking us if we would like drinks. My bf quickly threw in an order for a beer after she  half heartedly described beer options while walking away. Like wth..Then we wait forever for food to come out and he never got his beer despite the restaurant not being busy. She never came back at all to ask if I want a drink. I finally stopped her and asked her for a pop and for my bfs Stella. Which she then brought right away.

Food came out which was good. I got jerk pasta which totally hit the spot. My bf got jerk chicken plate. He felt like it was okay. This is when the service got weirder..

I asked to pack the rest of my food. The waitress silently took my plate and walked off. Didn't ask how food was or offered dessert menu or more drinks.. she then brought back my food packed and then walked off again??? She legit never came back to ask if we wanna pay the bill literally just left us sitting there.

She goes out for a smoke and another lady comes and asks do we need anything and I said just the bill pls. She just looks at me weirdly and says okay.

They leave us there for another 10 min and start eating their dinner as now it's close to closing. Our original waitress nowhere to be seen. I really wanna leave but feel bad that I see the other lady eating her dinner. I wait a few more minutes and finally just ask if we can pay our bill pls. She gets up and says she thought we already paid. Like???? Why would we just be sitting there. With no food or drinks literally waiting??  She brings the bill and then my boyfriend says he has cash. She responds with a disdain ""oh. No one ever has cash anymore"" 

LIKE WTF. 

Just also want to point out another couple customers other than a big group behind us weremt treated great either. One guy actually got up and took his food to go. Another customer came in for a take out order that they messed up for him with no apologies and started having a back n forth with the guy in front of the whole restaurant.

As V. mentioned in her review, we decided to take a rather nice walk from Tommy V's after having happy hour there to have a cuppa here.  Last time I visited this spot, it was called Solo.  While the skeleton of the cafe hasn't changed, I do like Cartel's version a tad bit more than the previous one.  I think the half-off pastries during happy hour had something to do with this...  :)  

A shout-out to James and Ryan for being so nice and such sports for answering my questions.  Thanks for the awesome cup of cappuccino, no sugar, btw.  Loved the coffee art!  I'm definitely a fan.

I had such a nice first visit on the 7th that I returned here last night (Feb. 15th) to do a bit of work on my speech.  Two and a half hours flew by, and I most certainly would've hung out longer had I not received a call to pick someone up from work!  One thing I didn't enjoy so much, though, were the heavy, space-consuming metal ""nesting"" round tables I chose to set my laptop on.  I guess it wouldn't have been such a hindrance if I was doing anything else BUT typing away on my laptop, but I really didn't have a choice.  At least my tushy enjoyed the comfy cushions.  Guess everything balanced out. :)

Next time, I'll have to go for another cappuccino!

I don't think I will come back to this Red Lobster location after my latest experience here. We came in on a Wednesday night to take advanage of the endless shirmp deal which ended on November 8th. We had called in to be placed on the waitlist, a 20 minute wait, not bad. By the time we drove there, our 20 minutes but the hostess told us it would take another 10-15 minutes for a table to be ready...this is why we called in, I don't want to wait. 

We were finally seated 10 minutes after walking in. Unfortunately, this didn't matter as not one server acknowledged my presence for almost 20 minutes. I was pretty upset but I didn't want to get up and leave since we drove all the way from Uptown for this. Finally, our server arrived to take our drink order. I asked her if they still offered the endless shrimp deal which sent her off into this huge schpeel about how endless shrimp festival is the worst time of the year for the servers, how much they hate it, and how they're boss was throwing a party for them when its over. Everyone has their right to an opinion on any matter including this but I think it's common sense not to share these opinions with your customers. I felt extremely uncomfortable after this conversation and hesitated to say that my bf and I specifically came here for the endless shrimp deal. 

It took another 30 minutes for our orders to come out, in that time, she checked up with the table behind us about 4 times but did not come to our table once and my water was completely out. My boyfriend was furious as he felt we were unable to fully take advantage of the endless shrimp deal due to the degree of neglect from our server. I was very disappointed when the food actually came out. My garlic shirmp scampi was dry as a desert in hell and my pinapple coconut shrimp was clearly thrown together. As the restaurant got less crowded, the quality of the food improved. I was just over it at this point. 

Save your money, patience, and time, go to another Red Lobster location. The one in Pineville is much better and the High Point location is outstanding, go there for sure. Ask for Amy if you are dining in High Point, she's rad.",2015-11-13 14:27:38
tsxOYenQi6cjZ-kOqeZz-w,un2KUxPNvUOZDuUYoN-FQg,mK19GgwhVQ0YWlUy4ZYGDw,4,2,0,2,"My boyfriend surprised me with two night at TSR for our anniversary and part of the fun was a couples massage at the spa. After having looked at the pictures on their website, I was pretty excited and looking forward to the trip. I will say while the whole hotel experience was okay, the spa was my favorite part! 

My boyfriend booked a couples massage for us and we checked in at the requested 30 minutes early before our treatment. The front desk staff was friendly and we were given a tour of the facility independently since the men and women's area's are seperate. 

The whole area was nice with a changing area, 4 individual showers that looked out over the golf course, a steam sauna and a big hot tub. The overall feel of the spa was tranquil and very spa like. The amenities of shower gel, shampoo and hair products seemed plentiful and you could have easily gotten ready here had you brought your makeup if you had somewhere to go afterwards. You are given your own locker and a robe and slippers to change into. I would recommend bringing your bathing suit to use in the hot tub and steam room! I was able to meet up with my boyfriend in the couples lounge area in the back of the spa where they had nice loungers and magazines as we waited for our therapists. We only had to wait a few minutes before they arrived and they both were very friendly. My therapist was Dawn and she asked the usual questions about where I would like her to focus on and explained everything that would go on during my desert lavender massage. 

The treatment room was dimly lit and there was a big Jacuzzi tub in the corner and two massage tables set up next to each other. The music through out the massage was the typical spa stuff you hear at most places and thankfully the massage oil used wasn't overly lavender. I'm not a huge fan of the scent so it was nice to not be covered in it. Dawn's technique was great and actually having just had a great massage the week prior, I'd say this one was right up there at the top though it was a bit routine. She did seem to work on my neck and shoulders and later told me there were some knots in there (from the pillows at the resort!) and overall did a nice job. The hot towels wrapped around my hands and feet at the end was a favorite part. The pima cotton balls she used to lightly go over my body was a nice, a definite unique touch but I can't say did anything for my skin as their website promised. My boyfriend had the deep tissue massage and said it was incredible. He almost lost his balance a few times leaving the room post massage because he was so relaxed! LOL

We were able to enjoy the back patio of the spa all to ourselves which was really nice. It overlooked the golf course and driving range and behind the chairs were walls with cascading waterfalls.  It was super relaxing and great to sit out and enjoy the relaxation from the massage. It was slightly flawed by several very long, dark hairs that were on my boyfriends chair when we sat down. The loungers are covered by a terry cloth towel and  I'm not sure how often they change those but it should definitely be a little more often. We also had the Orange Sky patio on the 15th floor, one floor above us, and had some restaurant patrons out enjoying the patio as well so you could hear them. We ordered a cocktail and even though it took probably 15-20 minutes to arrive, it didn't matter because the view was so great and we were super relaxed.

Before leaving I did take a shower in one of the showers and used their really good smelling body wash. Overlooking the golf course with the nicely decorated facilites was also a highlight of the day. 

Overall, I would love to come back here and spend a few hours using the facilities and enjoy another massage.",2013-04-03 23:40:08

My parents and I went here with a college friend of mine and her parents looking for a nice meal and a more sophisticated atmosphere.  Some things were a hit and some things were a miss... 

First, for an Italian restaurant, wine list was very limited in my opinion, I found one I liked but wasn't blown away.  Second, my surroundings.  Now as I said this is on more of the upper scale of a restaurant and next to us sat a 25 person table celebrating what looked to be a 16 year old birthday of some sort with at least 15 people under the age of 21 who were extremely loud and then decided to scream happy birthday throughout the restaurant.  There is a party room downstairs at this location (WHICH IS SUPER NICE, FYI), why are you not there instead of annoying everyone else around you? *curious emoji* 

Third, now I'll get to the food.  Our appetizer was actually delicious, we ended up ordering a pizza to split amongst us since we were a bigger party and we got pork, tomatoes, egg, and truffle oil and it was really delicious, perfectly thin stone oven pizza and the combination of the topping was absolutely delicious!  The meal is where it kind of fell flat, I ordered to gnocchi (one of my favorite meals of all time) and I think I almost used the entire dish of salt they put on the table because there was absolutely zero flavor. I didn't know if they missed the mark when boiling them or in the sauce but either or, would not order again and ended up not even eating my leftovers.  My mom's dish also mentioned it lacked flavor as well and the portions are on the smaller side, but that is to be expected.  

Overall I just really wasn't blown away, I wasn't interested in any of the salad's they really had to offer nor the desserts and my food was under par to what I was expecting. Hate to say it, but too much better Italian elsewhere.",2017-01-27 18:32:42

I got the panang curry and a Thai iced tea. If you check in on yelp it's free! The panang was ~$12. It was well flavored and actually spicy!! It is rare for a lot of places around here for the food to come spicy without having to ask. The only thing is the quality of the chicken wasn't amazing and the fact that the dish was $12 made it less worth it, especially because they only give you a small bowl of rice and not that much curry. 

I'm definitely glad I got to try this place, but I wish they have more food since they're charging $12.",2017-10-22 17:54:57

I went to Yang's this past week on a Friday night and I can firmly say that I will not be returning again. The place has gone downhill both in terms of food and service.

The menu was not impressive. I thought it was too small and not enough choices compared to other AYCE places. The salmon sashimi wasn't sweet at all. The sweet shrimp was acceptable. The Grilled Black Cod was good and very sweet (may be too sweet for some). The Grilled Octopus was also good - great texture and not chewy/tough.

My favourite sushi was the grilled salmon sushi. We didn't get this order until we ordered it for the third time. We complained to the server about this, along with several orders that we didn't receive. She was quite rude and gave us attitude. She asked us to list everything we ordered and didn't get. When we couldn't list everything, she told us, ""then you should think about it first"" and walked away. 

The dessert was my favourite part. I love ginger milk and Creme brûlée. I probably had 5 ginger milks that night and one Creme brûlée. It sucks that the sweetness, the amount of ginger and the texture was inconsistent in every cup. The Creme brûlée was good.",2018-05-27 14:43:50

MikZOveQ3tE4wIjEEgz0Jg,dgVJzkjTHapHRloRKYv4bA,HexCnP_tQFgXH6QD9UlJWw,4,4,0,1,"There are several reasons why I am a fan of Winco Foods. Starting with the following:

1. Great prices on produce,
2. Great quality produce, 
3. Bulk item (I will explain why I like this area later), 
4. Good quality deli meats (sliced when ordered), 
5. Good pricing in general on products (not just produce), and 
6. 24 hours

Now, the explanation on bulk. Winco has a large section with bulk items such candy, nuts, cereal, and spices. In this section, containers are provided and customers can measure out how much of an item they need. I find this especially useful for spices and nuts because so many recipes call for items that are not ""staples"" or infrequently used and this keeps customer from having to buy more of an item than needed for the recipe. I love this because I bake and I'm always in need of random spices. 

Now for negatives... I can think of two off hand but neither one bothers me much. First they do not accept credit cards at Winco and second you have to bag your own groceries. Other than those two things I think this store is pretty great. I always get great prices from Winco and great quality produce even on items that are not in season. I would have to say they have the best produce I purchased in Las Vegas. 

I would recommend Winco to anyone who lives near a location and I will continue to shop here.",2013-12-20 04:31:29

We had a selection of meats, and we were a big fan of the sausage, brisket and ribs (the chicken was ok, but that's not their fault - it's rare that chicken is a revelation).  Great sides as well, with not-too-sweet beans, mayo-less coleslaw and a quinoa and broccoli salad for some roughage.  

My only complaint is about their approach to service.  Waiting in line to order food and finding your own seat is fine for McDonald's, but seems a bit inhospitable when you're spending that much money.  Waiting to be served at the bar, then waiting for your drinks to be made was even worse (it took, no joke, 15 minutes).  We had one round, and didn't bother to get back up again for a second because it was kind of a pain.  A staff member came by and started talking to us about dessert, and we had a healthy debate about which option we'd choose (banana pudding was the clear winner in my books).  We settled on what we wanted, but was then politely informed that we had to go up to the counter to order.  

Don't get me wrong, everyone was super nice and the food was really tasty.  My two cents is that our experience could have been greatly improved had they offered table service.  I would hesitate to go back for anything other than a super casual lunch as a result.",2016-12-15 00:34:07

* Vegetarian friendly
* Minimum 2 order for Congbul 

For those of you who love Korean table top cooking style, you will love this restaurant. Shabu & Congbul specialize in Korean table top cooking and Shabu Shabu. Honestly, I don't really care for Korean Hot Pot so there was no doubt I wanted to try CongBul. CongBul is a short term for Cong-Na-Mul (beansprout) & Bul-Go-Gi (Korean BBQ) and I ordered OhSamCongBul which comes with Squid, Pork and Bean Sprout

It is unfortunately minimum 2 order for this specific dish so make sure to go with a friend or be prepared to stuff your face. They have difference price for lunch and dinner so keep that in mind plus you can order regular or extra spicy.

I went with 2 friends and we order 3 servings of CongBul, regular spicy and it comes with the main dish, steamed egg soup, seaweed soup, 3 side dishes and rice. The main dish consists of squid, thinly sliced pork, rice cake, beansprout and other veggies.

My friends and I love meat so we decided to add on 2 sides of sliced pork and 1 side of rice cake on top of everything.

I personally don't really like seaweed soup to begin with but their seaweed soup tasted a little too instant for me but it was nice to have some mild soup since the main dish does get pretty spicy

Steamed egg soup is a nice palette cleanser in between to give your mouth some rest from spicy food

Everything comes in a flat square pan uncooked and the servers will help you- Pork is sliced very thin so it does cook pretty fast

Just like every Korean table top cooking, you can order rice at the end and they will make fried rice for you with the left over sauce.

The rice comes with seaweed, kimchi and sesame oil and they will cook it for you

Summary: Another Korean table top cooking restaurant for you to try if you like Joons. It is not a large restaurant and it does fill up during dinner time so make sure to get there early. The restaurant is hidden inside the plaza North of Steeles so watch out for it if you decide to drop by.",2013-06-11 01:46:42

Dim Sum Cafe popped up with only 14 reviews but 4 stars so I thought it's worth a try. Not to mention it's only 7 minutes away from our home. I ordered shrimp dumplings, shumai, shanghai soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup. You can definitely taste that the shrimp dumplings and shumai were fresh unlike some other dim sum places so those were pretty good. I had the shanghai soup dumplings for the first time ever and boy did I not like it. I don't blame it on them since maybe I just don't have the taste for that but what I really didn't like was the hot and sour soup. It tasted so bad that I couldn't take another sip. I definitely would not recommend ordering that dish!

Overall the experience was neutral, there were goods and bads. I personally wouldn't come back again not just because of the horrid hot and sour soup but because they simply have too small of a dim sum menu.

I really enjoyed their Cornish hen and dumplings. The cornish hen was deep fried but very tender and  you can't find  in other restaurants and  it was a decent portion. The dumplings were quite big and they tasted very similar to chinese soup dumplings except without the soup.

My husband had the Hachapuri Adjarsky (freshly made pizza with an egg in the middle) he enjoyed it as it was unique but it was too big unless you share.

We were skeptical at first, thinking that we would receive less-than-excellent customer service, as MINI is not the primary vehicle line at this dealership.

WE WERE WRONG!!

When we first inquired about the MINI, we received a very prompt reply from GAVIN HILL, Internet and Fleet Manager. From that initial inquiry, Gavin has been nothing but positive, helpful, and timely in his communication with us. He walked us through the entire process from the test drive to the initial servicing and detailing that he arranged.

Even though the MINI we purchased is a pre-owned vehicle and sold for five times less than the sticker price of some of the vehicles in the Mercedes showroom, Gavin made us feel comfortable, appreciated, and valued. He made our car buying experience FUN - something we have not encountered in a long time.

(a) You're starving: then get the Chicken & Cheese Enchilladas with the GREEN SAUCE! (this comes with rice & your choice of beans)
(b) You're hungry, but NOT starving: ask for (a) - a la carte, without the beans & rice!
(c) You're in the mood for fish: the battered fish tacos are scrumptious! Soft on the outside, crunchy on the inside!
(d) You just want apps: Batterred Rock Shrimp. Mmmm...

ALSO: If you're not a big fan of rice & beans (which I am not), you can always ask to order the entrees as a-la-carte items! This will knock a few bucks off your dish, for something that you wouldn't have eaten (and wasted) anyway!

Beware of the chips & salsa- they are tasty and plentiful, but save some room for your meal!

It's all dark (but not I-can't-read-the-menu-dark), modern, and love the woodsy-Canadiana theme going on with the signature glass and modern artwork. I loved the bar area, and thought to myself, if ever I was in the area and wanted to pop by for drinks, this would be it.

Unbeknownst to me, this used to be Colborne Lane. I never had the opp to try Chef Aprile's restaurant, but my fiancé (who I was with tonight) said it was an amazing experience. The space didn't really change, in fact, he thought I was bringing him back to the restaurant!

I was seated first towards the back of the restaurant - table by the wall. There are some nice corner tables for two for a truly romantic dinner. But, here at woods, the tables are spaced just right so you're not hearing your diners conversation.

Our server (didn't get his name) immediately came and asked if I wanted tap water (so no pressure to say no to bottled and feel cheapo - one star just for that!) He recommended a great Pinot Noir from Cali (La Crema) and the night started from there. I had the Foie gras (yum) and my SO had the Beet salad. For mains, he ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu (which is the restaurant's most popular dish) and I had the Cod. The chicken was really good and had the awesome crispy skin.

For desserts, we tried the Pavlova (my fave) and also had some type of chocolate cheesecake (a bit too rich for me, but I generally don't like cheesecake).

As the night progressed, all the tables were filled, so reservations recommended for a Sat. night. Again, this is a perfect date night place.

The place was bustling and packed on a Saturday evening at around 8:30pm - but we didn't have to wait, we were quickly seated at a booth when we walked in. The food kept being refreshed since there were a lot of diners- this is a great thing! 

They have a decent selection of Chinese goodies and other asian flavors. 

I ended up with a plate stacked with cream cheese wontons and gyoza...Somehow it seemed like the right thing to do. They were so crispy and gushing with cream cheese goodness. So bad yet sooo sooo good! They make them very good here. 

Plus their sweet and sour sauce and gyoza sauce sealed the deal! I'm a saucy girl, and I dunked my gyoza and wontons like there was no tomorrow. Super yummy! 

They had oysters on a half shell that were cleanly shucked, tasted sweet, and didn't get us sick after eating... That's a huge plus in the books! 

The crab legs and butter with lemon was a hit for me! (Only served at dinner)

They had really nice blue patterned wallpaper and I felt like I was catching a peek of someone's home country kitchen.

The chai latte was hand-spiced and jazzed up by the barista. It rivaled my only other positive chai latte experience, which I'm sad to say is courtesy of Starbucks. I'm glad I have another alternative now as it's way tastier and cheaper - a small is $2.50, medium $3 and large $3.50. 

I also couldn't resist a try of freshly baked date squares that was presented to me the moment I placed my chai order. I just had to have one.

Positives are the range fee is cheap at $10. You can bring your own ammo as long as it's jacketed. The range is clean and well ventilated. I like the programmable target holders.

The downside- #1 is the tourists. This range caters to the tourists with their full auto ""zombie"" packages like all the other ranges in town. I'll be in my lane peacefully shooting my pistols when waves of obnoxious tourist groups get ushered in and out shooting full auto AK's and AR's right next to you. These guns are VERY loud especially 2 feet away from you in an indoor range not to mention the groups of 5-6 loudmouth east coast whooping and hollering constantly. Argh!

The only other thing is the staff can be a bit indifferent, for lack of a better term. If you're a local just paying the $10 for a range lane, you'll wait until every tourist is well taken care of first.

Also, one time I was looking at some guns after my range visit and it seemed like I was really imposing on the guy behind the counter to show me a few. When I ended up buying one, he actually seemed pissed off that he'd have to do some work.",2012-02-16 01:17:19

Architecture and ambiance aside, the food is delicious. I'm still kind of a newbie to the Indian cuisine, so I can't remember any of the names of the entrees. The rice is good, the cheese/pea in a tomato type sauce was my favorite dish! We also ordered a coconut curry dish with vegetables...very coco-nutty.

The samosas were a tad crunchy, but had a nice spicy punch inside. For you beer drinkers, the beer selection seemed a bit limited: King Pin, Budweiser, Bud Light, & Heineken. 

The service was good and our server was helpful in suggesting flavorful dishes.

Although it lost its title this year (to Terra Rosa), this place remains the go-to Italian joint for many families -- not just here, but across the nation. And that's too bad. Not that the Olive Garden is a horrible restaurant; it just puts out pedestrian food that's a little more expensive than it needs to be.

Every Christmas, my family and I swap restaurant gift cards. And that's how I end up at the Olive Garden every year. While I usually go to lunch (yes, I do love their soup, salad, and breadsticks combo), this time we splurged on dinner because we had $75 to spend. 

We each had a glass of pretty good wine (Cavit pinot noir for my husband, Evolution white blend for me), although they were a little warm (a common problem at chain restaurants), and we had the aforementioned salad and breadsticks, which were tasty as ever. For our entrees, my husband had the Mediterranean trout, and I had the portobello ravioli. Although I liked my ravioli, there was barely enough sauce to cover the pasta. Why so skimpy? And although the trout was seasoned well (but predictably overcooked), it was served with a tomato and broccoli pappardelle that didn't match the rest of the dish. Not a big fan of fish and tomatoes to start with, but the addition of the broccoli was just weird.

Service was kind of slow, and the food was just so-so. But I finished my meal on a high note, with a tasty Italian margarita. (Love that side shot of amaretto!) And I know I'll be back next year, gift card in hand. Next time, I think I'll stick with lunch.",2014-07-11 17:27:17

The pork belly was good but a bit basic, it had Korean BBQ sauce on it and some avocado puree on the side, some napa, etc. kind of Asian-inspired. Good, but didn't really blow me away. That scallop though...

The rib was wonderfully soft and tender, and I remember thinking this one was better than the one I had tried at La Societe the previous evening - perhaps the ingredients were just more interesting and the plating was more attractive.

I tried the citrus pavlova for dessert, having never had pavlova before. When it came out I thought it looked really nice, but unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan in the end - something about the texture of the pavlova didn't work for me. It was like crunchy on the outside but had a slightly chewy texture on the inside, it was sweet but in kind of an artificial, almost marshmallow-y way... perhaps just not my kind of dessert. It came with passionfruit sorbet and berries, and I remember thinking the passionfruit sorbet just didn't mix well with the pavlova - it added this extra bit of tartness and slight bitterness almost that just didn't work. 

Everything was plated super nicely, with artistic little garnishes. I quite enjoyed my experience at this restaurant and might consider coming back if I happen to be in the area!",2015-03-15 05:26:31

After reading the review on it in the New Times, we decided to hit this place with some friends. It was the first time for all of us, and to be fair, we are not of the ""Scottsdale"" scene and that was definitely part of the problem.

I'll make this simple:
Issue #1: Made reservations for 8:30 and even though almost every table was open, we couldn't be seated for a good 15 minutes.
Issue #2: Um, is this place a restaurant or a dance club? A DJ fired up at 9p and it wasn't music you could ignore. It was like eating in ""Trainspotting"".
Issue #3: Gigantic, pointy rock in the middle of the ""dance floor""
Issue #4: $12 for four TINY SLIVERS of tuna that wouldn't make an anorexic full.
Issue #5: Over an hour to get our meals, which were served one at a time, apparently whenever they were ready.
Issue #6: Did I mention there was a DJ?
Issue #7: The crowd was of the Paris Hilton type, which I was expecting, considering. However, my friend summed it up perfectly, when she said, ""This is the kind of place where you can see a 40 year old puking in the bathroom around 10pm."" Well done, my friend.
Issue #8: The service: horrendous. Our server actually admitted to us that the kitchen crew was hammered because they'd been at the Scottsdale Culinary Fest all day. I'm sure they remembered to wash their hands, though. 

Other than that, it was fine.",2008-10-17 01:40:06

Also of note, their cocktails, although super yummy, are very overpriced, but their wine list is fantastic.

Last night we started off with the oysters and they were fabulous. They only came with a vinaigrette with small chopped onion, but that was ok as they didn't need hot sauce or lemon. Then I had the chanterelle mushroom dish which was freaking amazing: perfectly roasted with just the right amount of I don't know what the hell kind of sauce it was, but I licked the plate with my finger and didn't care that 7 people saw me do it. My companion had the pot stickers and he thought they were excellent and that the greens on top were great.

Had the white cake with fruits for dessert and it was dense yet not overly sweet, it was incredible (normally I'm not even really a dessert person, but I just had to have the cake after seeing the guy next to me have it!) They topped it off with honey ice cream, it was awesome.

The service to get our initial cocktail was slow, I waited about 15 minutes before anyone came over to help me and it seemed like half of the staff were busy on mushroom cleaning duty, drinking beers. If they can be friendly and more consistent, then I would definitely dine here more often.

The quality of the dim sum is decent. Is it the best dim sum in the world? No. Is it the worst? No. I would concur that it falls somewhat in the middle.

My first thought was, obviously the employees aren't washing their hands after using the restrooms and returning back to work. Ugh my stomach turned. So I told the girl behind the counter there wasn't any soap in te bathroom, she shrugged her shoulders and then told another employee, in Spanish, ""no soap in the bathrooms"" neither of them seemed bothered. I left, and will never return. Good thing I have my hepatitis A vaccine. 



Like another yelper said, it's hard to find good bagels on the West coast but you have to make do with what you have and this and Brooklyn bagels are my favorite in town. My favorite bagel is an everything bagel and my pet peeve is when bagel places don't put the ""everything"" on both sides of the bagel and they do here! 

My favorite sandwich here is the uptown turkey, fresh sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, alfalfa sprout and scallion cream cheese spread, if you're watching carbs it tastes great on wheat bread but if not, of course an everything bagel then. 

Service here is, well not the greatest. I seem I get the same scowl faced girl who hates her job, but I'm not there to make friends.

I prefer getting my eyebrows threaded over waxed because it's less painful and my brows don't get thinned out too much. Eli did an amazing job. She made me feel comfortable and gently directed me how to place my hands to tighten the skin around my brows. I always feel clumsy at these places, but she made me feel very welcome. 
Her technique is gentle and didn't hurt at all! My eye area is very sensitive and they water like crazy. My eyes did water, but it's just from the pressure of pressing my eye down, no pain though! :) Eli was sweet and offered me a tissue. 
The results were awesome! She cleaned up my brows well and left some space for my lighter spots to grow in more. Payment wasn't bad, it's $12 for eyebrows. At other places, I've paid $10, but the customer service and salon environment definitely made it worth it.

And so I have been trying to find a time to bring the family to Wurst but so many factors have stopped us from being able to get there to try it out.  During this process I have been in communication with Geoff at Wurst and I have to say above all his customer service has exceeded any I have ever had.  Kudos to Geoff!

And so finally I was able to meet a girlfriend there for lunch/brunch on a Saturday (we had made reservations).  As soon as I walked into the restaurant I was very impressed with pretty much everything.  My gf and I both ordered Benny's for brunch.  I had the smoked salmon & double brie eggs benny and my gf had the duck confit eggs benny.  Both meals were outstanding, the customer service impressive and quality of food for the price just fabulous.  

I also have to mention I enjoyed being able to order samplers of the beer to see if I wanted to indulge more in a particular beer or try a new one. Speaks to me!

I can not think of a con on my first visit to Wurst.  What I would recommend as I did not see it on the menu is adding Schnapps as an option.  The homemade schnapps in Germany is mind boggling good & potent(my family's recipe).   I will return to this restaurant and I will recommend it.  Prost!",2011-11-28 02:03:01

I've actually eaten here several times but it's usually because of convenience or the need to get as many carbs in my system as humanly possible and what I mean by that is that the portions are good sized, the prices are decent. The green curry is decent, don't bother with the Pad Thai, the noodles are too gummy and it's just not authentic for my tastes. They do a decent Generals Chicken.
What I've noticed lately is that they kinda upped the place from a pretty casual place to white tablecloths and real silverware (they used to give you plastic sporks). Once I asked for extra napkins and she brought me ONE napkin, no joke.

Before I signed up, I investigated all yoga studios, including places that's not yoga studio but offer prenatal yoga. Think hospital, ""wellness center"", counseling center, etc.

I'm careful about selecting yoga instructor in general. What qualification does one need to start teaching prenatal yoga? I don't think there's any regulation. 

- Instructor quality:
The prenatal yoga instructor here, Eleanor, has the most comprehensive background - Master's Degree from The Ohio State University in Somatic Education, which is the study of movement from holistic perspective. And of course a certified yoga instructor. She said prenatal yoga is her favorite class to teach all week, because yoga helped her so much during her own pregnancy.

- Cost:
You don't need JCC membership to take the class. Just pay a bit more than regular members. The cost per class is $12 for non-members, comparable to regular classes at nearby yoga studios. 

Religious affiliation is not required to work out here. No one is preaching in your ears while exercising.

Friendly staff. 

- Environment:
They've got big windows everywhere that put me in a good mood thinking about coming here. This is very important. In the past I've worked out in gym which doesn't have any exterior window. I found it depressing to stay in a space like that for the long term. Work out is an activity that needs motivation already. Gyms should remove any mental friction that gets in the way of it.

- I'm glad JCC offers this class to the general public and I sure hope they continue to do so.",2015-05-08 02:50:39

They're both solid 3.5 stars, serving Chicago style dogs, falafel and gyros, italian beef, and other assorted fast food.   Mr Gyros gets 3 and so BurgerMania gets a 4, maybe for nostalgia at eating at this building in its previous incarnation as a Wendy's all through high school.

I've only had the gyros and fries, both really good, with HUGE portions.
I trust DarenC though, who has tried it all, and liked it all but the burgers -- but with the Pastrami-Burger getting a special mention, I had to put it on my list for next time.

_IgOS_1AE8GSux0oPEnbXw,TBLdjYJMIDaM6dB23AenLw,BqnxN4hHahZ-zZGXDDGLsg,4,0,0,0,"One word: Popovers.

Well, I guess that really isn't enough for a review, so let me start a short essay. I came here with the family, for a total of seven patrons that all regress to that age of 15 when we are all together, but our server, Peter, was up for the challenge. My parents and I got there first and were promptly seating (no waiting for the entire party to show up first, win). I started with a glass of the Giarrusso family Zinfandel, which was meh, and we were brought out a chicken liver pate with toasted baguette amuse bouche while we waited for the rest of the party to show. My non-adventurous parents wouldn't touch the pate with a ten foot pole, but I gave it a hesitant go and didn't start to appreciate the taste until a few bites in and then I found it enjoyable.

When the rest of the party showed we got to ordering our appetizers, I went for the Steak Tartare (quail egg, cornichon, spicy remoulade, served with toasted baguette), my brother ordered the Grilled Double Cut Bacon (I personally don't think it was worth the $10, it just tasted like regular bacon with pepper on it) and everyone else went for Caesar salad. I loved the presentation with the tartare as the quail egg was barely cracked and placed gently in the steak leaving me the option to pour and mix it in, which I did, and it was super tasty. Apparently the Caesar salad was good and I have to say they put on a generous amount of parmesan-reggiano cheese which is a huge plus for my Italian family. While we were munching on our apps, we were each surprised with their signature Popovers. These things are amazing (everyone in my family agreed)! They are like a giant hollow loaf of bread mixed with a bit of gruyere cheese that is served with a side of unsalted butter. They also bring you a giant cylinder of sea salt to put on the popover per personal preference. Seriously, you have to try one of these little miracles!

For the entrees, I ordered the Crispy Skin Branzino (Sea Bass) that came with roasted cauliflower in curry brown butter sauce. The rest of the family either got the Roasted Jidoir Chicken (huge portion) or the Spice Rub Steak. The sides are served family style with everything going to the center of the table for all to share. We all tried the stuffed mushrooms, creamy spinach, broccoli mac n cheese, and the parmesan gnocchi. OMG, ssssoooo much food that I found to be all so tasty, but a few family members weren't that impressed, pssh. 

Anyhoo, for dessert we all split the crepe souffle (it was okay), the assorted sorbet (yummy) and the Peanut Butter Chocolate Mouse with banana ice cream that everyone agreed was the best one and the only dessert that was completely devoured. While we waited for the damage to be charged, Peter brought out tiny ""chocolate cookies"" that were the size of a fifty cent piece and had the texture of cake as opposed to a cookie. The center was deliciously doughy and each ""cookie"" was topped with confectioners sugar.  

I am definitely a fan of BLT Steak. The view of Camelback Mountain was beautiful and I would love to come back when its a bit cooler to sit outside on the patio.  While I find the prices a bit high, you should still go at least once for the friggin' Popovers!",2012-09-23 04:10:25

As usual I was craving breakfast this morning and was able to convince the amazing Tony A. to meet me somewhere. He recommended Ticoz. I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.

Let's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.

I went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy. It did have a kick, but a little more of one would've been welcome.

Stepping away from the food, the service was prompt and the staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door before I could take my sunglasses off until I was headed out the door on my way home. Very conversational. Very prompt. Very much appreciated. The prices were also extremely reasonable. Although the menu for brunch is limited, at least half the items appealed to me, which means there is hope of a future trip.

I adored the laid back decor which was perfect on a Sunday morning. The colors were warm and inviting and the seating was creative. The bigger chairs at the table though almost don't work for short people, but I managed. I want to go back again. Now.",2009-09-27 20:54:19

She told me how everything was made fresh daily and they are known for their quiche. There was only once slice left so I ordered it. Along with a crispy green salad and a cup of onion soup with curry. When I asked which soup was better the owner brought me a taste of both. I also ordered a cappuccino since in a review someone mentioned it was the best they ever had. I told them I read that, and it was like the pressure was on. However that made no difference, it was indeed one of the best cappuccinos i have ever tasted in life ever.

I started off with the yuzu soda, and I was so pleasantly surprised at its deliciousness with real yuzu rind in the bottom of the glass.  I also got the agedashi tofu for my appetizer.  It was one perfect square of homemade tofu topped with grated ginger, scallion, and bonito flakes with almost a gelatinous dashi sauce beneath.

Philip and Ayumi shared their beef tongue stew appetizer, which was very tender and rich.  My DH ordered the hayashi beef stew with rice - it said it came with vegetables but he only got a few onions, so it was a bit plain.  He was a good sport since the menu mostly had fried or spicy food, even the specials, and that is not his forte.

I got the hamburg steak with daikon and shiso garnish.  The flavor was decent but the daikon was surprisingly more pickle-y tasting than fresh tasting to me.  The potatoes were simple and okay.  I ate everything on my plate though!  It was a unique meal for sure.

Philip had his staple the tororin omelette with fried rice and tomato sauce, and Ayumi got her favorite, mentaiko pasta.  Ayumi ordered a beautiful pineapple ravioli encasing ice cream with fresh berries for dessert, which she graciously shared with us when we discovered how good it was!

Overall, it was a really neat experience and great atmosphere.  We got to meet the chef and talk to him, and learned a lot about Japan from our dining companions.

I so wanted to love you ever since my mom came to a catered event her several years ago. When I was picking out Restaurant.com certificates, I just knew I had to have you in my life. I love ""upscale"" Mexican food, and was hoping you could deliver. Sadly, you did not. 

Your hostesses sat us very quickly and I applaud the quick chip and salsa delivery. I didn't realize how hungry I was until your delicious salsas were in my face and your warm chips were breaking all over the table in my impatience. Little did I know this was to be the best of the meal. 

Your server took approximately a year to even take our drink order. Then, throughout the meal, he proceeded to commit two cardinal sins in a restaurant: asking if we were doing okay with his hands full and his back 3/4 turned away from us, as though we were an afterthought, and the second, putting the check down before asking if we wanted anything else. Pink Taco, this server did not earn his included 18%. 

On to your strange food choices. I ordered your famed Pink Tacos, which had little flavor until I added the aforementioned salsas. The tortillas were good, the pickled onions too, but the chicken and black bean paste were dull. I so wanted to like your taquitos, our chosen appetizer, but the flavor was strange and by only receiving 3 tiny taquitos for $7.50, I sighed for those who would pay full price for them.  

The bottom line, dear sweet Pink Taco, is that you have all the potential for a great awesome upscale Mexican food reinvention--great decor, interesting menu items, and a provocative (albeit silly) name.  Somehow, you missed the mark and I hope we can be together again under better circumstances. 

Love,

Molly T.",2012-12-27 22:52:05

The Idaho Rainbow Trout is out of this world and always perfectly done.  Ditto for the salmon.  My son loves the Parmesan Crusted Sand Dabs and orders them whenever they're on the menu.   Good Shrimp dishes and the salmon sushi (I'm a novice here) is excellent!  

I love fresh oysters and this is the place to go.  The Fanny Bays are always great as are a few of the others.  I always get an order of raw oysters before a meal and have never been disappointed.  My friend claims the Crab Louie Salad is the best she's ever had -and she knows!

The Caesar salad is outstanding and the bread is - well we get an extra order every time.  It's that good. 

The Con here is that thier Oysters Rockefeller are about the blandest, and most uninteresting  O.R. I've ever had.

We love to eat on the patio and people watch.  The heaters keep the patio very comfy and warm during the winter.

Service : Very warm and friendly!! Our server was extremely sweet and explained all we needed to know and set our expectations on what to expect so there were no surprises.

Ambiance : A positive toned down template which pushes the homely feeling aspect of this food! 

Food : For starters, we tried their Pork Eggrolls. The pastry was fried perfectly and was nice and flaky. The filling was very fresh and quite unique in the sense of having glass noodles incorporated into it!

For mains, we tried a Medium Spicy (Adventurous) Chicken Green Curry and a Timid Moak Pa (Catfish). My wife gave a BIG thumbs up for the green curry and was very happy that they got the heat in the dish just right. It came with a side of white rice which was steamed well.

For me, the star was my Steamed Catfish in banana leaves. This is a specialty and they do inform you that it takes an additional 15 odd mins. But oh it's so worth it!!! The minute you open that beautiful gift wrapping of banana leaves, you're greeted by this satisfying aroma of dill and lemon grass! The fish simply melts in your mouth and the acid from the lemon perfectly balances the strong dill flavor. Pair that with a gooey sticky rice and you're good to go :).

mFLWTeq_hkdm7z3OXQ1S3w,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,TFdLM8R_7Pf1xVeBNKl0hg,1,5,2,2,"For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.

When our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.

Waiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.

Finished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be ""right out.""  While I guess she didn't define ""right out,"" what this actually meant was ""in 25 minutes.""  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory mélange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.

Vastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.

For my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb ""Mac and Cheese"", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.

Completing our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with ""just the bill.""

Settling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with ""I hope you will join us again."" I will not.",2010-07-06 16:37:25
IjVEJ6QG12ioAxLUIE3riQ,RylA6VZUTRuMGBu4nHKbCw,J4fxdRNWmqckOHTPJocWEw,4,2,2,2,"As I sad in my last review - amazing patio terrace! They have the most comfortable seating for a restaurant. The terrace is shaded from direct sun, but is open air on the sides which is great. It is designed as an outdoor room and is really cozy. 

For starters I ordered the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. This was very good and some shaved cheese and a small salad with a horseradish dressing was served with it. 

I also tried the Veal Sausage Stuffed Hot Peppers. These were a bit disappointing as the dish was not spicy at all. The dish was good, but did not have anywhere near the amount of spice I was expecting with hot being in the name of the dish. I really liked the tomato sauce however. It was sweeter, but a great addition to the dish. 

For my main I got the Peacn-Crusted Grouper which was highly recommended by both our waiters. I made a good choice! The dish was sweet, but not overpowering. The grouper was fully crusted on the top, but the pecans were still soft. The vanilla maple butter poured over everything was a delicious component of the dish. The side that came with it of sweet potato and bacon hash was really good as well. You can order this as a side with any meal as well. 

My friend got the Chicken Parmesan. Do note that even though listed by two other pastas on the menu, this dish itself does NOT come with pasta. If you want pasta with this dish you would have to order a side of it. The waiter messed this one up I think by not upselling and asking if pasta was wanted with the dish or if the side of Orecchiette was wanted. 

The portion on this entree is crazy too. It comes with 4 massive chicken breasts. The plate was mounded as if there was pasta under the chicken, but there was not - the chicken was just that large. It would make more sense cost wise for the restaurant to give two pieces of chicken with pasta instead of four pieces of chicken - a bit unreasonable. It worked out though that I got to try and entire piece since my friend could only eat three. The chicken was good - thick pieces of white meat. Tender. Thin breading. And a good tomato sauce with a provolone and mozzarella cheese blend. 

The dessert menu looked kind of boring to me, with only four options (chocolate moose, fudge sundae and something else) but I was blown away by the Butter Cake. It was warm - just baked with a slightly crunchy top - which was a nice surprise. The fruit and ice cream provided went perfectly together and the portion was pretty big and certainly large enough for 2 if not 3 people to share. 

I tend to forget about this shopping center restaurant, but I will certainly have to stop back in again soon. I would order everything that I ate again next time. Because of the menu design, you can always find something to eat here. Even something healthy as many fish options are simply prepared.",2016-06-19 12:55:31

The shaken beef was nothing too special, tasted like Maggi seasoning on beef that you would get at other Vietnamese restaurants.  The appetizers were a little underwhelming besides the lemongrass beef skewers which were tasty.  We tried the pork belly buns and the tamarind wings, but I would probably pass on them next time.  The tamarind wings were watery tasting on the inside and not really that flavorful.  The old cravin cajun had better wings...  The pork belly buns were just okay.  The one item that I will come back for is the Big Bone Marrow Soup...it seemed every table had one....we got there early so didn't realize what was popular until we saw all the other tables cutting away at their big bone.

I was quite disappointed to find that they don't have ""to stay"" cups (except for demitasse cups for espresso). There are two reasons I wasn't happy - firstly, imagine all the unnecessary garbage produced! I've reviewed over 40 coffee shops (http://www.yelp.com/list/coffee-toronto-2), and I believe this is the first occurrence of this. Secondly, coffee doesn't taste as good in a cardboard cup! A shop that ignores this is not making their coffee a priority, in my opinion. (I know of one shop that WILL NOT serve certain drinks in cardboard.)

Apparently, Cherry Bomb roasts their own beans as Spitfire Coffee Roasters and they've got great equipment. So, with freshly roasted beans, quality hardware and experienced baristas, the drinks should be good, but mine was below standard. The combination of slight over-roasting and cardboard taste results in this 3-star review.

DushOU1qNKgCsWO1O6kJeA,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,WXR0ND0KqbArMZDvFMA-bw,4,4,1,3,"""You know what the valley really needs?  Another burger joint"" - no one ever.  I'm not picking on Hopdoddy I promise, but c'mon we know the valley is as oversaturated with burger joints as we are with pizza joints, taco stands, and coffee shops.  But being the devoted and resolutely curious Yelper foodie I am, I can't let a new buzz-generating joint escape my view (even if it is just a burger joint).  I've actually missed numerous opportunities to try Hopdoddy in the past (including their original location in Austin years back), but my Dad asked for a burger joint to meet up at for dinner.  So on early Saturday evening, Hopdoddy it was.

Hopdoddy is pretty hard to miss in the Town & Shopping shopping complex.  On the southeast corner of 20th Street & Camelback, Hopdoddy's Phoenix location pretty demonstrably stands out from the old red tile roof row structures next door.  Hopdoddy's two story window encased structure is an odd mix with the rest of the plaza, but the laid back atmosphere inside will quickly disarm the confused.  The ordering process here is a little different than other burger joints however.  Here you're handed a menu, study it while waiting in line and then order at the register.  Being that there was no line Saturday at 5pm, my Dad and I had to act quickly.  Fortunately it didn't take me long to land on my preferred meal of the night.

First, the burger.  In this case the appropriately named Primetime Burger.  American Kobe style beef, brie cheese, caramelized onions, truffle aioli, steak sauce, arugula and tomato.  Yelpers also raved about the truffle fries so I split a large order of those with my Dad.  And because I'm a sucker for shakes, gotta have one of those.  I had a delicious salted caramel milk shake at The Stand in Arcadia not long ago I figured I'd see how Hopdoddy's compares.  Total cost for my food, shake and tax came to about $28 and was all brought to our table in just under 5 minutes.

The salted caramel shake here was solid, though not quite as rich and creamy as The Stand's version.  Still, a perfectly good shake I can recommend.  The truffle fries came out in a huge portion and liberally doused with parmesan cheese.  The aioli coating was present but not overwhelming which I appreciated.  As for the burger, it was good (especially liked the fresh baked bun), but the sandwich itself didn't blow me away.  I think it was probably the brie cheese that threw me off a bit on this one.  I might've gone with cheddar, blue cheese, or even mozzarella as a substitute.  The burger itself was great and the onions and steak sauce were excellent accompaniments.

So not perfect, but a really good overall first experience at Hopdoddy.  Given their commitment to fresh made bread, scratch made sauces, and keeping hormones and antibiotics out of the beef, I can understand why this Austin born burger chain has taken off.  And for you veggie lovers out there, there are salads as well as a black bean burger option.  Is Hopdoddy good enough to stand up the mountain of burger competitors in the valley?  Time will tell.  But I thinks it safe to say we'll be seeing more Hopdoddy locations popping up in the valley before long.",2017-06-25 03:09:08

The coffee in a cone costs around $5.35. You get to choose between four flavours I think. They have Macchiato, hot chocolate, cold brew and one other option. Your choice of drink is put into a chocolate lined cone. You have 10 minutes to drink your drink before all the chocolate melts and the cone starts leaking. And you must hold your cone on a 45 degree angle to prevent it from spilling. The. Coffee in the cone is extremely little. You get about 3 sips of coffee from the cone. I got the Macchiato.

I came in for a late meal at around 10pm and it was still quite full for the hour.  I sat at the bar and was served immediately and could watch the kitchen and the chef prepare right in front of me.  The way the restaurant works is they have a raw and cooked menu that is always available; they also have a specialty board with daily specials that are limited.  They are also pretty well known for their oyster bar and mix drinks.

I began my meal with a special sashimi platter and then went with the spicy tuna tartare. I also had a sake sampler which gave explanations and tasting notes based on the samples received.  The sashimi was on par with any other top notch sushi restaurant.  The spicy tuna tartare was exceptional.  It came with a large helping of BBQ waffle fries, which were a surprisingly perfect combo for this meal.

Like another person said I too try to go to the AMC at Esplanade or Az Center instead. Every time I go to Christown I get my movie ruined by fellow audience members who are; Texting, talking on the phone, bringing babies, starting trouble, and talking loud through the entire movie. I stopped going to the movie over these issues even. Movies are too expensive to miss half of it due to out of control movie patrons. The theater itself is nice and all, typical Harkins. Plenty of parking. They do need line control barriers at the box office though. I have seen fights start here over short cutting.

I am giving today 4 stars though. Today they did something that really impressed me and I think that all theaters should do it as well. If they did I would start going to the movies more often. I would even add that they should monitor throughout the movie like they do at concerts and plays. 

They had an usher actually sitting people in seats, filling in empty seats along the way. (kind of like an usher at the theater or symphony)  Now, I am sure it was because they expected the show to sell out but I still thought it was a great idea. I was pretty amazed by that and what followed. Right before the movie started a woman introduced herself as the theater manager. She then went over house rules. She asked that we please abide by the no texting, no rowdy kids, etc and so forth regarding interruptions. She even told us all to put our phones away right then and there. ""Woot, Woot!"" The manager then discussed a little background on the movie and ended with a hope that we all enjoy the show. I have never seen anyone do this at a non preview premier or a filmed movie before. I was very impressed. Of course people still broke the rules but what do you do? Monitor throughout might help but you can't control other people's behavior. For such a packed house it was better than usual though. On a side note why do people bring babies to movies anyway? It's dangerous to their brain development.",2013-06-17 03:52:19

So to start, a simple Caesars salad was standard fair, no major surprises there.
I had the chicken Paisano, still as good as ever, instead of the house potatoes I get it with the risotto, just a personal preference, but it is good.

The wife had the carbonara, this is the stand out dish, many places will not make it in the traditional way, Fellini's does and it shows.

The $8 chicken burrito my friend got was huge and looked worthy of the price, while I tried a small $3 grilled chicken taco which was decent, but you would need at least three of them to quench any hunger pains. The full bar is available, but they were trying to steer you towards the higher priced margaritas. It is a cleaner, less cluttered look and perhaps more refined, but the patio looks good and once they add umbrella's, etc, it should be back to its normal, old self.

(I say this as though I'm an experienced cyclist. Let's be clear. I'm not.) I'm just an incredibly satisfied repeat visitor.

This store happily helps all levels of cyclists. I've watched and listened. My favorite question (heard over and over) ""Hey, do these tires do something special?"" As shoppers point to beach cruiser balloon tires. With the patience of a saint, and without fail, the employees here explain the history.*

This is a one stop service store. They offer everything you could possibly need for a bicycle. (And a granny knee scooter, should one have foot surgery.) Obviously, bicycles. The scope of bicycles sold is mind boggling. They offer a fitting service to help you select one. Bikes can be assembled for you if you ship one here.

Accessory products range from locks, gloves, water bottles, lights, shorts, tops, mirrors, fenders, baskets, bells (I personally own one with a pink heart, thank-you-very-much), tech gadgets galore [  deep breath  ], socks, pumps, helmets, shoes. (Did you hear me search engine?) There's more. They sell stuff. Price points range from almost nothing to over 4K. And that's because they carry high quality merchandise. They also have an e-commerce store too! http://bikebarnaz.com

Kid products abound. (I know, I tried to purchase a unicorn design set of gloves. Alas this is understandably popular and was out of stock.)

The owners and employees of this store really are invested in the community. You're not just coming to buy stuff here. If you want, you can join a network of super nice people. They offer bike rides for all levels of cyclists. This information is posted on their website and on the white board in the store. It says ""No one left behind."" :)  That would be me.

I brought in my bell from my knee scooter and Hamilton was super happy to find a new home on my bicycle for it. He also showed me how to use a camel hydration system (which was not purchased at Bike Barn). I knew they would they help. Additionally I was shown how to use the different levels on my new front light. These guys are really looking out for you. I've learned something in every visit to this store. This is why my dollars will always be spent here.

Thanks for everything Hamilton!

Service is good at the bar, but can be slow on the patio. They seem to take quite a while to notice you at first especially if its busy.

Food is exactly what Yelp says for 3 stars... ""A-OK"" but nothing to go out of your way for. It's pretty standard & unimaginative fare; they don't seem to have any items that really jump out at you. I've done burgers, various apps & one of the cake-in-a-jar desserts. The bruschetta is HUGE, in a giant martini glass, and probably the only thing I would really be excited to order.

The prices though, are absurd. Seriously. Once I remember that, is when I start to ask the suggesting friend ""Ehhhh can we go somewhere else?"" 
All the apps run $10+. The drinks are even worse. Nothing good or 'specialty' is on HH pricing.  Mules, martinis, other cocktails are in the $10 range; it's insane. The liquor pours are definitely on the skimpy side. Could barely taste anything in my drink yesterday, and the Fireball shots were about 3/4 of an oz. instead of a full 1 oz.

You can find the eatery tucked in the corner on the second floor of the original SF Market shopping plaza.  While going to the bathroom, I noticed that there is parking out back that offers easy access to the restaurant via a ramp from the side of the building.

Practically everything here resembles most Chinese cuisines, except for the fact that there is no meat!  There is even a sign saying that they'll chop you head off if you come in with a slim jim or something of the sort...well maybe not that radical, but something to that affect.  Yet, the vegan faux meats is unparalleled.  I am guessing that most of it is derived from soy/tofu, but one cannot be sure.  Chef Kenny offers pineapple duck, general tso's chicken, and even seafood dishes, all ingredients are made with meatless plant proteins, natural spices, seasonings and even organic. No MSG, preservatives, or food coloring are added as well.

We started with the crab and shark fin soup (delish) and had the spicy beef with brocoli with curry mushroom plate.  Its amazing how closely the faux meat resembles real meat and like to think frying the ingredients has a lot to adding to the texture.  I can't wait to try some of the other dishes that were on rotation digitally on the flat screen TV's in the dining area.  Each time i peeked up, I say something else I wanted to try in the future.

The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  There were only two servers and the place is pretty petite, but handled well on the floor.  The place is designed with several cabana themes and a small pond inside.  Nothing flashy and colors were neutral and not surprising.  Maybe a little interior decorating wouldn't hurt.  The place was clean and very well kept to say the least.  Even Chef Kenny was roaming around greeting guests, this says a lot.

I thought that the dishes would be pricier given that it was a vegan joint, but not the case at all.  Everything is reasonably priced and competitive with similar (non vegan) dishes alike.  Although, because the place is small and popular, there could be a slight wait.  

Overall, very good place and a great addition for those who are either vegan or vegetarian.",2013-01-22 22:36:20

The hard part was finding the restaurant once I arrived at Station Square.  I really don't care for the organization of this odd mall, but that is another review.  Located at the North-East corner of the complex on the second floor, Sesame Inn is easily missed.  After having called the people several times on my cell trying to figure out where they were located, I was finally able to get to the stairwell leading to the front entry.  

Unintelligible Chinese people? Check
Chinese kitsch? Check
Good Chinese Food? Read on...

So far, so good.  Everything was appearing in place and had the proper feeling.  I was craving some good Sichuan food.  We were seated by the host and I looked at the menu solely to make certain that what I wanted to order was present.  When the server arrived I asked her some quick questions to make certain that there wasn't too much of a deviation from what I was craving and ordered:

Egg drop soup
Wonton soup
Panfried pork dumplings
Combination rice (no peas or carrots)
Kung pao, extra spicy, with only peanuts and red bell peppers

Our server was quite peppy and sounded like she was a first generation American since she spoke English flawlessly to us and then spoke Chinese to people in the back.  She was quick to bring out our Iced tea, Pepsi, and soups.  I was a tad taken aback by the appearance of my egg drop soup -- it was a deep red instead of a light yellow.  I spooned it through to make certain it was the right soup and found the cause for the deviation -- the addition of tomatoes to the soup.  Feeling comfortable, I tried the soup.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  It was thick and heavy with very little of that flowered egg/broth combination that makes for a very good egg drop soup.  I could live with a thicker soup, just don't take away the flavor.  The wonton soup also had that heavier feeling about it as compared to some of the lighter wonton soups that I have tried and enjoyed.

Our panfried dumplings arrived to our table and they smelled good.  While the skins were a little thicker, they weren't dumpling thick and the meat filling helped to balance it in terms of consistency.  The flavor was a bit muted, though.  Trying the dipping sauce, I received a bit of a shock.  Contrary to everything else thus far, it was quite vibrant. The dumpling sauce had a very strong acidic flavor to it and could possibly have use a tad less vinegar in the preparation.  Together, though, I enjoyed the dumplings and dipping sauce.  And, truth be told, I would rather the sauce be a little strong on the acid than a little week since I can always dilute with some soy sauce.

Our entrees arrived and they smelled quite good; but I had to send the chicken back.  There were mushrooms.  Sorry, can't eat mushrooms.  While waiting on the chicken to return, we started on the fried rice.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  It was fully cooked, but it was a bit soggy.  The meats were somewhat flavorless and only added another texture to the whole dish.  The flavor of the dish as a whole did not transcend being rice and meat.  A good fried rice really helps me understand the adage, ""Greater than the sum of the parts.""

As we were finishing the fried rice, the new chicken arrived.  It was steaming hot and smelled good.  It looked to be more in a red sauce than a glaze as is customary with Sichuan foods.  I figured as long as it tasted good then there would be no issue.  I took my first bite.  It was sweet.  It wasn't piquant.  I had asked the server if items were spicy.  I had asked her about which peppers she thought were hot.  The chicken tasted okay, but it was nothing spectacular.  I continued to eat the entree and finished it.  It could have at least have been made from white meat since it was not spicy.  Oh well.

They don't serve Sichuan food here.  It is too heavy and sauce oriented.  I would say that it has to be some mixture of Cantonese, Hunan and Mandarin. Will I return, probably not.  Why?  I just don't like the Station Square location.  There are other Sesame Inn in Ross Township and Dormont.  I will most likely try again at one of those related restaurants to see if I like anything else on the menu.  For better or worse, it is one of the better Chinese in the area.",2009-12-05 13:22:20

3) celebration evening (i.e. birthday, anniversary)

I noticed BJ's closed down and was replaced by Bourbon Street.  Wasn't sure if they were open or not, but LJ texted me and said they were open for business.  My first impression when i walked in was WOW!!  

You are greeted with the sound of video games and sports.  Lots and lots of sports on their enormous video wall.  i thought i was sitting front row at a casino sportsbook.  The setup is impressive.  It was the perfect spot to watch the NBA finals game 1.  I look forward to watching many more sporting events.  Some of the entertainment include a pool table, several arcade games, a basketball hoop game, a football toss game, and a bunch of bartop video slots.  You can earn tickets from games which you can then redeem for prizes up on the wall.  Anything from beads with sports teams medals to shirts and mini helmets.  I definitely saw some prizes that I really wanted.  

The room is spacious and everything is spread out nicely.  You won't feel cramped at all.  I've been to this place dozens of times when it was BJ's and I never knew how large the space actually was.  They opened it all up and it into one huge entertainment space.  

The only thing that was a little odd to me was that there was no waitress.  There is a food/drink service area where you go up to the cashier/bartender and place you food and drink order.  I didn't want to keep going back to the counter and I spotted a bucket of 6 bud lights for $15 which I grabbed.  

For those of you looking for happy hour, this place does not have a happy hour.  But the beers are pretty cheap.  As I mentioned earlier, 6 bud lights for $15 and a pint of bud light draft was $3.  Pretty reasonable if you ask me.  

I've eaten the muffaletta, gator nuggets, and pickle chips.  The muffaletta was SUPER good!  For $5, this beast was overflowing with meats.  Such a good sandwich!!  The gator nuggets were a first for me.  It didn't taste like chicken, I rather found that it tasted like a firm flesh fish.  Quite an interesting appetizer to say the least.  The pickle chips were different, they were sweet and spicy.  I found them to be rather tasty.

To sum it all up, the best way to describe this bar is it's a mini Dave & Busters.  Hands down the best bar in the Southwest!!  I know it is a bold statement, but I said it.  Don't believe me?  come in and see for yourself.  There is a good chance I'll be in there with my eyes glued to their video wall.",2017-06-02 23:04:29

When we finally got to the table, we all could not help but adore the well-designed restaurant, especially, the gorgeous custom-designed crystal chandelier.

Appetizer: Eva's Avocado Guacamole w/ crispy tortilla chips (best I've ever tried!!!! Yum yum Yum)

Entree:  Their version of strip steak w/ horseradish creamy sauce & roast potatoes (not really a full order on the menu, since this was a comp dinner) but was very tasty, yet small portions where given. 

Salad: Cesar salad (simply what it would normally be) great with the steak we had.

As you can see, these three selections above, looks a bit too minimal, and to tell you the truth, I wanted more! But in the end, I had a full tummy  & smile for the free food I just had eaten. ""free food tastes even better""

It was New Year's Eve and for a party of 5 we were able to make a real for 6:30pm. We arrived early and were promptly seated in a nice window booth.

We ordered three apps for the table: garlic toast, bruschetta and calamari...meh, not great and average at best. Mains included: steak sandwich, top sirloin, ribs and lasagna. The ribs appeared to be the best dish of the group. The steak sandwich was disappointing - at $27 my expectation is no grizzle and a good trim prior to hitting the grill - not so this time. Vegetable accompanying meal were limp and unappealing in appearance. Lasagna was rated 6/10 but even the 1/2 order was huge! The two desserts were solid - cheesecake and ice cream cake.

Sanuki Service:  Upbeat friendliness was experienced at every point of contact.  Everyone behind the counter was eager to help you with any questions and the cashier was so friendly.  The crew was quick to clear the table of finished bowls and trays when you were done.  Great positive vibe here, sweet.

Sanuki cuisine: The Carbonara Udon is my #1 here. This is a dish that can go so wrong if the cream and noodles aren't quality, they do it right at Sanuki! The noodles are prepped well and was evident in all the noodle dishes I've sampled.  I added the extra braised house pork belly (because I'm extra) as a mini rice bowl option and I'm glad I did, tasty.   The Curry chicken with rice is flavorful non-udon option. Also, over sized bowls are used to serve the main dishes.  I'm not sure if it has a functional purpose, but it's great for social media posts!

Sanuki Ambiance:  I'm such a fan of the operational  design efficiencies!  1) Immediately upon entry is a glass display case showcasing the popular dishes = gets patrons ready to order once in line 
2) Menu on the monitors = Clear display of food options and easy to update on the fly 
3) Dedicated FTE/staff to take orders which: notifies kitchen staff and is uploaded to POS (point of sale) system for the cashier.  Most of the staff is in the kitchen getting the orders ready quickly and keeping the quality in check.
4) Self Service Drinks = Keeps staff focused on the food and service in the dining area (clearing tables).  Also that Calpico dispenser is awesome, I started tearing up when I saw it. lol 
The huge open dining area is attractively decorated with a Japanese Udon house style with wood everywhere.  There's a long bar for single diners and tables that accommodate parties of 6 and 4. The tables are mobile and can be moved to accommodate even larger parties.

Overall this place is such a win.  The quality of food, service for the price point is incredibly tough to beat.  I'll be back to check out more dishes and get my AYCD Calpico in, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",2018-05-18 17:32:53

I picked up a menu to study prior to ordering. We ended up splitting the seafood hot pot, lamb pastrami and Peking duck steamed buns, smoked ""pig face"" dumplings and Chinese long beans. While the hot pot was good, I probably wouldn't order it again (but I'm not a huge soup person, unless it's pho). The house bacon lured me to order the Peking duck, and while it was delicious on its own it wasn't as amazing as the lamb pastrami. Good gravy that meat rocked! The pig face dumplings are packed with guanciale and is absolutely heavenly paired with kimchi. The long beans with crispy duck tongue were as awesome as it sounds--the lightly battered and fried tongues taste slightly like mushrooms and melt in your mouth.

Overall, we were both impressed with Cleaver Koi. The food was great and reasonably priced. The music was hip but not too loud. While there is outside seating, it's far too cold to enjoy. Regardless, I'm already planning my next meal for when I return.",2013-12-02 17:21:23

They are a bunch off options I do not drink alcohol but holy moly some of the price were outrageous up to 16.99 for once 12 ounce drink and I'm sure the glass was mostly ice. Although they give you the complimentary glass you can keep it for that price I don't know how the bar there can keep up.

Last time it was Halloween and the time before that it was a Holiday party.  Every time the manager has been more than helpful and the bartenders have been great.  It's a nice room where they provide table clothes, let us do what ever decorating that we want and they are generally overall accommodating.  Plus the room is nice and the view is spectacular!  

For the Superbowl we ordered wings, meatballs, a sub and pizza as well as a keg of beer.  The food was all normal bar food, but I appreciated the small touches of offering blue cheese and ranch as well as the celery and the pizza had parm sprinkled over the top for extra flavor.   Plus at the end of the night the bartender packed everything up for us.  So...guess what I'm eating for lunch today!?

I'd also like to give a shout-out to them for my Halloween party two years ago.  We had a headcount of 75 and umm...250 people showed up.  All night we were ordering keg after keg and they were bringing up pitchers of beer from downstairs because they couldn't handle the capacity with the one bartender we ordered (remember, we thought we were going to have 75 people there).  For the situation, I couldn't have had better management backing me up.

I dined here once several years ago, and could have sworn it was French/Italian fusion, but the menu last Friday night was French.  Don't be intimidated by this, as there is something that everyone will enjoy.  

After a day spent moving furniture, mattresses, etc. (the joys of moving), we had worked up a SERIOUS appetite.  To begin, we split the carpaccio du jour, which came with balsamic onions and gorgonzola.  I love onions of all shapes and sizes, but cooked in balsamic? Oh man, oh man.  Scrumptious.  

I ordered the duck confit as my entree, which comes served with a side of flageolet beans and sausage.  These are a thinner, more delicate looking kidney bean, and I absolutely adored them.  The duck was tender and very good, but sadly I preferred the duck confit at Rooster's a bit more.  I like a more salted, briny flavor. 

I sampled the fish of the day which was a poached halibut that was flavorful and ever so healthy.

It was a gorgeous night and upon arrival I was excited to see that they had open table on their patio.  We were greeted promptly and whisked through to the outdoor seating.

What a gorgeous evening to sit outside.  The patio if you haven't been is perfect for people watching and they have these huge tilt umbrellas that do a great job of keeping the sun out of your eyes.  The Hickory Tavern is right next door with their patio and there is a nice open park / greenway which adds to the ambiance.

On this special menu was pretty much what I would order anyway except for the Halibut.  I started off with the spicy thai calamari which if there is ever a contest for the 'Best Appetizer in CLT"" I would say this would win, hands down.  Lightly fried strips of calamari tossed in a sweet, gingery, and spicy thai sauce.  Topped delicately with a spicy wasabi sauce that is absolutely the perfect compliment to this great app.  You are definitely missing out if you don't order this when you're there.

For the entree I had the Blackened Heart of Ribeye served with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The ribeye, which I ordered medium rare (as a good carnivore should) was the thickness of a fillet and VERY hard to cook perfectly if you don't know what you're doing was lacking.  It was overcooked on the outside and mushy in the middle, the blackening never really took because of the way the steak cooked and was more charred tasting than blackened.  Not my favorite dish.  The sides were just meh...potatoes were plentiful and sections of them were cold.  Asparagus was just that, asparagus on the grill and boring.

We ordered our desserts to go as to make the kids feel better that we dumped them at a sitters house.  I had the Chocolate cake and Sweetie the cheesecake.  Now I haven't mentioned the service which was fine to this point.  Since we were ordering the meal off the special menu we ordered all at once and told her that we would take our dessert to go.  She brought us the chocolate cake which was apparently served with ice cream and we didn't realize it.  We don't live uptown and didn't go straight home so when we arrived the ice cream had melted and we had a mess in our to go container.  I would have preferred to be told that there was ice cram in the box and we could have put it in one of the 500 thermally insulated bags Sweetie keeps in her vehicle for emergency trips to Trader Joes.

The service here was super super slow and inattentive. For starters, they didn't give us enough glasses of water, so some of us had to share. There were also maybe like, at most 2 sets of utensils on the table, which we didn't realize until the food came and some people couldn't eat. For some reason, the first time our waitress came around she only took one person's order, which was odd and slightly confusing for the rest of us. 

I ordered the lobster grilled cheese, which was mediocre and disappointing. The lobster didn't taste fresh at all - it tasted like it came out of a can. Also the cheese was like... not super gooey or melty or anything. I don't know, it just didn't seem like a freshly grilled cheese sandwich, the cheese seemed kind of hard/old or something. 

Our waitress didn't come around to check on us even once after we got our food, and we had difficulty tracking her down when we wanted to get the bills. I was also displeased to discover on my bill that I was charged extra for my sweet potato fries and chipotle mayo, and I wish the waitress had told me there would be an extra charge for those items - I thought it was unprofessional that she didn't.

The only mildly redeeming thing was that the manager came around to our table and gave us all cards for a free sandwich - some kind of promo related to the Leafs winning or something. It was a nice gesture I guess, but felt kind of forced to me.

This place definitely has different flavors than that of HnJ, but I love it!

Someone was smoking pot inside using a vape with children nearby .We were waiting on our green bean to arrive after about 30 min of watching Everyone receive their dishes we were able to get our servers attn and ask if re green beans were coming out she gave a blank stare like she had forgot to put it in. She came back 10 min later and said the cooks had lost our ticket and the rest of the food should come out in a bit. Five minutes later all of our food arrived at once no biggie we were hungry what was not ok is the Nigiri yellowtail came out and was more had 50% bloodline ? We've ordered this dish many times and never had it come out looking so disgusting and couldn't believe a chef would think this was ok to send out. The calamari was tough & some pieces inedible but other bites were very good. We flagged our server down to ask her for the check and explained that the yellow tail was inedible and asked if she could remove that from bill and she said no ? Shocked because of all the other issues you would think they would have had no problem removing it. We said that's fine just the check then and that took another 20 min to get we left disappointed and still hungry after paying a $60 tab .

For example the thai hot wings we ordered but asked for low spice...they had me burning up and required a trip to the restroom to take care of the sweat. I regularly complain that hot wings most places aren't spicy enough and order suicide wings a decent amount if that gives you any idea of how hot these had to be.

The seafood curry was great as was the whole fish that was lightly battered with mango salsa (i think halibut), both were great. The panang was also very good but again packed some serious heat.

His pulmonary and oncology  team is Dr. Machuzak, Dr. Pennell, and fellow Dr. Malik.  I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Machzak while I was visiting my Dad.  He is outstanding--he has a terrific bedside manner, he's very knowledgeable, and he takes his time with patients.  And he even speaks in plain English.  While I was sitting in the room he even gave me a web site that I could visit to learn more about what he was talking about.  5 stars for him alone...  

Now, onto the negative stuff...the thing the Cleveland Clinic suffers from is SO much bureaucracy and highly specialized roles within the hospital.  There are SO many people involved from multiple doctors, day nurses, night nurses, etc. that the handoff from one person to the next isn't clear or smooth.  For example, the pulmonologist told my Dad he would order liquid morphine and the nurse came in with tablet form morphine.  The order put in the system didn't specify liquid format.  So, the onus was on my Dad to ask all the questions or a nurse and all she could say was, ""I'm sorry sir, but I don't see any record of that order.""  It's been frustrating for him to sift through what the doctors order for him and what ultimately gets handed to him as medicine.  Plus, I've chased down nurses to make sure he gets his pain meds every 6 hours because the nurses don't communicate from shift to shift and no one seems to be watching the clock.  My Dad has even gone so far to keep a notepad next to his bed with a list of medications and what time he should receive them--I think that's ridiculous.  I plan on speaking with the hospital administrator about it.  The responsibility shouldn't fall on the patient to track that stuff.  C+ rating for the Cleveland Clinic!

I give the clinic 5 stars for patient confidentiality.  There is a celebrity / high profile individual across the hall from my Dad.  She has a 24-hour police guard in her doorway with a sign that say NO CELL PHONES IN THE ROOM.  PLEASE LEAVE WITH SECURITY GUARD.  Clearly they don't want any pictures of her to be taken.  They give her special, ""patient confidentiality"" walks and close everyone's door in the hallway while she takes them.  I think that is pretty cool that the Clinic respects a patient's confidentiality like that.  But damn I'd like to know who it is!!",2009-07-18 00:17:53

Hands down the best meal of the two was the Steak Frites.  It was cooked to perfection and the first morsel to the last was so enjoyable you just had to close your eyes and savor all that flavor bursting in your mouth.  Oh if every steak bite could taste like this!

The Lobster and Corn Agnolotti did have lobster but very little of it.  The pasta was definitely a sweet taste which was an unexpected twist but it worked.  It was balanced by the Chanterelle mushrooms.  I am not sure where the corn was in the dish, maybe it was pureed?

- Pad Thai chicken was delicious! Just how I want my Pad Thai to taste. 
- Seafood Delight was a dry and spicy. I couldn't imagine how it would taste if it were a 5! Yikes! Mussels are tiny but packed with flavor. Too much onions. 
- Garlic Pepper chicken packed a punch of garlic! A Vampire's nightmare. Good with the broccoli.

The wings were really good. Meaty and extra crispy. Would have liked more garlic on the parm garlic wings but hey not every would prob agree with that.

The burger was large and cooked well. Most places would charge $14-$16 for a burger like this! On Wed nights, they have a $5.75 special!

The lasagna was surprisingly good for a lighter dish.  It reminded me of something I could make myself, but the point was, I didn't have to make it.

I was early to meeting some friends downtown and decided to pop in (on a Saturday night) for a quick beer and food.

I sat at the bar, and although it wasn't busy, the bartender was running around like a chicken with her head cut off.  She seemed put off when I wanted to see a menu, and once I received it, it took another 15 minutes to order.

I just decided to have a beer and order some guacamole, since I wasn't sure when my friends would arrive and knew it would be quick.  I was never offered chips and salsa, although there were 2 order sitting on the bar near me.  When I asked if I may have some, the bartender said ""oh, sure. These people never touched them, they sat at a table right away.""  Now, that is kind of gross - how do I know if they touched them?  And she was so ""busy,"" I am not certain she knew either.

The guacamole came out fairly quickly, and I asked for extra chips as well (fresh).

Everything was fine.  The decor is cute and it is a small place.  For as high as their prices are, you'd think they would focus on providing stellar service so diners feel like they are getting their monies worth.  I mean, the margaritas are the smallest things I've ever seen (I honestly thought we received a mini version at the event, but that is the true size!).  At $15 or so, that is crazy!!

The next morning, I believe I had some ""Montezuma's Revenge,"" for lack of better terms.  It had to be something in that guac, because that was the ONLY thing I had eaten all day on Saturday.

Absolutely had a blast here. I'd heard about the Onyx Theater through reading the Las Vegas Weekly. I had no idea this place existed. Anton Chekov's Cherry Orchard of the Living Dead was a hilarious rendition of the classic play! It was our first production to see here, and definitely not our last.

The place shares its space with The Rack, a novelty same-sex adult store/novelty shop. Also worth checking out if you're waiting for a show.

TINY theater that showcases off-strip productions, this place is legit. It's small, real, local, and a great place to soak up local culture. Old building that you wouldn't expect to find a stage in. That's part of the appeal!

Do not expect set changes, the stage is SMALL. Smaller than most high school stages. There's enough seating for around 50-60 people maybe? The set pieces are great, the acting is fantastic. It feels like a one-of-a-kind experience for locals.

Tickets do sell out! Cheap. Around $10-20ish per ticket. I went here on the day of the show and snagged them for 3rd row, center seats. I was surprised that there were any good seats left because when I showed up it was a full house! Try to buy your ticket online and print it out. If you do it over the phone or at the box office, they charge you $1-$2 per ticket for printing it out (AKA ""processing fees""). Shame, because I was expecting a nice, hardcopy ticket (I like to collect them!).

Concessions were surprisingly inexpensive! We got a pack of red vines and a giant water bottle for $3 total. Popcorn is small and priced at $3. 

I would not recommend going to shows here to people who are expecting super high-quality theater productions that you'd expect to see at the Smith Center. It's a budget theater for the local arts and not for big broadway shows. This place also hosts traveling shows/acts. Unique!

The show and the acting was solid. We did not expect to like a small theater production like this so much. Very fun evening for my date and I.

You gotta love the charm here. It's old Vegas. Low-budget, low-key, and personal. I cannot help but fall in love with it. It's a part of real downtown Las Vegas. Maybe it's not massive as strip shows, and maybe it's not as glamorous, but the experience is fantastic. My boyfriend and I had a great time here.",2014-03-09 10:11:45

We made reservations, but if you come early (5:30pm), a table for 2-4 is definitely possible ! 

We ordered the ...
Calamari Fritti - very nice with the sauce. could be crispier, but that's just a personal preference. 

Brushetta - Fresh Mozzarella & sun dried tomatos - looked so delish in photos! It was nice but could be seasoned slightly longer. Loved the sweet vinaigrette sauce that was on it. 

Stuffed Meatball - really loved this! Wish it were bigger but it was nice and tasty! My fav dish for the evening! 

Pesto Pollo pasta - This was a bit bland. I am not Italian but if I can use a Food Network recipe and it's tastier than something at a restaurant, that's a problem. The pasta itself had a nice texture as they are made fresh everyday. But the sauce was a little disappointing. I couldn't taste the pesto much. Glad we only got the small size. 

Service was excellent and the waitress always made sure everything was ok. She was also very personable.

Their dim sum selections were quite small and although it was a different dim sum experience than your traditional ""har gow"", ""siu mai"" kind - it was quite expensive.

I was reluctant to go back to a chain-type restaurant for Chinese food, but when we went for a friend's birthday, I had to admit that the food was well worth the price.  It is not at all comparable to chain-type restaurant, Spring Rolls and I'm more than willing to pay a small premium for the cleanliness and atmosphere that the place has.

What I highly recommend here is their roasted duck skin wraps!  They do up a whole roasted duck, and they cut the outter crispy skin of the duck off, which is eaten with a flour-like wrap (DIY).

Well we ordered the Kew Something appetizer, which is basically pork wontons.  As in, seven pork molecules in a wonton with some sweet and sour on the side.  Tasty, but not the sort of thing that I'd pay $6 for.  One star deduction.

But I had Kao Pad (which is a little disturbing sounding) but it is essentially fried rice.  With onions and tomatoes and egg and scallions.  She asked if I wanted it spicy.  I did.  She looked at me like I was a fool, as if I couldn't hang.  I can.

I don't generally love fried rice with spice, but I do like rhyming.  So I tried it, and it was amazing.  Really probably the best fried rice I've had in years.  Next time I'd try beef instead of pork but no complaints--for $8 you get a ton of it and it is sensational.

The spice is pretty hot.  I got hot, which is not as hot as Thai Spicy, but still spicy for sure.  I was fine with it, because that's just how I roll, but Dallas G's head was sweating profusely, creating quite a look.  Kind of like a shabby chic, with sweat.

Its melange of Latin inspired dishes, lovingly prepared by Chef Holly Gibson, offer a variety of flavors from Puerto Penasco (Ticoz Street Tacos) to the Caribbean (Coconut GInger Curry Rice).

I had the opportunity to speak with Chef Holly when coming here for a ""YAP."" (Yelper Appreciation Party)  Invitees were lured by drink tickets and a specially prepared spread.  Ticoz' reputation had previously awakened my culinary curiosity, so this was my first experience of the restaurant and its food.

Ahhh, the sight before me when I walked into the restaurant brought back visions of nights in Puerto Vallarta; ordering tacos and tostadas from street vendors at 2 in the morning.  Or was it the talk I had with Chef Holly, when she talked of her inspiration for one of Ticoz Signatures?  Though she grew up in Arizona (so rare, i know!) she spent much time in Mexico, vacationing with family.  It is here where she discovered the ""street taco"" and brought it back to Phoenix. 

I was to enjoy four of these ambrosial tacos the night of the event.  House braised meats on soft corn tortillas, festooned with cabbage, and blanketed with chipotle and an avocado crema.  To give the right amount of tribute, I want to describe Chef Holly's simple secrets to the taco meats.  The chicken is braised  in pineapple and chipotle, the beef in lime and cilantro, and the pork in orange and clove.  These make for distinct flavor combinations, and the juiciest and most tender meat.   The tacos caused a great well being, as everyone was magically transported to the Mayan riviera, with a cold margarita in hand.

I have to digress here, because i just typed one of my favorite words.  Margarita.  I easily enjoyed four of them, to go with the four tacos.  I could not help myself, they were pure titillation.  Not to mention, all the exotic libations are1/2 off between the hours of 4:00p-6:30p.   An unbeatable value, considering the average tropical cocktail here costs only $7.   In addition, the owners were extremely generous in offering its ""Yelping"" patrons two free drink tickets - even for 16oz. of jubilation.  

The drinks deserve a list all on their own:
#1 Coconut Margarita.  (who would have thunk that agave and coconut make great bedfellows? a first for me, now i will never go back to anything less than...)
#2  Passion Fruit Margarita. (a contender for the number one spot. perfect balance of ingredients - so much so that one hardly tastes the tequila and instead thinks they are plucking Maracuya from the vine.)
#3 Blackberry Margarita. (hold me back! I thought there was nothing more divine than a blackberry capirinha.)
#4 Lychee Margarita. (this sweet and fragranced fruit makes the cadillac margarita pale in comparison)

I will not admit to drinking any more than the above stated, but I did sample the other signature cocktails such as the kiwi white sangria, and the peach mojito.  With so many exotic and enticing blendings of flavors, I was overwhelmed.  The list of flavor combinations for mojitos and sangrias, as well as margaritas and martinis goes on...I only wished my liver had not been so well fortified after my drinking expedition.  I would have explored the wilds of this potable jungle, but I settled instead with putting the flowers, that came as decorative adornments in the drinks, in my hair.

So, after that wonderful veer, my focus was back on the food.  Other items my taste buds explored on the generous spread were the BBQ meat sliders, as well as the pork tostillados and guacummus.  What is guacammus?  It is Ticoz famous blend of house made guacamole and garlic hummus - a unique gathering of mediterranean and caribbean.  Go Chef Holly!

What one will find here on the appetizer menu are the characteristic  southwestern and even south american comfort foods such as empanadas (a taste of buenos aires) and flautas.  In addition to the guacammus, the basket of corn waffle fries seasoned wtih lime and chipotle distinguishes this eatery from the rest.

More than a half dozen salads grace the menu, with unique ingredients such as grilled peaches or hearts of palm.  Burgers and sandwhiches are available for the unadventurous, but the signature dishes is where Ticoz defines itself as a Latin Restaurant.

From the house Paella prepared in a citrus saffron broth, to the shrimp and lobster arroz in crab filled coconut rice - Ticoz will give you a small tour of the Latin World.",2009-07-23 07:35:57

Like all bars situated new a sports venue, the place was noisy and overcrowded, however with that being said, it was no surprise.  Though the patio wait time was over 45mins, we ended up sitting indoor and was seated within minutes. 
Though our waitress was cute, the service was extremely slow, and inefficient.  In addition the food was your typical bar food, which in most cases is mediocre.  

Wanting to try something different, I  ordered their Tropical Sangria that I rated a 1/5.
First off the sangria lacked substance!!!  though the presentation factor was exhibited, it was watered down...... 

Southern fried chicken sliders 2.5/5: took forever to come out, the buscuit bread was hard, and it did lacked versatile flavoring. The ranch sauce served added some element of flavor, but overall disappointing.

Service was great. Food was good. The jerk chicken wings and conch fritters came with really good sauces. The chicken adobo street tacos weren't the best. It had a lot of guacamole (I love guac) and it had Crispy tortilla strip at the bottom but there was barely any meat. We ended with a rum cake, which was pretty good. We ordered the Bahamarita cocktail and the sangria. Sangria tasted horrible even after they added more juice to it.

We ordered the low carb chicken hibachi. So extra veggies, no rice and chicken. The veggies were cooked perfectly. Still had a nice bite to them without being too crunchy. They were flavorful and seasoned deliciously. The chicken was not dried out and also seasoned well. The sauce on the side was a bit on the runny side but once you poured on top of veggies and chicken, it didn't matter much. 

I felt like they were one of the most affordable options along with the serving of the food.

Everyone knew their role and carried it out. Dr. Segal set his broken leg and after 4 days in the hospital, he went home to heal. He's just fine now, thanks to the great care he received.

#2 son was also a patient in one of the clinics. While there was a wait to get an appointment, I think that speaks to the high demand for these specialty services. His case was very complex and I appreciated that docs from the various specialties worked together to treat him.

The burgers here are a real treat. I like that the menu isn't vast and expansive -- it makes me feel as though everything that is offered is curated and intentional. I've sampled a handful of the burgers over different trips and I've always been pleased with my choice. My go-to is typically the Hangover, because I can't turn down a burger with a fried egg on top. On my last visit, my date had the Bleu Burger on special, and the bacon jam/bleu cheese mixture on top made my eyes roll back. So good.

The only things keeping me from giving Bang Bang five stars are due to my gluten free lifestyle. Since a basic burger and fries won't work for me, I add a GF bun and swap quinoa for my side, and it tacks several dollars onto the bill. I'm not bothered paying around $10 for a burger, but as my total price starts creeping toward $15, it makes for a pricey lunch. Also, I understand that the gluten free buns are baked locally. I'm all about supporting small businesses, but in this case I really wish Bang Bang would go with a national supplier -- the GF buns here are dry and fall apart in my hands, while the Udi's buns at Smashburger always hold up and have better texture and flavor. 

To end on a high note, though, I'm all about the new rewards program Bang Bang has started. It's linked to your credit card, so you don't have to carry around some sort of loyalty punch card in your wallet or recite your phone number -- as long as you use the same credit card each time, your rewards are automatically tabulated.

for tests CPT CODES 87591- Gonorrhoeae and Trahomatis.

UNKNOWN TO ME, something from MY BODY, was sent out for testing.

I asked Docasar to pay the bill.

I DO, along with any other patient, HAVE THE RIGHT OF REFUSAL.

Dr. Docasar follows the recommendations of the ""American College of Obstertrics and Gynecology"" for sexually active patients ages 19 to 35 is a yearly PAP that includes a screening for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia. This is their standards, which I did not see marked on their paperwork. 

Dr. Docasar agreed to pay the charges, and I was ""dismissed"" from Docasar's care and AWP.

We were chatting and the menu is huge, so we didn't know what we wanted to order yet...if looks could kill!!! Our waitress was obviously not happy about that. Once we finally ordered, it took a good 30 minutes for our food and this is how it went: Waitress comes to table, drops off my fiance's food and doesn't say a single word. I sit there with no food, wondering where mine is with no waitress in sight. After 5 minutes, I tell my fiance I appreciate his kindness, but his food is getting cold, so he digs in. 5 more minutes, the waitress finally comes and drops my food off along with the check, never asking if we had everything or needed anything else. We eat our typical diner food (huge portions, though), pay our bill, and never looked back. 

My theory is that the line is so long because it really does take forever just to get any sort of basic service here.

I was also horrified to read the food inspection report, especially seeing that they failed like 3 times before they actually passed.

Another problem is the clerks and the check out process.. I mean honestly if you hate your job so much that you need to be curt with every customer, please find a job that makes you happy. Also where does the line start? Its like you're in purgatory trying to figure out which line you're in. Its funny.. look at the flat shelves on your way in and notice how much random stuff that's on those shelves. You know where that stuff comes from?

I was told I could go get my food at the bar and take it to the sundeck...which turns out to be a barren concrete area with no tables or shade (or people).

Tonight was completely different though. I ordered the family dinner A and it gave me a list of eight options for my rice or chow mein item. I chose the combination chow mein. I added a couple more items and I put my order through which totaled $35, no problems. 

I received a call from the store about three minutes later. Some young girl, who didn't tell me her name, tells me combination chow mein isn't available as an option for family dinner A. So I ask her if that's not available as an option, why is it listed on the website they use for online ordering (BeyondMenu) as an option? She answers me ""we've never had a problem like this before."" I told her if it's an option available for me to choose then it is an option available. All I hear is silence then she responds by saying nobody else has had this problem. 

Now I'm pissed because I have a store calling me after I placed a $35 food order and telling me I have a problem. I demand to speak to a manager and this girl tells me they have a manager but they're not in the store right now and they're not available to speak because they're not there. 

So rather than owning their mistake and honoring the items offered on the website they use to place their orders, they lose a good size dinner order and a repeat customer.

Is this how the islands treat everyone because I can get used to this type of hospitality. The day was cold, dreary, and rainy. The service definitely brightened up my party's day. 

I am always craving Korean food and was looking for something on this side of town to meet Katrina M. for her lunch break. My sister and I got there early, so I took the liberty of ordering for everyone. Our very enthusiastic server, and most likely owner, came over to point out some suggestions. Combo plate ($9.90) comes with rice, mac salad,  kalbi, meat jun, and BBQ chicken. Sold, you had me at kalbi. Everything else was an added bonus. Chicken is one of those meats that can be dry, boring, and rarely the highlight of a meal. At Island, it definitely is a contender. Juicy and flavorful. The meat jun was intriguing. A thin slice of beef that has been thrown in an egg batter and browned. It is the first time I have ever had this and it was my sister's favorite off the plate. Brown rice is an option on their menu. We got it subbed instead of regular white and there was no charge. Bonus points! We had also got the bibimnaengmyeon ($9.90). A cold buckwheat noodle tossed in a spicy sweet sauce with radish, cucumber, half a hard boiled egg, and beef slices. I am glad they keep this even in winter. I am usually all for seasonal specialties, but forget that when it comes to this dish. In Korea, this item usually disappears once summer is over. Luckily, not here in Vegas. We had also got the seafood soondubu ($8 something). Bubbling hot, large chunks of tofu, plenty of seafood, and a raw egg dropped in. All good signs... but no kick. I love it best when it possesses a spiciness that can only be remedied with a spoonful of rice. All the dishes come with beansprouts, radish, and cabbage kimchi. The last two items had the same issue, but they were fresh. 

Everyone vowed to come back and try some of the other dishes on the large menu. Even after lunch, I was eyeing the loco moco for next time.

When it comes to the food, you can expect THICK cuts, which, combined with an all-pork menu, give me constant wet dreams. The service was absolutely fantastic, too. The servers came by every time we needed anything (before we even asked) to fill up our side dishes, check in on our water, and generally make sure we weren't burning the place down. 

That being said: while the food is good and the service great, the big issue here is the ventilation. That mofucker was steaming like a sauna. 

I am partial to the nearby Daldongnae: they've also got great meat and service, but I don't come out of it smelling like I sprayed on pork deodorant. Good smell while you're at the restaurant - not so good once you leave.

I'd return to Scaddabush for that mozzarella alone. I liked everything in that dish: focaccia crostini, fresh mozzarella bun that you can cut into slices, and tomato jam that tasted sweet.

I also tried a Caprese salad, and that was fresh and delicious. For my main dish, I got a small Capri pasta. Shrimps, scallops, mussels and other seafood in it were soft and they melted in my mouth. I found their mussels different from most other places, because the mussel meats were so soft. While I liked the seafood being soft, I didn't enjoy the pasta being soft. It was cooked too ""well-done"" for me. I didn't like the tomato sauce that much, either.

I had to come back since the smog certificate expired before I could register the car. They re-did the smog and even gas'd up my vehicle to make up for any inconvenience.

It was a quaint 24 seat (including 4 at the bar) restaurant that was almost full when we showed up at 6:00 on a Saturday night. 

The eastern European menu features a good home style, stick to your ribs fare like Goulash, Perogies, Sausages, Cabbage Rolls and a variety of Schnitzel.

The Holstein included a sunny side up fried egg with a couple of Sprats (a  small little herring style fish but not salty like an anchovy). It was served with an nice buttery spaezle and a veg of  roasted carrots and rings of a round white veg that may have been turnip, but my wife said it wasnt in order to get me to eat them. I ate them, they were good.

Their small bar had a variety of homemade infused vodkas that ranged from the fruity to the spicy to the healthy made with flowers, roots and spices. She told us that they do their artisnal infusing at their other site in midtown Toronto and have about 40 different choices to choose from. We decided on a flight of 3 including a cucumber dill infusion, an organic dulce infusion and one with lingonberry flowers and such. The flower one was quite nice, i liked the organic dulce (and had to explain to the waitress that it was a seaweed) but the cucumber dill was something else. After we tried it we realized the bottle was obviously mislabelled, what was sold to us as cucumber dill was actually an infusion of garlic, onion and chili. It was really very good with a nice kick but the waitress didnt believe us that the bottle seemed to have been mislabelled. 

The lone waitress was a young lady who, while the restaurant seem to fill 22 of the 24 seats in a short time span, was very friendly and courteous never losing her cool with the sudden rush. She is a good ambassador for the Schnitzel Hub.

It was early afternoon on a Saturday.  After overextending my curfew a little bit too far the night before, Bouchon, with its casual and airy atmosphere, rather quiet surrounding (in the Venezia tower of the Venetian), and a less than 5-minute wait was the brunch spot of choice.  We dragged ourselves there and, as always, were within 5 minutes ushered to a table overlooking the garden and presented with a cup of full-bodied french press coffee.  Bouchon was perfect, it has none of the wait nor the chaos that other (lesser but) more prominent and conveniently located LV Strip brunch spots have, it has no loud thumping music mixed with the cacophonous random sounds of slot machines, and it has no screaming kids or lewd tourists.  

Peace and quiet definitely became a luxury when it felt like I had three heads, all of which were thumping at different beat.  

So were the abovementioned coffee, a glass of chilled freshly squeezed OJ, the pastry du jour - pear danish (which were, quite possibly, the best French pastry I've ever had outside of France), and the eggs benedict and canadian bacon served with heaping of hollandaise on two pieces of homemade crumpets.  

Two hours later we were considering our options: (1) check out Crystals; (2) lay by the pool in the warm late summer afternoon (at this point pool parties were sadly ruled out by unanimous resolution passed by my three heads); or (3) go back to the suite at Augustus Tower and nap.

...and I have nothing bundt good things to say about this adorable little cake shop! 

A couple of days ago, news came about my grandma's death in the Philippines and I was crushed enough to leave the house to get some fresh air. Around the same complex where Belle Terre Bakery is located is Nothing Bundt Cakes, which is located towards Cimarron & Sahara.

I was leaving the bakery to go home when I came across the all too familiar sign. Over the past year, I've heard wonderful things about this place from my galpals and must've had it pushed back of my mind since all these other new places opened up. In a bout of serendipity, I swerved off my route and made my way inside their shabby chic-ish little world. If you've read the shopaholic series novels, you will feel as if you're in Becky Bloomwood's shoes. Everything was so pleasing to the eyes, luxury cupcake decors, the cute sample holder, birthday bundts design book, the aroma of baking bundts. Motion pictures really need to feature this place if ever Shopaholic takes Vegas! one day. 

Knowing how much my mom loves red velvet, I got her a little Bundtlet. It's quite a handful considering how much you pay for it ($3.99). Plus every serving gets stored in this cute plastic container pasted with the shop's sticker on top then packaged inside a paper bag. Environmental awareness was an added bonus. The ladies recommended me to try their peanut butter sample which was swirled with this delicious cream-cheese icing and if I weren't the only customer at the store, I might've snatched a few more because they were goooood.

Why I never bothered to come here before, I don't know why, but as sad as my mother was, she was very delighted with the treat. Papa was also at home that day. When he saw the cake, he gave a little wince. He's never too big on sweets but Mommy insisted on having him try some. When he did, he told us to pause while he made some tea. Came back and told Mommy to leave whatever she could for him (I swear, it would've been gone in a jiffy if he didn't tell us to pause) and he spent the rest of his lunchtime enjoying it. 

I'll base the ranks of Nothing Bundt Cakes according to Papa...for someone like him to give a cake a compliment, it must be something!",2014-04-30 16:27:32

5.  Lamb Mantra - i enjoyed this dish a lot because it was actually really tender and not gamey at all

On m'avait suggéré cet endroit pour les cocktails diversifiés ainsi que pour l'ambiance du samedi soir, un DJ est sur place. Nous sommes arrivées vers 20:30, l'endroit était déjà bien rempli de nombreux groupes, nous avons eu une table au 2e étage à l'écart du bruit. L'endroit en soit est charmant avec ses murs en brique mais enlaidi par une décoration trop colorée et bien trop kitsch, le tout se mélange très mal. Nous avons pris en entrée les calamars frits puis une pizza à partager. Les calamars viennent avec une sauce bien relevée qui pique la bouche et la pizza très bien faite, avec une croûte mince. La serveuse a même été assez accommodante pour modifier la garniture de notre pizza. Comme la majorité des commentaires que j'ai lu, les prix sont un peu trop élevés, mais bon on s'attend à quoi dans le Vieux? Le gérant nous a par la suite, installées au bar afin de terminer la soirée, avec un pichet de sangria trop rafraichissant et bien dosé en alcool. Nous étions à côté du DJ et on pouvait danser près de nos sièges. Ce fut vraiment une belle soirée.

It is located in a very nice, new business park on Tropicana, it has ample parking, and  I couldn't tell you about lighting; they are only open in the day time.
Nice waiting room; there was coffee, tea, and fresh chocolate chip cookies. 
It was my first time ever to a chiropractor, and for 32 I think that's kind of old for having never gone.
So I guess overall I was very pleased because Dr. Reiss brought new insight as to why I may be having headaches that I never thought of before. 
I thought the ""speedometer"" was cool , that rolls up your back and shows where the tension is. After I left, my headache was gone within a few hours!

I would say if you work in the area and want to spend a nice afternoon lunch out and not deal with the strip, then Coffee Pub has a nice homey atmosphere to enjoy the afternoon.

Then, when i got to the window, she told me they were out of cannoli so she offered me a mousse dome.  Then she came back and said they were out of that.  So I got a brownie.

I took my first Hot Pilates class with the instructor Costin. I loved the music and energy he brought to the class. While the class itself was intense, he made it bearable... even with the heat!

Really? No one's reviewed Co+Hoots yet? 

Co+Hoots is a great space in an old building on 7th Street near Roosevelt. It's a place for small businesses, the self-employed and anyone else interested to have a space to work that's not their house. It allows for brainstorming, socializing and bouncing ideas off others. There are both rates for drop in one time visits and for packages for full-time inhabitants. 

The work environment is an open collaborative space with meeting rooms to use when needed.

I've been there several times for both professional organization meetings and social events and every time I find it hard to leave. There's such a welcoming vibe and the creativity that abounds in that place is astounding. 

If you need a place to work for a day to get out of your element, a place to call home for your business of 1, a spot to hold a meeting or a swanky sexy space to hold an after hours gallery or social event, this is your place.

Still not convinced? Swing by and check it out. I'm sure they won't mind!!",2011-05-13 15:28:22

So to start with, the prices are reasonable and the portions are a good size.  Also, the spring rolls here were quite good.

The pho though was a disaster, and was some of the worst I've ever had.  Broth is absolutely the most important part of pho, as that's where all the flavor comes from, but the broth at Xe Lua tasted very watery.  I actually think it may have been made with bouillon, as I noticed water and this mysterious brown powder were separating from each other after a few minutes.  This is a big no-no - pho broth should come from simmering beef bones and spices for several hours, not from tossing some powder in a pot of boiling water.

What is a mystery is that Lone Spur begins their meals with wonderful fresh ingredients. However, they do not cook their onions long enough before folding them into the country potatoes and their egg dishes. If you love raw onions, this will not bother you. However, the flavor of the under-cooked onion overpowers many dishes. I had the cowboy scramble and my poor eggs and spinach were uneatable due to those offending onions. I gingerly picked out my onions from both the eggs and country potatoes which were beautifully seasoned and fried this time if sans onions.

How long I'm not entirely sure but the food has been pretty much the same this time as I went last time which was a very long time ago.

I had recently come here on Monday the 23rd of March only to find the establishment to be closed on Mondays so I was sort of disappointed.  I had returned on the Friday past (27th) to get my fill of what I had missed earlier in the week.

This place is a very down to earth mom and pop type of burger joint.  They also serve chicken fingers and fish and chips basically it's a fried food cafeteria style type of place.  We were here however for burgers since this is what the place is known for.

Honestly it has probably been over a decade since I last ate at C & Dubbs.  A lot has changed with me over that time.  I have what I think developed higher standard for food over that time.  When I was younger say... in my early 20's a burger was a burger was a burger and without a baseline standard in which to measure a young person really has nothing to compare experiences to.  

What I am saying is when I was younger this place would have done me just fine.  Today I have a much more spoiled taste and established burger sense.  The burgers at C &  Dubbs are basically what I can make at home, literally.  To start things off the burgers are just frozen.  I saw them putting them on the grill and cooking them.  They are preformed frozen patties.  I can make those at home like I said.  While I had 2 x 8oz patties to make a 1 pound burger (Sumo) there is nothing defining or special about this whatsoever, not in how it is cooked, served or what is put on it.  

In today's burger market especially in the GTA there is a myriad of establishments to get your burger fix from chain fast food to what can be almost called gourmet although burgers are not really a gourmet type of food.  C & Dubbs blends in with the older mom and pop shops of years past sort of in league with let's say Apache Burger also on Dundas but in Etobicoke close to Kipling Station.

  The pricing is not out of this world but for what you're paying and what you get I could make this at home.  It's about 10 bucks plus tax for a normal combo.  The fries are probably better than your average chain but I'd think Wendy's or A & W have tastier burgers than C & Dubbs.

The poutine was good not great and the food was ok, not exceptional.  Because of that I can only give it a 3*.",2015-03-30 14:35:57

I tend to ask a lot of questions and expect professional answers. Drs tend to feel like I'm questioning their credentials which I am not. And usually when they feel offended because of my questions I know they are not the doctor for me ( sadly it has happened before where I had to walk out and call state regarding an eye doctor). Also my time is just as important as the doctor's, so I do not want to feel like I am being rushed and the wait is reasonable. And most of all the care I receive. 

Dr. Lisa Hoang was above and beyond. Aside from graduating from one of the top dental schools in America (UOP in SF), she was polite, professional, caring, and respectful. 

I had 5 cavities filled, a deep clean, and had to get an impression done for my night guard. 

She didn't try to sell or push any treatments on me. She explained everything she was gonna do before she did it because I told her I get anxiety (not with the pain but the thought of someone in my mouth and not being able to move or do anything about it). 

She also asked about family history and educated me about how to care for my own teeth and mouth to delay the inevitable. My son was there and she was really patient with him too, they let him play with the office's ipad. I would think she is good with children even though they are not pediatric dentists. 

Overall, she was VERY knowledgable, did not push or make me feel to get treatments done. But with being so knowledgable, she would sometimes use medical terms I did not understand, so I had to ask her to simplify- which she politely did. It was a  not-as-scary-as-i-thought-it-would-be experience.

What I also like about this place is that once you place a reservation, they send you a text an hour ahead to remind you of it and you must reply with instructions to confirm your seating. If you don't show up after 15 mins, the table is no longer held so it's always best to confirm. 

I will also add that after some time of sitting in the middle near the bar that there was quite the draft. I was wearing a turtleneck and my guest, a sweater, so not too sure where it was coming from but hopefully management fixes this if it persists. 

Another amazing thing is that the women's bathroom contains women's sanitary napkins for emergency purposes, as well as mouthwash + plastic shot glass cups which is soo refreshing and appreciative to see =D

Anyway, I would recommend this place again as I regret not drinking alcohol or ordering the unagi bibimbap (miso disappoint!) the location is also convenient for me so I'll take it!",2016-01-13 04:33:41

-Beef with Brocolli

The second problem is that each and every time my husband has left this office his dental issues have reoccured worse than before.

Was sat at the small two person seats and the table is connected to the wall so you can't even create more room. I'm a small person and this was even too small for my liking.

It's primarily just chains that cater to the extremely dull suburban scene, so I consider Char to be a welcoming addition.  

Contrary to the traditional sit-down approach I originally assumed they'd have, Char has adopted the ultra-trendy Chipotle-style approach to their pizza, which is a model that people seem to lovingly embrace (ask Fired Pie). In some ways, I understand the benefits from a business standpoint. People like customizing their food and generally dislike restrictions on their favorite ingredients. What I don't like about it, however, is that the atmosphere is usually frantic. Long lines, lots of noise, minimal seating, and high-pressure to keep moving/choosing. Instead of being a restaurant, it becomes more like a cafeteria. I feel absolutely no guilt in writing a big zero in the tip line for this reason alone.

The one thing I give Char credit for is the fact that when they first opened up, they recognized some hiccups in their ordering system and adapted things accordingly, making the operation run much more smoothly.  

We always start with the bruschetta. Well, I shouldn't use the word ""start."" Traditionally, bruschetta serves as a starter that precedes the pizza. But since they're giving you all of your food at once, you're forced to wolf everything down simultaneously to avoid anything getting cold. Although the bruschetta appears to be pre-made anyway, so it's always cold regardless. The apple, mascarpone, and fig spread is probably the best of their samplings, although they recently screwed us by completely forgetting to the mascarpone almost entirely.

As for their pizzas, their margherita is probably their safest choice, with their priscuitto and fig also being a decent option. My girlfriend and I strongly dislike their bacon and corn pie, which tastes more similar to what you'd find at the Papa John's next door in terms of the ingredients. I've seen some chefs do incredible things with both corn and bacon on pizzas, but this definitely isn't one of them. Furthermore, seeing BBQ chicken on a menu that's supposedly ""Napoletana"" just flat-out makes me cringe. Their farmers market, unfortunately, has way too many toppings to the point where it's a total hodge-podge of ingredients. I would not order it again. However, from what I can tell, most people here don't order the specialty pies as they are originally presented, but prefer just building their own - which often does more harm than good. 

As a whole, their pizza is okay when it's done properly. What hurts them, however, is their consistency. We've been here several times and there seems to be a lot of inconsistency in getting the crust properly charred. A few of our pizzas seemed like they were underdone, while others were actually quite impressive. 

Honestly, if you're the type to confine yourself to this little suburban area for your adventure, you'll probably be very impressed. But if you're spoiled by some of the more critically acclaimed wood-fired pizza joints in Phoenix, you'll probably find these pies to be weak.

In summary, I see it as a good little neighborhood place that will most likely become a favorite of people who live in the area. It's reasonably priced, it's convenient, and it's locally owned.  But don't expect it to compete with some of the heavier hitters down south. And as much as I want to give them a higher review, based on their inconsistencies, I just can't.",2015-11-17 20:44:22

Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.

I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.

Went there and searched high and low and found the section the locks were in and exactly 1 (that was previously opened and taped shut, and placed back on the sales floor) was in stock. Long story short, not one sales associate was around to get help from- there was no one to ask nearby. I pretty much decided to leave without purchasing anything and  head to this Home Depot near Scottsdale Ranch.

Let me tell you it was like night and day walking in there. The store was cleaner and brighter in appearance.

Copacabana is up there with some of the most enjoyable dining experiences of my life.  If you seriously heart meat in large quantities, especially steak, this is the venue for you. 

Copa is a Brazilian Steakhouse, also known as a Churrasacaria. The dining experience is rodizio style, this means that the customer pays a fixed price, and the waiters bring to the table all types of meat speared on a skewer which they then shave off to your satisfaction. 

No word of a lie, I'm in a trance when I'm in this restaurant. I've been to both the Niagara location and the Yonge & Eglinton location. They are both stellar as folk but Niagara's does it up bigger and better fo sho. 

You begin your meal by hitting up the ""Harvest Table"". This section consists of various breads, pastas, salads, fruits, cold cuts, cheeses, and tons of other finger food madness. Always a good idea to hit up this table lightly as you'd want to be saving space for the slayer spree ahead.  

At your table will be a signal card with a green and red side. Green indicates to the servers flying by with the food you're down to get down, and red of course means you're not down.  In terms of the meal and the meats you can expect to devour, you will most likely run into most of the following on large skewers:

Prime Rib w/ cheddar
Flank Steak
Skirt Steak
Trip Tip Steak
Buttermilk Steak
Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon
Peppercorn Steak
Top Sirloin
Braised Beef Ribs
BBQ Pork Ribs
Beef Kebabs
Moroccan Chicken
Garlic Chicken
Slow roasted leg of lamb
Lamb Chops
Parm encrusted Pork Loin
Brazilian Sausage
Grilled Salmon
Bacon wrapped Turkey

Believe it or not I'm definitely missing meat items, pending you go on the weekend when the menu is at its full capacity. In addition to the T-Rex Jurassic Park 5 Fest are other wonderfully delectable items. The pineapple for example, stacked two per skewer and soaked in a marinade consisting of at least cinnamon and sugar before being roasted and caramelized to sh!t. Bananas are rolled in a similar dry rub like the pineapple and then deep fried...! Fresh baked piping hot cheese balls graced my plate, and the cornbread is to die for. It comes steaming out of the oven and is perfectly moist and seasoned, it was so good that I had 4 pieces despite all the delicious meat you would think I'd have saved space for. That good. 

Aside from the food there is live entertainment. A live band plays while the beautiful and extravagantly dressed Rio Samba Divas dance away. At the Yonge and Eglinton location, you can find 2 gentlemen doing some serious Wushu style martial arts to the music as well, flashkicks, sweeps and full aerials. These live shows are roughly on the hour and definitely add to the whole experience.  

In closing, there is nothing I didn't enjoy. I'd like to list off the specific meat items that I thoroughly enjoyed, but I'd pretty much be writing out the majority of menu list above. All I can say about the meat is that none of it is over cooked and the steak is typically medium rare, the way it should be. A word of caution to future patrons, to fill up trucker belly appetite guests they put a lot of salt on the meat, if you really can't handle a lot of salt then you will struggle with a lot of the meats. It's not salted to the point where it's not even edible, but there is quite a bit. 

The Copacabanas are spacious but always packed especially on weekends. Ensure you make reservations and arrive on time. I would also suggest getting into the mindset before you get there so you may slay at full capacity. Enjoy!",2009-07-07 22:34:42

Very friendly and helpful staff. Even came and chatted a little from time to time. But then there were only two tables, including us, so can't say how great the service is if it's busy.

Came for dinner. 23.95 per person + 2 dollars for weekend. Comes with half a lobster and a plate of seafood, which includes a mussel (okay), a fanny bay oyster (pretty huge, tasted great), a tiger shrimp (not for me, but my mom thought it was ok), some fish fillet (not sure what that one was, not that great), and some other stuff. Initially I thought it was kinda expensive per person, but considering that the lobster and oyster were nice and big, it's not that bad. For those wondering, after 10pm is 16.95 per person, without the plate of seafood and lobster.

The beef and lamb were pretty good. Just the right amount of fat on the meat (but that's kinda subjective). The wontons were pretty good.

The downside for this place, compared to other typical places, is that there isn't much selection in terms of sauces. I like other places where you get to go out, get your own sauces, and make your own concoction. Here we just get some soy sauce and a dish of satay sauce. Even if I can't make my own, I wish they had more sauces.

Also they don't have beef balls and beef tendon balls. Also they only have the omasum beef tripe and not the reticulum tripe. Too bad :(

Each adult person gets one plum juice. Additional ones cost money. Also other drinks also cost money. If I remember correctly, little sheep at warden has a all you can refill fountain.

When the bill first came, it was written. They added 10 percent charge on the bill, and the bill didn't indicate that it was tip. It almost looked like tax if I didn't examine it properly. When I asked them about it and then paid, they came back with a printed bill that actually came out to be a bit more expensive (calculated tax on top of the tip whereas it was 10% pretax before). It almost seemed a little shady. I was gonna give this place 10/10 service, but I knocked it down to 8 for that.

Not sure if I would come back. I kinda prefer Hipot (which is almost like right beside it) over this one in terms of selection, for stuff that I like having).",2015-01-17 04:14:28

Update:
Ok, so now I've been living in Scottsdale for almost a year and Tapino is a staple for us.  Its really one of the closest ""nice"" (its not like its fine dining) restaurants to us.  

I have to say that I don't find the portions to really be small.  Go to any trendy small plates restaurant in any city and the sizes of the plates will be the same.  Its all about savoring the way the different ingredients come together, not about shoveling food into your face. My husband and I always order about 4 plates and its always the perfect amount.  I think we may have gone over $100 once or twice but that included a LOT of wine.

1)Miso   2)Truffle   3)Soup

Done. 

Why the hell is this stuff so good? Well, it's got truffle, chunks of fresh lobster meat and edamame, served up in a bowl with a lid, sans spoon. Twist the lid off, pick-up the bowl, smell the steamy, hot, goodness, sip and bask in the glory. Twice the price of the regular miso soup, but worth every-single-indulgent-penny.

From this point of the review on, I have to preface that I am a complete sushi novice. I know what I think tastes good and I know what I think looks good. I won't eat sushi from shady looking places or super markets, but when in Rome (read: a nice resto) I will indulge. 

With that being said, holy bejesus everything I ate was divine. 

Spicy tuna roll: The safety roll for new sushi eaters. But, I've never had spicy tuna rolls like this. Fresh, perfect rice consistency with spicy mayo pipped on top and covered with crunchy tempura crumbs. It bumped the delicious-ness up to a whole new level. And can I just emphasize the freshness factor here? Good god. 

Eye of the Tiger: scallops, shiitake mushroom and burdock root, rolled up in rice, seaweed with a spicy sauce on top. I'm not going to lie and tell you that I have any idea what burdock root is, but its delicious regardless. 

Spicy scallop chips: Pringles, scallops, avocado. Try it. Trust me, you'll like it. 

Oh, and go ahead and order yourself a Ginger Martini: tequila (oh hells yes), grapefruit, sake and ginger. So good. If you like mint (which I don't), Kyoto #2 is where it's at: muddled mint, gin, lime and passion fruit. 

Expensive? I wouldn't say that at all. What I would say is you get what you pay for here--excellent quality sushi and cocktails. Decor? Super chic, but still fun and laid back. I loved the flowing river water bar and the lit glass wall. What I truly appreciated was the interaction with the head chef and watching him masterfully prepare his delicious creations.

I made 8pm reservations for our table of four, and I'm glad I did, since they seemed to stay steady throughout the evening.  Our waitress was pleasant and helpful from beginning to end.  One note: ask for the bread immediately.  We didn't receive ours until we had been there at least 30 minutes and our entrees were nearly ready - easy to look over, though, because the bread was awesome.

Two from our party ordered the vegetable tower entree, which seemed to please both of them.  I didn't hear rave reviews, but no complaints either.  I ordered the chicken and dumplings and a side order of the mac and cheese to share with the table.  The c&d were DELICIOUS - I finished every bite and was sufficiently filled but not stuffed.  The mac and cheese helped give everyone else something to pick at, which everyone seemed to like.  It wasn't extraordinarily unique mac and cheese, but it hit the spot.  The fourth person at our table had the short ribs, which none of us could get enough of.  I know it was outstanding and I only had two bites of it!

I also appreciated Beckett's wine, beer, and cocktails list.  The beer selection was sizable, which I liked, and the wine list included several from Arizona.  My wife actually had the Grenache blend from AZ - we both liked it a lot and would order it again without hesitation.

All in all, Beckett's made for a great night.  Good location, really cool architecture, friendly service, and excellent food and drink!",2011-01-03 06:36:07

There were a few people eating inside but majority of customers were grabbing food to go. We were in the same boat. It's more of a take out joint than a restaurant.

- Sate beef salad roll (#4) ($5.00) - we grabbed a beef salad roll to try. There were only two of them. Pretty mediocre but they were pretty stuffed.
- French fries (#8) ($3.95) - crunchy and better than your average fast food joints. My one friend orders them all the time and loves it but I thought they were a bit stingy on the amount that we got. We were starved so these were gone pronto.
- Spicy sate chicken (#27) ($6.70), veggie (#20) ($4.25) & cold cut special (#21) ($5.95) - three of us ordered banh mi's to go. These weren't the best I've ever had but were decent. Portion size is gigantic, you'll be full after eating one. They toast up the bun for you (yes!) and you can choose what you want for your toppings (everything obviously).
- Sate tofu and veggie spring roll bowl (#35) ($8.50) - our other friend wanted a more substantial meal so she opted for the sate tofu and veggie spring roll bowl. Lots of tofu, shredded lettuce/carrots and green onions over your choice of steamed rice or rice vermicelli noodles. Again, big portions but it hit the spot. She had leftovers for the next day.

With so many other options on 17th Ave to choose from, I can't see myself coming back anytime soon unless I'm craving some late night banh mi's eats. I haven't been able to try banh mi's elsewhere but I know there are better places in Calgary for them.",2015-08-04 15:26:26

The place is a bit small and I was confused as to whether it was a fast food joint or more of a dine in restaurant. Turns out that you have to go up and order your food up front then they'll bring it to your table. The staff were really friendly though!

I got the carbonara and at first bite I thought it was pretty good. Then it got super salty..I found that I had to drink water with every bite. It didn't quite taste as I had imagined (not as creamy, very heavy on salt) and was a little disappointed. On the other hand, my friend got funghi pizza and she quite enjoyed it.

My wife and I showed up at 7pm for our reservation.  Our drink orders were promptly taken and served, but then the wheels went off the bus.   After ordering our 4 course prix fixe, we proceeded to wait an hour for each course.  The most challenging part was that our respective dishes arrived at different times, so instead of us enjoying our own 4 course meals, we had to endure an 8-eight course tapas dinner!  Thankfully, we didn't fight over the food!  

The restaurant staff did an admirable job trying to serve us.  They explained that the kitchen was new and running way behind and offered us lots of free drinks.  Sadly, I'm not a huge drinker, so after a free cocktail and two glasses of wine, I just wanted my food. 

Honestly, it was hard to assess the food.  It came out in dribs and drabs.  Most dishes were passable, but nothing remarkable.  

The most frustrating part of the whole experience was watching the restaurant owner entertain friends and then host a wine agent, while his servers were being attacked by angry patrons.

Our most recent experience, this past weekend was exceptional though.  We chose to go there knowing that many/most menu items are gluten-free (corn tortillas!), and we had a celiac friend staying with us.  

Everything we ordered was delicious!  The guacamole is a delicious starter.  I had the Tostadas Dona Flora (which admittedly, I've had every time), and it's a HUGE plate covered in deliciousness.  Crispy tortilla shells with refried beans, tasty tender chicken, sour cream, guac, lettuce.  YUM.  And a side of rice.

My husband had the Red Snapper tacos (which are the only menu item on a flour tortilla - so celiacs beware), and our guest had some plain enchiladas, as she apparently doesn't love spice.  She enjoyed what she ate.

We also scored by ordering 3 gluten-free desserts to share: a dense, cinammon-infused chocolate ""mousse"", and a caramel flan.  Both are impossible to describe, but were delicious!!  

But what made the experience particularly exceptional, was the service.   VERY attentive (to the point that we joked about how many different staff/servers came to check on us).  We were sitting in the booths by the kitchen, so I guess we were in their line of sight, but every staff that passed, asked us how we were enjoying everything.   Even the Colin Firth lookalike chef stopped over to ask how the meal was.  Nice touch!

Here is where Milagro loses the 5th star:   I called earlier in the day in search of a reservation, and was told no reservations were allowed between 6:45 pm and 8:45 pm, and that there was no point in coming between those times, because the wait for a table would be 1 to 2 hours.  We made a reservation for right at 8:45.  At about 7:50 pm, we walking by and starving, so we checked in to see how long the wait was.  There were quite a few empty tables, but we were told they were all accounted for.... I'm not sure how that could be, since reservations weren't allowed during that time.  We decided to have a drink at the bar while waiting for our reservation. Within 2 minutes of standing at the bar (and before even ordering a drink), a table ""came up"".  I would have been surprised if they actually left us at the bar surrounded by empty tables, so I'm glad they pulled through.  But really, the hostess was giving me the impression that it was impossible to get a table, and that we should just give up.  If they hadn't given us a table within minutes of arriving, we may have just eaten elsewhere, because we were way too hungry to wait until 8:45.

You can't deny that they have some of the best prices on brand name items, but at the same time, they have some of the worst customer service around. So really it comes down to shopping there for items that we know where they are located, and we don't have questions about whether we want to buy something or not. 

This particular Walmart is pretty much the same as most Walmart Superstores. Plenty of options, lots of stock of each option, clean and organized aisle ways, decent rollbacks and regular prices on most brand items and of course their own brand items, and overall you are almost always able to find something you did or didn't plan on buying before you leave.

On this particular visit we struck out on what we were looking for in Halloween decorations, but that's more so because we are looking for pretty specific things not just general decor - which they had about 3 aisles worth!

Overall: B-
All things being said it's still Walmart, and we still dread the beast of a store that they offer, but who can deny the cheap prices?",2013-10-22 16:31:39

The best part about this restaurant is that the birthday eats for free (which was me in this case). The cost is reasonable considering it is AYCE and the atmosphere was excellent. The service was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

They have tons of dishes, from the usual noodles, chicken, pizza, to sushi, dumplings, and veges. The unique thing here is the wok - you fill your plate with raw veges and meat, and then they cook it for you with your choice if sauce - and this tastes pretty good! They also have cooked shrimps, steak, and fish - which is excellent value considering it's all you can eat.

They do sell slices like in PGH. The reason I didn't give a 5 star has nothing to do with the food but what I noticed inside. First off it's expensive. I always thought a Vinnie Pie was expensive, this place thinks they are a fine dining pizza shop. If you get a xl plain its almost $20. The other reason only 4 star, I noticed on their soda dispenser they charge for tap water, they say its purified but I don't care. Who charges for tap water? This also goes to my above EXPENSIVE.

The place is half restaurant, half wine shop. The whole space has a great ambiance, especially with the lakeside patio. There's also a bar and lounge area next to the shop. Although it wasn't particularly hot that day, it wasn't cool enough to want to sit outside (everyone else did).

FIRST COURSE

Soup du Jour: Potato Leek Soup with bacon and croutons. The soup was thick, but not heavy and very flavorful. I loved the addition of bacon.

Fresh Burrata Cheese with Heirloom Tomatoes: Balsamic vinegar, ciabatta croutons, and basil oil. This was just okay. The burrata was nice, but I've had much better salads of its kind. I would have enjoyed more tomato as well.

SECOND COURSE

Poulet Frites: Roasted chicken breast, fries, and natural chicken jus. We both ordered this dish and loved it. My chicken was slightly dry, but the jus was so, so good! The fries were really fantastic as well (Top 10) and tasted amazing when soaked in the jus. More jus please!

THIRD COURSE

Tiramisu: Mascarpone, vanilla lady fingers, espresso, and Kahlua. This is one of my favorite desserts and of course, I'm very particular about it. That said, I did not like this tiramisu. I don't know what it was, but I did not like the flavor and didn't finish it.

Crème Brûlée: Vanilla bean custard and caramelized sugar. This was really nice! The custard was oh, so creamy. Delicious.

We had been here previously a couple of years past and not much has changed since then. The restaurant was absolutely packed whenever we got there with only a single table open that was being held by our reservation.  I really have not noticed much decor in this restaurant but I am not sure that much is needed since they have giant chalkboards on either side of the restaurant with the daily specials on them.

My fiance and I started off our meals by splitting the lettuce wraps appetizer.  It was good with a nice sauce and a decent amount of filling.  Then for dinner I decided to go with the duck breast that came with honied Brussels sprouts and also some pierogies as well as a side of Szchuan green beans. Whenever the duck came out I thought it looked good but after biting into  it I realized that it was missing something.  My other friend confirmed that it just wasn't that great of a duck dish.  The Brussels sprouts were almost non existent on the dish as well but the pierogies were good.  Sadly I think I chose poorly twice in a row here as my fiancés swordfish was awesome as well as my friends sausage pasta.  The green beans were pretty good though as they were cooked nicely and came with a dark sauce that was mildly spicy.  It's not the green beans you would get in a true Szchuan restaurant with prickly ash but was good nevertheless.

Ty80UJhANyaAyjHApu2DGA,7I4yjdnLRUgTr4HeDZPyBQ,5-C2YTzEfPkRCm_7MF057w,1,10,2,0,"This facility dramatizes the crisis in healthcare in this country in general, and spotlights the poor state of medical training in Southern Nevada. I wish a TV channel would do an undercover spot here, because only if the public were made aware of this office's practices would there be incentive for improvement.

I have seen two doctors there within 24 hours, one with a resident in tow. They appeared to be knowledgeable, but whatever medical knowledge they may possess is compromised by the patient scripts and protocols they are required by office rules to follow. It is difficult to imagine a better situation for misdiagnosis than one in which the patient interview is funneled into clipped responses for computer questionnaires while the stopwatch ticks. Both doctors were like racehorses, waiting to bolt at the gate. I suspect there must be some sort of internal reward system for seeing as many patients as possible within a given time frame, or finishing up before the next guy, or getting in and out of the room in under 10 minutes. 

Because of the pressure to dispense with patients as quickly as possible and the restricted script for the patient interview, I was prescribed a medication that I should never have been given. Blame on it on the tree-diagram. When the doctor-patient relationship is reduced to a rote exchange, a computer can--and possibly will--do it. I will never go back to this facility, and urge my fellow Nevadans to steer clear. What could have been a source of pride--a decent, even strong, medical school facility--is a model of corporate greed. Whatever medical expertise the staff might possess takes a back seat to the ""office rules"" which, in my case, didn't work.

I am grieving; I can't sleep. I went for help, since the melatonin wasn't working, my anxiety was rising, and I was feeling depressed. The doctor heard only ""can't sleep"" and we were off and running on a set of questions in his computer to determine which medication is the right one for me. When I was asked, ""Do you smoke?"" I said ""no,"" then added, thinking it might be relevant, ""in my 20s for a few years."" His response was, ""I don't need detail."" The questions kept coming. I was obedient, keeping my responses short. ""Did any relative die of a heart attack under the age of 55?"" 

I said my paternal aunt had died at 55 of a heart attack. Instead of asking about other heart issues in my family, apparently the tree diagram led to a pharmaceutical conclusion: a prescription for some God-awful sleep aid that made my heart race, my ears ring, and my throat dry out, leaving a bad taste in the my mouth for hours that I couldn't get rid of. The palpitations were so strong that I had pain in my chest and contemplated emergency room care, but rode it out at home. At 3 in the morning, I Googled the drug--it's not to be given to people with cardiac disease in their family, such as (in my case), three grandparents dead of heart attacks and two parents with heart issues. I had no time to give this information to the doctor who saw me; his patient questionnaire didn't have space for the detail, and the tree-diagram for question-and-response steered us out of the office. It would have taken time, and intuition, and interest, to delve into my family history.

I returned the next day, and I went through the same routine with another doctor and left with a different medication. Again the script for patient interview. Again the pressure to get in and out of the room as soon as possible. Two co-pays and one bad-drug episode later, I left with a grand total of 15 sleeping pills for one month (since I insisted I'm sensitive to medications, she insisted I take half) with no refills. I would sooner stay awake all night than go back to that place. 

I am still shocked by the lack of fellow feeling at this facility, a quality that is at the core of the doctor-patient relationship. What about kindness? Cheerfulness? What about the connection between the doctor and the patient that is the foundation for accuracy in diagnosis? Can that really be reduced to computer questionnaires? To tree-diagrams scripts for doctor-patient interaction? Just because I have a common problem--sleeplessness--do I need to be made to feel I'm wasting time? I feel for the residents at this place, because whatever impulse to service that steered them into the medical field in the first place is certainly being crushed. The full-time docs have already crossed over to the dark side.

I am ashamed for our city that our medical teaching facility is all about a very ugly bottom-line.",2014-05-17 05:55:57

AMBIANCE/SERVICE
Classy elegant feel with loud pop music playing. Sushi bar counter sits in the center of the restaurant, with tables around which are sectioned off. Cool layout but chairs at the sushi bar was extremely uncomfortable. Neat that they have a purse hook under the table. 

Courteous and attentive servers here. Attention to detail/knowledge of menu were on point. 

FOOD
Not much of a variety or selection in my opinion. If anything, I would stick to their yakitori. According to their description, Hachi uses a high quality Binchotan charcoal which release large quantities of infrared rays, therefore making the meat crispy on the outside and tender/juicy on the inside. 

Yakitori Bowl-It's really a mini yakitori bowl. I would say it is the same size as the mini chasyu bowl you can get over at Ramen Sora. Yakitori was super tender but had a very light flavor. 3/5

Pork with Negi Shio Sauce-pork belly was so juicy. I also liked the negi shio sauce. 4/5

Umeshiso Yaki-I know Ichiza has a pork skewer with umeshiso which is exactly like this. This one is chicken and I must say I liked the umeshiso skewer here better. Stronger ume flavor and more shiso leaves. 5/5

HOANoNlwXWWVvwbMl9mbyQ,WOXtbPwnwrFIt8f8E-UGNA,-FtngCwHCD2tRlH8jpj_Ag,2,0,1,0,"Stopped for lunch at 11 today (7/15).  Place was a bit busy being 25% discount for National Tattoo Day.  Probably the 4th time we (party of 2) have been in.  Day trippers from Lake Havasu City to Henderson for some shopping which we do often.

Went in and was told there would be about a 15 minute wait so we sat down.  About 10 minutes later another party of two walks in and they were told it would be about 20 minutes.  So the guy steps a little closer to the hostess and speaks softly to her and lo and behold they're walked around to the bar so as to make it look like their dining in the bar.  But wait, they circle the bar go into the dining area and are seated in a booth immediately.  WHAT!  So why did we, and a lot of other patient customers, have to wait so this a..... could be seated.   I guess they were special and we were chopped liver!

We got seated about 2 minutes after that and were greeted cheerfully and we ordered.  Breakfast dishes for both of us.  While time for the food to arrive was about normal but we both found our food only barely luke warm.  Not even a hint of being close to hot.  Dry potatoes, cold biscuit etcetera. 

So anyway, after the experience today we both commented that we didn't need to come back again opting to try and new restaurant. 

I suppose I gave then two stars due to past visits.  But in all honesty they were no more memorable  taste wise than today.",2017-07-16 00:09:23

The Widmere berry lime heffe was amazingly refreshing, paired with a warm soft pretzel dipped in cheese sauce and homemade ground mustard.  For lunch I had the buffalo bleu cheese burger, which included a slaw topping that was crispy and cold but complimented nicely with the hot charred burger underneath it.  I couldn't stop eating it, nor could I the tater tots!  My friend had the pickled jalapeno and candied bacon pineapple burger that was equally as good (the jalapenos are diced up too, so when you bite into them you don't get an overwhelming sensation of heat and jalapenos).  Seating is very casual, picnic style mixed with high tops and a bar, with hard plastic ""paper"" plates and Red Solo cups on top of turf grass under canopies that shield you from Vegas' hot summer days and misters and fans that help keep you cool.  There are a bunch of TVs to watch various sports shows, as well as table games and yard games should you be up for some friendly competition while overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  The only down side was the hostess.  She clearly wasn't thrilled about being there that day, and seemed to have lost her ability to smile.  But, hey, it was hot and muggy.  Maybe just an off day for her.  Who knows.  Def will do this again.",2017-08-05 19:35:38

Hmmmm....me thinks Toronto has very few options.  One of the things I miss about Van is it's OK sushi is phenomenal here.  I tried so much stuff I do not even know where to begin.   

The infamous California roll made famous by Tojo's in Van is a shadow of itself here.  Ever had a crunchy California roll? I swear it was a cucumber not an avocado and definitely not fresh crab.  The  chicken teriyaki was overcooked. I had to tear off the hard pieces from my mouth quite a few times.  The tempura and iceberg lettuce salad with the universal Japanese vinaigrette was exactly as it should be.

I did have a wonderful dish that makes me want to eat it again. The salmon pizza.  Wow! It melted in my mouth like butter. The crunch of the patty base of deep fried rice with a layer of mayo was a wonderful texture against the salmon.  I am so hungry now.

The drinks here are reasonably priced for the size - they are quite large! And not to mention mixed very well. They taste like kool-aid and, according to my husband, are quite dangerous on the intoxication meter as you can drink and drink as of there were no alcohol - until you stand up from your seat. 

Food: I personally love the jerk chicken pasta. The asparagus and mushrooms work very well with the spices of the chicken and the pasta sauce. The husband loves the chicken salad, and the burgers here are also very good. The portions are large, so a single entree is enough to share between 2 adults, which is nice.

For fast food it is good, but there are a million bars and restaurants that have better chicken fingers. 

I will say that the chicken itself was very moist, tender and juicy. They get credit (and the 3rd star) for that. Unfortunately the breading was very bland and tasteless and the sauce was only okay.

Be prepared, the ONLY thing this place sells is chicken fingers and a chicken sandwich made from chicken fingers. So if you are eating with someone who might want a burger or something else you will need to go elsewhere.

I was quite disappointed that they didn't appear to have a selection of sauces. I would have preferred a good BBQ sauce to their Canes Sauce, but considering the lack of options on their menu I guess their business plan is to tell people what to eat rather than let them decide what they want for themselves.

Again, not bad I guess for fast food, definitely better than the chicken strips at Burger King or Jack-in-the-Box (not that the bar there is set that high) but if you really want good chicken fingers you can do much better.",2010-08-03 23:20:11

I finally made it to Wurst last night for a friend's 29th bday (only 1 left for her) and I was so glad I didn't let laziness on a Friday night overtake the night out. Wurst was deadly. We arrived at 8:30pm and were taken to our seats quickly by a friendly hostess to join the others in the party. We had two tables at the back of what was a very cool restaurant. The giant tree, the lights, the awesome long bar, and nice tables - I liked the deco and I was surprised I did.

The waiter was decent, not withstanding that I got the beer wrong on the first order, then again on the second but alas, third time was a charm. He's lucky I like beer - any beer. The German beers was delicious (specifically the Ayinger Bräu Weisse), and the large menu of beer and serving sizes was something I appreciate. Special note to the massive BOOT of beer. HA! Also surprising to me was the food. It was outstanding and very German. This was my first Schnitzel and I was so impressed. I had the Jaeger Schnitzel which came with Spatzle (I don't even know what all of this stuff was until it was in front of me - so it was a new and exciting venture.). The schnitzel was served in a gravy of sorts with mushrooms and onions and was unbelievably delicious - I could have eaten 5 lbs if it wasn't for the ridic amounts of beer inside my stomach. Others had the Schnitzel Chop which was a HUGGGEEEE hunk of something with a bone and a jar of bitter/sour jam. Again, I don't even know what this food was, but it was great. The portions were massive. Don't bother with a starter as the mains will feed two people each and you will want space for beer. My first German food experience left me excited to try more and come back. After supper we went downstairs which was a contrast to the restaurant. I felt catapulted into a German basement that looked like an old hut in the woods with picnic tables, wooden beams and a million 24 years olds drinking more beer than they could handle it seemed. It was very busy by midnight, everyone was pretty liquored, but it was also pretty fun. The music was top 40 and the song choices were my favs (with a random 1980's hit thrown in - loves it). Giant boots were abound and a silly amount of beer is served here on a nightly basis. (A boot of beer is 35$).

This store has floors (vs. carpet @ Premium) and is a little more spacious (the racks are spaced out more) than the one at Premium Outlets. It's almost located at the corner of the indoor outlet mall, kitty corner from Burlington Brands (the corner). Lots of inventory (ie. career clothing for the classic-styled woman) including clearance racks towards the middle back end of the store (facing the store from the entrance). Like the other one, one section for Petite and another section for regular Misses.

Worth checking out if you are shopping at this outlet mall.",2011-01-06 20:59:31

We finally made it in to spend the gift certificate in February. The experience is very informative, and also very fun. We knew a little about whisky, but learned a lot more from JD, who was super personable and of course, extremely knowledgeable. After teaching us the tasting method and giving us some history, he figured out our ""flavor profile"" and selected 5 unique whiskys for both me and my husband to try. I love that we sampled stuff I had never heard of and even better that I actually LIKED them all! As a bonus, JD told us about how much each one would cost and where we could find it in town.
The whole thing took over 2 hours, and we really enjoyed ourselves...we were the only 2 guests on a Thursday evening, which made me more likely to ask questions!
I would recommend a tasting at The Whisky Attic to anybody who likes whisky or thinks they might like whisky or who wants to buy a unique gift for somebody. I guarantee you will try something new!
My only only only beef with the place is the cost. I totally get that a private tasting for 2 people would cost $150, but I wish there was a more affordable option. Maybe they could do large groups once a week or something at only $40 or 50 each? At a lower price point, I would definitely return.",2016-02-22 18:56:35

When we went on a Sunday morning, the line was long but was moving fast. We found when we got inside that there was a person helping navigate the line.

We got seats right in front of the shake maker on the counter. Forget the name of the guy working the machine but he was a show of fun. That was he job just to make shake and malt. He showed us his hands. They looked freezer burned. Really wanted to give him a pair of gloves. Watching him make all the flavor made the time go fast waiting for the food. It did come surprisingly fast with the full house. Put for some reason whenever your hungry your stomach likes to make it feel so much slower.

Our waitress was friendly and didn't seem rushed thou it was crazy busy. They had extra hands just to clear tables and fill waters. We all got the Scrambler. You can get bacon, sausage or ham in the eggs. There is potatoes under the eggs, topped with cheese and gravy with a side of toast. If you want you can ask to have the gravy on the side. Huge portions for everything. The gravy wasn't very rich in flavor and on the more runny side. I always end up eating my eggs with ketchup anyway. Pure comfort food right there! Shared a side of Hash and Buttermilk Pancakes. The Hash had an excellent smokey flavor. The pancakes were huge. Had great buttermilk flavor but on the denser side. But im just think that was because we had so much food and it all came at once that they just sat there densing up. Hopefully that was the case.

Overall my stomach hates me. My wallet loves me. Will be back to explore the menu. The Cinnamon Roll looked gooey divine.

I had CB Hash.  like everything at bouchon, it was perfectly respectable.  the CB was tender but lacked in tangy yumminess.  it also lacked in potatoes and crustiness. 

the one thing that was really off-putting on this trip was when we ordered a side of fries the server asked if we would care to make them truffle fries for a ""small upcharge""?  my bad for not asking how small.  I think the fries were $5 and the upcharge was an additional $13.  when questioned, the server removed the charge without hesitation but the experience made me feel like a cheap-ass and left me with a bad overall experience of the place.  just put the price on the menu if you're that proud of your truffle fries.",2014-12-30 06:50:24

We're from the south--so we love fried foods, and these pickle chips are almost as good as back home. I'm only giving this restaurant a 4/5 because of the price. A rotisserie chicken from the grocery store or Boston Market is a fraction of the price.

Very cool concept.  The food is your typical tasty udon with a couple of different broths and temperatures.  But Sanuki goes a little further with the inclusion of tempura and oden on the menu to make you full on Japan.  You take a tray, put your order in, and make your way to pay, passing by all the fried goodness on your way to your seat.  Prices are very fair with the typical udon at $6.45.  Many options both vegetarian and with fish.  Quality, home-cooked noodles with a nice soft broth, though a little fishy at times.  I find udon a little empty at times as the dish is 95% broth and noodle, but Sanuki filled me up and was tasty to the last sip.  Very cool new entity in China Town.

This place opened 4 months ago, according to Mihran, the owner. He explained that the tradition he is carrying on was started by his grandfather, although his grandfather's place was in Syria. He makes the jouns from scratch everyday, and there are limited quantities. As soon as those are sold out, that's it! Get there before that happens, people, cuz you don't want to miss out.

Decor is quaint. They have a counter where you can see all the various types of jouns for sale that day. Beside it there is a counter with all the salads and dips. At the register, they have preserves (blackberry, pumpkin, apricot, walnut) made in Armenia for sale. There's also some kind of music CD I did not investigate. Their salad option counter has a number of options (green olives, black olives, lettuce, pickles, hot peppers, pickled turnip, etc., and a bunch of the sauce options are made in house). 

Had:

Tahn ($2.50) - I hope I didn't switch the h and the n in the spelling...This drink is a salted yogurt drink. It's not for everyone. I shared it with other people who likened it to drinking sour cream or drinking white cheese. It's not milkshake thick, but it's thicker than milk. It goes well with the mamjoun, adding almost a cheeselike element to it.

Mamjoun (1 - $2.50, 6 - $7.50, 12 - $15) - We bought six. We had half spicy and half not spicy. Usually, this is not doable because he makes them in half dozens, but his numbers worked out yesterday so we were able to try both. The spicy is not particularly spicy. It's a tad spicier than pepperoni. This tastes like a spiced pizza sans cheese. The dough used as the base is delicious and crisp. The sauce is extremely flavorful (did I detect a hint of cumin?) There's ground meat on there as well. You definitely want more than one of these. Mihran told me they also freeze well, so I bought some to go. Those I shared with enjoyed them as well.

Ham and Cheese joun ($5.50) - I ordered this one for my dad. I was surprised how much I didn't mind eating it after trying it. I'm not into ham and cheese. I don't like the taste of ham. After adding lettuce, black olives and tahini, this one was surprisingly good. I prefer the mamjoun and the spinach and cheese joun, but this one gets a solid 3/5 from me (I was expecting a sad 1/5). After adding salad options, Mihran folded this joun like a wrap, then put it onto the panini press to crisp it up. Crispy it was. Good amount of filling too.

Spinach and cheese joun ($5.50) - We ate this one like a pizza. We did not add salad options and sauces and fold like a wrap. At $5.50, it's not particularly cheap, nor is it expensive, but it's delicious. There's lots of spinach and lots of cheese. I'm not sure which I liked more, the mamjoun or this. Both I'd eat again in a heartbeat.

I've been told it's very busy Saturdays and Sundays around lunch, but on a Friday night for dinner, it  was fairly quiet. It was lovely. There aren't many tables, and not much seating, but it's a really good (and I'm pretty sure fairly nutritious) grab and go food for cheap!

Final thoughts: This place makes fresh food and fast. There's nothing deep fried (to my knowledge) and although i like meat, I appreciate that there's a lot of veggies here and Mamajoun's makes eating my veggies easy! I hope Mamjoun's is at this location for years and years to come, because I think I might just end up becoming a regular here.",2015-03-15 03:38:51

If you have scratched up games at home you can bring them in and they will buff them for 2 to 3 dollars depending on how scratched they are. They can buff 2 games at a time. If a game you want to buy in the store is scratched they will buff it for free.     If you're into Legos then this place is definitely for you. They have a whole bunch of pieces and let you fill up a pretty big bag with whatever you want in it for $20. I ended up getting 4 games for just a little over $20. I will be coming back here.

(Really not sure if its family run, but they do well at giving off the vibe.) Good for dates, but I think slightly overpriced for the value.

What i've noticed is that their rolls are quite small. Which may not be a bad thing either. After you place your order, it takes maybe 10 minutes or so until the first dish comes. It isn't a long time for our order to arrive, but usually at AYCE places, your dishes come one by one so we are at least occupied. It's understandable for dishes from the grill to take longer, or even to make rolls. But for something as simple as ice cream, seaweed salad & garden salad, it still takes 10 minutes for them to arrive. 
Thats really my only complaint. Not much to expect from this place.. or any AYCE sushi really

Mediocre food and the service improved a bit.",2017-06-02 05:27:37

It was my first time having such a thing and I didn't EVEN KNOW such a thing existed!!! I have been living under a rock it seems but hellooooo Korean fried chicken! My friend recommended we eat here and that I try this place since it is one of the better places.

We ordered the garlic chicken and the green onion popcorn chicken and both tasted pretty decent. They were somewhat crispy and quite moist/juicy on the inside which was surprising as I guess I was expecting it to be drier because it was fried. That was definitely not the case. However, I did have an expectation that the popcorn chicken was similar to the Taiwanese salt and pepper popcorn chicken style but of course that wasn't the case. Thinking about it now, why did I think that when CLEARLY it's made by different people!! I mean Taiwanese vs. Korean...helloooo??? Anyway the food was not bad and came out in a timely manner. Although, for some reason it just wasn't comparable to western fried chicken like Popeyes for example. Ok, I KNOW it's KOREAN fried chicken and maybe I had high expectations but I really thought this may be a mind blowing wicked experience...did I expect too much people??? :T

It was busy when we got there but we still managed to get a table luckily. Busy can mean good right? Service was good too despite the number of tables they had to manage. Would I be back? Possibly...if I wanna try more Korean fried chicken but it really didn't give me that umph I was looking for.",2018-03-01 05:37:07

Service .5 - food - 1.5 - and that's only because there was an ice cream root beer shot for dessert .. lol. I mean .. from the start - I asked for a different table because we were squeezed into the corner and the hostess gave me the dirtiest look and said ""well what would you prefer then?"". Well what would I prefer then??? Wtf. I would prefer not being spoken to in a rude manner - by a 18 year old in heels, when we are trying to have a nice dinner at a semi pricey restaurant. 

The female server didn't even tell us anything about the menu- ""are you ready to order"" well.. no - we've been sitting here for about 4 minutes. I was looking for some inspiration and suggestion perhaps ...but - nothing. I asked about wine, and was greeted with a blank stare. I resorted to asking our neighboring tables how their meals were and what they suggested. We chose a few things hoping to get something great - but none of it really hit home or worked that well. Just uninspired and basic dishes. I'm not just trying to be a jerk - but it was pretty weak, and the despondent service made it so much worse. 

From that point on, we were repeatedly underwhelmed by the food and we were literally so hungry. Elote corn scallops? - Baja style fish tacos? - the most un flavorful Brussel sprouts ?? What is the direction of the menu meant to be? It was so all-over-the-place. 

We didn't finish one single dish and it was cleared away without question. We just had a couple of martinis and hoped dessert would save the meal. It was helpful- the root beer floats - but didn't make up for how weak the rest of everything else was. 

To make it worse - The server disappeared for nearly half an hour and eventually I had to get up and chase down a guy in a suit with an earpiece - just to get our check. Terrible. I know things happen - but c'mon. The place was packed and we could not get our check so we could just leave. 

This was a fail to say the least. The room was cool and the decor was fun. The 90's inspired music track was a cool vibe - but the service was absolutely terrible and the food was so basic. Seriously. 

No one will read this or care - and the kids that think this is good good will continue to support blandness because they have no idea what good is anymore. At around $100 a head - you would hope for, at least, very good. This was REALLY not  great. 

Let's hope you have a better experience.

We'd driven by a few times and decided it was time to finally stop in. I enjoyed the bicycle decor on the walls, menu, etc, as well as the creative names for each of the different types of burgers. The menu had quite a few vegetarian options as well as an extensive list of burgers. On Saturday nights they have buckets of beer (6 bottles) for $12, which I thought was a great deal. The drink specials were also quite good for the other days of the week...will have to go back to try them out.

In terms of food, everyone at my table (except me), got one of the burgers. Each person tried a different kind, and all were very pleased. I got the veggie sandwich with Kickstand's homemade artichoke spread, which was delicious. I also got the tater tots. Now, I'm a sucker for any restaurant that sells tots, and these did not disappoint. I also tried the sweet potato fries and they were pretty good.  We started the meal out with the veggie flatbread, and it was surprisingly good. So good, in fact, that I plan to order it as my main course the next time I visit. 

The service was great, although the TV in the booth was a bit overwhelming - especially if you've got four people crammed into the seats. The only real con I had was that parking was pretty tight. Once we found a spot, though, it was a great meal with a cool atmosphere.",2011-01-31 16:22:22

The place is way bigger than it looks and very different from what you'd assume if you were just looking at the part you can see from the street (the open kitchen with the outdoor barstools).   Inside, it's dark and dungeon-ish, but in a very attractive way.  The octopus sconces, iron and wood decor, and Mexican candles lend the place a really fun vibe.   

The food was amazing.  We ordered the queso and two special taco plates.   One of the specials was shrimp with a bunch of deliciousness including pistachios.  It was a great fresh combo and I definitely wish it was on the regular menu.  The other special was a cheesesteak taco.  This was not your average cheesesteak - tender strips of actual steak - not the processed pressed stuff you think of when you think cheesesteak.   Both specials were absolutely delicious!   Each plate came with two tacos, which was a pretty good portion for the price and quality.   

The queso appetizer was really the only thing I had a comment about.   The queso itself was awesome.   The soft tortillas it was served with were awesome.  The combo, though, was a little awkward.  Do you make a very cheesy burrito?  Try and dip/scoop with the soft tortilla?  We tried it a bunch of different ways; but in the end, we kind of just wanted some chips to scoop up all that rich and creamy queso.   

Service?  Also excellent.  Our server was prompt, attentive, and friendly.   As an added bonus, we asked where the restroom was on the way out.  He pointed us in the direction, but took the time to tell us that there was a big line and we'd be better to try the one in the attached Butcher and the Rye (see my review of that place for why there was no line there).

The short review:  THE BEST!

The long review (sorry its so long):

Three Michelin stars and the AAA Five Diamond award speak for themselves.

A meal at Joel Robuchon showcases the French passion for food, respect for ingredients, deftly practiced restraint, and the melding of cutting edge cooking techniques with the traditional.  The presentation is nothing short of breath taking yet everything on the plate has a purpose.  Ahhh like a beautiful yet sensible woman.

While the core of each dish may be the same, portion size and the way they are dressed varies depending on what menu you order them from (a la carte, pre fixe, or degustation).  Keep this in mind when trying to follow the recommendations of another.  

The current menu standout is the signature truffle langoustine ravioli.  A see through thin wrapping envelopes a core of sweet, moist , langoustine tails dressed by an incredible foam (not your typical brown butter sauce), and doused in a generous amount of shaved black truffles.  Sensuality on a plate.

The current 16 course ultimate degustation menu was nothing short of perfection.  Course after course of pure artistry and intriguing flavors.  How about a salad of haricot verts (green beans) with Parmesan and foie. So simple.  So delicious as the richness of the foie and the earthiness of the parm makes the vegetal flavors of the beans explode.  Too simple, how about the langoustine ravioli described earlier with grilled spiny lobster lightly accented by a curry served aside an aspic of uni with a fennel potato puree scented with anise.  The warmth of the ravioli and puree quickly soften the aspic releasing the creamy goodness of the uni throughout the dish.  Layer after layer of flavor.  Truly orgasmic.

The ambiance is contemporary European elegance.  Stunning. 

The price?  Prefix menus (2, 4, 6 courses); $120 - $240.  The ultimate degustation menu (16 courses) $425 in the fall of 2011. If it sounds crazy, consider there must be more chefs in the kitchen than guest in the dining room preparing your meal.

The outstanding wine list focuses on France.  Good vintage depth. Fair pricing considering the cellaring, however the average bottle price is $300.  There are few worthy selections below $100.

Service is perfect.  It is executed by professionals who view service as a career.  Practiced, polished,  extremely knowledgeable of menu and culinary techniques  They are experts at making you feel like a welcome guest.  No stuffiness. 

Finally, remember there are things even your casino host cannot do:  provide illicit drugs, arrange ""companionship"" for the evening, and get a same day reservation at Joel Robuchon.  Make you reservations well in advance.

Ahhh, the French really do have it right.",2011-11-16 15:41:54

Prohibition changes a lot.  Maybe too much, but maybe not.  I think they may have actually settled on their menu now, as it hasn't changed in a while and in the past it would have changed 3 times in the 3 months since Christmas.  Some of my favorite things are gone from the menu, there's something new that I like, the hashbrowns are different every time I eat them and they are carrying Delerium on draught right now. 

The things I miss from various old menus:
a) DUCK FAT FRIES. These were the greatest and used to come with a trio of sauces including a curried ketchup that I was in love with.  Zack S and I enjoyed them on a number of great nights at Prohibition... they were kind of our go-to snack food for the east side.  I sort of understand why the fries had to change - it's expensive to use duck fat and it's not vegetarian friendly (and their new fries ARE very good) but I wish the curried ketchup was still on the menu.
b) There was a chicken wrap that was kind of like a very chunky chicken salad.  It used to be my lunchtime go-to item.  

The things I like on the new menu:
a) Buckingham Blanket.  This is a yorkie flatbread wrapped around roast beef and arugula with wasabi mayo and jus for dipping.  This is either amazing or terrible on a given day.  If you have it later in the night the beef is less rare and the jus is reheated and thick.  If you have it earlier in the day it's usually better.  This is a great sandwich and a good addition to the menu.
b) Chicken Fried Ribs.  Another good new item.

The staff:
The guy who works the bar is awesome.  He brought me a beer before I even ordered it the other day.  He is friendly, composed when it's busy and has great beer picks when I say surprise me.

The cook is a jerk. I won't go into details, but don't try to talk to him (even if he talks to you, because he will just walk away in the middle of your conversation.)  Anyways - if you are reading this, what I was going to tell you before you rudely walked away from me was that the 'final iteration' of the hashbrowns were really nicely seasoned and I applaud the use of the potato ricer but I wish there was a crispy outer layer.  But whatever, you obviously don't care what the customers think because you're back there making art or some bullshit.

The manager is always there and drinking at the bar and he's hilarious and has great hair.  He is always surrounded by cougars and I am slightly in awe of his magnetism.

There is also am amazing girl who works here that once yelled at a vagrant who was passing by through the garage door style window.  ""Be on you way Sir!"" she hollered.

Overall, Prohibition hangs onto it's 4 star rating.  It's a trustworthy food source in my neighbourhood, I love the ambiance and they have good taps.  Bonus points for the speakers corner video booth in the basement that has never worked once when I have been there.",2010-02-15 21:22:51

---  Location:  Good.  I'm a downtown guy, the Plaza is at the end of Fremont Street.

---  Room:  Marginal.  The room was dated and smelled like Lemon Pledge and ass.  The carpet in the bathroom had big stains in it.  I didn't spend much time in the room, so it wasn't a big deal.

---  Staff:  Good.  Most of the staff was very friendly and helpful.

---  Clientele:  NOT GOOD.  The clientele at the Plaza is sketchy, even by downtown casino standards.  Through no fault of its own, the Plaza is the closest casino to the Greyhound station.  It shows.  Working as security at the Plaza must suck almost as bad as working at a piano bar.

---  Food:  Didn't eat anywhere - nothing looked very good.

---  Entertainment:  Meh.  They have ""The Rat Pack.""  I'd rather be hit by a train than sit through that.  They did have a free show with some low rent Temptations imitators that was actually not so bad.  

Overall, I've gotta go with two stars.  Top-to-bottom rating of downtown casinos where I've stayed:
(1)  Golden Nugget
..........Small dropoff......
(2)  El Cortez
(3)  Main Street Station
...........Big dropoff.........

The Pad see ew uses large egg noodles. Very soft. More sou sauce based unlike the pad thai. But very delicious. They offer choices between regular broccoli or the chinese broccoli for the dish. 

Asparagus and beef stir fry. It was seasoned perfectly. Not too salty, asparagus had a crisp to each bite and not overly cooked. 

Bbq ribs. Gives you 3 large ribs marinated with a soy sauce asian bbq sauce. It was great as well. It came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and fried rice with it as well. The meat was very tender, and came right off the bones.

We made reservation ahead of time for the Super Bowl party to get there and have the hostess tried to sit us at the bar and said we made reservation for bar seating. Who reserve a bar seat? After correcting her that our reservation was for table she quickly took us to a table. If you have tables and your customers made reservations for a table why trying to sit them at a bar?!? What kind of business practice is that? 

Our table was in the back room and they had 2 small TVs, if I had to guess I'd say they were 30 inch TVs. 2 for about 100 people! SPORTS FANS, DO NOT GO HERE FOR A BIG GAME EVENT! The set up is for very very very casual sports fan, that wants to just hear the game and not see it. 

They need to have more TVs or bigger TVs, especially for a big game like the Super Bowl. 

The food was not good but the wait staff was pretty nice.  We were a party of 2 and they charge automatic 20% gratuity.  I would like the option to give how much I want since it was only for 2 people and not a large party of 5 or more.

As mentioned in other reviews these folks really pride themselves on the entertainment factor with the dancing and singing etc so if you're looking for a unique experience I'd really suggest it because lots of people were having fun. 

However it did seem to take away from the service delivery on the dining side:

We were seated by the Door was which was open on a chilly evening. We asked for the door to be closed or for us to be moved. We were told that the door couldn't be closed (?) but when they realized that they had reservations which prohibited from us being moved they finally closed the door. However at the end of the meal they opened the door again. We were close to the end of the meal so we didn't push the issue but the draft was pretty annoying.

Food comes out as its prepared. Bussers are  very quick to bus your table but they'd take EVERYTHING away so we'd have to ask for additional plates and silverware on a couple of occasions.

We ordered the Brussel sprouts which never arrived. When we asked at the end of the meal to make sure we weren't charged the server said they were still being cooked (over an hour at this point). We paid our bill and the server said the food was still coming even though we weren't being charged. We finished our drinks but after another 15 minutes we were done and still no Brussel sprouts so we left. Not that we were still hungry but still... 

They push Sake bombs pretty hard at this place. I'm no prude by any means and have had more than a few in my day so when the emcee came over to introduce herself and starred pushing them I said we would buy a round if she joined us. She said that sounded awesome and would join us so I bought a round for the table and her. However when the shots came she made up an excuse as to why she couldn't take the shot. No big deal but because of the hard sell we felt like there was a bit of a bait and switch.

I checked in for a king size bed and I was placed at the very end of the hall, a very long hall, on the second floor, with neon lights flashing through the windows at night and a terrible view. I thought... Usually rooms at the end of hall have nice views yet when I got there... Yeah... Nope... Pretty bad! I ended up just closing the curtains at night.
The hotel has potential as it is very pretty and the grounds around the hotel are beautiful. The rooms are nice... In my opinion a little bit outdated compared to other hotels, especially the newer ones on the strip, yet at least the bed is comfortable. There is a minibar in your hotel room, although quite expensive. There is room service available. The size of the room is good with a very nice bathroom, and the walk to the casino is roughly 3 to 5 minutes. 
Getting around this hotel to either the parking lot or another section takes little time to learn and can be confusing, yet there are signs for where to go, only they are plastered onto the wall and not obvious unless you really look for them as they are very high up close to the ceiling.
If you are staying in this hotel, make sure to let check in know if you want to be close to the elevator or have a good view. I think it is important because although the inside of the room was OK for me, it was very far away from where elevator was, for going to the casino and the garage where I parked, and the view was pathetic.",2017-06-03 16:45:21

The Fry is a major contender, and Ajuker Chicken is also in the area. Then there's Mom's Chicken at Gallery (Yonge/Steeles). 

What makes Home of Hot Taste worth your time? 

1) Selection: They have the widest selection of Korean Chicken. You can get basic fried chicken, sauce chicken, onion chicken etc, or you can go for the insanely hot Teary Hot Chicken. They also have chewy noodles with chicken. They even have seafood. If you want spicy chicken, this is THE place to go. 

2) Spiciness: A lot of Korean restaurants seem to dumb down the spiciness to suit foreigner tastes. This place is one of the few places that seems to serve up authentic flavors with their special pepper sauces. Of course, if you can't handle spicy food, there are plenty of non-spicy options for you.

3) Price: KFC is not the cheapest thing there is in Korean food. But it's far from expensive. If you come here, you'll always need at least 2 people (unless you've been stranded on an island for 3 days and haven't eaten). One portion is going to be $17+ tax and it's good for 2 people. This price point is on par with the other places.

Greek Salad (""romaine lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, bell pepper, black olives, feta cheese & Greek dressing""): I wasn't expecting much from a Greek Salad, but this was definitely one of the better versions of the venerable dish I've had of late. The various, plentiful veggies were all chopped up and presented perfectly, while the tasty dressing proved an ideal complement to the whole thing. The generous sprinkling of feta cheese didn't hurt, either.

The Full Monty (""black bean & corn salsa, lettuce, tomato, grilled chicken, jalapeno, guacamole, chipotle aioli & havarti cheese""): McSorley's has a bunch of wraps on their extensive menu, but this one stood out to me for obvious reasons (ie anything Mexican is automatically going to catch my eye). And indeed, it's delicious. It might be a little messy but the solid assortment of ingredients and pronounced bold flavors ensure that every bite is delicious. I really enjoyed this.

Our bill was $180 with tip and all three of us left Mesa Grill completely dissatisfied and we all agreed that we would not return. What made it even more dissatisfying was the impersonal staff.

The service was friendly and relatively quick given that the resto was packed with hungry patrons.  The smell of BBQ permeating the humid summer air that day.

Hogtown Poutine

Smoked Brisket Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries

It is always busy, but the staff always does a good job with drinks and turning tables to handle a mounting crowd. The advantage of not having the sushi made to order is you can get in and out with a sizable crowd in a decent amount of time. Also it allows you to try a lot of different sushi pieces. I will say that it is difficult at times to know what you are eating as nothing is labeled. Also many of the rolls tend to be simple or are deep fried.

Happy hour is 4-6 PM Monday through Friday, and there are lots of drinks but it looked like only 5 or so choices for apps.  Well, our bartender Melissa hooked it up with more than that and even though there were only 5 of us, she furnished a second round of our faves and almost ordered a third round...of FOOD...and we had to turn her down!

To drink I had the bahamarita, with strawberry, kiwi and mango slush and margarita on top with a side shot of cactus schnapps...interesting and almost like alcoholic jamba juice.  I tried a variety of apps (beef patties which were really empanadas with creole seasoning, coconut shrimp, spinach dip, chicken wings, and chicken sliders) and they also brought out cheeseburger sliders, chorizo sliders, and pulled pork sliders, none of which I tried.

My conclusion is this: 
1) a good deal for a free meal,
2) the empanadas, shrimp, and wings were good, the dip not so much, and
3) THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG: the chicken sliders tasted like MINI CHICK-FIL-A sandwiches!
I hardly ever eat fried food but I had 4 of these, 2 each round.  Hearty juicy fried white meat chicken, 2 pickle slices, and a tasty bun (that probably has less butter than CFA, a good thing!)

I might die tomorrow but I have to say that after being away from Chick-Fil-A for quite some time, Bahama Breeze solves that craving.  Now if only I can find good waffle fries ever since Caribbean Cooker went out of business.

Moral of this story: Go to Bahama Breeze between 4 and 6, order 1 happy hour priced chicken sliders app and 1 drink for $3 and you will thank me later.  and get Melissa as your bartender, she rocks!",2012-03-23 04:46:17
_wEarH901xUm4rYxDW8omw,oaYB_b62fqtJCbeKFWg8Sg,PjlodjmfABi5dW-iek2P-w,2,8,4,0,"I was a long-time Calgary Transit user.  Those were some of the worst years of my life.  As a university student I spent upwards of three hours a day commuting twelve kilometers (each way) to my assigned work-study placement: waiting in the freezing snow and rain for buses that never arrived, wasting hours upon hours on slow-moving buses that stop at every corner, standing on unheated C-Train platforms waiting for dirty trains... using transit actually took an emotional toll.  As a young working professional I commuted by transit for a year while saving money for a car: sometimes the only bus to the neighbourhood where I worked wouldn't show up, sometimes it ran late while the driver ran into a fast food place to grab a coffee, and sometimes I watched drivers treat the young people who rode my bus with total disrespect.  

I think that routes are poorly laid out, schedules are stupid (I live across the street from a junior high- why does the bus come two minutes before the school bell?), vehicles are in need of upgrades and all staff require extensive customer service training.  I moved out at eighteen and relied on transit until I was twenty-four.  During that time I lived in cities all over the world where transit was run efficiently, effectively and affordably.  If Mexico City can do it, why can't Calgary?  Heck, if Tiraspol(!) can do it, why can't Calgary?

I would like to end this review with an anecdote.  This will probably reveal my identity to Calgary Transit, but I really don't care.  Two years ago, mere weeks before I finally gave in and bought a car, I was taking a bus home from work in the mid-afternoon.  The bus driver had a medical emergency which resulted in the bus veering slightly off the road, the bus coming to a stop off to the side of the road, and the bus driver laying down on the floor of the bus, unable to move.  A fellow passenger called 911, and the driver asked me to get their cell phone from their jacket pocket and hit redial.  I spoke to a family member on the other end and said there had been a medical emergency.  The bus driver then gave me a phone number to call, which turned out to be something like a driver dispatch service (I'm not totally sure- it was an internal Calgary Transit number).  I told the person who answered that I was on bus #XYZ, that the driver had a medical emergency, the bus was off the road and an ambulance was on the way.  I was clear and concise.  The person on the other end of the phone was accusatory (""How did you get this number?  Hmmmm?"") and did not provide any suggestions or reassurances.  An ambulance showed up and I was asked by the EMTs to wait until they had administered some treatment; at that point in time the next bus came and the EMTs said I was free to go.  That was a Thursday.  The next Tuesday I took the same bus... and found the same driver operating the vehicle.  The one who had been laying, seemingly paralyzed, on the floor of the bus only days earlier.  You tell me if that's a bus you want to ride.",2011-02-05 04:16:42

If I subject him to dainty lady food, that means I sometimes have to concede to his lust for greasy carnage. We heard about half-price Tuesdays at Duff's (thanks Yelp!) and decided to give it a try.

First, the wings aren't half price any more. They're 10 for $6.75 (reg. $9.75). No bigs, still a bargain. Everyone else seemed to think so as the line was out the door on a rainy Tuesday night.

I chose mild medium because the signs on the wall say that ""Medium is HOT."" Mild medium wasn't hot at all and I was kind of wishing that I got medium. The S.O. got medium hot and when I tried one, it wasn't that much hotter but it was way tangier--in a Tabasco-ey kind of way. The wings were plump and made to order instead of pre-cooked and then sauced like I've seen at other places. (*cough, cough Gabby's*.)

What I really loved was the celery at Duff's. Now I know what you're thinking; Who the hell goes to a wings joint and reviews the celery? Well, I happen to like celery. A lot. The stalks were so fresh and crunchy at Duff's instead of dry and limp like I usually see them. I'm referring to the celery here. FOCUS!

I know blue cheese is the classic accompaniment but the creamy dill dip at Duff's tastes much better. Especially with that glorious celery. (All right, all right. I'll shut up about the celery now.)

Overall, OK but I probably wouldn't go back there on a Tuesday night because it's too crowded and noisy, and it's hard to get the server's attention. The Jay's game was on, so the place had a sports bar feel to it. And after eating only 8 out of my 10 wings, like Richard S. said, ""my digestive track is none to pleased with my behavior.""",2009-07-23 02:17:59

I knew I was in for a treat after just a few bites (or OK...a few pieces) of their amazing bread.

The chilean seabass was pretty incredible as well.  I didn't save nearly enough room for the ginormous baked alaska dessert, which may have been just for me, but was clearly big enough for my party of six.

At entering the exhibition hall, you'll be first greeted and awed by a TOWERING, COMPLETE skeleton of a mammoth, along with another complete skeleton of an ancient sleuth nearby! You'll definitely learn about various types of interesting animals, minerals, rocks and plants in our deserts and mountains; how our desert and mountain ranges rose from the sea; how the State of Nevada and the city of Las Vegas came about; how the original Indian tribes and immigrants from Asia and Europe had lived and helped shape the State of Nevada...!

This wonderful, small museum is housed in a huge, gorgeous building. There is an exhibition hall for permanent displays; another smaller one for temporary exhibits; and an additional hall for special events. There is a charming attrium reception area, with large picture windows framing the landscape; a pretty good size gift shop, a research library, and a small observation deck overlooking the Springs Preserve Complex against the Las Vegas Skyline! The museum exhibition hall itself is not overwhelmingly large; all displays are luxuriously constructed and quite cleverly arranged for continuity and easy access; rich with contents and very eye pleasing! It is wheelchair/stroller-friendly. The staff is very friendly and helpful with brochures, explanations and recommendations.

- This place is great, but I think it'd be nice to have a few benches placed in the long hallway for the needy.

Again: - Be sure to enjoy yourselves in the ""Spring Preserve"", too, at NO EXTRA COST!

This is in reference to the Spa My Blend at the Ritz.  It is by far the best spa experience I have ever had in Toronto.

Firstly, the people who work there are so nice.  The whole experience was filled with politeness but not only that, also FRIENDLINESS, which can be hard to come by at a more upscale hotel/spa.  The staff were very personable, from the people at the front desk to my massage therapist.

Everything is neat and tidy, there are infused water stations located throughout and the spa itself is quite big.  There is a quiet women's relaxation room and a mixed gender relation room.  They provide snacks such as dried fruit, apples and almonds.  They also have a great selection of teas.  The robes are extremely comfortable: terry lined but linen on top, they are lightweight and fitted.

I did not venture to the salt water pool.  We went to the spa jacuzzi, and the sauna.  Both of them were lovely.  The sauna is large, warm and inviting.  We then waited for our treatments in the relaxation room for women, where there are beds with blankets and reading material, along with the snacks and tea mentioned above.  You can also order lunch from a spa menu.

I had a 1.5 hour massage and it was AMAZING.  You start with your feet wrapped in a hot, lavender towel.  They also put one on your neck AND they put a hot lavender compress on your back.  The massage therapist had excellent technique and I left feeling very loose.  The part I loved most was the lavender infused eye pillow they give you.  Additionally, at the end of your massage they lift the bed up so you are sitting upright, which is the most wonderful touch.  It is always hard to get up after a massage of that length, but with the assistance in elevation it was easy.  The massage therapist also gave me advice on stretches I could do to ease my tightness in the future.

Afterwards, I had a nice shower (their showers are HUGE and rain-style and just far too awesome).  The products are great.  The staff are great.  The facilities are great.  I will definitely be back!",2012-06-23 18:43:07

The restaurant has two menus to choose dishes from, a Malaysian menu and a Japanese menu. 

Malaysian food= my favorites are: roti chanai (appetizer), prawn mee, chow kueh teow, laksa noodles, and the BEEF RENDANG. I've also tried the following which are also very good: Tom yum seafood clay pot, curry chicken noodles, and the hokkien mee. 

Japanese food=  appetizers: curry croquette (my fav!!), agedashi tofu, and Maguro tataki (very yummy!). sushi rolls: rainbow, green dragon, tempura, giant spider rolls, lobster tempura roll ...basically I love most of their rolls, especially the ones with eel. They have the classic rolls of course, like spicy tuna etc., but the ones listed are my favorites. The fish is pretty fresh, so I'm rarely disappointed.

Initially, some people had told me that they disliked the food at Pacific East, which made me a little nervous about trying the place out.

After walking over a mile from the Thomas and Mack to that shameful, bakery-less Vons on Trop. and then to my car parked at Freakin' Frog, I said let's get on down the road. He wanted to try out Albertson's but they didn't have a large enough cake. 

At 5 seconds to 10 PM, we ran into Red Ribbon and they told us they were closed. We ignored that and told them we needed to buy a cake. Wesley quickly picked out a chocolate cake, they wrote on it for us, and we each purchased some purple yam pastries. I got some sort of cake, he got a sweet roll. Now Wesley is totally not into any ethnic food, so he wasn't too pleased with the pastry and gave the leftovers to me - each item was just okay, not as good as the homemade stuff that I've had.

The fella and I had been to the former location a couple of times, but the atmosphere always put me off since it was basically in a weirdo business office. The new location is in a quaint old building in downtown Pineville, and we loved it.

We got there around 5:30 on a Saturday to have a drink at the bar, and the bartender (Hannah) was so nice and friendly. We were the only ones in the place, but still. We started with martinis and and the pork belly appetizer, which was good, but not the best I'd ever had. It wasn't as fatty as most, which took a little bit of the flavor away.

We had official reservations through Yelp, and we asked to be seated upstairs once we checked in. Three tables upstairs are at windows that overlook Main Street, which was a really nice view. We each got a glass of wine; I got the duck, and the fella got the pork cheeks. We decided my dish won by a smidgen (I didn't love the acidity of the tomato with his pork, but he did), but it was close. We really liked the onion spread with the complimentary bread, too.

Unfortunately, our waitress was really sweet, but almost painfully shy and timid, so the service was a little tricky, and we wound up doing most of the talking when she'd appear at the table. The fella ordered a glass of wine that never came, so we finally called the waitress over to cancel it. She didn't apologize, but I think it was because she was so socially awkward. Bless her heart.

After dinner, we went back down to the bar for dessert and drinks, and the place was pretty full by then - I got the Nougat Glaçé, which was good but didn't quite hit the dessert spot since it was so incredibly light, and the fella got the ""Fly Me to the Moon"" Grand Marnier sampler. I helped him drink a little, and it was pretty tasty.

Even though it's ""fine dining,"" the dress is casual, which I appreciated. Overall, I'm so glad Global moved to downtown Pineville. This ambiance suits their cuisine much better, and I'm excited to try them again.",2016-08-21 01:03:31

Usually, the fried chicken, if available, is the top attraction, due to its crispyness and moist meat. On this day, which was a Monday afternoon, I had rotiserre chicken breast which was the best offering. Nothing else actually looked or tasted good. Mole chicken sounded great and on my initial walkthrough, that is why I purchased the buffet. Too bad, that this mole had no relation to real Mexican mole and the entire dish was too dryed out. Stffed cabbage was a horror show and the taco meat section was one giant pool of grease. Mongolian BBQ was also tried, but they don't put any sauce on it when they cook it, so it tastes just like, well nothing. The Chile Relleno was possibly the worst looking thing ever and didn't taste much better either. Deserts needed some work as well, but the butter pecan custard (they said it was) was decent, although could have been the culprit also to my later problems. You know what bothered me also was that there is a Guy cooking back there and anytimne anybody spills something (like some corn, etc) he is all over it, taking his nasty over the shoulder towel and dabbing it up. I'm all for a clean buffet, but find something else to do for a few minutes besides clean up every piece of corn that falls out of a laddling spoon. Maybe think of a better recipe to have us eat. Call ahead and if the fried  chicken is available for dinner, it is worth the $8.99 itself with a few side dishes that are usually better than this lunch, which would include potatoes.

One of the best burgers I've ever had, without a doubt.  And sweet potato tots on the side, that's right, sweet potato.  I would give it a 5 on Saturday.

Today, not as good.  We pretty much got ignored most of the time we were there.  And they weren't that busy, not sure what the waitresses were doing, as I hardly ever saw them.

1) hot and sour soup was BLAND. Literally tasted like chicken broth. No flavor at all.

2) I ordered a lunch special which comes with an egg roll. Did not receive the egg roll.

3) asked if there was sweet and sour sauce in my bag (for the egg roll that didn't exist) and was told it would be $.50 extra! Really? $.50 for something every restaurant serves with their egg rolls? Umm no.

4) ordered the Mongolian beef extra spicy, it was milder than I'd ever had it there before when I ordered it regular.

5) Mongolian beef was 75% onion, 5% mushroom, 20% beef. I ordered Mongolian BEEF, not Mongolian onion.

6) as I was getting my bag from the counter I noticed a large bucket (like the orange home depot ones) sitting on the floor with a large wooden spoon in it, no lid, and full of red sauce (I'm assuming it was sweet and sour). Not a clean way to keep food. So turns out it was good I didn't get the sweet and sour sauce after all.

I never finish my wings and sadly have to leave them behind. 

Also, ranch or blue cheese doesn't come with wings (insert laughing emoji) you have to pay $1 for it.. And its the super tiny cups -_-

 The good thing is both regular and boneless wings are part of the deal. 

One other issue i've been having is the pop tastes blaaahhh. I usually avoid pop but you have to buy a drink to get the wing deal and they dont offer unsweetened tea so i go with pop. Please clean your pop hose. :\",2015-09-22 13:57:08

Not the greatest idea. Actually, I blame it on my sister, who said it was great, so I believed her (thanks sister, pfft).

Both of my friends felt the server was extremely awkward and didn't attend to us well. I just think he's new at serving, so I cut him a break. Ok, so maybe he didn't make eye contact and seemed to hate the fact that there was a higher male to female ratio at the table but still...maybe he's just really new.

The smoked salmon was WAY too salty, the eggs were fine, but the sauce and the egg combined were so wet and saucy that after 4 bites and a bit of talking, the bread underneath was so soggy, it was gross. You should be able to recognize your food after a few bites, this thing was suc a mess, that it had contorted into mush, that smelled like fish. Dramatic sounding, but true.

Another friend had the vegetarian omelet and said it was quite bland. The other had the meatatarian something or other and said it was ok. All in all my bill came to $20 for my breakfast and a coffee, which I thought was way too much, especially since it was so unsatisfying I stopped eating it halfway through. I ended up going to Beano after and getting a bran muffin to sustain me through the morning.

They have a small but solid selection of chips. They also had a nice set of fountain drink choices.

There's not a lot you can do with presentation for a taco, especially from a food truck but Maki Taco does the best with it.  The tacos were very appealing with mixed greens covering the crab mixture in a crunchy taco.  Most food trucks do the soft tacos these days so it was nice to see the crunchy shell. 

The flavor was fantastic.  The crab mixture was creamy and coupled with the mixed greens and avacodo it had a wonderful flavor.   The spice came from sriracha sauce and there was just enough to give these tacos a nice kick.  It certainly went well with the beer from Triple C.

We were his only table and right when we were seated he came up to us, this is cool, then he asked for our drink order I had just picked up the drink menu and before I could look at it he wanted my order I asked for a frozen mararita and that is a no go, so then I say let me look at the drink list and he tells me he will be back he is going to get my dates drink and take my order when he brings hers. Um, FU Man, well i thought this was rude. He could have made a seggestion or even took a min he had no other tables. Whatever i delt with it. Then he comes back I give him my drink order and he askes if we wanted an app. We asked him to give us a min and come back and he says ok well how about some chips and guac to munch on while you look at the menu. Sure we say and as he walks away Iook at the menu and the chips are $9. Chips and guac, for $9 I could get three mini tostadas with chicken. Ah I will pass on the $9 chips. This guy was not helpful with the menu and I hate it when you ask what is good or what is your favorite or mabey the most ordered dish and all they say is everything is good not sure what the best is. This guy blows and he should not be a server, at all. Not friendly and just a frekin douce bag! He did not care about nothing this guy. I almost asked for another waiter cause he just seemed to be trying to rush us. Well because of how he was we decided to not get an app and just get dinner. 

Well we ordered the Steak Fajitas and the Pollo Relleno. The steak was so good and tender, it melted in my mouth. Peppers and onions were delicious and they have the best rice and beans.  The flower tortillas were heated on the flat top and crisped up and chared a little, yum. The Pollo Relleno is the house signature dish! chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onion, corn and goat cheese finished with poblano cream sauce. paired with guajillo mashed potatoes, and vegetables. I will be back for this for sure. Its so good. The mash were a little dry but good flavor. The chicken was moist and had tons of flavor. I was hoping it was going to be a little bit spicy but it really did not matter cause the flavor was there. So many good things on the menu and I will be back for sure. I absolutly will refuse having that server again. This place is great, awsome little patio and the inside is nice to. No booths but nice and clean look inside with art hanging next to every table. My opinion its way better than Barrio, cause there the only thing I liked was the pork, and I tried 4 different dishes there, plus I felt like I was eating in a alley or something. So for now I will give this place 3 stars, -1 cause of the service, but I will be back to do a follow up. On the way out the owner stopped me and asked me how everything was. He stood outside and talked to me for about five min. I told him I loved the food and will be bringing the folks back to try. Also told him we were very unhappy with the waiter and he said he agreed with it sound like he was rushing us and not very informative. He said if there is ever a problem like that again to ask for him and he will take care of us.",2010-02-14 23:38:02

The service for a planned banquet was awful! My sister had to go head to head with the manager. We were waiting for tables upto 25 minutes and even then the tables were not grouped together.

Because this week I went back for a friend' birthday dinner party and I almost choked on the level of crap I witnessed at this restaurant. Things have changed.
THE GOOD

As an entrée I combo-ed two of them after I saw the same dish fly by to another table and the waiter was kind of forced to comply with my request. I had the Sliders which they call the Burger Flight and with Charlevoix Poutine with braised pork, Migneron cheese. I must admit that the sliders were awesome with the little tangy mayonnaise, cherry-tomatoes and perfectly tasting meat. And the poutine was very good as usual. The service was still very friendly and casual. The Good ends there.
THE BAD

Anyone who knows me, knows I live for steak. If you wrap it up with bacon its even better, if you slather it with Foie Gras sauce, I have a complete mental collapse from the goddness. This is what they offered.

In my previous review I raved about their Foie Gras sauce but the restaurateurs went and changed it to save of food-cost most likely and cut it down with pepper sauce. It completely changed the sauce and ruined it making the appeal of the main fly away like a bird.

Next up was what I dunk in my sauce, the steak. I love eating meat, show me a way I've never eaten before and I'll try it. But the good ol' standards stick with me and a tasty steak tops the list. I've had steak all over North America. There's only one way to eat steak and properly enjoy its flavour, its texture, its juices and that's RARE. You can eat Flank Steak and if it's properly prepared it'll be tender despite being the toughest but yet most flavourful cut of meat.

I ordered a NY strip rare and what I got was a piece of rubber I could hardly cut through without having the steak slip and sliding all over my plate. Chewwing? That was impossible. I wanted to install a mandibular grinder to pre-grind my meat for me. So impossibly chewy steak with disgustingly peppery Foie Gras sauce. But WAIT, it's gets better?
THE UGLY

I of course called up the waiter to complained about the rubber boot on my plate and this is where it gets sad and yet funny. The waiter goes and talks with the manager about the situation and comes back to tell me that it's normal for rare steak to be chewy. WHAT THE FUCK? WHEN DID THIS WARP IN THE UNIVERSE HAPPEN? Talk about crappy client service, piss poor knowledge of meat preparation and total lack of respect. In most restaurants where I pay 40$ for a piece of crap meat, the manager has the decency to come over to my table and talk to me personally and makes a deal. This time no deal other than to re-fire my steak, which duh, would have given me a medium steak and a steak that has already cooled down after cooking cannot be re-heated. Go ahead and try it, it's horrible because it boils the meat.

Someone else at my table ordered the Pan-Seared Foie Gras at 13$ a pop. This was the biggest joke of the night. It was barely a quarter of a liver and it was burnt to a crisp. I wanted to scream bloody murder. If it weren't for the fact that it was my friend's birthday party I would have exploded.

This is obviously a case of retards with no experience who have no place opening a restaurant who decided to open the next trendy go-to hot spot. All form and no function. It looks cool, it's pretty, it's trendy but the food is horrible. Méchant Bœuf can sling some tasty burgers but that's where they peak.",2009-01-18 17:57:37

My favorite breakfast is a sausage, egg, and cheese on a croissant, so any bad morning I'm having can be turned around by Two Lou's in a snap.

It's always a hard choice between their classic sandwich menu and their salads for lunch, but you can't go wrong either way. My favorite is probably their grilled chicken salad with mixed greens. Their raspberry dressing is to die for. One of my friends loved the dressing so much that she bought a gallon of it! Some of my coworkers are fans of their stuffed pepper soup on Wednesdays and their buffalo chicken wraps on Thursdays. I've never heard a complaint, except about their prices. They've been increased since I first started frequenting Two Lou's, and sometimes it can get a bit expensive.

It's a simple setup inside, with the food counter on the right side, snacks and basic grocery items, and some cold drinks. Two Lou's is a take-out only restaurant, but one of my favorite unique touches is the brown bag and small piece of candy they package your lunch with. It gives it a real ""mom and pops"" feel, and not to mention who doesn't love a snickers bar? Two Lou's is great when you need a quick bite to eat and you want that home-cooked feel.

I went to this place four different times, trying beer and coffee and snacks. I'll try to keep this short:

Pros:
-Cool aesthetic 
-Cool concept

Cons:
-Service. Consistently poor here. It's odd. There is no sense of urgency from any employee, and while I like the laid back style, at some point it shouldn't take 10 minutes for an iced coffee to be prepared, with no line ahead of you. On each and every visit, it was just a shit-show of service. On two occasions, and owner was sitting at the bar, either talking to friends, or another time a vendor. As the line grew from one customer, to four, finally the owner got up and started helping his employee, who was clearly in the weeds. Listen, I get that you have to order stuff, and take care of the business side, but if you ignore the paying customers who are right there- then soon you won't have a need for vendors. I say that with all due respect, and I hope the advice is heeded.

-Products, so the iced vanilla latte (three of them) never had any vanilla flavor that I could detect. All three occasions I couldn't detect any vanilla, and while I don't need to be clubbed over the head with flavor- a hint would be nice. I had some coffee cake which was super dry, to the extent that it should be served with a red flag warning.
I tried to order pizza one time, but then saw the person in back lean into a freezer to pull some component out to heat and serve. I quickly cancelled that order- if you can't do fresh- don't bother.

In closing- I want this place to succeed- the Dale needs indie places, but they MUST start paying attention to detail. If they don't do that, and get a sense of urgency- this place will close, and all their hard work will be for nada.",2014-06-09 17:36:22

Chambers has the Phoenix Blues (Chelsea supporters) in on game days. Sometimes it is a small crowd, but this was a big game, with over 100 supporters in attendance. Although they seemed a bit surprised by the large crowd, the staff handled everything exceptionally well. I didn't catch the bartenders name but she busted her ass both setting up and serving. They have a decent draft list, with many pub regulars (Harp, Stella, etc...) and a few AZ beers mixed in (Papago, Oak Creek.) The bar and pub layout is spacious with plenty of room to get around.

I kept hearing about this place and thought I would finally make my way in since I live so darn close.   It was a short walk from the escalators for the theater, and it seemed primarily composed of bar type seating.  Nice comfy chairs, elligent decor, and  purse hooks which really make a big difference for us ladies... Or men who enjoy purses.  

My first fatal error upon arriving at 4:10 was not realizing happy hour only included drinks until 4pm, and at 5pm small plates could then be ordered. I arrived very hungry.  So since alcohol was all that could be consumed my lightweight self became very inebriated by 5pm.  My favorite martini was the blackberry.  Not artificial tasting,  the basil balanced the sweetness,  just a yummy drink.  My second favorite was the peach apple,  but my friend had the fat Elvis I believe,  and that was to sweet for me.   With the half off discount most martinis are about 7 to 8 dollars,  and they fill that glass super full. I appreciated the glass was chilled.   They also have reduced cost wine  for happy hour.   

Now the small plates for happy hour were definatly small,  and compared to other happy hours I really love like brio or Soho,  they were a bit overpriced.  Most averaging 10 dollars. This is the main reason I'm marking off one star. 

  The beef rib was tender and we'll flavored, but not much meat on the single 9 dollar rib.  It was served with some mash potato puree and a couple roasted veggies. 

  The lobster puffs had no actual peices of lobster more a  puree they piped into the puffs .

  The fried chicken and chedder biscuits were nice, and the most fillings option.  Tender and crispy,  and I always love a good biscuit. 

We also ordered two desserts which were not on the happy hour menu.
 The chocolate souffle with pistachio sauce: not bad,  but it didn't blow my mind. 
The cheesecake :huge slice could feed an army,    nice and creamy,  could use more of a sauce or fruit for its size. 

Overall the service was attentive, which I appreciated.  The crowd that ate their was more on the 50 plus side,  so we were definitely the odd men out.  Ill make sure to come 10 till 5  next time so there are still ample seating,  but I can eat sooner than later.",2018-03-28 22:11:04

Unfortunately for Jersey Mike, I've eaten at White House Subs in Atlantic City so my expectations were pretty high. I was sorely disappointed.

The ingredients were good, the dressing above average, and the staff was friendly, however, one of the main ingredients of a good sub is the roll itself and Jersey Mike's bread was way off the mark.
The roll was dry, its shell spongy and not crusty, and there was an overwhelming amount of dry crumb, so much so, not even the dressing would soften it.

For one large sub, two drinks and a bag of chips, the bill came to nineteen dollars.
Sorry Jersey Mike, but a cutesy Point Pleasant sign and dry bread doesn't do it for me.

In fact, the owner never really looked at the coupon to see any terms and conditions.  I just said it said 10% off.  They honored that more so on my word than being picky about the coupon.

They seated us in a booth at the far end of the restaurant away from other people, which is what my husband wanted.  The decor was nice, friendly and clean.  The ambiance was nice and the tables had nice tablecloths and cloth napkins - a place that is nicer than what we normally go to.

The owner was very friendly and energized, gave us personal attention without being overbearing.  The booths were big so my husband and I could snuggle together, but eat without bumping our arms into each other.

We were glad to leave a good tip and glad we made the trip up to north Phx for this restaurant.  The owner is from Manhattan New York.  I never got the chance to ask if he was Greek or not, but the food was really good.  We would come back again.

The restaurant from the outside didn't look too great, but the inside was fine.  If we are in the area again, we'll go eat there again.

This was probably the fifth or sixth time I have eaten at this local neighborhood gem, and I can assuredly tell you, this Alexander Michael's experience was just as good as the first.

My date and I walked in pleasantly surprised that despite the warm, quiet, lazy, summer evening outside, Alexander Michael's was cool, dark, and very lively on the inside.  We were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant, just behind the bar.  

My date ordered the chicken pita with fries (I've taken a picture of it), I ordered the craw fish bake (see pic).  The bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole.  It was perfectly gooey and cheesy - but not heartstoppingly so.  As for my date's pita; she loved it.  I had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy.  Both OUR MEALS WERE EXCELLENT!!  

I am truly of fan of this elegant and intimate Charlotte jewel. To me, Alexander Michael's is a place where you can get elegant, all-american bar food, but with an upscale twist.  If you haven't been to Alexander Michael's - GO!  If you've already been, GO AGAIN!!",2011-08-20 20:57:01

As well, as the nearby office crowd which tend to cluster like bees to honey around the bar, like fermented honey-wheat-bees... if those existed. Plus some other random people.

The place has that ""Je ne sais quoi"" dive feel which is hard to ignore, specially since I have now been there a number of times, mostly (and by mostly, I mean ""ONLY"") after class, after an exam or celebratory final class, as I am currently finishing a social media course at George Brown.

The place also has that hipster vibe with a bunch of photos and posters plastered on most walls at the front, although to be quite honest, I have never paid much attention to them as the tv's on top of the bar displaying numerous sports compete and win for your attention when walking in.

The venue reminds me to an upper-class version of the Red Room -sans books but not as cool nor as smooth as 7-West. Never had food here so I can't comment on that.

I would say Betty's is medium in size which means it can fill out faster than the space would  hint at. There is a good patio which I test drove early in the year; remember those days about a month of so ago when it got all warm all of the sudden? I was there.

Beer is not expensive, however the secret as told by my teacher is to make the last drink you order is a half pint, which, unless you are a jackass to the wait staff, will in fact be more like a 6/7 of a pint. Bonus Points!

I was fortunate enough to eat at Harris Grill on a beautiful night in early November. The temperature was just about perfect for a fall night to eat out on their patio. The outside seating gives a really nice atmosphere to wind down after a long day at work. Now I know why people like coming here for Happy Hour. The inside has a nice lounge area, also good for getting to know your co-workers outside of the office structure. I give it a good solid 4 stars for the restaurant itself.

The food is okay too. I had the Lettuce Pray - seared tuna and grilled peppers with lettuce to wrap it all in. I liked it; it was a nice small snack to accompany my beer. I did enjoy the entertaining menu names. The beer selection is not that big, but they have an ok variety to choose from.  For the food, I'll give it 2.5 stars because, although it wasn't bad, it also wasn't anything to remember.

The hot buffet offered a selection of carbs (mashed potato, bread, rice, pasta) while the salad bar had too many options of heavy salads. It would have been nice to have some lighter salad choices. The chimichurri sauce was my favourite out of all the buffet selection. 

The meat was really the star of the night. As soon as we sat down, we were overwhelmed by the amount of servers stopping by us to serve us. However, the majority of the meat were on the over seasoned and salty side, especially the parmesan beef and the bacon filet mignon. The frequency of the servers appearing was also a irregular: we got flooded with servers in the first 10 minutes but when we started eating, there were no more servers in sight with them only appearing 30 minutes later. 

Overall, it was a nice experience but I don't think I would come back on a regular basis.",2017-02-07 19:44:11

Those were the parameters set by Beau S. when he asked me to pick a restaurant for a ""late lunch/early dinner"" yesterday  (4/13/11) before I had to head to work.  Somehow, we ended up at Mesa, which, according to Beau, isn't Mexican, it's Tex-Mex, which is just ""spicy American food."" 

Upon walking in, it sorta looks like Guy Fieri had free reign to liberally apply as many ""flame"" touches as possible - from the sconces to the ceiling, there were flames...and cowhide backed chairs, and toile backed chairs, and rainbow tea jars, and various other curious design choices throughout the restaurant. 

When seated, the waiter asked if I would like anything to drink. I said ""water, no lemon please"" and he walked off. Apparently it didn't matter if Beau wanted anything to drink, because he, by default, would get what I was getting, regardless of what he wanted. Never mind that he was the one paying.

We were given at least 5 menus between the two of us. I couldn't decide if I should have the spicy beef tenderloin tartare appetizer or the barbecued lamb cobb salad. I decided to have my second cobb salad of the day so I went with that. Beau went with the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. 

Being a native Texan, and therefor quite familiar with Tex- Mex cuisine, I found it curious that a restaurant that billed itself as ""Tex-Mex"" had two semi-Tex-Mex offerings on the lunch menu: Tacos and a chile relleno. All other offerings may have the inclusion of ""New Mexican spice blend"" (whatever that is) or a green chile sauce atop American fare but that's kinda... not really Tex-Mex. 

Our waiter delivered us a bread basket containing the following:
-2 slices of jalapeño French bread.
-1 blue and yellow corn muffin. (The blue corn part had the consistency of Moon Sand and fell apart when I picked it up.)
-2 slices of (Pepperidge Farm) raisin bread. (Yeah, I have no idea what that's about.) 

When the waiter brought out the food, he accidentally stepped on my foot and about had a heart attack, thinking I was one of those money hungry crazies that threaten to sue if so much as an eyelash is found on their napkin. It really wasn't that big of a deal and didn't even hurt. No biggie, but I guess he had no way of knowing I wasn't going to demand his termination to the manager for the gaffe. 

My salad was good. Not $17 dollars good, but tasty none-the-less. The lamb was perfectly rare, just how I like it. The frisée definitely needed to be ripped up because the pieces were huge and I looked like The Beast, from Beauty and the Beast, when he was trying to learn to use a spoon, when I was trying to wrap my mouth around my fork filled with this mini frisée tree. Beau's hash looked like baby vomit on the plate once he deconstructed it and picked out the chicken. He left the sweet potato on the plate because he said it was too sweet. 

After spending most of the time talking about the bizarre documentaries we watch on Netflix, it was time to go. When the waiter came with the bill, I told him there was no way we were paying after he assulted me by stepping on my foot. (haha) He said if that was the case that he would need to finish the job. I like it when waiters can play along like that. Beau took care of the bill and we left. 

Was the food good? Yeah. But there's no way that it's worth the prices they're charging. It was nice to try but it's no where I'd be tripping over myself to go back to.",2011-04-14 16:45:53

It was pretty empty.

We were seated right away and had a male and female server who doubled as the hostess. 

The menu is small, which I like. There are three pizzas to choose from in a large or small and then you can choose your own toppings.

My friend and I just ordered a mushroom pizza to split and a caprese salad.

The salad was good, but I can't imagine how you'd go wrong making that. They give you salt, oil, and balsamic on the side. It was a good portion and shareable at $8. 

Our pizza was served shortly after.

The woman served our first slice and we ate the whole large between the two of us.

The crust is very thin, the cheese was very good, the mushrooms were fresh, and the sauce was just right.

It was a very good pizza. They found a very good recipe for their proportions and ratios of cheese versus sauce versus crust.

The only thing that didn't make this a 5 star review is that:

1. They never refilled our drinks until we asked when leaving. Sure he offered a to go cup, but it want busy because he had a bite of food from an off the clock employee's food while he was on the clock but that's beside the point.
2. A customer leaving broke a wine glass just by putting his jacket on. Although they handled the situation well to make the customer not feel at fault.. They said don't worry it happens all the time.. First they shouldn't keep wine glasses on the table no matter how nice it makes the table setting look since their tables are so close together. Second the staff said it happens all the time and not to worry. It just feels dangerous, uncomfortable for who ever did it, and could be avoided. I hope it doesn't happen all the time for safety reasons.

You wouldn't normally find me hanging out around Old Town on a Saturday night. Not unless I'm there for my favorite sport: people-watching. However, my fabulous friend Natalie had recently won a free hour of a karaoke in one of Geisha's private rooms. Free karaoke? Don't mind if I do!

It's no secret, I love karaoke. In fact, I am slightly obsessed and a place like this really gives me the opportunity to sing my heart out without having to share the mic (much). Just like any other karaoke joint, you get two books full of song choices, two microphones, and your own server. There's even a little switch to flip in case you need your server to come check on you. Unfortunately, our server was like a freaking model or something. AND she was really nice. Couldn't they give us someone a little uglier to make me feel better about myself??? 

Anyway, we had a great time here. We gave Celine Dion, Spice Girls, and Bonnie Tyler a run for their money. However, that being said, I don't think I would be willing to actually pay the $75 per hour fee to rent one of the rooms. The rooms are super outdated and a little gross. Yes, that is probably true to traditional Japanese karaoke, but the price is just too steep.

Sweet topping baked cha Siu Bau - similar but not quite pineapple topping, these were served warm and my favourite of all we ate. We also ordered some to go for afternoon snacks.

I've walked by this store for months and love the selection in the window all the time, the selection changes pretty regularly and always something interesting to look at, some books I've heard of or seen before - lots of old publications.   

Today I stopped in, and so glad I did, what a cute small place. Books on every wall, every nook and cranny...floor to the ceiling. I was looking for a a particular book and unfortunately  they didn't have it....but he recommend two other places close by that might have it.  The books are organized really well and the prices are wonderful !

Ambiance: It is a very cute/trendy spot that appears like a pawn shop when you walk in but has a very large indoor dining area/bar. Good feel for date night/girls night or even out with the family.
Food: I really appreciated the variety of the menu. But the problem lies here. I got an Apple and Berry salad which was very good, but we dont eat pork. After I found pork, they brought it back with pork again. This was extremely disrespectful to us, and kind of gross considering they probably pre-make their food and just picked out the pork. I also ordered poke tacos, sea bass, and sashimi. Everything was excellent, just that mess up. 
Dessert: The strawberry shortcake drumstick is heavenly, wrapped in captain crunch YUM. Super unique and a must try. Also, the butterscotch creme was excellent too with super cute ginger chip spoons. They were excellent.
Service: Our waiter was nice, but he kind of didn't believe us when I showed him the 2x mess up. After I showed it to him and the manager the wanted me to think its a walnut, but then they believed it and comped us which was really nice.

Overall would definitely come again and recommend a try.",2017-02-27 16:55:01

Even though we were standing at the entrance for a little while before a table was cleaned off, the waiter cordially greeted and seated us.  It's a family restaurant so they can handle large groups.

We ordered a meat platter and a veggie one.  The food was okay, not incredibly flavorful (the way I remembered Ethopian food.).  At first glance I thought the lamb was chicken and to tell you the truth, I couldn't taste the difference.  The beef was obviously red meat, but tasted only slightly different from the other meats.

The yellow peas tasted lightly seasoned, and so did the cabbage.  I thought the green bean and carrot mix was the tastiest but unfortunately we had only one portion of it.  The injera was okay -  there was an ample amount of it.

Didn't order dessert because nothing screamed Ethiopian dessert. What they served I could order at several other restaurants.",2014-08-08 06:28:43

The restaurant is large enough to accommodate our larger party if our family decides to go there last minute without reservation. Overall, the food is OK, nothing really has ever been mind blowing and nothing has ever been a fail. We like to come here because the restaurant is spacious with a laid back island feel and atmosphere. Service has never been an issue either and we have sat in all areas including the main dining area, the bar area, and in the indoor patio area.

The firecracker shrimp street tacos, the Jamaican chicken wings, and the ahi tuna stack are pretty decent starters. The whole wing is served as the appetizer so be ready to share. For entrees, the paella and the steak oscar have been satisfactory. But the last few visits I have ordered something from the fresh fish menu.

Our last visit was on a Saturday night and we sat in the indoor patio area. They had a gentleman playing live music for our entire stay. The music did not drown out our conversation, but you should request another seat if you would like a more peaceful environment. 

For drinks, we had the Yaka Hula Hickey Dula and the Painkiller. Both cocktails were strong but nice mixes with kick from the rum. They were too strong for my wife, so that meant two dinner cocktails for me. I had the sauteed tilapia with chimichurri sauce as my entree. My wife had a turkey burger. My fish was cooked perfectly, moist and flaky with the chimichurri being a nice accompaniment. For dessert, the chocolate pineapple upside down cake was enjoyed by both of us.

We had came here on the Wednesday earlier in the evening around 530A and had gotten a table fairly quickly. We wanted to ""beat the dinner crowd"" so it had worked out. Most of us had arrived fairly on time except 1 who had gotten off work a little later than expected. 

Located on the northwest corner of Silverado Ranch and Bermuda, it sits in a plaza with very limited parking. Luckily we came here early ! 

Typically, on the AYCE menu, only 2 fresh oyster's are offered per person. But for opening special and because they were out of sea urchin as well as beef kabayaki, they offered us 2 dozen oysters (and more) for our group of 8. They had 4 different oysters to try including Kumamotos, Blue Points, something that had ""Sweet"" in the name, and something else. The oysters were fresh but overall were fairly tasteless. All the ""natural brine"" is gone and it was hard to differentiate in terms of flavor. 

Along with the AYCE menu, the ""bar"" is also available that had fried rice, orange chicken, oranges, chow mein, and some other stuff i never looked at xD 

We had ordered appetizers (sashimi salad, crispy soft shell crab, baked new zealand mussel, butter grilled corn), entree (teriyaki beef), skewers (king trumpet mushroom), nigiri (salmon, yellowtail, ikura, super white tuna, tuna, unagi, sweet shrimp, cajun albacore, surf clam), no rice roll (apple special #1, sea salt tower, salmon holic)

I had ordered a handroll consisting of salmon, ikura, and avocado. Avocado was forgotten but there was a lot of salmon and even more ikura, stuffed to the brim ! Good colony of potential salmon was just ingested. Hehe... 

Overall, the nigiri was pretty decent. Good amount of fish to rice ratio. Besides the apple special which was unique, the other two ""no rice roll"" items weren't too impressive. The king trumpet mushroom was seasoned by something citrus-y where it was preferred to be plain. Sashimi salad was a bit overdressed for the salad and the fish, like they were trying to cover something. (probably not but just saying). Soft shell crab and mussels were fairly decent over all. 

Service was great. The waiter kept communication with us because we had a lot of issues with getting our orders out. Stuff like salmon holic, crispy soft shell crab, teriyaki beef took forever or never showed up. The guy tried to be really helpful, when his attention was on us. Otherwise, his attention goes off really quick. 

Not bad for the 50% off price. Not sure if its comparable to other places in town at full price. For grand opening, a lot of ""mistakes"" seemed more on the level of ""soft opening"".",2018-08-01 19:30:57

A recent review for a place in Chandler made me NEED some Filipino food. Let me back track a few years. 

I worked with a guy who was in charge of hiring for a drug wholesaler, he liked helping friends and family. He was a Polish Filipino. Some of the family he hired were Filipino and would bring Pancit, Lumpia, adobo etc to the potluck type lunches we had. I would even go to family functions with them. I love Filipino food. 

There was a place near me that closed down and I was left with no where to go. I drove past CFB but at the time it was only a bakery...lame 

After seeing the review for the place in Chandler, I had to find a closer place. SO I YELPED... sure enough there it was CFB. It is only 6 miles from work...sweet. 

I roll in and expect to see a dive but instead see a very clean, and larger then expected dining room. Attached was a bakery full of delights. 

I ordered the Pancit with chicken and veggies. It was freaking good. No soy or spicy sauce ALL the normal flavors. I also asked if I could sample some of the Lumpia and it was perfect, fresh, hot, and awesome. 

I will be back for some Adobo and some pastry's.

I went here last night around 10:30 pm. My son had diarrhea and constant vomiting. The Nurses here don't know how to deal with kids in an age appropriate manner. This hospital cares more about having the shortest wait times over nursing a child back to health. They were rushing patients in and out to be able to have more empty rooms. Triage nurses were not compassionate. They made me son walk up to the window just to put a band on him. They should have came out to the lobby to do that considering the fact my child was weak from constantly vomiting. Nurses are too busy playing in there hair as opposed to checking on the patients. They were too incompetent to run tests or do any type of bloodwork on my son. They didn't even start an IV for his dehydration. They gave him liquid Motrin for a fever which he immediately threw up. Instead of giving him medicine in an IV. Most nurses in this department are fresh out of school and have no real knowledge of different types of illnesses. Most of the nurses acted like they were scared of vomit. I would suggest picking another profession...all kids vomit. The doctor was nice but kinda rough with my son and he was obviously rushed which isn't his fault. The doctor told me my son had a stomach bug? How would they know that without doing any blood work?!?! An hour later they brought my son in a popsicle and said ""if he keeps this down you guys can leave."" After all this all they did was give my son a prescription for an anti-nausea medication. All this hospital cares about is your money. I'm so disappointed in this hospital. I see all the great advertising I hear is false speaking from my experience. I would never return here!!! I'll go to the hospital in Henderson.

You know, pizza is something we all have a standard against which all others are measured. And the search for that perfect pizza is much like the search for the fountain of youth - elusive but clearly worthwhile. Michael's has restored my faith that perhaps that fountain of youth does exist - the perfect pizza certainly does! And Michael's has it! Sure, there's good pizza all over the place. But there's only one BEST pizza. I've had pizza all over Pittsburgh, all over the US (NYC, Chicago, SoCal...) and all over Europe including Italy. I've had Monte Cello's VIncent's, Domenico's, Luciano's, Mineo's, and all the chains - although I do like Piccolo Forno's too. My search has not been half-hearted nor without focus. I stumbled upon Michaels about 8 years ago and hit the motherlode. When I want pizza, I'm willing to drive the 25 miles from the north hills to the south side just to sit and enjoy my favorite pizza with a pitcher of Yuengling in a comfy bar atmosphere.

I wanted to keep this place to myself, not to tell anyone about it. After all, hidden gems are meant to remain hidden, right? Otherwise people swarm in and spoil a good thing. No one wants to go somewhere where everyone goes!! But alas, I find myself after 8 years of going here as a regular, finally wanting to shout it out!! THIS IS GREAT PIZZA!!! 

Two blocks off Carson street on Sarah, it's off the beaten path and is not a place you're likely to just happen upon. You have to look for it. But once you do, you'll be hooked. First off, the crust is perfect, not too thin, not thick and doughy. It's a delight. The sauce is what make it. One thing I know it's sauce. And this is remarkable. Order the twisty's as an appetizer - parmesan dusted baked dough twists that are to die for - and you'll get a side of the sauce. Go ahead, dip in. You'll thank me. I could eat a bowl of that sauce with a tablespoon. And ask for more. This pizza just kills!! And if Meghan is working there, you'll be treated to the best service with a smile. She is absolutely the best. Good pizza, good service, good beer, good atmosphere. I call that JACKPOT!! What more could you want?

We dropped by during happy hour, which is valid dining at the bar or their communal table. There were 3 of us, the bar area was busy so we sat at the communal table. Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and efficient. She brought us HH menus as well as the regular menu and took our drink order a few minutes later. I got the fix, which is a rum based drink with fruit compote. It was very good, fruity and almost reminded me of lemonade. For food off the HH menu, we tried the smoked carnitas nachos, salmon and roasted pepper toast. The nachos were surprisingly really good, it was all about the cheese they used. Not your standard nacho cheese, and once all our chips were gone our waitress brought us more so we could finish off the cheese. The toasts were ok, they weren't toasted at all just a spread over bread with some toppings and too much cilantro. For our entree, we decided to get a half dozen oysters, king crab legs and a shrimp each. The oysters came with a choice of sauces, we opted for the jalapeño option and it was so good! That definitely made the oysters different than any other I've had. The shrimp was fine and crab legs were good with butter. Since we had more time to kill, we ended up agreeing to seeing the dessert menu and were quickly talked into trying their award winning salted caramel pudding. It was SO good! I was not expecting that at all.

Run down Evap cooler rotted out all around the sides of the building around it.   Mops just tossed in the yard. Honestly I can't even describe how poor the condition of the building is.

I got the house chicken Carlos Sr got Orange Chicken.   Half mine was super fried and half raw batter.  It was the weirdest thing ever.  Sauce had a very funky flavor I couldn't put my finger on.  Like fermented garlic.  And the Chicken seemed ReFried.

Carlos Sr.  one word on the Sauce.  Cloyingly sweet.  Gobs of gooey sugar sauce with minimal orange flavor.  First bite not bad.  But by the end.  My god you just want it to end.  His rice.  Same as mine.

There are lots of cocktail food classics; this isn't an overly ambitious or experimental menu. It's not horribly boring either. The concept is design your own snack board, share some plates and sip your drinks by the glowing stained glass bar. It works well. 

We tried a bit of everything from the menu categories: olives, meats, cheese, sharing plates, drinks and sweets.

Sushi and sashimi (tuna, red snapper, and salmon) is generally decent for budget sushi restaurant, only all you can eat. The salmon sashimi was actually excellent though farmed salmon most likely. I appreciated that they were served at room temperature rather than chilled.

Cooked seafood was pretty good. Small crabs are a lot of work to eat and the crab legs are the smaller King Crab kind. Large and small clams.

I enjoyed the Peking Duck (actually watched them butcher a whole duck after one tray was finished) served with the sauce, onions, and even the flour pancakes.

Lots of hard packed ice cream choices for desert is much better than the soft serve at other Asian buffets.

Mongolian BBQ looked pretty good with unfrozen meats (whole NY strip steak) and raw shrimp though I ran out of gas before I can try it.

We popped in to get a quick burger before walking the the Crescent Ballroom which is about five short city blocks away.  You can easily take the light rail here by getting off at the station that is just east of Central. 

The wife and I each had a burger, I had a local beer and she had a Hendricks Gin martini.  We sat at the bar and had great service from the bartender who was attentive, but not too into our business.  We had a night of drinking ahead, and he kept our water glasses full at every turn, which is something any good bartender should do instead of only focusing on the alcohol.  

When ordering the burgers, the only choice was the side (fries, coleslaw or side salad).  So not cooked to order, just cooked.  We liked the simplicity.  I had the side salad, which just came tossed with a house vinaigrette that was great.  While I was surprised that I wasn't offered a choice of dressing, I liked that I didn't have to give a bunch of specifics-- I loved just ordering the burger and not having to make a bunch of choices.   I am the type of customer that like to experience the food as the cook/chef decides to put it together.  I am not picky and often find that leaving those decisions to the chef make it more fun for me.  

The place is very clean, and the kitchen is open-air, right in the middle of the restaurant.  You can watch as they prepare every item.  Everything was priced reasonably.  The special was prime rib at $25 a plate.  The burgers we had were $10 each, the beer was under $6, and the Hendricks martini, which was basically a double was $13.50.

I was looking for a sunny spot to relax with my knitting and a good cuppa joe, and, following the recommendations of other Yelpers and the book Dévorer Montréal, I headed on over.

The soup (apple-ginger-fennel) was quite tasty and homemade. The café filtre and giant cookie were fine, but nothing special. (I am a good baker and can make better at home). They did have soy milk for coffee and a dairy-free soup option, merci beaucoup, much appreciated.

It cost a little more than I was expecting to pay versus other coffee/lunch spots in the Plateau. All the students on laptops had little cast-iron pots of tea which they kept getting topped up with hot water -- that might be the best strategy for an affordable ""coffee shop office."" 

For me, Café Névé was too loud and too dark. The layout is kind of like a tunnel, with a nice southwest-facing window by the door, but long windowless walls leading into the café.

Service was same day, and Joel was courteous and competent.  

Service man from other company left after several hours and $260 saying it would take about 24 hours for this mid sized condo to cool down, but my tenants were questioned his competence before he even left.  Tepid air blew throughout the night cooling the place down slightly, but the unit quit entirely the next day, leaving the  family of 6 with 4 small children sweltering for several days with no AC in late July in AZ.  My prior preferred provider was booked solid for at least 10 days out and Cruz AC whom they recommended as an alternative has never yet returned one of my two 
(or 3?)  calls, so I called Howard Air whom I had heard advertised on KTAR and for whom I found a small discount on the service call via Angie's.  

Joel from Howard made it there within a few hours and before he left the unit was blowing COLD air and has worked fine for the months since. The service tech from the prior company had overfilled the unit with refrigerant to the extent pressure couldn't be measured. Howard's Joel bled the pressure and did some exterior cleaning on a coil left unclean and covered in among other things wretched ""cat hair"" from the tenants running the AC for at least a couple weeks with no filter.  

I'm giving 5 stars with the disclaimer that this has been my first and only experience with Howard Air, but it's now (3/14/15) been nine months since the service, but thus far the experience has been nothing but blue skies and fresh (cold) - air.  Compliments and thanks to Joel of Howard Air",2014-08-10 05:04:11

Ordered the chicken tandoori kebab - To Go. I was first in line so it couldn't take too too long to receive my food. 

Firstly, the place is quite modern. Clean and ample amount of seating. 

Bathroom was spotless, which is a nice touch. I used the accessible 'suite' - they take care of this usual issue. 

Food arrived - minimum 15 min wait. That means it's fresh...but wait. 

Arrived to my post order destination, opened the take out container, andddd...was disappointed. 

Firstly - way too much rice. Second - too little meat. Third - too little salad. 

Rice was under cooked. Abrasive to the bite. Usually I look forward to the salad but the salad was sloppy and disappointing. Tons of lettuce, little veg, and too much dressing. 

The meat - I've had really good BBQ chicken. But have you ever bitten into a chunk of chicken and questioned whether it was cooked or not. That's what I went through tonight. The left side of my brain said don't eat it - but the right side said eat it you fat pig.

The food came out ridiculously fast but I was a bit leery the chicken was undercooked. It tasted okay and I never got sick but it didn't seem particularly well done.

The Malaysian tea is a must try. It's so good. The best way to explain how it taste would be a mixture of thai tea and milk tea! Yum!!

Wonton soup was only $7 and you can literally feed 6 people. Real wontons filled w meat, you get like 12 pieces of them.

Took my friend who was visiting from Cali here for a quick bite, since I thought the food quality would be the same but I guess I was wrong. I ordered the BBQ pork wonton soup and the wontons had a sour taste to them which were not mild, and made me think they may be expired. Broth was extremely red, probably due to the BBQ pork coloring, but at the other locations the broth is always brown and if anything, a hint of red; never would the entire soup be overpowered with a red color...In addition, the papaya salad was made with ripened papaya. When I say this, I mean that the papaya salad came out orange, instead of the bright green color. No it was not from the fish sauce, or because it may have been made laos style, it was because the papaya was ripe. It made the salad have a different soft texture and also added a sweet flavor to it which was not like the usual Thai style green papaya salad.

So Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with this location. I was so excited for it also! I thought that it would be a great addition to the Town Square and was really hoping it could live up to the previous version of Gameworks that was on the Strip.. at least a little. In my opinion however, it does not. Not even close. Which, is understandable actually. The Las Vegas Strip Location was fantastic in many ways. If  the Town Square location could even be 1/4 of what the previous version was, it could be great. 

I agree that first and foremost, this place should be about the games. I also believe that they have really failed at the design of the space as far as the games go. There appear to be a lot of cool games though they are crammed into a corner. The layout is not cool. So clustered and uncomfortable to walk through when there are many players around. 

Staff was all awesome and very accommodating, I will say  that now.

I walked around a bit and saw the space in the back, that appears to be for private events maybe? A few empty rooms with LCD TV's mounted on the walls. I don't know, but I'd rather see that filled with games and maybe some themed rooms. That's another thing.. the space is so stark and boring and as I mentioned previously, the layout is kinda whack. 

The bar specifically, and even a restaurant that serves alcohol should not be something that kids walk through. It's not a difficult fix. There should be a divider wall between those areas. there are a couple of spaces that can be divided off for over and under 21 patrons. I understand that Gameworks will draw many under 21 people, but  as this is Las  Vegas and there is a huge market for the adult kids! As it stands, it's very uncomfortable to sit at the bar. Your back is to the walkway with kids going by, just not cool in my opinion. It even looks uncomfortable for the bartenders and servers to be serving there. 

I know that people reading this: employees, managers, owners and guests alike, will agree, disagree and be every range of emotion available at these reviews that are so negative. It's not easy opening a new place. Going in, everyone knew there were high expectations. 

I can't even go into much else without writing a full website on the subject, but I feel like this Gameworks needs a serious overhaul already. I really look forward to some major changes and hope that they come sooner than later. I will occasionally drop in to help support that.. but I cannot see myself spending money on games until those credits drop or you some form of unlimited play is offered as it has been in the past.. say $20 10pm-until close for adults, and something for the kids on weekends? 

I wish you luck Gameworks! You are responsible for a great many happy and fun memories in my earlier years! I want to be part of something great like that again!",2014-08-22 23:17:47

Oh, the little sleep light came on, and the DVD drive buzzed, but the screen was dark, and the startup chime didn't sound.

Bummer!

I took it to the Apple Store after making an appointment at the Genius Bar. (When you need them, ALWAYS make an appointment. They are very busy, especially on weekends.)

While standing around, waiting my turn, one of the staff came up with her iPod Touch in hand and checked to see if I had an appointment, and then checked me into their ""present"" queue. She asked me if there was anything she could help me with or answer as I waited. I did ask her a few questions about the iPhone and she promptly answered them. 

The lady who waited on me at the Genius Bar asked the right open-ended questions (""How can I help you today? Tell me about your Mac."") I explained the problem, and that I had tried all the obvious things they normally ask you to do. 

She promptly tried resetting the parameter RAM, but that didn't work. (I had forgotten that one!) Then, she plugged in a series of diagnostic drives, and attempted to start my Mac from the systems on them. That didn't work, either, so she concluded the main logic board needed to be replaced, and explained my options.

I chose to have the machine repaired... They would send it off and have it repaired at a central facility, then overnight it back to me. All was covered under AppleCare, and I received the machine on Wednesday morning, a day earlier than she suggested. It works fine!

I checked the cost of a main logic board for an A1260 (my model) at iFixit.com... It was more than twice what I paid for AppleCare, so the warranty was well worth the cost. 

The machine is about 20 months old, so had I not purchased AppleCare, I would have had to pray that the problem was covered under the nVidia 8600M GT chip failure warranty (It probably would have been... The explanation of repair that came back with my machine said that chip was the problem, and they replaced the main logic board to fix it.)

All in all, Apple did the right thing, here. They made the diagnosis and the cure as painless as I could have asked for, just as they have on several other occasions. I'll keep coming back.

A friend of mine once told me it's better to have lower expectations of people/things so that you're not disappointed. I suppose I should've had lower expectations. The place is super cute and their menu sounds amazing. But execution of it all just didn't come together. 

I met up with some friends a few weeks ago and was super excited for this place. Mashed potato bar? Um. Count me in! So the friends had already ordered an app by the time I got there - some little balls of sorts. They were delicious. Who doesn't love little balls? 

For my main entree, I ordered the quarter chicken with truffle marinade or whatever. It comes with two sides so I got the mashed potato side (you get to choose whatever toppings) and I had a the side salad. I didn't specify what kind of meat I wanted the chicken to be so they brought dark. Great! I love dark meat, so juicy and delicious....well not this place. I'm confused. The name of the restaurant is Chick Rotisserie. Two things come to mind - chicken and rotisserie. A. The chicken was flavored alright. Don't waste your money on upgrading to the truffle marinade or whatever...it wasn't that great. B. the chicken was dry! W.T.F. Dry dark-meat roasted chicken? Come on, if that's what you're gonna name your place you had better make some damn good chicken. Nope. Fail. The side salad was womp womp. Warm and wilty....maybe you should put it on a different plate or something because warm salad is gross. The drinks were good - thank goodness. My mashed potatoes were great but my friend's were weird. They tasted lemony or something - we got the same toppings. No reason why it should've tasted different. 

The place is super cute inside and I might come back and try something else because the chicken was boring and I can buy a whole chicken from the grocery store that's juicier and tastier than what I had at Chick.",2012-07-31 00:14:06

It was a group of 7 of us and we ordered a fair bit of food including the Charcuterie sampler platter, the suckling pig, the tuna tartare, potatoes bravas, blood sausage with acorn relish, sous vide Octopus and a jug of sangria. 

I don't know if there was someone on the table who was a food hog, or if the pieces were miscounted, but by the time the platter got to me, and I was the second last person to be served, a lot of the meat only had x 1 piece left and the person served after me definitely missed out on some of the Charcuterie! Btw, what I tasted of this platter was great - really perfectly curated. 

I really liked the rest of our menu choices too - we had some fussy eaters who ended up loving the blood sausage to their surprise and our table had a lovely conversation then about haggis vs blood pudding and white pudding. I loved the acorn relish and licked the plate clean with a piece of bread- I wasn't letting any of that food item go to waste!  

The octopus was another favorite as was the lavendar sugared marcona almonds. The suckling pig's skin was so crisp, and the flavors were perfectly spot on and tender. The tuna tartare was another favorite and frankly, you can never go wrong with an order of Potatoes Bravas at a Spanish restaurant and this was no exception.

For dessert we tried 2 of the 3 available choices - I'm not a fan of sabayon and after I described to my colleagues how it was made, there was unanimous agreement to instead try the Creme Catalina plus the Churros. To my surprise, I really liked the Churros - the cinnamon dusting on it wasn't at all aggressive but the Creme Catalina is what I would order again next time and then not share!

Really lovely evening out but if it came back to a choice, I'd go back to Cure before coming back to Morcilla!

PS - it was only after I uploaded pics that I realized my review failed to mention the cauliflower and mushroom with egg dish! Guess they weren't that memorable even tho' I recall liking the mushrooms!

Even though it is a 42 mile one way trip to the place.  For a Wednesday night, they had a lot of things going.  The hockey and basketball games were on TV and Wednesday nights is their poker tournament events.  There was a steady flow of people for the time we were there.  Even with all the activities our service was still GREAT!  Seth ROCKS!

Ok down to the good stuff - FOOD review:

Salt and Pepper Wings served with carrots, celery and chipotle ranch dressing
- The wings were fried to a golden perfection.  The wings were cooked through & through but still juicy and full of the simple balance of salt and pepper.

Baked Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken breast
- Spiral macaroni cheesed out with a creamy comb of smoked provolone and cheddar jack.  It is topped with toasted bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  The grilled chicken was still juicy not dry.  The combination of the cheese and the toasted bread crumbs was so cheesy and GOOD.

Hubby had the loco soft tacos with the shredded pork and told me that they tacos were just RE-DONK-U-LIOUS.  I am not sure if that is a word but OK we will go with that.

On this most recent visit, I ordered the shredded kale salad with local chicken, cranberries, pepitas, apple, and pomegranate dressing AND PICKLED GINGER! What? I need to remember that I love pickled ginger, and why shouldn't it go on a salad?! It was delicious! There was also a hint of cinnamon that I couldn't place. It could have been the dressing, but my memory made it taste like it was on the apples, sort of like apples that were just tossed and ready to go in a pie. Yum!

The onion rings were made fresh. However, I've made better at home (and on my first and only try). The batter was bland and tasted ""oily,"" if it had a flavor at all. The actual onion pieces were cut too small to have a good mouth-feel.

The charred beef jumbo hot dog I ate was okay. It was buried under a pleasant mountain of toppings--I asked for ""everything""--and this was nice. The bun was typical; nothing that went above and beyond the Wal-Mart buns-in-a-bag experience.

I also had a jumbo burger. 1/3 pound. It was cooked okay; medium-rare in parts, medium in others. I suspect they were trying for medium. The toppings were acceptable and the bun was pretty good. The meat itself tasted unseasoned, but was fine. 

We had a milkshake, too. Loganberry. Theoretically. It tasted like strawberry, and when I asked for confirmation that it was not strawberry, the staff offered to remake it. Okay, I thought this may be a gambit to save face--fine, let's let them remake the drink. I was told that they'd bring it out to us, so I sat down at the table. We were later ""greeted"" by an employee carrying our milkshake. She slammed it down on the table without comment (slopping some of it over the edge of the cup), and spun on her heel and returned to the service line. 

All in all ... I really, really, really hope they had an ""off night."" We won't be going back, which is sad--all I wanted was a tasty hot dog served by folks who were friendly. I don't care that I'm being fleeced for a hot dog; I'll pay $4 for one if it is good and comes with quality service and preparation. If our evening is any indication, Ted's Hot Dogs has a long way to go with staff training and quality of sides.

Went in for the first time . Saw a posted sign at the register advertising a three peice tender combo meal for $5 bucks . 
I clearly pointed to the sign and told the cashier I would have the $5 combo special.  She rang up my order and charged me $7.46 . I took the food to my table and looked at the receipt thinking the combo special probably didn't include the soda . But why would soda be an extra $2. 46 ?   
I told the cashier I thought the combo was $5 dollars ? She said "" oh that special starts at 7 pm . I asked her to tell me the time since I didn't wear a watch . It was 6:48 pm . I asked her if she could reimburse the difference . I had assumed it was already 7 pm (my fault ) . 
She went to get someone else . The manager ? Shift supervisor ? Obviously someone who was in charge .  I explained that it was my fault for not knowing the proper time . But since I had clearly pointed to the sign when placing the order , I should've been told that it was 12 minutes too early to receive that special .
In a not so friendly manner told me he was unable to refund the difference.
I asked him if I didn't like the taste of the food or if the food was too cold would he refund the entire price ? He said yes . So I then told him the food was cold and he gave me a very slow and drawn out refund for the entire amount . Plus then he took the plate of food which I had already handled and put it neatly back on the kitchen where I'm assuming he planned on re selling it . ( health code violation) .
So for the difference of $2 dollars and 12 minutes in time ... He would rather refund the Entire price of the meal , and also lose a customer forever ? No problem . This is Las Vegas and we have many different  choices on each block to choose from.  The reason I give ONE Star and will never come back is the poor customer service combined with him not throwing away the food I had already handled .",2016-03-28 02:20:35

It's a relatively small place, and when you have that many people, it's bound to get loud, and uncomfortably so.  At least now I know why so many people came in for to-go orders!  
Moving on to the food, it's pretty good and portions are large, but there are a few things that need to be tweaked.  
The complimentary bread sticks and marinara were ok, but our artichoke casserole appetizer was TOTALLY excellent!  My son ordered Caesar salad with chicken, yet it contained black olives, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese. Not exactly used to having a Caesar with black olives and tomatoes, nor mozzarella cheese rather than the typical Parmesan cheese.  My daughter's spaghetti with meat sauce appeared to be simply marinara sauce with torn apart meatballs tossed in it.  She thought the sauce tasted sweet, but I thought it was pretty good - and I HATE sweet spaghetti sauce.  I ordered an antipasto salad, which was fairly good, but way too many marinated veggies on it.  Whatever brand of pepperoncini peppers they use should be tossed out - they were terrible tasting, so get another brand, please!  The homemade vinaigrette was fantastic, so much so that I think they should sell that in jars to take home. We were going to order a Philly Cheese steak sub to-go, but when we found out that it only contained meat and cheese (no onions, no mushrooms, and no peppers - not that we like the peppers anyway) we opted out.  
There's not a great beer nor wine selection, as someone mentioned.  Wine is mainly grocery-store jugs and a few other bottles. I did have a glass of their Cabernet, and it really wasn't bad at all - but I'm not exactly known as a wine snob. ;)  
The waitress was extremely pleasant, super nice & attentive.  Upon entering the restaurant, I def. did NOT detect any odors inside (as someone else had mentioned) and the ladies bathroom was very clean.

I would say 3.5 star (4 stars for other location as I find the layout a bit better at other stores)",2013-04-08 18:19:01

We had an egg roll, which differed from your traditional egg roll in that it seemed to be filled with bbq pork. We also ordered a Khmer Stirred Pan Noodle, which tasted like a pad thai except significantly less sweet.

The appetizers were OK. I started with the scallops, which were a special. In my experience, scallops should be light and almost melt in your mouth. These ones were hard to cut through, and they were chewy/rubbery. They brought us out some homemade bread, which was very light and delicious, and probably my favorite thing of the meal. Then I got the filet for dinner with a side of green beans. I asked for my filet to be done medium, and it was done medium well with little to no extra sauce/flavoring around it (which the flavoring/sauce/juices were delicious). The green beans were also mushy. Not crisp at all. They were overdone as well. It was just very disappointing for the quality you expect when pay for a good meal.

Consistency is key here, which is good. I generally see the same staff, same amount of patrons & am guaranteed the selection in the case is in perfect shape. I love that they're constantly keeping an eye on that case, shifting out the ingredients. 

They have pre-determined salads & then of course, make your own. I go with the spinach, grilled shrimp, chopped hard boiled eggs, Asian noodles, fresh mozzarella cheese, bacon & the ginger soy dressing.  The portions are generous & they give you a piece of bread, too.

On my first visit I had the chicken and dumplings. It was so blah and boring and corn starchy. The vegetables were under cooked and the broth under seasoned. Also, the chicken in it seemed to be more like mystery meat. 
The second time I went I just went with the grilled cheese and soup. Pretty blah as well. They don't seem to season any of their food here???
The third time I went reluctantly for a friends birthday party. This time I tried the over-hyped short ribs. Again, blah. Over priced, over reduced sauce, overly fatty small piece of meat, but the green beans with it were delicious!

It's right next to the Circle K on the corner of 16th and Thomas.  Last Satuday my daughter and I started out to run some errands and one of them was right by Lucky Boy's.  We were greated warmly and it appeared to be a mother and son.   Mom was working the grill and son was taking the orders.  My daughter had her standard hot dog and I ordered a 1/4 burger with bacon and swiss.  We got fries and I got an order of fried zuchinni sticks.  My daughter had a butterscotch milkshake.  That was one of the best shakes I have tasted in a while.  It was not overly sweet and it was thick and creamy.  Our food came out hot and fresh, so hot we had to wait a few minutes for it to cool off.  My burger was done to perfection.  It was delish!!  I am somewhat of a purist so I did not have all the standard condiments on my burger, just the burger, cheese and bacon and I added some ketchup.  Excellent!  My daughter's hot dog did not last long.  She said it was awesome....and gave it a thumbs up.  High praise from her.  The fries......oh the fries.  Crispy on the outside and potatoy fulffiness on the inside.  They were sheer perfection!!  I'm getting hungry for them again just writing this.  The zuchinni sticks were excellent too.  They had a really nice, crunchy batter on the outside but it did not overwhelm the zuchinni inside.  All in all the food was excellent.  It's a little more than standard fast food but honestly, you get what you pay for and this was worth every penny.  

The inside is not very big but there are several tables to sit and a little bar over looking the drive thru.  The drive thu is old school.  A little bell goes off when I car pulls in and your order is taken.  It seemed the cars had to wait a bit but I think the wait is well worth it.  The inside is also clean.

Let's first start with the atmosphere, serious techno beats at 6:30pm on a Thursday is not relaxing. The lights were bright - and it's not really a club atmosphere so why the club music? I am not a big person by any means but I felt as though I was sitting in a little kids chair, I could not imagine if I were a bigger guy. 

We started with the spring rolls which were downright gross in my opinion. The pork just had a really funny flavor and they were over-cooked. My boyfriend ate them, but he eats everything ...he even said so himself, so I doubt he really liked them either.

We split four rolls 1) Florida- good flavor, the avocado was fresh and perfect. The tuna is that mashed chopped-up kind and it was just be so much better if it was just a nice small piece of raw tuna.  I also felt like all the rolls were a bit warm.

2) Orange Blossom- Again with the chopped tuna, but at least they had a nice salmon piece. I liked this roll flavor-wise but again with the oddly warm temp.

3) Surf & Turf- It was ok, but I prefer cowfish Burgushi. The meat was just odd ( couldn't tell if it was lightly seared, raw etc.) Just not a huge fan

4) Spider Roll- Worst spider roll I've ever had. It was inedible for me- I had one slice and gave up. It honestly tasted like it had sand in it, even my boyfriend had trouble with this one.

The cupcakes are delicious and I come on the regular to surprise coworkers with delicious sweets. Even when I was breastfeeding, I was advised my lactation consultant they would make lactation cookies. I would call ahead and order them and man, I think I gained like 15 lbs from those damn cookies. 

So, when it came to ordering a large cake for 60 people for my son's 1st birthday or course I chose Peridot Sweets. Everyone said, go to Freeds! Or go here or there. And I stuck by Peridot sweets. I came in during a lunch break to put my order in and went over all the details. I had originally gotten a 12 inch as there were less people originally going to be attending the party. I had ordered a funfetti cake with a crème center. Perfect for a little boys birthday with a bunch of little kids. Who doesn't love funfetti. We went over the decorations and everything seemed great. Picked my cake up on the day of the event and it looked beautiful. I had called earlier in the week to actually make it a 14 inch cause more mouths to feed unexpectedly. 

So, party is on. We sing happy birthday and cut into that beautiful cake. UMM.. Why is my funfetti cake brown and why is it super gooey. Like crumbling down. Oh well, lets put some vanilla ice cream on that sucker and hope people don't notice. Well they did notice as I was telling everyone how excited I was for this funfetti cake. Someone asked me if I ordered a Mexican Cake.. hmmm.. I dunno. 

Anyways. I ended up taking a photo of the inside of the cake and going into the location the following Monday. I talked to a lady that was trying to tell me she took my order that she understood that I wanted sprinkles in the crème. Ok so what the hell was the brown cake? I had never talked to this lady in my life. So, the manager/owner overheard us and stepped in. She advised when she saw the order she thought it was weird. I have no idea if she thought it was weird, why she didn't call me and just made the cake. But, you know she handled it professionally and apologized to me. I really was not expecting much except to find out what went on and to advise them of how unhappy I was. She ended up refunding me for the cost of the cake-not the decoration, but I was happy with this. 

I will definitely come back to get more cupcakes, but would not order a special made cake from them unless I knew it was very clear on exactly what I wanted. I guess it was a case of bad communication..",2016-05-15 05:53:55

I'm pretty sure that by now I've had a taste of most everything on the menu, and while nothing stands out as being outrageously delicious, nothing is particularly bad either. Some of the dishes I tend to prefer over others includes chinese broccoli, bao (pork rolls) and pineapple fried rice. Everything else is just so-so.

I do like the prices (around $2-3 a dish) and it makes for an enjoyable out-of the-ordinary-brunch outing for larger groups, but it does seem as though you get easily overlooked by the dim sum cart when you're at a small table, so I would seek alternative dining options if that's the case.",2013-01-25 21:51:08

First time coming here as I wanted to try the new viennoiseries.

The place was already filled with people eating high tea. 

Tried the double cheese croissant, ham and cheese danish, sausage croissant, and smoked salmon and spinach danish. Nothing special about them. All of them are not fluffy enough, way too firm.

The double cheese croissant, just a croissant with some cheese on top and a tiny bit of cheese in the middle. 

The ham and cheese danish, again, not much cheese flavour. In the middle there is a very thin piece of ham, close to nothing.

The sausage in the sausage croissant is very soft. Unlike the sausage buns in Chinese bakeries, the sausage used is the European type. However, the croissant itself is very soggy from the sausage. 

The smoked salmon and spinach danish was the worst. The danish is very soggy from all the water coming from the spinach.

The reason being was that although I had a buzzer, I acquired all three of my dishes at different times and in different fashion. When it first buzzed, I went up and got my first dish. 10 minutes passed and then finally the second dish was brought out to us.Another 5 min passed and I finally had to go up again.

I kept hearing about the burger with the extra foie gras, so obviously I had to try it. 

It is indeed awesome. It's not the best burger I've had in my life however, which is what I was hoping for. 

At 27-28$, I fully expected to have my mind blown. What I got was a really good - no; an excellent burger with great meat, a good bun, and a hint of a taste of foie gras. The taste of the cheese was completely lost, and so is taste of foie gras.

I think there's a better burger to be made with these quality ingredients. Maybe a different, tastier cheese, and perhaps a different cooking method for the foie gras so the taste is more pronounced. 

I think there were caramelized onions? I'm not sure. 

Maybe even a completely different burger with the same ingredients but without the sauce, and with salad, tomato, raw onions and cold foie gras. That could be exiting, I don't know. 

Oh and one more thing - my friend had the spaghetti. It looks awesome, and he described it as really good. He was a little disappointed by the size of the portion however. I get that truffle sauce is expensive, but pastas are not. It's not a valid reason to put 15 spaghettis on a plate and call it a main course.

Nevertheless, I still recommend that you try this place at least once. I look forward to trying the spaghetti on a future visit actually.

Yeah. It's good. Pricey though. The kinda place where beautiful yuppies go to be seen, and they overpay a little for that privilege.

It's nice that their kitchen is open late, very convenient.

I wish these was a bigger and better beer selection. 

The place looked like it would feel a bit crammed, but it's not that bad. We had a table by the window, it worked out for us 3 big men.

Ordered the spicy margarita, mine was good with just the right amount of heat. My friend's 1st was good but the second didn't even come close the the 1st. Bartender in training - not sure how you get around that but the manager needs to figure out how to provide consistent drinks at the bar. On to the food-we ordered the chips and salsa and then ordered the guacamole. Chips were hot and just enough salt. Salsa was good but was lacking in heat. Maybe there should be two options. The guacamole - had to ask about it a second time in order to get it delivered to us. Chunky, a little too chunky-almost as if the person making it didn't finish mashing it. Again-lacked heat and was overly onion tasting. Ordered the chop salad-tasty although they should leave off the jalapeño rings. Ordered ""you are going the wrong way"" and ""it goes to the ducks"" tacos. My friend has a dairy allergy so the bartender decided to put that note on our entire order. By the time the food arrived, I didn't say anything but I am hoping/guessing that is why my tacos had little to no flavor. They were basically the meat and none of the toppings-bland. I would go back to give it another chance but there are other places in the area that deliver consistently. I don't mind paying for the chips & salsa as others have posted this as a problem, just be good. Bartenders could do a better job making the specialty drinks. And pay better attention to what is ordered.

This isn't your average pizza place - that's for sure. Pizza is a polarizing topic as it is, and most places are either New York style or Chicago style or Italian style or West Coast style (or some variation of these). This is Quad City pizza - something I've never had from a place I've never been. I'm told this is the only place you can get pizza like this in the Valley - I believe that. I don't think this style really makes its way outside of the Quad Cities. 

Let me just say that there appear to be shenanigans going on with this restaurant's web page. Nearly 60 reviews hidden from view. Some may well be fake, but many are clearly legitimate. Also, many of them appear to be favorable. In case you were wondering, the hidden consensus tells a different story than the handful of reviews allowed to remain above the fog. If mine ends up in the trash, I'll KNOW something is up. Anyway - I will just state now that my review of this place is probably closer to a 4 than a 5 - and I'll tell you why, but I do feel this place earns a 5 on the merits of being different and because the shenanigans brought their score to a 3 which is just nonsense. There's no way this place is a 3. 

So we ordered the pit bread, a caesar salad, a pizza with half of their famous sausage and half pepperoni, and I washed it down with beer. The pit bread is basically just their small/medium pizza crust with melted mozzarella cheese all basted with garlic butter and with a side of their pizza sauce to dip. The sauce was a mild and yet zesty marinara flavor with a hint of sweet. It was good. The pit bread was a solid cheese stick. If you like the flavor of Papa John's cheese bread (as I admit I do), but don't care for the chemical fake mass-produced-ness of it, then this is a solid choice (and a fair comparison) - it's also cut into strips the same exact way. It's also a hint of what's to come with the pizza, but you'll still be surprised. 

The salad was interesting - the chicken was tender and juicy, but almost had the flavor of chicken soup chicken rather than grilled. I liked their dressing and croutons. Overall, it was good - just a little different. They offer the chicken crispy as well which I would like to try. As we were eating, they brought by a taco pizza which looked like a party. I asked how it was made and the description was something I had never heard of before - intriguing. Part of the draw of this place has to be their unique pies. 

Now the pizza. The best way for me to describe it is to say that it's like a Chicago style deep dish, but on a thin New York crust - but even that's not doing it justice. It's different. The toppings are cooked under the cheese and they dust it with spices. Now the pepperoni side was great. I liked the flavor of everything about it. The sausage side was another story. Now, this is the polarizing factor. You can't go here expecting italian sausage - which is what pretty much every other place serves. I didn't expect that (but that's what I truly like), and that's not what I got. 

Their sausage is made from Pork Sirloin - they make it in-house with tender loving care. You can't really find this elsewhere. Your mouth will want to relate it to something else it has tasted if you're eating it for the first time, but the comparisons you are drawing will be wrong. Now Pork Sirloin isn't the most flavorful of meats on its own, so they season it... lots. It's an interesting blend for sure. The first thing I noticed was that the sausage was a layer under the cheese of tiny tender sausage crumbles rather than big sausage rocks that you may be used to. It's a unique taste and texture. 

Now out here in the South West, we've been exposed to some cheap frozen pizza brands that have a slightly similar texture of sausage crumbles, but just know that this is vastly different in terms of flavor and especially quality. Now I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage, but I think it's something I would definitely have to try a few times to get used to it. I know this place has some regulars who are addicted to it... those who grew up in the Quad Cities definitely.

The restaurant has a great location and even a nice patio overlooking a gorgeous grassy bank canal. If you go for dinner at sunset, it can be a lovely experience. The name of the place is puzzling - why not call it Quad City Pizza or something that echoes its roots... something that starts a discussion or begs questions. Pizza Pit sounds like a lesser more common joint. This is a unique family-owned restaurant people will drive across town to visit.",2012-02-23 04:43:18

They are in the middle of a remodel and that makes things difficult, but the new construction looks like it is going to be very nice when it is finished.

My friend and I came in on a Friday night around 4 to get a mani/pedi done. I've been here before and had a very good experience and was expecting more of the same.

They were busier than the last time I'd been in, but right away we were asked to select our colors and were offered massage chairs at the pedicure stations. Last time I was here, I felt like I got the works on my feet, they were thorough and did a very good job. This time, my technician just seemed disinterested, as if she wanted to get me out of the chair right away. I had to ask her twice to fix one of my toes - the polish I had selected was sheer and it just wasn't looking very nice. Really now, if I can see a blemish from a few feet away, how can you not see that from ONE foot away? And why should I have to ask? You should be doing a careful job and if you screw up, you should fix it automatically.

I didn't get much of any kind of foot massage, she just kind of slapped my legs and punched my feet, which I do NOT like. In past I've gotten leg massages, which are very nice, but this time, nothing. My friend's technician was slower so her pedi took way longer but I know that my technician did not do the best job.

My fingernails were okay, again I had to ask her to fix a streaky part of my nail before she tried to put topcoat on it. All in, not as good of an experience as before, but frankly I think it depends on the technician you get. I've never been offered drinks or magazines or anything when I've come here so I don't know whether I'm missing out on something!

In the end, my pedicure was okay, lasted quite a while, especially after a week of beach and ocean, but my toenails were uneven as they grew in, so I had to go and get another pedicure two weeks later at another location. My manicure though chipped within a day and a half (and I was being careful, no dishes, short shower, etc to try to get it to last longer). Probably the worst-lasting manicure I've had in a while.

The deal they have going is a $35 mani/pedi which is standard everywhere but this place is a little more upscale and feels a little nicer than others. I'll probably go back here but I'll have to be more direct with the technicians who seem to not know how to do their jobs.",2012-07-13 15:55:28

3 GUYS:
3 Guys is my favorite drink here. Signature Pearl Milk Tea with Grass Jelly and Mango Pudding. The combination of toppings give such a unique experience: chewy from tapioca, slightly bitter from grass jelly, sweet from mango pudding and umami from the tea. That's almost all taste sensations in one drink!

This is probably the MOST VALUE bubble tea there is because you get 3 toppings for just $5 regular or $5.5 large. Where in other places like Chatime or Gong Cha, you'll need to pay for extra 2 or 3 toppings, which is $1-1.8, to match the same.


SAGO TARO MILK TEA:
Such a refreshing drink for Taro lovers. Coming from the Philippines where sago is popular, I just love the sago here. I haven't seen other places offering sago. What I would've liked more is if they have real taro bits like they do in Chatime.

My tip is to also add Tapioca. Then you'll have a really bubbly day :)


MATCHA MACCHIATO:
This was my least favorite out of what I've tried. I'm a big matcha lover - the stronger the better. I find the matcha to be too weak for my liking. I also prefer the Cream Foam at Gong Cha. The cream foam just didn't have that unique umami taste that Gong Cha has.


BLACK TEA MACCHIATO:
I tried this following a friend's recommendation since it's her favorite. I really liked. The tea taste is very strong and perfectly balanced by the Cream Foam.


Fun Fact:
I find it so interesting that CoCo Tea makes 100 Pearl Milk Teas every second across the globe.",2016-04-21 22:52:00

Partner and I came here tonight because I'm currently carb loading for a half marathon this Sunday. We've been here before for brunch only and found the restaurant very heartwarming, welcoming, and romantic with the twinkling, wicker basket style decor. In the warmer season the sidewalk patio is also open. Unfortunately they are located a bit off the downtown core - still super convenient of a short walk from the Financial District (10-15 minutes) with parking spots everywhere. However, might be hard to find for some folks since the front door is located off to the side, not facing King Street East.

Food- 3.5/5. Again, how could one not love carbs and fat. Italian is always a favorite. However, after consulting my partner, who actually eats Italian food very often when he goes out, he said the pasta and pizza were only ""ok"". A complimentary bread basket featuring ""nice"" bread and EVOO+BV was given at the start. 

Many vegetarian options here for pastas and pizzas compared to other Italian places like Mercatto where vegetarians are pretty much stuck ordering the same 1-2 items every time, i.e. margherita pizza. Not vegan friendly though. We ordered the tricolore pasta (vegetarian), which contained white wine braised zucchini, very few roasted cherry tomatoes, red onions, bocconcini (mozzarella), and basil. All of their pastas are homemade and cooked perfectly al dente (gluten-free pasta is also an option but these are store-purchased). Partner said the pasta was mediocre, better than at Mercatto since more veggie toppings and more veggie options, but comparable to Hot House pastas. The fresh mozzarella bits were my absolute favorite - so chewy and no after taste, very fresh. We also ordered the zucchina pizza, featuring tomato sauce, grilled yellow & green zucchini, bufalo ricotta, red onions, and mint. The dough was thin and a bit soggy due to the tomato sauce except at the crust, which was thick and not too hard, cripsy, or bitter like usual pizza crust. I loved the crust omg, chewy and perfectly risen. The ricotta was also perfection.

PS. The panini sandwiches (around $10) are only available at lunch, sorry.

Value- 4/5. Pretty good value for a romantic, fancy-ish. Mains are between $20-30, but the portion sizes are pretty big and filling unlike at fancier Italian restaurants like Buca.

Venue- 4/5. Twinkle, twinkle little star. Lots of space inside with large tables available for group seating. Perfect for large groups actually, but do make a prior reservation. Lost 1 star for being a bit hard to find.

Service- 3/5. Very warm staff. However, after serving the food and bringing a jug of water we barely saw them again. No offers of fresh pepper or cheese with our mains, but no big deal.

Will be back again, but perhaps after trying a few other Italian restaurants to build up my critic credentials lol",2017-05-06 05:03:53

I came in on a Friday evening at about 7pm and there were only 2 waitresses working the floor. The place was considerably full. The tables in the back were all full and there were only a couple tables in the front and a couple of seats at the bar that were empty. The waitresses that were on duty were very friendly and very helpful, but all their efforts weren't enough to keep up with a full restaurant.

Just to give you an idea of wait times, my friend and I were seated at a table 4 steps from the bar where they grab our drinks. We waited about 10 minutes for our glasses of water to be delivered to our table (at one point, I was just tempted to get it myself because I was so thirsty). Our app took 20 minutes to get delivered and our wings and fries (don't think it takes that long to cook wings and fries) were delivered another 20 minutes after that. The food was mediocre. The wings that I had at the City Place location were much juicier. These ones were pretty dry.

Thank you for making it so easy for me to eat here... You are beyond accommodating with my vegan needs and everything always tastes so good.

It's located on Maryland parkway and Charleston. It's pretty tiny but full of delicious food. The pastry case is always stocked with vegan and non vegan options. *the zucchini banana chocolate muffin is so ridiculously good!!! Ask them to warm it for you and it practically melts in your mouth. The ""cheesecakes"" have never ever disappointed. The blueberry is fabulous! Never tastes artificial and the crust is perfectly crisp! The coffee has never disappointed, made hot and fresh, and always smooth. The melon waters... The turmeric and canteloupe is by far my favorite... It is a perfect summer beverage. 

The smoothies... We've tried the cocoa super food (smooth and delicious and hearty) and the coconut almond (light, slightly sweet, and thirst quenching) I would recommend either after a lifting session or yoga. Both are full of nutrients and electrolytes. 

The sandwiches... So far we have tried the good earth pita (stocked with veggies and full vegan goodness)  and the tree of life pita (our fav) very hearty and the dressing was out of this world!! 

The salads... The Thai peanut was surprisingly very very good! I wasn't expecting it to be as savory as it was and textures all blended surprisingly well. It was a day we split the salad and a pita and we were both very very full and satisfied. THE BIZZNESS, is exactly that, the business! We always try different options. You get to choose three options over chopped kale in a perfect lemon vinaigrette. So far we have tried the hummus, the babagonoosh, roasted beet and quinoa, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, spiced chickpeas, avocado... I think you get the Idea (so many options)! It's always a go to
For us and is always delicious. 

Their soups are insane. The split pea and lentil are two of my favorites. I would recommend checking out their face book daily to see what the days options are. They also had a vegan tamale that was put of this world. My boyfriend said it was the best tamale he has ever eaten. If you see one make sure to grab it.

An antique store sounded like the perfect way to find something unusual, so I Yelp'ed it and found a number of options.  I started my journey by heading to the Red Rooster Antique Mall (closing 7/15/10) when I stumbled upon the Charlston Antique Mall, which is just next door.

As I wandered through the place, I couldn't help but think about how similar it was to the San Francisco Antique Mall.  Basically, it is a large space with a series of small booths and rooms, provided by different antique vendors.  Definitely a fun place to walk around.

A few things you might find include:

1. Casino matchbooks, ash trays, dice, cards, soap bars, and memorabilia ($5+)
2. Vintage video game systems by Sega and Coleco ($25-85)
3. Chandeliers, paintings, furniture, and asian art ($50-250+)
4. Star Wars items and other collectibles
5. Yellow ostrich shoes (Size 13 men's)

and so much more..

The people in the store were very friendly and asked if I needed assistance finding anything in particular.  Most of the people appered to be vendors working on their displays and what not, and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves and socializing.

I did not find an excessive amount of Las Vegas memorabilia, which is what I was hoping to find, but they did have an amazing assortment of stuff (see photos).  Plan to spend at least an hour, because it will take that long to just walk through and glance at everything.

Prices seemed high on some items and low on others.  That is likely the result of having many different vendors.  There are certainly some deals, depending on what you are looking for.  Don't be afraid to negotiate.",2010-06-27 02:07:10

I love me some Little Miss, and Worth's interesting yet restrained rendition complimented the ingredient in a way that shows a culinary deftness and level of inspiration that is hard to be found in most other sandwich place in the valley.

Every sandwich I've had here was beyond on point. There's a level of attention to detail that becomes evident regarding composition, quality, balance, and creativity in all their sandwiches regardless of how traditional or unconventional any one leans.

Ingredients, ingredients, ingredients... Everything is local and fresh, and upon first bite this alone starts pimpslapping most other joints. Everything they produce in house is legit in it's own right.  I swear I would buy a bucket of their crispy chicken if they sold it like that.

I haven't even mentioned the decor and atmosphere, it's not like nothing else in Pittsburgh and I really think it sets a new standard. I just hope others can keep up. :)",2015-08-05 16:16:45
WG1fKAUL2RkIVGHc4om_og,mgBV3YmtaEqKmvrOHKQXfA,Ul6JwluSTm12PVDIqnNaTg,4,1,0,1,Went on a double date with friends. I will start with the bad. It took over 45 minuets for our meals to come from when we ordered (we ordered them after our appetizers). But it took no time for our appetizers and drinks to come. But with that said out waitress was great. Letting us know that the kitchen was backed up and when to expect the food etc. also when we got the food it was fantastic. I got the crocodile appetizer and for my meal the Cuban  sandwich. All very good. We also shared the hot bean dip and everyone else enjoyed their meals. I would of given this place a lower score if they food had not been so good when it did come out. Also since the weather was nice it was a great night to sit outside. Only issue was the bad river/shit smell that blew past every now and then but it did not ruin the experience.,2014-08-18 01:18:03

It is pretty effin awesome.  I have definitely had better massages here than when I've paid full price for them, but I've also had better massages by seasoned professionals.  It can be hit or miss, but in general I've only had great experiences here.

Bottom line, for the price it can't be beat.  It is $37 for a session that lasts an hour, and that includes an assessment and some follow-up.  They also have ""stress-buster"" cards which, when filled out, entitle you to a free massage.  Awesomeness.

The real secret  here is their ""specialty clinics"" - focused on specific injuries or conditions, such as pregnancy, sports, central nervous system, M.S., and others.  What is amazing about these massages is that they are $15 each.  Wowza!  I went last night for the pregnancy clinic and I plan to go every week at that price - the student was knowledgeable and really helpful with low back pain.  It was great. It is actually affordable and accessible to people of all socio-economic classes!

One star off because while I love it here, there are times where it can be a less than relaxing experience.  Since all the clients are only divided by curtains you can hear all the nitty gritty details of  other people's injuries or complaints.  It can also be hit or miss with the students, so my best advice is fine a massage therapist you like and stick with that person for as long as you can - you won't regret it.",2009-11-18 15:03:37
aD5ZEygrlaA6rxTIaVmELA,1N4z5Okxbl9Bz6Min-ZYTQ,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,2,0,0,0,"I went here for a pre-show dinner before JT's Man of the Woods tour. It was a good idea that I made reservations on Open Table because it was busy, even at 6pm on a Sunday. (Excitement of our Vegas Golden Knights fans, mixed with JT/Nsync fans).

We were seated in the 2nd level, which allowed us to see the show. This is a lively, interactive dining experience. I was kinda prepared for it, since there is a disclaimer/warning on the restaurant's website. There was a emcee, dressed up in rocker Japanese garb, who did sake bombs with a table whenever they were ordered. My favorite part of the act was the Nsync vs. Backstreet Boys medley they performed. All the wait staff do the dances along with the emcee. It was fantastic.

I wish I could say the same for the food. If you are a sushi fanatic, this is not the place for you. It was underwhelming. For the appetizers, we ordered pork gyoza, edamame, and shrimp/vegetable tempura. My one friend ordered miso soup. These were all pretty basic. They forgot our edamame. One friend ordered shrimp tempura roll, the other ordered more temura, requesting all sweet potato, which they accommodated. She also ordered a cocktail, assisted by our server's recommendation, claiming her choice was great, since she likes fruity drinks. My friend said that was not the case when she tasted it. She wished it was more sweet. For my main course, I ordered sake (salmon sashimi). It was highway robbery (in my opinion) to pay $5/piece. I got 2. It tasted the way it's supposed to. I was probably more excited to eat it since it was my first sushi since I had surgery 4 months ago. 

I supposed, since we were on the Strip, that is the reason for the exorbitant prices. We decided to split the check in 3-ways, which amounted to $30/pp, including tip. Ridunkulous if you ask me. As my friend pointed out, it was more out of convenience that we chose this restaurant, as it was a stone's throw away from T-Mobile Arena. 

Personally, I would not go to this establishment again. I will find another place to eat in The Park before my next concert.",2018-04-23 05:14:15

the place is cute and has plenty of room to avoid a 2 hour wait....and the pizza was good. wood oven baked so it had that little burnt crispy edge. we had the mahhhhgahhhhrita pizza and it was enough to stave our pizza crave. and then we indulged in their version of the desert pizza cookie. although quite bigger than oregano's, it wasn't as sweet, but altogether still tasty!

The location may seem like a scavenger hunt... if you're coming from Rainbow Blvd., making a right onto W. Sunset Rd., you'll drive up and when you see tall office buildings and shiny reflective windows, you'll know you're almost there.. make a left as soon as you see an entry to go in... stay on the left side of the whole complex and when you see the office building number 8337, it's behind that building and you'll be making a slight right passing it. Baguette Cafe will be next to Bank of America. Hope these directions help in your hunt if you decide to give this cafe a try.

I walked in and was greeted right away with a friendly, sweet smile from a gentleman named Olivier. He asked me my name and if I worked in one of the offices nearby and I told him no, but that I stopped by because I wanted to try this cafe. He was happy that I came here and started to passionately talk about what's the specials are today and specifically told me each ingredient that were in those dishes. He was very informative as if he knew everything by heart to the very last seasoning. I love it when you can tell when someone has the ""fire"" for flavor and food... He enjoyed telling me everything as if he was sharing his favorite recipe with me. All this, while I don't have any makeup on... I know scary right??!?!? It's not even Halloween yet!! Yikes! And he still treated me as if I was his #1 guest. 

I ended up trying the Prosciutto Baguette which consist of: mixed greens, tomato, prosciutto, salami, blue cheese, walnut, and celery spread. My sandwich and a handful portion of mixed green salad that had a tangy dressing on top of it was plated on a rectangular white glass dish. Olivier brought me some utensils and hope I enjoy my meal. 

From the first look at this Baguette.. I was afraid the bread would be tougher than leather to chew and harder than rock to break glass.. BUT it wasn't at all the case. It was tough on the outside, since most baguette are made that way and soft in the inside... almost spongy. The bread was good, but I was chewing way more than I ever did when eating a sandwich. I actually woke up the next day with a slight sore jaw, but I remember Olivier mentioning that I can order it Panini- style instead of Baguette. There wasn't anything wrong with the Baguette, as a matter of fact the whole sandwich was satisfying and all the ingredients complimented each other. The celery spread tasted light and fresh with a touch of tartness... it kept me guessing what's in it, but it was a delicious spread that softened the saltiness of the freshly cut prosciutto. The walnuts even made it mellow, in a sense giving it a smooth flavor. The blue cheese wasn't so profound, but you can taste it was there. Overall, I did enjoyed this meal. I washed my palate down with some Green Tea Pomegranate Iced Tea that they served there. It was the bitter kind without having any sugar, but I like it sometimes like that. 

I bought two muffins on my way out: the Pumpkin and Strawberry. I recall Olivier bringing out a fresh batch of muffins when I first walked in the cafe... they ran out of the Banana Nut Muffin, which I wanted to try, but the Pumpkin Muffin was out of this world delicious! I originally was only going to one bite and start my errands, but it so happens that before I knew it... I did my own magical act and the Pumpkin Muffin disappeared in thin air into my tummy. I know I didn't know I had such talent, but I was still in disbelief that I ate it all in a few seconds. Poof!! Abbra Cudabbra give me another Pumpkin muffin!! :( Sadly I couldn't make it happen and my muffin bag was still empty... darn. I saved the Strawberry Muffin for my date and he asked me if it was still good?!??! Ooo I wanted to hit him upside his head, but no no I'm not a violent person so I told him.. of course it's still good, they made it today!!! What?!? Is he crazy to think I'm going to give him a rotten, spoiled muffin??! Come on! He later told me he ate it for breakfast the next day and it was good. 

This cafe isn't a fast food order and BAM it comes out in a flash... no siree bob... they make it after you order and use the freshest ingredients. If you have time to relax, then you'll enjoy this place... but if you want something quick... maybe a salad or muffin doesn't take that long... they have a good selection of salads if that's something you are looking for. Fraps, hot chocolate, smoothies too! They have outside seating as well and bring out the food for you when it's ready. They even play catchy, fun even romantic french music.. nice listening pleasure while you grab a bite to eat or wanting to relax over some tea or coffee. 

Even though it might be challenging to find this cafe, you'll be happy you took the journey to find it.",2010-10-27 06:21:32

Okay, well for starters I almost gave up since the sign outside still says Kabuki and not Sakana!  I was actually already going to take one star off for the fact I drove around and around...until I read a little yelp tip that finally led me to this treasure.  When we walked in we were immediately greeted and asked if we wanted a table or sushi bar....I said table, but the sushi bar chef yelled sushi bar at the hostess and apparently he calls the shots =P  Eating at the sushi bar was definitely an advantage, we called off our orders to the chef and he made them on the spot! 

For starters this place has AYCE for $22.95...cheapest AYCE in Vegas that I know of.  So most important part of AYCE is freshness and the rice to fish ratio for the sushi.  I swear there were not more than 20 kernels of rice per piece of fish!  I would equate this to almost eating sashimi with the small amount of rice per piece.  The salmon, white tuna, unagi, seared tuna were all extremely fresh and well prepared.  Okay, so the best part is how they sear off the tuna and unagi with a blow torch....it was still piping hot when I consumed it, pure heaven! The specials that day were salmon belly and toro steak....again more bites of perfection!  We tried a few rolls that were on their dinner/one time only part of the AYCE menu as well.  The towering sashimi poke with wonton crisps...I could have just sat there and eaten that all night, cripsy wonton shell with fresh fish and a touch of acidity....too bad we were limited to one order per person =(.  We also tried their Screaming O and the Sashimi Roll, both of which were well prepared as well.  The only thing I honestly did not like....the plum ice cream (this was slightly atrocious to be since it reminded me of the pink amoxicillin (antibiotic) medication I had as a child that they tried to disguise with some unknown flavor.  But, minor flaw given they have plenty of other options for dessert.  Make sure you look at their updated menus on the counter as well....the one that is laminated that they hand you is missing a few items.  If you love AYCE sushi....you have to try this place out.

If you like your potatoes ""crispy"", I would highly recommend the new line of ""smashed potatoes"" instead of fries because of the increased surface area of potato skin. The gravy is always pipping hot and savoury and the cheese curds melt beautifully in a stringy fashion that epitomizes how poutines should be! The portion sizes at Smoke's are huge and now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever been able to finish a medium sized poutine by myself.

I would have given it a 1 star based on that experience.

This time, I got the sesame bagel with scallion cream cheese and it was not terrible but it still just was not good. The bagel was pretty bland. And I asked for it toasted and it was warm but definitely not toasted!! The schmear tasted like plain cream cheese with like a few scallion pieces in it.

I didn't like how they had like 20 boxes of tea but they did not have any plain black tea or a breakfast tea or just plain lipton. How do you not carry that?! Weird. Also the staff both times were not very welcoming. This morning, I was the only person in the place and they were rushing me!! They had like a bunch of cream cheese choices, I had to read them all before I picked one!! Jeeze!! lol.

- Other pastry stuffed with pork (3)
- Fried tofu (3)
- Some white ball with a colorful dot that I didn't taste (3)
- Round/soft wonton like stuffed with shrimp (4)
- Lo main -very skinny noodles
- Chicken feet in red sauce (I really wanted to try those)
- Fried wontons, they were not stuffed with cream cheese, but with shrimp (4)
- Some sort of spring rolls, very big and turned out to be stuffed with shrimp 
   (2, cut in 3 pieces each)
- Sesame seed balls (3)
- Fried dough with honey
- Jello/mango dessert

Like a lot of reviews here I've been to the original Ike's in the Castro in SF many times.  I travel to SF several times a year and always make a point to visit Ike's.  I truly think that it is the best sandwich I've ever had.  

So big question...was this Ike's as good as the one in San Francisco??  Well, I'm glad to report that it is!  Man I'm so happy.

I was with a buddy of mine and we ended up ordering the Kryptonite,  This sandwich is no joke.  It's $26 but for two sandwiches.  I knew how big Ike's sandwiches are and I knew that I wouldn't probably even make it through one.  

The Kryptonite had everything in it.  Cheese sticks, onion rings, pesto, turkey, roast beef, ham, pastrami, bacon, stuffed jalapenos.  I mean just about everything!  It was amazing, and yes I had it on the Dutch crunch roll.

There are so many sandwiches to choose from at Ike's.  All of the favorites are there and they even offer vegan sandwiches too.  I doubt that I will get close to even trying half of the sandwiches, but I have my favorite.  The 98. Jaymee Sirewich is probably my personal favorite, but when I go back Im going to try something different.  

The best thing about Ike's here in Mesa is tables to sit and eat your sandwich!  If you have ever been to the original location you would appreciate how good that is!  Also, they are opening a location on Mill ave in Tempe!  I hope they end up expanding to all sides of the valley, especially the NW valley!

Lastly, we ordered during happy hour.  No booze here, but we did get a free chips and drink if you ordered it to eat at the restaurant.  It's every day from 4-7 so check it out!!!!

Do yourself a favor and order the fish and chips. The icelandic cod is battered in their Kilt Lifter and the fries are perfectly crispy. I have yet to finish a whole order of this monster, so definitely a split-able item. 

Happy hour runs 3-7 pm and 10-close. $1 off pints, which brings the cost to $3.25.  $12 for a pitcher. The Kilt Lifter Scottish Ale and Oatmeal Stout are my current favorites.

Although I end up going only once or twice a year to the symphony I do love going to the TSO at the Roy Thompson Hall.  My boyfriend and I make it an event, we get dressed up, have a drink before the show, take some pictures, enjoy the concert and have a post-theatre dinner.  Because I am not too familiar with classical music, I do some research and listen to which shows I would actually enjoy as if you're like me you may or may not like all varieties of classical music.

I would also advise that if you're relatively flexible about which shows you want to go to and where you want to sit, to wait for the various sales the TSO offers throughout the season.

Today, I'm going to make an exception to not generalize as EOS had a pretty okay staff... with the exception of one person. A very rude (and very hair gelled) guy named Gus.

I was looking for a new gym nearby my house to join and this came recommended by a co-worker. I called over the phone to go over prices and was transferred to a sales rep (I believe her name was Jennifer?). She was actually nice and thorough with me. It was enough to get me in the same day. All was good so far in.

I came in at 9:00pm with one of my best friends Brianna. I spoke with two young ladies at the front desk which was my first encounter with Gus. They had to answer all my questions because while he was the nearest person to us, he didn't care to talk to us until he had to toward the end. 

He gave us what was definitely the least enticing tour we've ever had. He didn't go into detail on a single thing unless we pried it out of him, but that's what it took. Prying. 

After the tour (where we passed an office with a visible copy machine) this is where he REALLY shined. He sat us down at a sales desk and the dismissive answers began. He gave a price sheet to review and because of their down payment variations and side fees I asked if he had a copy to look over -- ""no."" Okay... I asked if he can make a copy to look over -- ""no."" Baffled by his adamant efforts to not be helpful, I asked if we can try the gym out -- ""I'll see. I need your IDs."" I asked ""you have to see if you'll allow me to try it out for a day?"" which was followed with ""Yeah.""

It was nuts. The whole time home was literally ENTIRELY spent talking about how impressively horrible his service was. I've never seen any gym facility hire a ""service specialist"" like that (... and I've been to Planet Fitness). 

I really hope someone running this gym sees this and more responsibly screens who they select to represent their facility because I liked literally everything else about this place, but he is the singular reason we not only did not sign up on the spot, but now would rather drive out of the way to go elsewhere where we are treated like our business is wanted.",2017-07-07 20:45:28

HaYpBrdNfvsLWSYZBcFXgw,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,TYZIMuHwhZo_Hizenmf8Pg,4,6,4,7,"BZ's Bar and Grill bills itself as having ""The Best Happy Hour In The 'Burgh"" or something along those lines. That I couldn't care less about as I barhop for grub not booze, and it's the former BZ's mostly excels at, offering more innovative and modern takes on tavern eats. Prior to the touring Slayer/Gojira spectacle at Stage AE recently, I had a reason to give BZ's a sporting chance and received a healthy return on my wager.

BZ's menu had been tickling my palate for some time after having examined their New American bill of fare online months ago. Due to my research, I already knew what I wanted to fill my stomach for the concert ahead well before we occupied a seat in the restaurant's cool, sleek black and blue interiors. 

Well, it was Kay who wanted the Spinach Artichoke Dip to launch our meal. A chain restaurant staple, I wasn't too enthused over the prospect, but I was won over by its hedonistic blend of cream cheese, Parmesan, and Asiago. Chunky, mossy, and highly appetizing, cuts of a buttery Crostini were provided as a vessel to carry the blobs of tempting, thermal ooze towards our mouths.

Due to Kay's decision, I had the Beef Sliders as my main and shared a Bedded Duck Pizza with the lady. 

The trio of sliders utilized thick pieces of a smoky and fiercely flavorful brisket that was too fall-apart tender to be lawful. Topped with caramelized onions, my substitution of cheddar in lieu of bleu (eew), and placed inside toasty White Castle-worthy buns, this was a perfectly indulgent treat in triplicate. 

The 6 cut pizza's lone problem was that it was a bit salty, most likely due to the curious inclusion of feta instead of the advertised goat cheese, which I would have preferred (we were not told of this switch by our server). Aside from that, the duck confit was fabulously fatty, a drizzling of olive oil making it all the richer. Garlic upped the flavor quotient a bit, almost drowning out the brackish feta, and a pile of argula cleansed the palate with every single slice. The pita bread crust was a welcome and exotic stroke of culinary cunning. 

A quoin of S'Mores Cheesecake was the dessert I singled out and singlehandedly amused my sweet tooth with. Garnished with roasted marshmallows, cordoned by lines of caramel and chocolate sauce, riddled with fragments of candy, and anchored by a graham cracker crust, this was a campfire treat one can enjoy without having to endure the Great (overrated) Outdoors or sticky, burnt fingers and mouths for that matter. 

Kay's Dessert Du Jour turned out to be a ""Fresh Fruit Trifle"" as BZ's called it. It might have been a nice, tidy, wholesome breakfast dish with some honey, nuts and perhaps lemon added to liven it up a bit, but as it was served to her, the ""trifle"" was merely a glass of yogurt with blueberries in it. Booooring. Heck, I thought trifle was supposed to have some sponge cake in it. Kay abandoned it, and I cleaned up the remainder for her. 

Overall, our dinner was no pooch, however, and I feel that BZ's is an eatery local diners would do well to keep an eye on. While many are tiring of the New American movement, BZ's offers enough novel ideas to keep this culinary genre interesting for the time being. So enjoy what they do for what it is. I know I pretty much did.

P.S. The service was acceptable. 

P.P.S. I don't know if this is worth noting, but our appetizer was half-off that evening (we ate there on a Wednesday during 'happy hour').",2013-12-02 02:25:12

I have lived around the corner for the last 10 years and have had met both friends, colleagues (realtors) and clients here. What I like about this place and why I recommend it, lets start with the story, Elses namesake a way cool chick who decided to open up a bar in the Plateau at a time when the plateau was filled with one of two categories, either Portuguese families, or all the bohemians living on the plateau back when it was really cheap, she was part of the founders of the plateau in my mind

.  I first moved to the plateau over 20 years ago, when you could find an apartment at the rate of 100$ per room, so if you had a 4,5 it would cost 450$, needless to say that at the price the people living there were able to move from one place to another easily, there were tonnes of these cheap rentals and the vibe was all about moving every year, vs having to paint (not kidding it was too easy). 

 No one had money but everyone lived for dirt cheap and went out all the time to neghborhood places that sprang up randomely like elses, the vibe was about doing whatever you wanted (which is why she is considered a rebel, see this is restaurant according to the permit, so she must sell food, but let's be real, it's a pub where you buy chilly.  

Just so you know this place can drop some serious names, I have seen poiltiicans, high end business execs, and once even someone like Will Ferrel  they are mingling in the casual place with other regulars who simply spend their entire lived there The place it around for reason it just too cool a place to not try sometime.

In those periods we seek out good veggie restaurants to eat at.  This one came at such a time, and although not bad, it wasn't anything marvelous. 

The main 'thing' here is that they serve 'imitation meat'.  Basically processed tofu which tastes (vaguely) like chicken, beef, shrimp etc.  The problem is that the rest of the dishes (minus imitation meat) are very simplistic and cooked very hurriedly.  One could have better cooked vegetarian dishes at Indian and Thai restaurants.  

I had the Buddha Delight with 'chicken' and although the 'chicken' had a vague chicken taste, it was anything but.  The rest of the dish was just a bunch of boiled vegetables; no noodles, variety of mushrooms and other extras that I've had in similarly named dishes in other places.  

The squash soup was very good, I have to say. 

Thus, unless you are a self-hating vegetarian who sorely misses the 'taste' of meat (even in a vague form) - you could have much better vegetarian dishes (minus fake meat) at other places. 

Not bad food, just not that great either.",2016-05-06 20:50:57

His pasta had too much sauce on the bottom it's almost like a noodle soup than a pasta dish,he had to ask for another bowl to drain the sauce. The pasta taste decent,not awesome but not awful. The beef was cooked perfectly tender.

It's been the 2nd time that I'm visiting this place in 1 week, and both times I ordered Tonkotsu Black. I LOVE the garlic flavour together with the broth and the noodles. I usually ask for chilli powder to add some spiciness to the meal and I usually get thin noodles just because I feel like I have more noodles to eat.

But last Sunday I decided to try out their thick noodles and I got extra thin noodles on the side, just to eat both types. Their think noodles are more chewy and I felt like it was done before I expected it to :(. Anyway, I'm biased because noodles are my favourite food in a ramen (not the pork, I usually give my pork to somebody else). But I've heard lots of people ordering think noodles with this kind of broth. 

I've never ordered other ramens but I've tasted Spicy Tantan and Tomato. They're very different in flavour, but they're both delicious. The spiciness in spicy tantan is on point for me. It's not too spicy to the point where the food becomes unenjoyable.

PROS
*Food came out quick
*Staff is very friendly 
*They had this Channel sushi roll and OMG that's the reason why I gave them 3 stars vs 2. You have to try it. It's yummy.
*Good amount of sitting areas. 
*Buy one get one free drinks (THE BEST)

CONS
*It's not located in the best part of Las Vegas. Hidden in the back of the Target shopping center. 
*Restroom was very dirty 
*Small waiting are ""Good luck in thinking you'll be sitting while your waiting for your table""
*The main reason for only 3 stars is because, it was super HOT in here. Just think, in Las Vegas during the summer and its 100+ outside and all they have are fans in the restaurant ""yup that's not going to cut it"" It was hard to enjoy your food when your sweating dripping water.

63maFLw2QPo7Tt9WjIdiHA,Dh4HFUiw9Ip5wFQM_kEbbw,37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg,5,0,0,1,"....The flavours were discernible by the menu descriptions, and nothing came off as pretentious or over-reaching.   Hearing that the Carte Blache (their 5 or 7 course tasting  menus) was comprised primarily of menu items, we decided that we would prefer to choose our dishes to ensure that we got our must-have dishes (hello, foie gras, I'm talking about you). This is what we had:

 
Bread Basket
Simple and delicious with a fluffy rich white bun and a heartier whole grain selection.
 
Mixed Wild Mushrooms with Spanish Fried Egg and Brioche Toast
The flavours here were flawless.  The mushrooms were cooked and seasoned perfectly, a celebration of earthy deep flavours.  Cut by a bright parsley garlic olive oil, the egg and brioche brought a rich, decadent element that did not overpower the mushrooms.  I had only wished that the egg had been cooked a little less (the yolk did not run as I'd hope), and the brioche had been toasted or seared well enough that it maintained some of its integrity rather than becoming an indiscernible disk of soggy carbs at the bottom of the bowl.  My other criticism was that the dish was served luke warm.  Unfortunately, this was actually true for every dish we had at Edulis.

 
Fresh Istrian White Truffle with Soft Eggs and Onion Puree
Probably the best truffle dish I have ever tasted.  The onion puree had a sweet, slightly smokey flavour, with a pleasant mild acidic note.  The eggs had a really comforting texture, gingerly speckled with fresh herbs to cut the richness.  And thank you, Edulis, for doing truffle right.  A delicate shaving of white truffles adorned the eggs so that the umami-rich flavour was distinguished, but not overwhelming.

 
Poached Foie Gras ""Facon Michel Guerard"" Du Puy Lentils, Smoked Apple Puree For someone who ordinarily is not a huge fan of De Puy Lentils, this was a stellar dish, and worth holding out on the Carte Blanche for (or ordering it in addition to the tasting). The foie itself was generously portioned and incredibly buttery, contrasted with the supple pop of the lentils beneath.  I appreciated the sweet and acidic note of the apple, and the salty crunch of the chicken skin. Way to make a girl love lentils.

Glazed Beef Cheek with Black Trumpets, Parsley Root Puree, Sunchokes, Herbs
The beef cheek was meltingly tender, and its deep rich flavour was complemented beautifully with the trumpet mushrooms.  Both of these elements worked well with the nutty, sweet sunchokes and lustrously smooth puree.

 
Kale and Duck Leg Meat Ball with Stewed Potatoes and Hazelnuts
This was probably our least favourite dish, but by no means and failure.  The meat ball lacked the moisture and the sumptuous mouthfeel I would expect from anything made of duck legs.  The stewed potatoes and hazelnuts, however, were a dream.  The potatoes were tender and beautifully seasoned, while the hazelnuts lent a contrasting crunch and nutty aroma. This would make for a beautiful holiday side.

 
Vin Santo Roasted Pear, Walnut Toffee Cream, Salted Caramel
Sitting before us looking like a Bon Appetit magazine cover, this was a light, yet indulgent and elegant dessert.  The pear had slightly caramelized exterior, that when plunged into the caramel and cream below yielded a perfect bite of sweet, salty and richness.  As someone who has poached many-a-pears, I found the roasting technique easier to eat (with a bit of care, you could cut it easily with a spoon), but a little bit more grainy in texture. Regardless, I literally ate everything in the bowl except the stem.

Spiced Apple Sorbet
Another light and refreshing end to a meat-heavy meal.  The sorbet had all of those memory-evoking holiday spices, and without the weight an ice cream, I could actually appreciate the bright acidic apple flavour.  A rendition of this may make an appearance in my freezer sometime soon.


So, for 5 savoury dishes, 2 sweet, 3 cocktails, 1 glass of wine, sparkling water and a cappuccino, the bill came to $250, a bit more than we normally spend, but the quality was testimony to its worth.  I will definitely come for a return visit, and when I do, I'll plan for an all-nighter, tuck into a 7-course Carte Blanch, and try to spend some time chatting it up with Tobey.  Congratulations Edulis on your recent success and accolades.  There is definitely good reason why you've been voted number one!",2013-05-23 00:36:39

Apparently the menu was recently updated and the restaurant is only a few weeks old. We tried a number of small plates and felt the only really great piece were the pork ribs which had a nice honey glaze on them. The avocado pork belly toast had barely any pork, the poutine was just ""eh"" (no canadian pun intended), and the fried chicken had a really smokey mustard and strange after taste that was not my favourite. The service was a little bit slow, no water refills, seats were very close together, and the vent kept blowing out cold air.

To be honest, my first experience at Flock was not pleasant. I had made the mistake of placing my order through Hurrier, a food delivery company. Unfortunately, Hurrier ""hurried"" the order. The Fancy Flock salad with chicken ($10) was submerged in liquid and had random bones in the salad. It looks like the salad was regurgitated by a bird of some sort (pun intended)

I had e-mailed Flock about my experience and head Flocker, Cory Vitiello had offered a complimentary meal to compensate for the lackluster experience. Second time around, Cory had entrusted an Uber driver with the sacred lunch. Unfortunately, the hungry Uber driver had flocked away with my lunchtime delight. 

Third time around, Cory had arrived to my office in a taxi. He brought a bunch of goodies including a new side (roasted miso brussel sprouts), a large Power flock made with Kale, a large Fancy Flock, pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich and two bottles of Pierre water. I still have left overs for another day after sharing the meal with my colleague. The food was beyond delicious. As much as I had adored the salads, the chicken sandwich in brioche buns was by far my favorite. The bun has a hint of garlic butter. The sandwich itself was garnished with beet & apple horseradish, dijon mayo, green leaf, crispy onion, tomato & avocado. It was an interplay of flavours and texture. If I have to eat a sandwich for the rest of my life, this would be it!

We went back to the lobby to request if we could sit in those seats and they were able to change our seats without any issue or hassle.  That was a plus.

Even though we live in Gilbert, we have already made plans to watch the new movies here.  The ticket prices are little more expensive but the leg room and the recliners make up for it.

There are two main exhibit halls, one housing the permanent displays and one with rotating exhibits.  There is so much more room for the things the museum owns that can now displayed that wouldn't fit in the old building.

There are many audio and video things to look at, there is information about Nevada mining, and you can find out who Emma Nevada was.

In the rotating exhibit area, there was an HD photo display by Cameron Grant called ""Unexpected Nevada.""  His photos are stunning and it's worth visiting just to see this.

There is a room for visiting school kids, there's a research room, a new gift shop, and a room for presentations with a wonderful patio outside that has a terrific view of the resort corridor.  You can also look down into the animal habitat of the Springs Preserve.

The new museum opens to the public on October 28th.  It's at the far end of the Springs Preserve parking lot.  Go and visit--you won't be disappointed!",2011-10-15 23:05:08

Snap sugar peas: 5/5 So fresh--crunchy!

Pork bone soup comes in a good portion for $9.99

I've been to Tomo before but it had been years and now I know why I stayed away. The seaweed salad was a tiny bit of seaweed on top of a pile of lettuce. I've never had it served this way at any other restaurant. Usually when you get seaweed salad, it's pretty much all seaweed. The calamari was so heavy with batter that you couldn't taste the squid at all. It was like eating a tempura hushpuppy with a little squid in the middle. 

After the appetizers, we waited a very long time before our server came back to actually take our order. By the time she returned, we debated just leaving but we put in an order for a caterpillar roll anyway. 

It was also pretty bland and so heavy with panko or whatever they fried it in, that it was pretty much tasteless.

This place has a chic environment, nice location (close enough to Uptown but don't have to worry about parking; good for pre-party dining), and opens late (which is always good for that late night sushi crave).  Been here a few times, and honestly it's nothing too special.  My recap of tonight's experience:

Service was average, got seated right away (considering there's not waiting area to speak of, I don't think they have much choice but to get our butts to a table).  I had to look for my waiter to get my glass refilled at least once.  It took awhile to get our food, but we were busy talking so it wasn't a problem.  My friend ordered a last drink and asked for the check, and guess what, he got the check and not the drink. 

Food was ok.  But for the price, I have to say the portion is tiny.  One order will not feed a grown person (comparing to Enzo, for instance, where one order is enough to feel somewhat full).  The Dragon Roll came apart a little when I picked it up with my chopsticks.  The rice in both runchy rolls (we had Philly & Spicy Salmon) seem a little mushy.  We capped off our dinner with an order of red bean ice cream (which if you haven't tried, it's the best freaking ice cream flavor... and don't worry, you can get this at any sushi/japanese place, not just here... and they all taste similar).  I have never seen a worse scoop shape of ice cream in my entire dining life.  Bascially it's just one bowl of ice cream mess, but at least it tastes good.

They were all conveniently labelled, and even though it was a very large crowd it was easy to see where to lineup.  I have to say, because the lineup was so long, that I didn't think we would get in.  But as soon as the doors opened the line moved smoother than any line I've ever been in.  Getting past security and the ticket checkers was a breeze and there was plenty of seating available.  I sat at the very top row at the side and thought the view of the stage was quite good.

I cam here with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day last week. It was our first time to Lalibela, but we're no strangers to Ethiopian food. So, we made reservations, were quickly brought to our table and everything was swell.

They offered a Valentine's day menu, so we ordered the vegetarian special. It was about $36 and was allegedly a meal for two. Odd, because on their regular menu they have a meal for 3 at $38. In retrospect, we probably should have paid the extra $2 and taken home more leftovers. More bang for your buck.

Either way, it's a pretty steep price for Ethiopian food. Most of which is very cheap to make as our meal was mostly peas, lentils, potatoes, salad and cabbage. 

We also got a bottle of Yellow Tail merlot @ ~$18. Both our food and our wine came out very quickly. And that was pretty much the last time we saw our server for the rest of the meal.

I will hand it to Lalibela, the food is good. Very good. Perhaps even better than Blue Nile. But the price is steep and the lack of service really spoiled the night for us. It's not as if the place was busy. By the time our meal was finished there was only 3 other tables with patrons at them but none of them were receiving any service. Sure, we knew there were waitresses. We could hear them talking in the kitchen so they must exist! After maybe 15-20 minutes of sitting waiting on our check, empty water and no service to speak of I actually had go up to the front desk and wave down our waitress. This is completely unacceptable for any restaurant. Short of an emergency, there is no reason why a dining room should be left unattended for 15 minutes while there are guests. My feeling was that the servers got their food out and that's all that mattered. No ""How's the food?"" no refills on waters. Nothing.

On top of that, Lalibela's menu lacks the diversity of Blue Nile. Not only does Blue Nile have great veg options, but they have sambusas, hummus, falafel, salads and a raw vegan menu. Lalibela just has about a dozen or so meat and vegetable dishes. Likely all that could be found at Blue Nile for a much lower price.

I can understand why people come here. The food is good (the injera is certainly better than Blue Nile's), but the lack of service and the price are enough to keep me out of Lalibela for good.",2012-02-20 21:21:50

I drove up to the car wash, and there were no instructions on how to enter the code from your receipt. There was only the option to purchase a wash. I decided to just punch in the numbers from my receipt onto the keypad, and it worked. They have you wait for an attendant, who guides your car into the wash. The attendant then walks around your car and sprays it down before actually entering the wash. At the end of the wash, someone is there to towel dry your car. I chose not to have them dry mine, as I pull mine around the corner and dry and detail it myself. Nice option though.

Arrived with no reservations (didn't think we'd need).   Party of 3 including a four year old.  Here are my thoughts/experience:
1) place is small. They can get a decent number of people in there...and there was!  We couldn't be seated for almost 2 hours.  The noise level was too much for my 4 yr old.  That was ok because the hostess offered us a table out front.  We took it and it was perfect!
2) food.  Had the sourdough bread, the cavatelli, the pasta with meatballs and a dish of spaghetti with just butter for the kid.  She doesn't like red sauce.  
The cavatelli was amazing!  The spaghetti with sauce and meatballs were equally amazing as it was with just butter.  The meatballs were sooo good, too!
Towards the end of the meal, my 4 yr old actually tried the spaghetti with the sauce and LOVED IT!  So much that we had to mix in her pasta with it! 

My complaints.   These are personal thoughts, so I didn't reduce the number of stars lol
-If you offer outside seating, invest in heaters and get the tables level.  Waitress poured glasses of water and it ran right off the table. Maybe try to put up a divider between business and edge of sidewalk?  Maybe a fence?
-the bread.  I don't like my bread to have a black/hard crust.  Would've been more enjoyable with an nice darkened crisp crust.  Just overdone in my book.

Trying to read this rag (apparently printed on the toilet paper quality newsprint, using some sort of ""ink"" that causes massive nasal irritation, smears, rubs off and immediately blackens my hands and stains my clothes) is an exercise in frustration.

While the paper itself is physically unappealing, the actual content is almost unreadable...I have not seen so many typos, grammatical errors and factual misstatements since the last time I wrote a business plan!

But, my business isn't reporting...or writing...or even advertising!

In theory, that is the business of the AZ Republic.

Especially reporting!

I read about the Fiesta Bowl Fiasco investigation this morning...what a blockbuster!

I read about all the shenanigans that were known for years to everyone even peripherally around the people involved in the Fiesta Bowl...everyone except the publisher of the AZ Republic who was on the Fiesta Bowl Executive committee.

I didn't read about a bunch of other Fiesta Bowl stuff that I've heard about for years...they must still be ""investigating"".

I expect that the publisher thought that all the free trips, free tickets, free hookers and blow and the rest of the swag were handed out just because he, Russell, and John were such cool guys!

Of course, that's just rumor...I'm no investigative journalist...but then I'm not sure they have any of those at the Republic, either.

I understand that newspapers are in some trouble...they haven't, by and large, figured out how to change their business model to adapt to the new paradigm...they were caught off guard (much like Russell in an ambush interview yesterday).

But the ""solutions"" being deployed by the Republic to try to ""save"" their paper (poor quality paper and ink: major cuts to reporting and editorial staff, creative content and more) are reminiscent of every other business that has missed the signs of changing times and then cut everything useful in a effort to save dollars and their hides.

It kind of makes me wonder what else they missed.

At the end of the day, this paper, like many others, will likely rest on the scrapheap of broken businesses along with the telegraphs that used to bring important news from far away places and the Smith Corona's they used to use to type their stories.",2011-04-02 15:20:35

First time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.

Second time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!

Third time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)
. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.

Plan to wait, upwards of 2 hours if you go on a weekend night.  I have pretty smart friends, so we came here at 7:30 on a Wednesday night and had nary a problem getting a table (with a 6 top).

We decided to order drinks at the bar while waiting on our last guest.  I was feeling crazy, and ordered a bloody mary (Absolut Peppar).  Bartender asked if I had ever tried a gin bloody mary.  I hadn't, and he gave me a sample.  I will stick to my vodka, but it was an awesome gesture. My liver says, ""thanks.""

Cheese Plate- I feel sorry for vegans.  This was excellent.  My only qualm is that our server did not tell us what cheese was what, came from what kind of mammal, etc. 

Lamb Lollipops-Fab.  I love these suckers, pun intended.

Dolmades-I am spoiled in this department and partial to Kabob's.

Order at the walk-up counter and keep up because the line can move quickly. The line can be long during busy hours, so I try to avoid peak times, especially because the wails of poorly managed children echo painfully loudly in the high-ceilinged counter area. (And unfortunately, there always seems to be at least one family ignoring a screaming kid in the place.) Once you've placed your order, you can take the order-is-ready buzzer and go find a seat inside or on the patio or yard seating.

I've tried a number of things on the menu, all of which have been good. The Ahi sandwich has a generous portion of perfectly seared tuna. It was too much food (and the wasabi dressing was a bit to spicy for me) and the meal turned out to be a drippy mess, but I liked it.

The barbeque chicken pizza is good but usually too wet (I like pizza crisp), and I also recommend the pepperoni pizza. The Asian salad is delicious; Joe's salads definitely show off how fresh all the ingredients are. I recently tried the ribs and pulled pork platter. It was big enough to feed two adults, and both meats were excellent.

The best item on the menu is the sweet potato fries. It's a large portion of not greasy (maybe baked?), mildly seasoned thin-sliced fries with a mango/pineapple chutney on the side. I upgrade to them at every opportunity. I also suggest keeping an eye out for seasonal/special items; I once tried a date shake and it was fantastic.

The bathrooms always seem to be extremely clean and have a fun, funky decor. Display cases with old Barbie and G.I.Joe style dolls are built into the walls, and an in-wall TV shows what looks to be old Thunderbirds (marionette) episodes on continual loop.",2010-06-27 19:18:43

The smell was so good when I walked in and I knew from looking around what I was going to get.  There comes a time in a mans life where he wants a great flavor and value.  The fajitas even had the peppers cooked just right and I don't even like peppers.  The only thing I can think of that kept me from giving a solid 5 stars would be the price.  It's a bit too pricey for what you get but others are saying this is more upscale.  I guess that's what they were going for but it's not really much more upscale than I'm used to.  Maybe I'm missing something.  The atmosphere is really welcoming and they have quick service.  The decor is newer and they have comfortable seating all around.  It was too cold to sit outside but I would have enjoyed that had it been a little warmer.  I will say this for some reason they seem to be a little slower if you are only ordering take-out which doesn't make a whole lot of since to me but hey whatever.  The chips and salsa is good it's nothing special.  The sweet tea was a bit under sweetened to my liking but the rest of my party seemed to think it was okay. What can I say I'm from Georgia and I love my sweet tea well you know sweet.  I would definitely give this spot a go.  They do reservations but each time I have been I didn't need one.

After going to Sansotei, another popular ramen joint, I was excited to try this place as I am a ramen fanatic! However, I left feeling fairly unsettled but don't get me wrong, it was still super tasty! 

First off, the egg in my ramen was hard boiled instead of soft which was disappointing. I ordered the Shoyu Pork ramen and got multiple slices pork. However, they were all poorly sliced and tasted dry times. The soup base wasn't that salty and it had a good balance. 

Also ordered a bubble tea for $3.5 but the tapioca was super hard and I think they used green instead of the usual black tea so it tasted a bit watery. She told me I had to wait 20 minutes for her to brew a new pot of black tea but she came back fast and yah think she gave me green but oh well. My friends also ordered it before the black tea ran out and theirs tasted much better. 

Overall, the biggest pro was that my tongue wasn't itchy after meaning there wasn't that much salt or MSG. Flavour wise, I would say Sansotei is better just based on quality of pork slices and egg. However, the soup base here is more sustainable (Sansotei is SO salty) and probably healthier. 

This place also has slightly bigger portions and cheaper prices.",2018-01-19 05:52:13

And I actually wonder what I am missing when I read other peoples rave reviews.  But I was working from home on Fri and some former co-workers were heading there so I decided to suck it up and meet them.

It was packed at 12:15 and even though the 3 others were there they wouldn't seat them until I arrived.  Seemed odd for a place like that but okay.  When our waitress came by she was very abrupt with us and kind of slapped the menus on the table.

Someone else came by and threw the chips and salsa down.  My main complaint with this place is the chips suck, like seriously w/o fail everytime I go there they taste stale and cold.  Do they keep them in a fridge??  Not good.

We split the crab and shrimp dip appetizer, it was good and they pita crisps they give you tasted fresh.  I had the shrimp tacos w/no cilantro sauce because cilantro  makes me gag!  I was offered some honey wasabi sauce and I accepted but never received it.  Oh well, the tacos were actually pretty yummy on their own.  I got a side of the fruit but didn't eat it because it looks like it was really old and had a congealed look about it, no thanks.

Consistent in many POSITIVE aspects:
1. The customer service from hostess to bartenders to servers at the table.
2. The food is consistently GOOD & we've eaten all over the menu from front to back. From Tapas to full plates to sushi to sides.
3. The drinks  are very consistent in flavor and alcohol levels to ice
The one NEGATIVE consistency:
1. THE WAIT & not accepting reservations

The plus to the only negative consistency I have is that they offer table places using the NoWait app which is new and a HUGE plus. Lastnight my husband and I were at a concert and was able to put our name down in line while enjoying the last two acts because it specified that we had 89 - 110 minutes before our table would be ready and showed us that there were 24 parties before us.

Let's Get down to the goodies. The food is not complex it's straight forward and GOOD. Some of our go to's are:
Sashimi tacos 
Fried oysters 
Garlic shrimp skewers 
Lamb lollipops 
Beef skewer 
A number of sushi rolls which we tried the Godzilla lastnight and wasn't a huge fan due to the cream cheese. I asked if they could only put 1% on and was told YES however they put 101%. It was too creamy and we ended up picking out the cream cheese per piece before eating. 
Our server was super cool and he noticed all the cream cheese on our plates and once we ordered dessert Chocolate Bread pudding (which was amazing) he brought it out and informed us that he was comping it due to the mix up with the cream cheese which we Super cool as we didn't complain we just took the cream cheese out and ate the roll.
This place is the perfect DateNight spot with the dim lighting and cool music. It's also a cool spot to catch up with friends and enjoy some drinks and small plates. 
If you are going for the first time please note that it's not accessible friendly as you have to climb the black fire escape black cast iron stairs to enter. Don't quote me on this because maybe there is a secret elevator that no one knows about but I've never seen it or I inquired about it.

Bites and Brews is in line with that mode of thought- its an enjoyable pizza joint where the decor is a blend of playful, and standard ""bar"" ornamentation. 

I had a large 2 topping pizza (spinach and sun dried tomatoes- my fave) and  two beers- a solidly good one from the East End Brewery (black strap stout)  and a Magic Hat. Surprisingly, for a place called bites and brews there is a fairly conservative selection of beers available-- I may be getting spoiled by places like the Sharp Edge though.

The food was good. A friend and I shared a medium pizza and it was more than we could eat.

Pros:
-Nice rooms, epecially for the price.  During the week, the rooms are as low as $50.  Rooms are clean, fully stocked, and comfortable

-TV: Big enough flat screen, but not many channels.  This is the hotels trick to keep you out of your room and into the casino

-Bingo:  Plenty of late nights killing time playing bingo.  Not bad, fun actually.  I'm one of those lazy bingo players that have the machines.  

-Movies:  Movie Theater upstairs near the Bingo and Bowling.  A lot of locals here. When I stay at this hotel, I never watched a movie here.  Now that I live here, I watched movies a handful of times here. 

-Bowling:  Convenient that there's place to bowl in all hours of the day.  But regardless what time you come in, there always seems to be some league going.  Or, it's crazy busy.  Only bowled here twice.  I end up heading to the Orleans if I'm down for late night bowling. 

-Gaming:  I don't gamble much anymore so I can't judge.  But I do check out the Poker Room from time to time, even now.  Not a bad room to play at. It's rarely busy and you'll be playing with mostly locals. 

-Parking and Valet:  Better than anywhere on the strip. 

-Fitness Room, Spa, and Pool:  Love them all, especially the staff.  There is a cost to use their gym.  But sometimes I get in for free.  Doesn't hurt to ask. 

-Bar and Eats:  About average.  When it comes to drinking and eating, it sometimes comes down to who your company is.  I've always had a good time here with whoever I'm with. 

-Perfect if you are traveling with kids.  There's movies, bowling, pools, and an arcade. 

Cons:
The only issue is that this hotel/casino is located off the strip.  Don't let the Las Vegas Blvd address fool you.  I actually prefer that, but the ""Vegas Baby!!"" crowd may not.  

Overall,  I recommend this place for anyone coming into town or locals that want a nice and clean hotel at a good price.  Don't come here thinking it's going to be the Bellagio or Mandalay.  But it's far better than Hotels like Circus Circus and Tropicana.",2012-08-31 00:18:11

There are nice plush booths for parties of 6 and under and if you have a large party like ours, 9 people, then you will sit in between all those booths with them facing you.  

The only reason I've come here for dinner is because our friend gives us comps to eat there.  So we usually take the whole family.  

The escargot appetizer is ok, garlicky but that's about it.  The seafood tower is lacking and for $38, they really need to add some more pieces of seafood on that ice tray.  My sister usually gets the lobster bisque but she stopped ordering it because there's hardly any lobster in there.

So the other day I ordered the prime rib, 16 oz cut with baked sweet potato.  And it was a HUGE disappointment!  The prime rib was rare like I like it but it was so tough to cut and even tougher to chew!  The baked sweet potato was overcooked that it was just mush.  My baby nephew loved it though.  

My boyfriend got the special of the day which was a 6 oz filet mignon and a lobster tail for $60.  The lobster tail was rubbery and the steak was not as tender as it could be.  

Service is really slow because they bring everyones food out at the same time - so if you are in a large group like ours then it will take a while.

I went on the GM website and did estimates for leasing with approximate money down, and adjusted the payments on leasing to what my car was worth based on Kelly blue book pricing. Findlay offered me a lease at $319/month. Um yeah. I BOUGHT my car for $246/month, so there was no way I was paying that amount. Fast forward to this past weekend. My car needed brakes, a new battery soon, etc, so I checked the website for the GM Family First discounts/specials (My dad is a retiree of GM), and saw a hot special on an Equinox for $139 for current lessees. I read it wrong thinking it included lessees, GM employees, retirees, etc. I set up an appointment and went Friday evening. Spoke to Randy, a sales guy, and we went through the test drive, numbers, etc. Not only did Henderson Chevrolet give me almost double what Findlay offered me for my car last year, but they gave me the full discounts to employees and all incentives. Last year at Findlay, I was told because I was getting the GM discount, I couldn't get the full incentive amount on a lease vehicle, only if I purchased the vehicle. BS.  Henderson Chevrolet gave me a great deal, and I drove off their lot Friday in my new 2015 Equinox! I was planning on not being able to get the car until the next day due to them having to clean it and service it, but was shocked when they said enjoy my night and take the car, just bring it back in the morning to get it serviced and learn all the new features. I did that, and was able to clean out my car in the morning. It took maybe 45 min the next morning for them to clean it, and I went over the features shortly after. I LOVE my new Equinox! 

Everyone at Henderson Chevrolet I deal with from Randy, John the Finance guy, and everyone else was extremely pleasant and accommodating.  They have a nice lounge area with TVs and some beverages while you're waiting for services. I like to stick to the same dealership once I find one and I have found my new dealer!

The layout of Tomo is a little strange - when you walk in, there's a bunch of tables, with a bar on the right, and a sushi bar on the left, a little further down. We decided to eat at the sushi bar, and the server placed us in the center of it - an odd choice, since it meant my roommate was facing a giant fake flower and couldn't see the chefs or the mirror behind the chefs all that well. Further back in the restaurant were some hibachi tables with groups of people around them. It was a little strange to hear the hibachi chefs as we were eating - they sounded like they were decent entertainers, but to listen to that as you're NOT eating hibachi was a little weird. I wish they had divided the restaurant up so that the sound was better separated.

The...owner? Manager? Someone important? came up to us twice to check on how we were doing. He seemed very nice and clearly was hoping we were having a good time - he was also very clearly excited about the restaurant and building, and talked about some of his plans for it - for instance, a tea room on one of the upper floors. I had no idea this place was 5 floors, or that Tomo owned them all. UNFORTUNATELY, he also twice offered to give us a tour, and his tone and words came off a bit more than a little creepily. I am pretty sure that he was just being friendly and excited, and I later saw him talking to many other patrons, but as a pair of 20-something girls, we just didn't feel comfortable taking him up on his offer. In a larger group, I would have love to have seen the rest of the space, and I feel bad because I really do think he wanted to show off the space. In the future, I think I would have felt more comfortable had he gotten a larger group of patrons together and invited us, rather than making it sound like it'd just be the three of us. I feel bad even writing this, but we both felt pretty uncomfortable at the time.

I ordered the miso soup, spicy tuna roll and California roll - I had really wanted to try some of the specialty rolls, but many of the more interesting ones were $18 - guaranteeing that there is no way that I'm going to ever get them unless there's some sort of discount deal. 

The miso soup was pretty standard, although it was a lot more clear (instead of yellow) than I'm used to, and had mushrooms in it. As a mushroom-hater, I was able to pretty easily avoid the fungus floating in my bowl. I would have preferred more greens in it, but it was fine. Both of my rolls were large and delicious to the point where I was uncomfortably full after eating both of them - in the future, I think my roommate and I will probably split 3 between us. 

Look - if I'm being honest, I think I want Tomo to succeed and that's probably making this earn an extra half star, but why not? This place has been empty for a year, and it's clear the staff wants to make this work. They're currently the only dedicated sushi place in the Warehouse District (until Sushi Rock reopens), and a heck of a lot better than the sushi at China Sea or prepackaged at Constantino's. Could their decorations be improved? Definitely. Are the hibachi sounds distracting? Yup. Will I go here again? Absolutely.",2013-02-15 20:44:23

We probably would have ordered another round had the pigeons not been there.  They were disgusting - walking across the tables and chairs!  One even flew right at my husband.  Another one flew right at a woman sitting at an adjacent table and the waitress came over to try and get it to fly away.  The patio is so nice and ruined by these pigeons.  I can't believe a place as nice as the Ritz wouldn't find a way to get these birds out of the eating space of their guests.  I have never seen this at any other patio in Toronto.,2015-09-07 14:20:57

By that I mean I will gravitate to the most extravagant thing in the room/section/department/store/mall... whatever. I have a shopping problem. 

That being said there are a few things that I love and have accepted that will not change about me in the future without some sort of catastrophic or supernatural intervention. 

1) The lovely gentleman, Walter Santiago, in the shoe department at this Nordy's will be able to retire early based on his sales to me alone. The man glanced at my feet, shod with shabby old shoes and definitively stated my size (correctly I might add). He then advised me against even trying one pair I was considering because he said their construction would not work well with my instep. Of course I ignored him because they were adorable, but when he brought them out he was right. They felt like anvils that had glass shard straps. Lesson one from Walter: if it doesn't feel fabulous... don't buy it! 

Luckily this guy knows his stuff. Having the foresight that I would not be able to wear those toe torturing tools for more than 1 minute, he brought me 2 other similar choices, that because of their styling, would work on my feet. Not only that, they were styles that I hadn't even noticed amongst the bazillion shoes they have available, one was cheaper than my original selection, and it was so cute that it actually made me clap my hands in delight when I got them on. Lesson two from Walter: if you don't love it... don't buy it! 

And so my relationship with Walter began as a love story and continues to grow. There are many other lessons, but you can find out for yourself. Just ask for him when you get to shoes and he will make you feel like you are the only one that matters. From boots, to ballet flats, reasonably priced to extravagant, the man has changed my life. Well at least the life of my feet. : ) 

2) There are so many other wonderful things about this store that I never would have known, had it not been for a friend that dragged me there (literally) a few years ago. The prices can actually be affordable. Their sales are amazing. Their service (web, return, etc.) is unmatched. The bra department has given my girls new lift. The live music makes me want to linger. They Valet. They hold your bags while you shop. I literally put the private sales in my calender so I don't miss them. I am already starting to vibrate with anticipation at the upcoming annual holiday party night. Well, I could just go on but you get the point. 

If you are going to shop, try it. My feet and my girls are pretty sure you will like it.",2011-09-16 18:13:58

You can eat-in or take-out from this place, which seems to be pretty standard. The restaurant has a few booths and tables and can likely seat about 20-25 people.

One place  in Summerlin my other friend recommended was just $129 just for the glass.

I would go ASAP once you notice a crack and not allow losing touch screen and getting internal damage like bad battery as I did. It's pretty much a brand new phone , I'm not embarrassed anymore .

It may have been Family Guy or some other adult themed cartoon but I was watching the close caption and it was totally inappropriate for children.  I went over to tell them and they did not hesitate to change the channel.  They apologized so I can forgive that.  The other family that was there was actually watching this with their young (like 4 and 5 yrs olds) children.

mVxniittJ_ld0uqnactWMw,yeX7tzZZWCnphQifRJglUg,4KHo1LnkM69RtWTDBdG16g,2,0,0,0,"Maybe it's a bad timing, though considering that the place was relatively empty for a Saturday at 12 (there were still empty seats around us) and they had two staff members, the service wasn't up to par the general quality of the their non-desserts were pretty bad.

As for the service, it seemed very unresponsive and uncoordinated rather than being maliciously lousy like some other restaurants.   It felt like these people were are the first day of the job and have no training.  Granted it is a relatively small restaurant and you can see how things go from the waiter area.

As usual they served us with date tea, back when this was called the Sugar this was one of the reasons I came here because it was a bit soothing, the only problem with it was the version they have now is so diluted you can barely taste it.

For the meals I got ramen with popcorn chicken and my wife got wonton noodle soup.  We both ended up getting the same noodles which were no better than the ones you get at Ajisen with bean sprout filler (yuck) and the same soup base.

I didn't get to try her wontons (normally I don't like them anyway unless it's from Chung King) but their popcorn chicken was okay for me when I ate it first since it wasn't salty, though it is very tough and as I was eating it got even tougher.

The saving grace was the soup base wasn't too bad, I drank it down all the way and didn't get the MSG feel I normally get when I eat at Pho.  However, because the noodles were not the same quality as you would get from Niwatei and they used the Taiwanese tea egg, I  would call this ramen experiment a failure.

My dad and aunt got some rice dishes.  Although they appear nice on the picture, they were pretty much loaded up with rice and not much of the meat.  So it felt more like a rip off.

The only reason I bumped this up to two stars is because of their dessert.  I still like this place for the night time desserts   I had the strawberry and ice cream crepe.  It was a good finisher and the ice cream wasn't too heavy for me.

I would still come here again, but only for the desserts and maybe small dishes.  However, I do know they have the capability of being better depending on the time of day because I was here for dinner once and I liked it too.",2013-05-04 22:02:56

While places like the Art Gallery of Ontario have 49 reviews, this oasis of multiple climates in a city like Toronto only has 12 as of this writing; and the last one was 6 months ago! Why?

Decreed into being free for perpetuity after Allan donated the land back in 1857 the park/land was almost rejected as it was considered way too far in the 'burbs' back then. (Ha!) Now the thing is smack downtown and for the most part it is run by volunteers and it is generally always empty. So...

The Conservatory is a great place to go and just sit. Or if you never been, walk around an just take in that delicious greenery smell. Remember to bring your camera. 

Word for the wise, the park surrounding the conservatory has a dog park where you can let your dog run free free-reign. The grounds are also home to Toronto's largest flock of pigeons and a decent number of loitering homeless people. Not so keen on that last one though.

As for the actual conservatory/gardens, they are divided in 6 sections. One being a teaching area. The other five are full of glorious plants from desert cacti, tropical banana, bamboo to orchids and a few endangered species (as if orchids themselves are growing everywhere) like Jade Vines! 

This is one of those places that really makes you feel proud to be a Torontonian and I enjoy visiting often.

I buy all things apple: Macbook, watch, iPhone, iPad as i continue to complain about their products and all the accessories they make me buy while I eagerly wait for the next apple device to come out.
Been here a couple of times and Idk why I continue to come here without an appointment. This place is always packed. Esp on weekend, the parking at summerlin mall is horrendous. 
Came here and was helped by Francis for the return of my apple watch. Was quick and easy.
The hardest part about any store is the purchasing part (which is why I prefer to buy everything online via the apple store) and the technical support here is just an unacceptable wait time, cause I wanted to buy another apple watch- in a different color and I then had to wait only to be told they didnt have the one I wanted in store.
On a Thursday morning around 11am I went in because I wanted to disable the lock on my apple watch after i tried googling, pairing/unpairing, restarting my apple watch many times via the apple forums. The guy who helped me, said I needed to wait inline to get help. I waited for 10min and then I was told by the wait time to unlock my Apple Watch was 1 hour 30min. 
I was mind blown and left and made an appointment for the following day. 
I will always avoid coming into the apple store if necessary.",2017-02-03 17:35:07

This is basically a lab-themed bubble tea shop where you pick your own flavors and toppings. You pick a hot or cold drink, flavor profile, sugar (white/brown/maple syrup - 10/20/30%), milk, and tapioca vs jelly (different flavors). I'll give them credit for trying a new concept in a city where aesthetic is everything, but they still need to iron a lot of wrinkles out. Honestly it's pretty confusing what flavors you can/can't combine, and the guy at the front explaining can't keep up with the volumes of customers. Essentially you can't combine the syrup flavors (cold drink) with the powder flavors (hot drinks) and can pick up to 1 or 2 flavors depending on if you get a hot or cold drink. I went with two other people, and we all tried different flavors but came to the same conclusion - the flavors do not mix well at all! My matcha coconut milk tea didn't come out as expected at all, and my friends said the same for their drinks. 

Price wise, this place is ridiculously expensive. I get it - you're paying for the novelty of the concept but charging $3.25 for a cup, $1 per flavor, $0.5-1 for milk, and $1 per topping means that each drink comes out to around $7-8. The only thing that's free is the sugar, and even that costs extra if you want maple syrup instead of white/brown sugar. There are much better bubble tea places in the city that don't break the bank!",2018-03-13 02:23:54

This hotel is a solid 4 star as the location is great and it is somewhat newer. The prices can get real high real quick so watch out for the prices. I got a deal through hotwire so it was affordable. We were here for the new years and concierge was very helpful in finding us last minute spots and places that were open around new years (I found the hard way that a lot of places close down during new years) Initially were given a smaller room but after pushing a bit we were upgraded to a higher floor and a nicer room.

She rated it OK. Her favorite is a burrito from a chain. I will say that she ate her entire half which was the equivalent size of a full size at the chain. So, leftovers! I got the loaded burrito with green sauce. It's true as the other reviews said. The sauces have kick--I love it! The green sauce is creamy. I am not sure if it was the sight or size of my burrito but I was only able to eat a quarter. It felt like woman vs food. But I give my dish a 5. Their hot salsa is awesome too. It was way too hot for the kids. And I'll have to order the nachos without pico de gallo for my daughter next time....at least until she acquires the taste for heat.

I give it 4.25-4.5 stars. Not necessarily a 5 quite yet- I wasn't super blown away, but it's definitely better and so much more fresh than other sushi that I've attempted to eat in Cleveland and around Cleveland. It's comparable to a good sushi place in other cities (thus, my non-5 star rating), but for Cleveland, I think this is definitely a great step in the right direction. (I remember there was a sushi place on the east side of CLE where the sushi was warm. And not the right color.. after that, I gave up hope..but then, BAM, here came Ginko).

My friend and I arrived around 7:30pm. It's right next to Dante and you have to walk down a set of stairs to a door where Ginko is. (Reminded me of a speakeasy lounge in Chicago... where I'm like...oh what? I'm going down these random stairs?)

It was a tad empty, but as the night when on (past 8pm), the place filled up fast. Koji was our sushi chef, as we sat at the bar, and he was incredibly cordial and informative about the sushi, the specials, and everything. Any question we had, he could answer- and was just a cool person to chat with.

The decor is full of warm colors- definitely gave it a warm fuzzy vibe in the midst of a sushi place. The restaurant itself is rather small- but hey, it IS in a basement of all things.

We ordered the unagi foie gras to start off. It was pretty good- I had really never had the combination together, so it was interesting..and the amount that came out was a lot more than I thought! I ordered some good brown rice green tea, and it was quite the perfect match. One of their specials of the night was their mackerel- a special cut from Japan, as Koji stated. We ordered the mackerel nigiri- and it was FRESH. Oh happiness.

For specialty rolls, we got the ginko roll and the nippon roll. The ginko roll was good- it had tuna, salmon, avocado, daikon, and other things, all wrapped up in a cucumber, with differing colors of tobiko on top- so that was quite pretty. And good. The nippon roll....was... a tad adventurous for us. haha. Burdock root? Koji gave us some to try- and we liked it. Ok, let's order the nippon roll- squid, shiso, plum, root... and... I think neither of us had really had raw squid. It was rather..different. 

I think I need to go back and try the other items on the menu as well..(the food...plus the sake next time), but it's a definitely great place to bring out of town friends, as well as just a cool place to chill and get some good food. Bravo, Ginko- finally an authentic place in Cleveland. :)",2011-10-21 17:51:22

We did one show in the Upstairs room and most of the comedians bombed on stage because everyone's ADD kicked in when they saw all of the things hanging on the walls and ceiling.  Sometimes that happens with people in new rooms who are less experienced in comedy (like me), but it was insane watching even the most experienced comedians do poorly at that show.  With that being said, it didn't work out the way we wanted to and we're not allowed back in, but I have no hard feelings and I hope they give us another shot.

Anyway, 5-stars because this place is amazing.  Beautiful patio outside of the building, and then you walk in and the further you trek, the weirder and wilder it gets!  You think to yourself ""hey, can it get weirder than this?""  Oh yes it can!  And it does from the very moment you take your first step upstairs....I can't even explain the upstairs room.

The interior is beautiful--especially the living wall on the open air side of the restaurant. Poor service is a common complaint about Grinder but after two visits I don't have anything particularly bad to say about the service--it was not exceptional but definitely satisfactory. 

It is definitely possible to eat at Grinder and keep the bill fairly reasonable, but it is also very easy to let it get out of hand. On my first visit I had the appetizer duck tartar (quite big) with a side of mashed potatoes and a side of mushrooms; this was more than enough portion-wise and I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. On my second visit I shared with a friend; we split the beef short rib and raw scallops. The scallop plate was so small I found it to be bad value for money, but the beef short rib was amazing--I would order it again in a heartbeat.

We ordered a round of a Spring Mountain Sour (beet foam!!!), Where There's Smoke (mezcal), Model T (Gin/Cucumber) and a Jump the Shark (it's a shark shaped glass w/ bourbon!).  All of the drinks were so good we downed them (enjoyed them slowly....) and ordered a second round.  For starters, we went with 4 pieces of the Chinatown Clams Casino and the Hearth Baked Bread (as who isn't a sucker for in house fresh carbs).  The bread had the exact crunch you look for in a dinner roll / sauce picker upper.  More on that later.  The Chinatown Clams Casino were an interesting take as not everyone is an Uni fan, but it worked and I want more....like now.  For our entrees we decided it was best to order a smattering of items and pick them apart like vultures.  We ordered the Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings, Sweetbreads and Campfire Duck w/ wood ear mushrooms and a healthy portion of foie gras.  The flavors were all spot on so it will be hard to want to order anything else although the Big Ass Pork Shoulder passed our table and I think I drooled on the floor.  Just a little....don't judge.

Side Note: Very cool meeting Chef Brian Howard as he went around touching tables and it's always nice to share some moments with the curators of your culinary experience.

I was going to try the 7 course beef meal, but some of the dishes have peanuts in it, so i opted for a curry dish due to allergy.  Shame, I really wanted to try something different since i have Viet food at least twice a week at home.

- Saigon Curry with Chicken = $17: Not your typical, thick curry, more soupy like Pho.  The only place i found that make curry similar to my mom's but not as spicy.  Still Decent and has good flavor. 
Loaded with bunch of fillers; eggplant, onions, baby corn, asparagus, green string beans, potato and chicken.  Came with a side plate of rice vermicelli.   It's nice that they put the noodles on the side because there's no way in hell you can finish the curry in one sitting..  The serving bowl was also arranged with a candle set-up underneath the bowl to keep soup warm.  Thought that was a nice touch as well.

-My mom ordered her usual; Grilled Short Beef Ribs = $15:  Five (5) thick slice of Korean BBQ style ribs (gal bi), side salad, and a cup of some really clean tasty fluffy white rice.  I was really impress with how much flavor the rib had when fresh.  My mom usually bring leftovers home, so I'd never had a chance to fully experience it.  Pretty darn good ribs, but for 15bucks?  Hmmm..


Service was non-existent.  Water was placed on the table 5min after we ordered.  The curry dish came out first wayy before my mom's ribs did, so i made my mom a small bowl and another for myself.

We seriously kept turning our head and looking for her meal for the next 15-20min.  How do you expect me to enjoy my meal when my mom hasn't even been served her food yet? 
I've actually finished eating before it came out.  Not a good feeling to be honest.  Had I known it would have take that long I should have never started eating regardless if they bring out two empty side bowl for the curry.

We had to flag them down for everything because they never bother to check up on us. I was mortified.  I get it.. I'll grab my own to-go containers, thank you.

I've tried their fried dumplings (a little on the meager side, but at least the exterior is crispy) and scallion pancakes (too dry and flour-y, and I didn't see much scallion action) as well as their bubble tea (it's fine). I looked around at the food other people got, and the dishes look pretty standard.

The folks who work here do exude a hard-to-describe quirky charm. 

All in all, Taiwan Cafe is not bad for students and people who work in the nearby businesses to drop in for a quick bite. If I have a particular hankering for Taiwanese food, though, I think I'd rather head over to Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill.",2011-10-19 14:32:05

When I was at the UYE at Hot Dog Haus fellow Yelpers let me know about this cupcake deal going on. If you bring your own box the cupcakes are only $1.00 each but if you need a box they are $1.50 each. This is a steal compared to places like the Cupcakery. 

When we were driving there it felt like I was going on a scavenger hunt because it's a bit out of the way. If I didn't see Anthony M or Angela H there I wouldn't know if I was in the right place or not. There are no signs and you have to knock on a secret door...kind of like a speak easy. The cupcakes are well worth it though! There wasn't too much frosting and the cupcakes were nice and moist.

Neither me nor my guy drink , so for me there needs to be a comfortable place for us to go and enjoy ourselves. The bartenders always make great mocktails, and I actually start having more fun and dance more the more I have. I like that Latin Nights the best. On Weds it is a great place to go if you want to just have a girls night. This place is small enough to just enjoy the people watching and where it's not too loud or crowded where you feel pressured to have a drink just to make it through. We have been to other lounges and clubs, and when you tell them you just want a water or something non alcoholic they don't give you the best vibe. But BM is not that way and we are just comfortable there. If I feel like the crowd is getting too out of hand and people are not capable of handling their liquor I just say it's time for us to go. It is meat market though so ladies be prepared for the guys to try all night! Even if you are with someone they still try! :/ They also have an industry happy hour and always accommodating if you just want to eat as well.

Service: 4/5
Overall experience: 4/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Cute little bistro with a clean and simple decor of hardwood floors, green and white wall panels, and comfy seats. It seats about 10-15 people inside and a couple more on the patio. The service was exceptional - our server was very friendly, professional, and attentive (made sure our cups were always filled with coffee) but not too intruding. The food came out quick... then again we were the only ones there at 10am on a Wednesday

Their menu is simple with breakfast and brunch options such as your basic breakfast (eggs, choice of meat, toast, hash), omelets, french toast, paninis, poutines, salads, and lunch combos of  which can include your choice of fries/salad/poutine or even gelato (yes, they serve Fiasco Gelato here). The prices are average for a breakfast/brunch restaurant, ranging from $10-$15 for breakfast, $10 for sandwiches, and around $20 for combos. 

My friend ordered the Wake Scramble (mix of hash browns, onions, peppers, sausage, ham, bacon, with scrambled eggs and melted cheese on top); and I ordered their 'meat-atarian' omelet (3 eggs, mix of sausage, ham, bacon and cheese, hash browns, and two slices of toast from a fresh loaf of crusty bread). The food was delicious! My friend and I enjoyed our meals very much and we were stuffed by the end. The hash was not overdone and perfectly crispy (just how i like it); the omelet was light and fluffy, not too eggy and packed full of meat; the toast was a little too crunchy for me and came with homemade berry jam that lacked a little sweetness. 

Overall, the food was fresh, tasted great, and cooked perfectly. My only disappointment was how the menu wasn't extremely unique since it's the usual things you would see on a brunch menu.

Despite that, if you are in the area and looking for some excellent brunch food I suggest a visit!",2011-05-13 02:07:04

I was pleasantly suprised! The picture quality was sharp, sound was crisp,  and the seating very comfortable! 

One thing I noticed about this theatrer is that their security was in and out at several times during the movie. Whoa, they don't ..mess around! It's good to see that there is a presence to keep people quiet and courteous and , of course, keep me from bootlegging Madagascar 3. 

Snack bar was a bit better than your typical movie theater snack bar, overpriced but with a nice variety of snacks to choose from. Popcorn was better than average.

Sometimes I feel like they're overrated and for the food I get? I rather go somewhere else.  But nonetheless, it was my friend's bday so Angela and I headed there to celebrate her day.

The Milestones location that we went to was at North York Centre or sometimes better known as Empress Walk.  The decor is rather stylish and on a Saturday night, the crowd was the young and cliché type. Most people well dressed so as a heads up, dress up a little to blend in. The lights were dimmed and the mood set for a more intimate experience. My apologies for the photo quality ahead of time.

Didn't order any drinks and as my main, I ordered the Californian style burger with sweet potato fries. The Californian burger was topped with fresh house-made avocado salsa, double-smoked bacon, lettuce, a pickle and even more tomato. The bun was a sesame seed bun.  And looks perfect for the burger.  Angela got their seasonal item which was Braised Beef Pappardelle with a nice cream base and cheese. The food took a while to come, at about 20 mins or so and at this occasion I was able to test their service for a large party. I do this by the number of water refills.

Once the food arrived I took a bite of the sweet potato fries and... Not cripsy, sucks.  I don't believe that this was solely caused because of the dish sitting and waiting to be served with others. But I believe it might be the lack of batter on the fries. It was lightly battered and appeared to be cooked in older oil.  The burger tho, surprisingly quite good. I was honestly surprised. The patty was nicely seasoned and wasn't dry.  I'm not sure if I got lucky but I still somehow feel that Milestones serves frozen not fresh patties.  Nonetheless, everything worked and I would have to say, Milestones served me a good burger tonight. Angela and her dish, once again very surprised.  She asked me what looks good and looking at their seasonal menu, this item stood out.  The beef was tender, the pasta cooked well and the sauce was perfect. I have to say even with the good burger, I 100% wish I had her dish instead. It was very good.

Overall, I would have to say that at this occasion, I liked Milestones. Maybe it was one of their good days, maybe. But the food that was served was good. My only complaints would be service and the fries.  My water never got refilled. We were there for 2 hours and you couldn't refill my water, you serious? Everyone that ordered water didn't get a refill, so guess what Mr. Waiter, I tip accordingly. Tho my friend brought up a good point, he said with this tip he's gonna think I'm just another cheap young chinese fella.  It probably doesn't help that I look like I'm 19.

It had Sopressata ( Italian cured salami), roasted garlic, Ricotta Cheese, fresh mozzarella, roasted tomatoes, red onions , and sliced pepperoncinis.

I bought some bulk teas to take home. The earl grey creme smelled intoxicatingly good and is very pretty. The amandine tea smells even better and is also very pretty.

At checkout, the cashier was very friendly. However, I wasn't too sold on the total price coming to almost $18 for just a salad and a drink. The size of the salad was plentiful, but I can't wholeheartedly say it was the best I've had.",2016-05-01 21:22:44

I thought the veggies were inside the fold of the omlette and since its so dark in the place I couldnt see the ham!!!

I did in fact order a veggie cheese omlette because the waitress showed me the order on paper the kitchen made the error. However I haven't eaten meat in 3 years... I did spit out the bite of the omlette but I was still a little grossed out nonetheless.

When I did alert the staff of this error the offered me 1/2 off my food. I was like ok. but they didnt include my appetizer... so I only ended up getting 2.75 off my omlette which I think should have been comp'd.

I've known them for their bar and raw bar, but I had no idea the food that comes out of that kitchen can be that amazing.  

Great quality ingredient and simple preparation is the best way to cook food.  And they've nailed it on that concept.  

Tried a variety of oysters, clean and fresh.  You pick a few special condiments/sauces you can accompany with instead of the regular basic lemon, tabasco or vinegar.  Point Reyes ones were our fav., you could taste the ocean almost.

Sashimi combo, great quality and good portion.

The prime hanger steak is unbelievably tender and well seasoned.  The waffle fries on the side are perfectly crispy and not greasy at all. The sauce on top is also great and not overpowering, and I am normally not a heavy sauce person.

The bronzino is definitely the best bronzino I've ever had in my whole life as it seems.  The fish itself is so perfectly grilled and cleaned.  Simple salt, pepper, a little season with rosemary and lemon slices.  Not covered in any fancy sauce, no fancy EVOO drizzled on top, it's the cleanest fish, crisp and flaky at the same time.  It's a must order at this place.

The caviar/uni french toasts are also top notch.  Uni and caviars are only the icy on the incredibly fluffy and pillow-like french toast squares.  I joked with the chef that he should make them pillow size that I would totally dive in.  

Service is great, price is so reasonable, food is amazing.  It's definitely my top restaurant in town and will recommend it to anyone who's looking for a fantastic meal.  I LOVE sashimi/sushi, seafood and good meat.  I think I've found the perfect restaurant for me that I can indulge in everything that's on my favorite list in one meal.

There's no need, everything you would ever want is next door in Epicentre. It's a very large station and considered the ""hub"" of the light rail system. Below you can see the terminus of the CityLYNX street car which is FREE to ride. The blue line does require a ticket either physically or through the CATSPass App (which I highly recommend, Android or iPhone).

The tracks on the Epicentre side go South towards Pineville, while the other side goes all the way to the UNCC-Main Campus. During peak times, trains show up nearly every 7 minutes, while slower points in the day the trains are spaced out every 15 minutes. The CATS bus terminal is right below the platform that has routes to every end of the city. While there are no public restrooms on the platform, there are some at the bus station. Just keep in mind.. yeah, it's a bus station. They try their best to keep the restrooms in order, but someone always needs to prove how nasty they are by... well you know what, you can fill in the blanks!

Keep an eye out for funny individuals. While I've seen security or LYNX officials nearly every time I've been here, there's still the occasional solicitor of change that can be a bit too aggressive, or argument turned destructive. Maintain that personal bubble, my dudes!

My girlfriend ordered their special, a brisket sandwich, and I ordered 6 ribs. I confidently exclaimed to the staff that a growing man such as myself should have no trouble putting that away. We had sides of Macaroni, red beans and rice, and greens. I have tried ribs many places, the Carolinas, Oklahoma, etc. These were without a doubt my favorite. The smokiness and dry rub alone could make the need for sauce an afterthought. They were extremely meaty and filling. In fact, I failed on my claim and was only able to eat four. They did however come with two sauces to dip in, a mustard, and spicy sauce. They were ungodly delicious.

I remember going to a Gelato place in Florence twice a day for a week, and it was only 1.50 euros for a cup with two flavours.  But whenever specialties are imported, the price inflates, and I'll take it for gelato this tasty!

It was very warm so I definitely wanted refreshing flavours.  I chose raspberry and coconut, and the boy got stracciatella and strawberry.  The raspberry was exactly how it should be with a nice sharp flavour.  The coconut also had an amazing taste.  It wasn't like other gelato I've had in the city where I can't really tell what the flavour was.  With these, you knew immediately.

Staff is attentive, and the food and menu seem identical.  Typical diner food, but most of the time we get breakfast. Servings are large, and the kids' menu has a variety. It's not terribly different from the standard breakfast establishments around time.

And that's where it started getting worse....
Do they even know what ""service"" means? Tips by definition are product of the proper service (they're not requirement) - good service=good tip and bad service .... you guess no tip!

First we had to chase waitress around to order drinks. I started going towards bar stand but ""security-type"" guy stopped me and said that waitress will come to our table. 10-15 minutes later he ended up taking our drink order himself .... than we had to wait for another 15-20 minutes for drinks to get to our table. 
Than we ordered some food and it took almost 40 minutes to get it (because for some reason 1st time it was delivered to another table!!!)
.... bla bla bla and here we are ready to move on to next venue - not so easy because it took damn waitress another 30 minutes to get my check! Heck!!!! I can forgive anything but NOT WHEN I HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY CHECK! Come on people ... you want your money for your damn overpriced drinks do you?

So I have to confess - first time in all these years I stiffed and left zero tip. I could insult her of course and put few coins in but I was in a decent mood even after all this crap.

(Am I just bitching? May be I am ... but customer is always right, isn't he?)

P.S. While I was standing on the balcony I witnessed a nasty act of hit-and-run - b*tch was trying to turn around (turn, reverse and turn) and hit a car that was parallel parked right in front of BM.

I tried the beef kofta with salad and naan. You order and pay at the register and your number is on your receipt. Pay attention to the numbers being called because I noticed that they weren't necessarily going in chronological order. 

The beef kofta (you get two) were juicy and flavourful. The salad was decent, but a bit skimpy. There was a little bit of lettuce with some diced tomatoes and onions. My colleague who ordered a ""dinner"" which comes with salad, rice, and naan got far more salad than I did which seems odd since mine was the ""salad"" option. They forgot my naan, but my colleague told me not to worry about it since she'd split hers with me. The naan is not like soft traditional Indian naan. This was kind of hard and crispy. Like a cross between a flatbread and a cracker.

okay let's talk about making appointments .. when calling you can expect to get a person that speaks English pretty well so communication is rather easy to get the info you need as well as when you check in when you get there there's a secretary at front so they make you feel attended to instead of just standing around wondering who will acknowledge you. 
So let's talk about decor... it looks pretty and clean with plenty of pedi chairs all around. oh yeah they also use sanitary plastic coverings for the pedi bowls. I would highly recommend getting a guy to do the pedi since they are stronger and can get your feet super clean and a stronger massage on your legs! The 2 guys I got already have been very polite and does a good job! My go to for dip powder nails is Phoebe. She does a good job and I enjoy talking to her. The owners seem to be cool too. 
Price point... it's rather on the average price range or maybe a tad bit higher, but cheaper than any nail places off the strip! Dip powder is around $50 and the pedi is around $30. $5 extra if you do french.

REVIEW: Although it's not my favorite place to dine for seafood, I have always been a fan of Kings Fish House.  I love that it's located at the District, which has been remodeled and decorated for the holidays--festive!  We came in Sunday night for dinner.  It was not busy at all, and we were immediately sat at a booth.  It took a little while for the server to come by and greet us.  By the time he came by, my boyfriend and I had thoroughly looked through the menu and were ready to order.

Anyway, we ordered, and our server brought us some sourdough bread and butter.  The sourdough bread was fresh and warm--crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  For starters, we had a dozen of the Kumamuto oysters, which were not bad.  Served alongside horseradish, mignonette, cocktail sauce and lemon wedges, the oysters were small yet plump, sweet, and creamy--as they were supposed to be.  There WERE a couple in the bunch, however, that were a little on the fishy side... it wasn't enough to ruin the meal though.  I had also ordered the New England clam chowder--so good!  It wasn't thick or lumpy how most chains serve clam chowder; it was perfectly soupy, creamy, and clammy! lol My boyfriend's not regularly a fan of clam chowder, and even he liked it.  For our entree, we had the crab leg dinner special (I forget what kind they were), which came with a pound of crab and two sides.  For sides, I had the vegetable ratatouille and macaroni and cheese, and he had the sautéed spinach and cheese grits.  The crab legs were good.  They were thick and had some nice sweet, juicy chunks of meat; I was only sad that there wasn't more!  The shell itself was spiky and a little rough to get through, but worth the work if you really like crab.  The sides were good, but nothing to rave about.  The meal came out to about $140, without tip.  Our server was great though, despite the fact that he was little busy in the beginning.

Overall, Kings Fish House isn't bad.  They've got great reasonably priced seafood.  Plus I hear they have a pretty good happy hour.  Gotta give that a shot next time!",2013-11-26 23:28:10

Appetizers: finger licking lollipop wings were cooked perfectly, flavored perfectly, and had ample meat. Hot rocks was fun and delicious. Colossal crab Louis was tasty with huge lumps.

Side dishes (ala a carte): Mac and cheese was really great. Crunchy cheesy crust with hot creamy noodles. Yum! Loaded backed potatoes were really good. Served whipped in a cast iron skillet. Grilled asparagus and roasted and smoked mushrooms were also delicious.

Pink Lotus is a decent, clean, hole-in-the-strip-mall americhino classic.

Their extensive menus includes all the basics, prepared hot and fresh for you to takeout or dine in, as long as the odd mural on the wall doesn't scare you off.  (pic)

The food was pretty good.  General Tsao's chicken is a barometer to me, and Pink Lotus' rendition was a little different.  Think more along the lines of spicy terriyaki than hoysin.  But there were lots of bits of green onion and minced FRESH garlic (I'm still getting garlic burps).  The consistency, as well as the flavor that was underneath the sauce, was more like rough chopped chunks of crispy fried chicken than the usual batter-balls.  Good but a little greasy.

Pink Lotus is pretty generous with giving small discounts to deserving community members like military or helathcare workers (pic).

They've been hidden on the outside edge of this shopping center for years and I'd never noticed them before.

When we arrived our friends were already seated in an uncomfortable booth directly in the blast zone of the subzero AC. The booth was rather flimsy so my friend and I felt every fidget from the group behind us.

When ordering drinks I asked what beers they had and received a puzzling answer of ""a lot"". Thankfully a friend let me try his beer that he thought I would like so I ordered one of his and a water. In fact I tried to get a water from our waitress three times before flagging down someone else to ask. My friend who was the only one who did not order an alcoholic beverage said she struggled to get her sweet tea before we arrived.

The burger I ordered was not impressive. It was super greasy and pink in the middle (the menu did not mention cooking the burgers at medium). The fries it came with were a happy surprise (again menu did not mention the burger came with fries). We had to ask for ketchup from the group across from us for the fries, which were better than the burger but on the same level with frozen fries.

She told him she could do that, but only in orders of 6's (because it's SOOOO HARDDDD  to shake boneless wings around in sauce!!!!) so he ordered 6 of one kind and 18 of another.  SHE CHARGED HIM for FOUR ORDERS OF 6 BONELESS WINGS!  What on earth are you thinking, Panini's??

Firstly, the renovations are great. This place still very much is a pub....with fancy chandeliers. I'm not sure what the owner is going for. But I like chandeliers so hey, can't really complain there.

I've only been here late at night but my most recent visit was a few weekends ago. For a Saturday night, this place wasn't all that busy. 

One of the major factors in making a decision as to what bar to go to is whether they serve food. Chambers does have a late night menu and is one of the only downtown bars that does. They offer standard bar fare, however as a vegetarian who was quite hungry it was unfortunate that their main dish menu had 0 vegetarian options. The only things available were on the appetizer menu and consisted of fried items/hummus. Its understandable that you wouldn't have a lot to pick from on a late night menu but I think at least offering a veggie burger might be a thing to consider in the future. According to the menu, they do have a black bean burger so I'm not sure how much trouble it would be to add that to the late night menu. I ordered the hummus which was alright. 

The other issue I have is with the variety of beers and the price of said beers. I feel, just as I did with Turf--the same. It is overpriced, on average about $7-$8 for a beer that I could get a for about $5 elsewhere. I'm really into craft beer and have a fairly good grasp on how much standard local beer costs at nearby establishments. It's kind of a disappointment.

They had $5 burgers tonight. It was a chirizo beef patty with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion and a spicy mayo...served with shoestring fries. Total experience was fabulous. I was impressed with the service, the quality of the food and the total atmosphere.

I hope by now you've had a chance to experience the charm of Burger 320 in Bridgeland, but in case you haven't: burgers crafted of fresh brisket, ground daily on-site from locally raised beef, with fresh local farm ingredients served inside fresh-baked, branded buns, (deep breath...) with gelato to boot, all inside one super tiny, beyond minuscule shack of a building.

The new Kensington location rocks the same concept as the first, but with one big change - no more tiny shack! Epic burgers, to-die-for parm fries, delicious gelato, all in a space that you can kick back in and relax. They're licensed and carry the full lineup of Unibroue beers from Quebec. I'll let you in on a little secret: Beer and burgers go really well together!

With the bigger size comes and increase in menu to go along with it. They've added waffles to the list and feature a list of sweet and savour concoctions ranging from a s'mores waffle to a philly cheese steak waffle. My favourite so far - chicken and waffles. They're expertly crispy, juicy, and come served with a white gravy, maple syrup and some dollops of Sriracha. It's a comfort food flavour explosion.

On my first time eating here. I found the place through Groupon and likely wouldn't have ever found it otherwise as I seldom if ever would be in that particular location to see it.

I had bought a 3 pack of groupons here and they are about to expire, so I rounded up a friend to use them up up before they expired. 

The manager came out and with absolute rudeness called me names and told me thanks for trying to scam and use 2 on a single visit. 

I told him they were expiring and he was super rude.... Not a single care was given by the owner, not even courtesy.

Favorite Beers:
1. Succession
2. Cross Pollen-nation

Location: 4/5   
Near the border of NoDa; only of a couple blocks away from all the action. Parking can be tight sometimes

Atmosphere / Ambiance: 4/5    
Think of a cross between a restaurant and brewery. Lot's of space and tables so larger parties can be accommodated relatively easy. The establishment is well lit and the table seating makes it less of a bar atmosphere so if you're looking to co-mingle, you might want to try else where.

Cleanliness: 5/5

Service: 5/5

They also get good marks from me for subbing items without a fuss. I know to expect the presence of bell pepper in Thai cuisine; however, I just don't like them.  I will eat anything and it's not typical of me to be picky but I just hate bell peppers.  It is the only vegetable I won't eat. So, I asked politely if they wouldn't mind subbing out my bell peppers for extra green beans. My server appeared pleased to do so. I was pleased too.

So on to the food!

Lunch Menu:
I love the Wok#10 - Spicy Green Bean add chicken no bell . I learned to ask for my spice level to be spicy-spicy since the just spicy is not spicy enough.  Great dish.
 
The Wok#5 -Ginger Angel add chicken no bell- sub green bean. Mmmm, I had this dish a few times. Yup, that good.

I was also pleased with the Wok#4-Vegitable Delight add mixed meat requested spicy-spicy.
 
The Red Curry#15 add chicken sub out bell was good but it could have been just a little more spicy for me. I think I'll request this to be spicy-spicy- spicy next time.

I'll also add that the lunch portions are sizable enough for two meals. Good for my belly and wallet.

Their booths are closed which is nice and intimate if you have a date. Service was great as well kept the refills coming and always asked if everything was ok.

The buffet area was constant kept clean and food was brought our regularly. They offer mostly curry dishes which is a huge plus for me. It varies from chicken, to vegetarian to goat curry dishes. They serve cheese and garlic naan bread with the curries.

Everything was delish. I will say that I was turned off a bit by the chicken curries having dark and white meat in it. Of all the chicken curries I've had, they were cooked with white meat only and being someone who only eat chicken breast, it was a bit of a turn down. However, the sauce and rice were great and there were some chicken breast pieces in the curries at least. 
 
We dinned in a Sunday afternoon where lunch buffet was served for $8.95. Great price. For dinner, you can only order off of the menu. Shockingly for a early Sunday lunch, they had plenty of customers. Wait staff were very friendly and prompt. 

Interesting note, my boyfriend and I noticed how similar the establishment was to Dhaba Indian Bistro out in Middleton.  We asked the server if there was a coincidence and come to find out, they are a sister restaurant of Dhaba. That being said, if you like Dhaba, you'll liked Heveli. The big difference is Dhaba doesn't have a buffet.

While the buffet was good, I think is enjoy ordering off the menu instead. I will try that next time.

I partially agree with Sandra R. in that the cucumber ice cube is a bit too much, the cocktail was much better when I let my drink sit and some of the cucumber mixed with the drink. Cocktails are meant to be drank slow, sipped and enjoyed. Something my generation does not understand, unfortunately. But the cube was damn large, maybe two or three smaller cubes would be better? Done talking about ice cubes now.

The second drink was their twist on an old fashioned cocktail. I say twist because I believe he added an olive instead of a cherry and used soda water versus plain. Beautiful. I appreciate a bartender/bar equipped with a muddler despite how simple. 

In all the decor was good. Eye pleasing without taking away from conversation. I went midday, the windows in the front brought in sufficient but not too much daylight. All the metals & classic seating fit together very well. I myself not so impressed with the Buddha chandelier. Whatever.

Great friendly, knowledgeable bartenders, caring enough to offer waters to people drinking (including myself), bars in this town need to do this more. Great lively atmosphere, no smoking inside (I smoke, don't mind this), some gaming & in addition to the craft cocktails there is also a few craft beers on the menu.

I started off with their Foie Gras and thought it was above average but not exceptional.

I ordered the Porterhouse medium-medium well and it came with a trio of sauces for dipping. I was not impressed with the steak, again I would say above average at most. I did like the soy based dipping sauce but it almost overpowered the natural flavor of the steak. So with that said, I could of used practically any meat and dipped it into that sauce and it would probably taste the same. I didn't care much for the other sauces including the bearnaise. (bearnaise, usually is my preferred sauce with a steak)

On the other hand, their Truffle Mash Potatoes.. I must say is impeccable! The texture was on point and the amount of actual truffles (not truffle oil) is right on the money. I'd take this over the steak!

Food: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Overall experience: 4/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I was a little hesitant to try Home Tasting Room after seeing mediocre ratings from when it first opened, but after 20 minutes of  walking in the cold, my friend and I settled here since neither of us have been to Home Tasting Room. 

And boy, did I not regret my decision! The highlight of our ""linner"" was meeting executive chef Xavier Lacaze who competed on Top Chef Canada S02! He has been working at Home Tasting Room for about 3 months now. To some people, this means nothing, but as a foodie I was ecstatic and a little starstruck. Super nice guy =D

That aside, Home Tasting Room knocked out some stellar food! Their menu concept is ""shared plates"" which is ideal for those who want to try a little bit of everything. We arrived at around 3PM and ordered from their dinner menu. Their menu consisted of simple, fresh, ingredients prepared in a careful manner. There were a few starters (soup and salads), a list of shared plates (~$15-$23), and entrees (~$26-$30). 

We ordered their:

- Charcuterie Tasting with Local Artisan & House Made Meats which included salami, smoked bison which was my favourite, cured sausage, and slices of meat terrine. There was a delicious yellow (maybe peach or mango) fruit compote, homemade mustard, and pickled onions, egg, and carrots ($23). If you like charcuterie boards, I suggest sharing this dish among 2-3 people. The meats weren't overly salty and there was enough variety to keep the juices flowing.

- Pacific Scallops with Brown Butter & Winter Squash Puree, Pine Nuts, Turkish Olive oil ($17). The dish came with 3 large scallops and a parital one that were seasoned well and perfectly cooked; not rubbery at all. The winter squash puree looked like baby food and had an odd lumpy texture, but it tasted rich from the brown butter which is always a plus. Another dish that I recommend if you like scallops.

- I ordered myself two East Coast oysters ($3.50/ea) that came with a House Mignonette. The oysters were clean tasting and the mignoette was delicious; it wasn't overly vinegary-tasting and had a nice light hint of vanilla.  

As the restaurant's name suggests, the ambiance was very warm, inviting, and ""homey"". They have an open kitchen concept where guests can sit up front and watch their food being prepared. It's partial stone walls makes the restaurant very beautiful in a rustic kind of way.

Our food came out all at once and in a very reasonable amount of time; then again we were the only people dining at the time and we avoided the lunch/dinner rush. Our server was friendly, but when asked about the drinks and to explain what was on our charcuterie board, he wasn't very knowledgeable which was disappointing. His shift must have ended in the middle of our meal because we got a new waiter who was more enthusiastic and engaging with us. 

Overall, I highly recommend a visit to Home Tasting Room for a ""shared"" type of meal and for deliciously prepared wholesome food. I found the prices to be reasonable for quality ingredients and expert preparation. I was definitely full from and satisfied with my meal. 

I will definitely come back to try the rest of their menu!",2012-11-03 22:06:35

The salad was good also but could have eaten more, it was a bit on the petite side. The oranges were yummy and fresh though and the vinagerette was light and great for summer.

When my in-laws said we were going to a virtual shooting gallery I wasn't sure what to expect, but it turned out to be excellent. We had a large group so they gave us two of the shooting areas that were located next to each other and brought us a nice selection of appetizers. The food was excellent and service was very attentive.

Now, as to the game play it was fun. Each area has two pistols and two automatic weapons that feel like real weapons. You can play everything from zombie shooting games to actual Police and Military scenarios. The Police scenarios are fun, and scary, because you can see how much pressure our officers are under and how hard it is to know who is a threat. Also, I noticed that another reviewer was upset that the Military scenarios all involve Arab combatants and while I agree that it would be fun to have Nazi or other enemy scenes, I think we need to consider where the US has been at war for the past 15 years.

I decided to get the same chicken sandwich here and I'm surprised this is a takeout place and not a sit-down. It was given in a takeout box, so I didn't expect a wonderful presentation. But I can't express how the sandwich had failed my standards; the bun was so stale!

The bun wasn't even toasted, so it was neither warm nor crispy at all. Secondly, the bun itself was stale! It was tough to rip apart and it looks like those Chinese bakery buns that have been sitting out for a week. I just threw away and ate the filling.

The filling was okay. There weren't a lot of crispy onions or avocado and the chicken was like room temperature. It just seems like the sandwich has been sitting there for a while and they just wrapped it up for you.

Nicole was very pleasant on the phone and got me in right away. I was booked with Janelle and she was finishing up with an appointment when I arrived. 

Nicole greeted me and offered me a drink. Then Janelle came over to introduce herself, and let me know she was finishing up with a client. Right away I felt in the presence of warm company. The studio was beautifully decorated and inviting, as well. 

Janelle really took the time to go over what I wanted for a cut. She even got out her computer to pull up a photo of an actress I mentioned as a reference. She fully explained every detail of what she planned to do and asked my opinion.

Not only was she on top of things when it came to the cut, but she was so personable and held a great conversation. I have a ton of hair and it takes a lot longer to cut my locks. Time flew by with this cut because we got along so well.

She did an excellent job thinning out my hair while maintaining the length. I have thick, course hair, but I want to grow it  out. There was a huge pile of hair on the floor, but it didn't look like she really cut the length. That was great. 

After she cut my hair, she went over a quick and easy way to style it. Being that my hair is so unmanageable, this was really useful. Usually I just tie it up in a ponytail and call it a day because I can never get it to look like it does in the salon. 

Though I didn't perfect my style like she did, I felt very confident doing my own hair. It turned out great the next day and was easy to pull off. That is a gift I rarely leave with after a salon trip. 

Overall, this was a great experience and I will definitely return. From the looks of it, the salon is filled with high quality professionals who are truly passionate about their work and clients. Though I am partial to Janelle and would send anyone to her, I think it's a safe bet that everyone provides equally outstanding serving.",2012-04-21 19:12:44

Glad I came because everything was very good.  I loved the unique items you could get such as octopus.  My friend was very amused by the shape of the octopus.  Very tasty and long to cook.  I didn't want to take any risks.  I had some of the rib eye and dang, they went all out and gave us the whole piece (about 8oz worth).  Very generous and I cooked it like a steak.  The soup was not what I expected.  I'm accustomed to the spicy tofu soup versus the paste type they had here. Poo.

The place does work on memberships so they will try to sell you on that after your massage, but the basic package is $50 a month and includes a massage so its not all that expensive ($39 is the rate for every massage after the included- $80 for non members) I am going to bring my Fiancee back when she gets home as we may be signing up...

I recently got into Kate Spade. Love the handbags, wallets and everything else! I prefer the store at the Forum Shops because it is bigger and the employees are much more friendly and helpful. However, we all know that parking at Caesars is a disaster! Figured I would have better luck with parking at Fashion Show during the weekend anyway.

Walked in, didn't get a greeting at all. I was carrying my new Kate Spade bag too! There were 3 employees talking story behind the register. Two other customers were shopping and being ignored as well. The store is small, but very organized and clean. Didn't find anything, which was a good thing because I refuse to spend my money in a store that is run by snobs! I mean, I really do hate pushy, irritating sales people but they could at least put on a smile and greet customers!

My Yelp friend was so relax and chill while we were chowing down Tacos at Yo Amo Tacos. The interior deco does reminds me of Playa del Carmen or somewhere in a resort area in Mexico. We were sitting at the sun room area overlooking a small ravine, not a beach but I can really use my imagination!

I really want a real Margarita but apparently the bartender was not in the house and no cocktails or foo foo drinks for me... (hopefully next visit!) I ended up having a Negra Modelo ($7.25)

We also shared: 

Fish Ceviche Taco ($6) - Fish or Seafood? Tasted a little bland and the seafood was hard and dry.. I have to remind myself I am not in Mexico!

Tuna Tartar Tostada ($7) - Really tasty and the condiments complimented the tuna tartar perfectly, will order again!

Short Rib Taco ($6) - Meat was tender and flavoured

Fish Taco ($6) - Fish was dry and mushy 

(Most of the tacos were really saucy and piled high with fillings, making eating a messy and tricky experience.)

And for dessert, the most important part of the meal, we shared:

Grilled Pineapple with Mexican Vanilla Ice Cream and Dulce de Leche ($8) - love everything! A great combination of texture, taste and presentation!

Churros in a Maya Chocolate Sauce ($7) - Churros were a little doughy but love the chocolate sauce.... and the presentation was interesting!

We really enjoyed our experience! A taste of Mexico up in Vaughan!

In fact, they're both kinda gross now! :(

The grilled fish burrito contains breaded fish and the breading texture is mushy inside the burrito. The flavor is weak.

The rice is skimpy on the chicken and you are given the option of if you want it spicy or not. It used to just have a nice mild spice to it. Now? Now, it is sweet! Blech! And, if you make it spicy, it's still more sweet than spicy.

I have to explain exactly what happened to us..... Well we ate, we got a tummy ache, went to the bathroom.

I have thick and long hair, it is not an easy task to keep this mane looking so gorgeous however she has no problem in keeping it stunning at all times.

I love color, I like the ""lion"" look. She is a color specialist in using multiple colors as well, I have her do a foil weave with a paprika red, a caramel and a dark chocolate.

She really should be working in Hollywood doing the hair of the movie stars she is that phenomenal. Her prices are reasonable, she charges no more than these other colorist around town that do half of the work that she does. 

She is simply Amazing and uses the best quality products and color available.  She is not only a hair colorist and stylist, she does it all.

She is an Awesome lady who is full of spunk and has an Amazing personality, if you can think of it, she can make it happen. Trust me!

I had the egg white omelet and could only finish half. It also came with breakfast potatoes that hit the spot. The meal wasn't fancy but it was good. When I'm in the area, I will definitely choose Harlow's Cafe as my breakfast spot. I'm just sad it took me this long to find it!",2011-06-21 05:07:07

There used to be a very charismatic Korean kid working here who would provide excellent customer service and run the whole restaurant by himself. Also, the food was always good. The Korean BBQ beef was always flavored to perfection, and the Chinese-Korean noodle dishes were better than what you get in Korea Town.  The free appetizers were always of the highest quality because they would make all the variations of kimchee by scratch and not order it premade. 

Yesterday, I came here with my best friend. He flew in from Norway and wanted some Korean food. He had been craving it for years since the only Korean restaurant in North Norway recently went out of business. The moment we stepped in, everything was different. The server was a new guy who was extremely hands off and barely came around. The free appetizers were no longer of high quality and was that generic kimchee you get prepackaged at those Korean markets.  The BBQ beef, which had gone up in price to $25, was now almost flavorless and tasted like they marinated it for only 10minutes and cooked it in a toaster oven. At most all Korean restaurants, they give you enough beef for 3-4 people. This place charges $25 and gives you only enough food to feed one person. For only like $9.99 you can get AYCE Korean Beef at some places and it tastes 100 times better than this.   

The Sushi I ordered tasted like they made it in the morning and refrigerated it.  As we all already know, Sushi is my favorite food in the world. I didn't expect ""great"" sushi from this place, but I did expect mediocre sushi. It wasn't even mediocre! To tell you the truth, I have never had bad sushi from a Korean style sushi restaurant. Korean sushi chefs are very creative and innovative and try to invent new styles and sauces for traditional sushi, which always turns out really really good. So, whenever I want great Sushi, I go offstrip 15 miles to ""Sushi Bomb"" where many of the chefs are Korean. My sushi at ""Ginseng 3"" was the first time I was disappointed while eating Sushi at a Korean style restaurant.   

Even though the service was so bad, my friend still left a giant tip. I don't know why Europeans always leave such big tips even though service sucks?

This was a first for me. It was the first time I ever had Sushi I could not finish, and it was the first time I ever got bad service from a Korean restaurant. Usually Korean restaurants have excellent service. Not this place... Oddly, the restaurant is now busier than it has ever been. Back a couple of years ago when the service and food were actually good, they  never had this many customers. Very strange...

I'm still give it 3-stars because my friend liked this place. I guess most 
Europeans can't tell the difference between bad and good Korean food.",2012-01-22 10:00:42

Ozl-y3hqdQKsCzmSNvBj1g,ykY7aVvXlNgKpnbNjhUciA,W7hCuNdn2gzehta6eSHzgQ,1,4,1,0,"I knew this place had poor reviews before Yelp was even around but was in the area in search of food. I improvised and went to one of the first places nearby.

I ordered a combo that was 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a drink.  Came out to just under $10.  For price comparison, the same thing at Long John Silver would be $5-6.

The shrimp were flat out awful.  They butterfly the shrimp to make it look bigger and then overload it with heavy batter before frying it.  I removed one of the shrimp from the breading and noticed it was probably 10 times smaller than the amount of batter used.  They use realllllly small shrimp, like 50-100 ct used in cheap shrimp cocktail platters at the grocery store.  

The fries are below average.  If you are going to have ""chips"" in your name, you need to have some of the best fries around.  They do not.  

 Their fish was okay because it wasn't overly greasy but again their breading is so thick and heavy it ruins it.  Fried fish should have a light batter.  In fact, nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use.  To top it off, their fish is served in the most natural of shapes.... a square.  If I want awkward looking fish, I'll head to the frozen section and get some fish sticks.
  
I saved the worst for part of the meal for last.  Their signature sauce.  That stuff was awful.  It tasted like it was 50% water and 45% ketchup and 5% vinegar.  They don't give you any tartar sauce, no malt vinegar and nickel and dime you for sauces on the menu.  I figured some other staples for this type of meal would be included but I was wrong.  I didn't even get to drown the bad food in a decent sauce, it was just more mediocrity.  

On to the most obvious quirk about the place, cash only.  If you are a cash only joint I assume you are trying to save the fees associated with accepting them and keeping your prices down.  Then why is the food so expensive?  It certainly isn't high quality.  It certainly isn't any good.  

Bad fish + bad shrimp + bad sauce + bad fries = 1 star.",2011-06-28 05:44:06

I've averaged the 5 and the 1 for a three star. I'd go back because it is so pretty, but I don't know that I would organize an event there in the near future either.

My first visit was during Oktoberfest, a bit of a gong show in the giant basement. Having just gotten back from Germany, it was fun to see the big picnic tables out and about, and the German band in full swing. The atmosphere was great, tons of people but still space to sit, our server was on it and the food that I stole off my friends plate was quite tasty! Overall, a 5 star experience! I love the decor - earthy, European, and just plain stylin'.

I was a little bit disappointed by the beer selection, but I grabbed the sampler, sat back and enjoyed the double headed bird decor. When we finally left a little bit early, I was surprised to see a big line coming out the door.

My second experience emphasized a lot of my bar pet peeves. First of all, I was late meeting some friends, and thought if I got there by 9, I'd beat the line. Not so. And not only that, the bouncer was not interested in letting me join my friends at their table and was downright rude. So, after a little friend- guilt tripping and a too long wait with them, we made it in for some increasingly bad service.

The drinks are, let's face it, overpriced for what they are, which I can live with when everything else comes together. But my second visit was a one star. Either Wurst is a little bi-polar, is getting a little too popular and its going to their heads, or the best time to come down is during lunch or dinner.",2011-11-10 04:15:10

It's a great little Japanese place in an area that was really needing it. 
We came on Saturday Afternoon, and there was no line, but started to get full around 1pm. 

They have an AYCE for $12.95 but the menu is limited (no sashimi, but lots of rolls etc) great for groups!

Lunch time, they have some great specials, including $7.95 for beef teriyaki and chicken teriyaki rolls (among a bunch of others). I thought they would give only a half portion of each (given that rolls on the menu range from $8), but they actually give you 2 full portions (12 pcs) along with miso and salad!

Because of this, in addition to my Sashimi Combo ($10.95), we got a Wakame Roll. 
The sashimi was good and filling, with salad, miso and rice. Big thick pieces - nothing to write home about, but was okay.
Wakame Roll wasn't amazing either, but still good. I thought it would be tuna sashim, but it was cooked, with sauce, maki dipped in tempura batter.

Cost: about $15 after taxes/tip for lunch. I've never been for dinner.

It's Greek food, so it's relatively not so fat, but that's a good thing. At any rate, you'll eat enough that you'll become fat I suppose, because the food is pretty good. 

The food is generally all really good, the skewers (not marinated, but you can always add taziki and/or hotsauce), fries (sweet potato fries as well, which are goooooood), calamari, and grilled veggies (I love grilled veggies) are all pretty good, made fresh in the open kitchen. 

Regarding the skewers and beef, honestly, some days are better than others. They cook them all in the open kitchen, some batches might be drier than others, but they're all freshly made.

Stuffed tomatoes, eggplant and a variety of stewed beefs round out the entrées, but I generally stick to the stuff I mentioned above.

For dessert, you have bhaklava, almond shortbread cookies, chocolate chip cookies, a variety of cakes (apple, coffee, chocolate, etc. etc.) and other carb heavy desserts, plus ice cream, all of which WILL make you fat. 

Here's a listing of their food if you're interested. While not Mandarin big, it's a decent size:

Dishes:  I'd say they have about... oh... 20 dishes.. chicken and pork skewers, some beef patty type things, spinach and cheese spanakopitas, french fries, sweet potato fries, calmari, roasted red peppers, roasted eggplant, roasted mushrooms, stuffed tomatoes, some saucy eggplant dishes, stewed beef, stewed chicken, some kind of lasagna looking eggplant dish, rice, steamed veggies, 2 soups, I'm sure I'm missing a few, but that's the majority of it.

The fresh pico de gallo is maybe the best I've ever had. It is super spicy and tart and fresh, and was inexpensive ($3.79). 

I also picked up a tiny tres leches cake ($3) because they were too darling to pass up. I thought it would be a perfect dessert for my party, but once I got home, I decided it was way too small to go around, so I instead ate the entire thing while standing over my sink.

If you peruse my reviews, you'll discover a few things about me. My food groups are often sugar, doughnuts, and BBQ. I also like coffee and liquor. Now yes, everything in moderation and all that - but point is, I am far from a crunchy granola hippie head. I don't need my food to be detoxifying or whatever, I need my food to taste good, I need to enjoy the experience of what I eat. And that is where Veghed comes in. This is the healthiest, most immaculately prepared, incredibly DELICIOUS vegetarian food that you will ever LOVE. LOVE, ALL CAPS LOVE. I have gone back to this place 3 times this week. The food here makes me feel like a super hero, like I can fly and move mountains and sh*t. But it also is some of the best food I've ever tasted. Faves are the Muay Thai Noodle Salad, an ammmaaaaaazzziiing deal at $7. You could totally make two meals of it, and it's fresh and delicious and full of yam noodles and veg goodness. The grilled cheese is some of the best I've ever eaten, complete with apple slices and honey on top. You can order it with the salad, for which I will quote Amy Pataki of the Toronto Star: 
""With the salad, a lavish affair starring 20 ingredients, Veghed gets interesting. Spiralized beets and zucchini meet cross-sectioned radishes and shaved heirloom carrots. Kale, spinach, broccoli florets, cucumber and a lime wedge bring the green. Crisp shallots supply crunch, as do the seeds: organic hemp, sunflower and pumpkin. Vegan lemon-pomegranate vinaigrette pulls it nicely together."" And I swear to you, on my first visit to Veghed, I actually watched the chef pluck one substandard piece of purple basil off the top of my salad, and replace it with another, more perfect piece of basil. They are meticulous about every detail here. Not only does this salad taste good, it's a feast for the senses - soooo many gorgeous colors and flavours and textures all coming together. It's harmonious, unique, and you won;t be able to stop eating it. I took a vegetarian friend for lunch and she commented how all of this leads to a stronger sense of satisfaction - veggie food can be boring, both in taste and in experience - food as fuel, not fun. This food is an experience will make you giddy, that you will want to enjoy over and over again, that will make you feel like a god. Oh, and they have this lemon-ginger-turmeric tea? They sell it in big mason jars for $10. It's like liquid gold. You can drink it hot, cold. I've been downing buckets of the stuff night and day, so addictive. Go get some now!",2015-12-04 04:09:03

Finally somebody shows up asks us what we want to drink. We gave our drink orders and said we were ready to order. To my disgust, she was only the ""drink"" person. She says she will go get our drinks and that our server will be out soon. A couple minutes later we get our drinks. Still no server.

I ordered the basil tofu with brown rice, which was not what I imagined it would be. It almost had a tomato-sauce taste and I really couldn't taste the basil, but there were tons of fresh veggies and the tofu was cooked well. It also wasn't heavy and greasy, which I like. Our food came quickly and was hot. I definitely had Thai on the mind and unfortunately Sun Penang didn't deliver killer Thai, but Thai is not their specialty.  The menu is more Chinese than anything.

This way, you know what the restaurant is good for and known for and you go there for those specific items or specialties. Arrogant Butcher was a place that fits this description. 

It's located in downtown Phoenix which is very close to US Airway center and the Chase ballpark. The place itself was quite huge with three different seating areas (the bar, main dining, and private rooms). The staff was nice overall and service was prompt because every server pretty much helps out each table. I know this may not seem like a huge factor but I liked it. 

We ordered the pretzel and fondue which seems like a hit for everyone. it was good no doubt, but you would prolly get sick if you ate too much of it. As for the main course, I had the King crab cioppino which was excellent! Gf had the short rib stew which was also excellent. We polished those dishes until it was clean and was full with satisfaction. 

Drinks were on the okay side. I had an old fashioned which was kinda watered down. Overall though, it was a very enjoyable experience with the food being the best part. Will definitely repeat again!",2012-08-07 04:46:29

The ambiance is really nice with dim lighting and lots of seating. I just didn't like where we were seated--it was for a birthday celebration and where we were placed, the birthday boy had people continuously walking behind him and it was a tight squeeze (to the point where he had to move his chair closer to the table just to accommodate people walking behind him).

There was a lot of meats (obviously) came our way, most of which we both enjoyed. We just didn't like how all of them were cooked rare, like I had blood on all my plates which is not a nice view. However, one of the meat carvers was very understanding and even cooked the meat we asked for well done. For the buffet, it was mediocre. The lasagne was actually disgusting, cold (although it was in one of those warmers), dry and just overall very bland in taste. I did enjoy the rice with black beans and the fruit spinach salad (I went back up twice for this). 

As for our waitress, she was very sweet and friendly but all I can say is that common sense isn't so common anymore. I had come in the restaurant a couple hours prior to my reservation as I wanted to surprise the birthday boy with a special cake I had ordered. I explained to the hostess that it was a surprise and so we would be ready for the cake after we were done eating our meals. So our waitress now, comes up to my table after we're done eating and asks us if we're ready for the cake to be brought out. I mean commonsense would tell me to not ruin the surprise, so I wasn't very thrilled about that. Other than that she was very sweet but just for future reference, if the cake is supposed to be a surprise, don't announce it to the birthday boy.  We also had plates break right beside our table 2 separate times so I guess we weren't seated in the best spot. 

To drink I got the Brazilian sangria which was actually very delicious so I would totally try that again.

I went for their lunch buffet one weekend and was very surprised by their meager selection. Their veggie spread was adequate,  but their meat section seemed like an afterthought: two meat curries and tandoori chicken. Their desert selection didn't have  gulab jamun and the like. Usually buffet restaurants ramp it up on the weekend, perhaps Bombay Palace does that for their buffet dinners.

The veggies were all very forgettable, the samosas had clearly come out of a frozen packet. The beef curry was flavorful and the tandoori chicken was very moist and flavored. Major props for that! However, I couldn't tolerate the butter chicken which was disgustingly sweet. The rice pudding was similarly half assed.

The reason for the lower stars is due to incredibly bad service we received. I came here on a Saturday morning (originally on going somewhere close by but there was a wait) we got seated immediately which was nice for a larger party. 

When we sat down we ordered drinks they do have all you can drink for 15 dollars (bloody marys, mimosa or belinis) and you can change them around. The bloody marys tasted like tomato juice, no flavor or spice. 

We ordered our food within 10 minutes of seating and then about 30 minutes later the server came and told me that the potatoes that I had requested without bell pepper were pre cooked with bell pepper and they can sub it with fries. I had said that was fine. After waiting an additional 30 minutes. (total of 1 hr after ordering) the server came and said it will be a few minutes before our food is ready. I asked if there was something they can provide us due to the long wait. The server stated they can bring us a fruit platter as we have been waiting for such a long time. 

We waited another 20 minutes and asked for a manger because at this time we were really upset for the length of time it was taking to get our food. We finally got the manager and he stated was coming out now.... we still had to wait another 20 minutes ( making it 1hr and 40 minutes by the time we ordered and 1 hr and 50 minutes from when we sat down). we notes the time as we had marked in metered parking.

When we addressed the situation with the manager he stated he would provide a 10% discount to the bill. He was arguing with us about the amount of time it took to bring the food out. 

The location, the view and food was amazing but the service and management was lacking. On top of everything they charged for the fruit plate they brought us, I had to bring it to their attention to have them take it off.

They've created the tom yum of my dreams, the tom yum I've only ever eaten on the shores of Sandakan, Sabah crafted by my sister-in-law, who happens to make an excellent Malay style tom yum kung.  That delectable and complex concoction that only fresh prawn heads can contribute to a homemade broth. That intense red chili infused soup that hits your taste buds with spicy, sour, sweet, and pungent flavor so strong if you breathe in while slurping the soup YOU WILL COUGH. This is the true calling card of Tom Yum, if you do not cough from slurping the broth too quickly then you know it's not that good.

Tom yum is bound to be good when you get that deep reddish orange sheen with bits of red chili flecked throughout. The galangal chunks were there, as well as lemon grass and lime leaves to give the sour balance. They lose in authenticity for refusing to use whole prawn... It's not their fault, it's ours. Why don't we USians understand the value of slurping the juicy brains of the prawn head? Such a loss of flavor. Here they cook the broth with prawn head to give the rich depth and then discard it. The real deal is to do both. Cook the broth with the prawn head and shells, discard, and then throw in the whole prawn for the patrons to pull apart and eat. 

I also ordered the khua fue with flat, wide rice noodle. It was excellent, and they deliver since we live so close. They also aren't badly priced. I will devour this entire menu, give me 6 months.

Walked in on Monday 1-25-16 at 5:30 PM and placed a to-go order.  This restaurant is located on Desert Inn & Pecos next to the dollar store.  The menu is posted behind the counter on the wall and has all the classic items you'd expect from a sushi joint with very little frills.  No fancy orgasm-sauce-covered-cream cheese-deep-fried nonsense here.  They do have other stuff besides sushi like teriyaki bowls, udon soup, edamame, bento boxes, etc.  
.
$35.62 got me an order of shrimp tempura, an order of fried chicken pieces, two sushi snack rolls, a shrimp tempura roll, and a rainbow roll.  I was on my way in less than 10 minutes!  Talk about ninja fast! 
.
The tempura shrimp were crunchy and very well flavored.  The star of the show was the fried chicken pieces...they were battered and then deep fried and so crunchy and juicy.  Both came with tasty dipping sauces.  
. 
Most of the rolls were maybe one step above gas station sushi...lots of cali roll filler.  I enjoyed the shrimp tempura roll the most.  The rolls were beautifully presented in a sushi tray with ginger and wasabi.  I was given soy sauce, napkins, forks, and chopsticks without having to ask which I think is thoughtful.

This is a great place if you want sushi but don't want to dine in.  Sometimes you just wanna take it to go and watch some Netflix on the couch.  I realize you can get take-out from just about any sushi place but this place is *designed* for it, friendly, and super fast.",2016-01-26 17:18:02

We had to go for the fireworks. 

Parking here can get a bit busy, the parking lot is rather small. There is several lots and dirt parking areas with people guiding you. At least you know where you are going. 

The food here is phenomenal. Its not just ball park food. Its tri tip, kettle corn, etc. We had a tri tip from one of the vendors. MAN was it good!!!!!

I noticed that it had mixed reviews on yelp but I was invited by  friends so I tried to keep an open mind. The first clue that I had that this  meal was not going to be that good was the fact that at 7:30 pm on a weekend night, there were hardly any people in this restaurant. Other than our party, there were perhaps three other parties in the entire restaurant. Most restaurants in CLT are busy on Saturday nights at that hour.

Basically the actual food does not live up to the menu.  I had the Chicken Marsala, it was not good, very bland, green beans not cooked well, almost raw - I did like  the cauliflower/potato puree. Overall, I felt I was eating a meal prepared for a senior citizen at nursing home who is on a restricted diet. It was just that bland and I left half on the plate and did not get a to go box.

Others in our party had pasta, one was a special and it was sent back because the diner said it tasted like Chef Boyardee (her exact words), the other diner had linguine and hardly ate any of it.  We also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was basically penne shells with very little  cheese sauce  on top, very bland and definitely not the traditional M&C. Both pasta dishes lacked sufficient sauce and seasoning.

The only people who seemed to enjoy their meals were the ones who ordered flatbreads, burgers and the Bass. We got a side of Belgian Frites which were barely warm and nothing special.  Another had the brussels sprouts as a side which I tried and they were dry and had no flavor.  We had two appetizers, the deviled eggs and bacon wrapped tater tots. The tots were great, the eggs, bland, no seasoning and somewhat small. The bread pudding dessert was quite good and others liked the chocolate cake.

In general, it feels like the chef does not taste what she/he is putting out, just churning out dishes with out much regard to the quality and flavor of the food. I gave it two stars since some dishes were a hit and the tots were good, even though my meal was not. 

With so many other restaurants to try in CLT, I can't see coming back here for dinner again. You only have one time to make a first impression and this place really missed the mark with me.",2014-12-15 18:42:35

I settled on an Office Max light useage diamond pattern shredder that was suppose to be 49.99 but was onsale for 29.99. Directly under the display and the price tag was a completely different model for 79.99. Oh...Kay...logically shouldn't you put it UNDER the display so if anyone wants it it's right there so they can grab it?

Finally found and flagged down an employee who grabbed the actual unit i wanted under the display of another model about 3 units down...yeah not exactly the most logical layout for goods.

The rotating menu does make it difficult to say what my favorite dish is - but honestly, they've all been very good. With these seasonal dishes, you can expect fresh food each time. Tonight, my husband and I ordered a tasty Lavender Row Rose wine, a cheese plate (with blue cheese, feta, and prosciutto) for starters, a lobster roll, and bouillabaisse.  

The cheese plate was phenomenal; I especially loved the fig jam and toasted almonds that came with the cheese plate.  The blue cheese just melts in your mouth!  The cheese plate also contained grapes, toasted bread, crackers and mustard - it was the perfect taste combination. The lobster roll was one of the most delicious ones I've had, since the cream-base was light and tasty, and the lobster pieces were huge and juicy.  It also came with a side cup of lobster broth, which I don't have any words for other than YUM.  My bouillabaisse was delicious - with a lot of seafood and a light broth (not swimming in too much butter and fat).

I ordered the challah French toast with melted Brie and fig jam and fresh mixed berries the first time. I loved the marble tables in the back of the restaurant - it added to the aesthetic of the picture and the dish. I'm not a big fan of Brie but the taste wasn't too strong which was good. 

The second time I went, I ordered the grilled shrimp and aged cheddar grits with poached eggs. I love grits but I wasn't sure how it would taste with cheddar cheese. It was a bit heavy and thick in my opinion so the grilled shrimp evened it out a bit but I don't think I'd get it again. I also ordered the almond coca mocha and it was sooo amazing! I would order it in the future again.  

And the third time, I ordered the shakshuka with eggs baked in spicy tomato sauce in an iron skillet with pita bread, potatoes, and fresh fruit on the side. This was an interesting dish because I've never had anything like this before. I definitely recommend dipping the pita bread with the eggs and tomato sauce because just eating the tomato sauce itself is a bit boring and doesn't seem like you're eating a meal. The flavor of the dish was a bit foreign to me in that there seemed to be a lot of spices but overall it was a good new experience. 

I tried something new this time: the Fried Eggplant Benedict! I think as I'm aging, I'm growing to love all different kinds of veggies so I went with the eggplant. It came with poached eggs with roasted cherry tomatoes on top, covered by basil hollandaise. And the English muffins under all of that. I was scared that the hollandaise would be too much for me but I really really enjoyed it. I liked the different textures of the fried eggplant, the poached eggs, and the roasted tomatoes. 

A bit of a warning though, the space inside is not too big so it can get crowded and loud during its busy hours. It's a popular breakfast/brunch place so I would say that for the weekends, you'd need to go in early to be seated quickly. Otherwise, the service is nice and friendly.",2017-05-21 01:14:10

So seeing how prices can be crazy expensive, we decided to visit for Brunch/Breakfast. Bouchon doesn't take reservations for Brunch or Breakfast, and is based on a FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. 

The wait doesn't seem to be too bad, I think for our party it was about a half hour, and they have little muffins to nibble on, while you are waiting and a pretty decent waiting area, with cafe tables and banquettes to sit around while you wait. They also have Thomas Keller's published cookbooks to browse around so killing time here isn't too much of hardship, although if you want to explore, make sure you leave one of your party behind to wait, while you do so, since they don't operate on a buzzer system  and they do it the old fashioned way, with someone calling out your name, which makes it beautifully organized chaos.

Food was extremely excellent and quite filling. Our party ordered the Benedict of the day (short rib eggs Benedict), chicken & waffles, Sourdough waffles; the Croque Madame; along with their pastry basket.

The pastry basket was pretty excellent, you get to choose a selection of what they have on the menu, in addition to what they have the board.  I loved their Pear Danish and their chocolate almond croissant the most, because they left me craving more of it.

I'd say definitely order the chicken & Waffles, which are chive and bacon waffles with half a roasted chicken which was so beautifully amazing, you could eat it on its own, as well as with the vanilla bean butter and their gravy that came with it.. I'd say skip the maple syrup that comes with it, since it really doesn't need it.

QlYu2qk1F6h_Kahs3cVcrw,jota0sSnaRVO-pyr1IM5IA,DT35ycaAVzbq83vVGRCoIQ,3,0,0,0,The first few times I had this place I thought it was amazing with the best value compared to the salad and sandwich combo places.  Price is better than Paradise/Panera and Wildflower and you get a full sandwich instead of the half of an already small sandwich at Panera.  I was so sold on the value and the complimentary choc dipped strawberry that I failed to realize the mediocrity of the food.  The non-creamy soups aren't very good and the creamy ones are literally straight up cream and little of anything else.  I avoid the soups now and do salad and sandwich combo. The salads are fresh and good but most are meatless and all are same tier since all are same price combos unlike the option to upgrade to premium salad and sandwiches at Panera.  I like their berry salads and pair it with a heartier sandwich.  They do have a better variety of sandwiches and do taste decent but the quality is slightly inferior to other places.,2017-10-09 06:24:53

I was heartily greeted by 5 members of the Walmart team. I was also asked if I needed any assistance 3 times in the grocery section. Yes, I wanted to by a watermelon ($3.88).

I then went to automotive. I wanted to find a vinyl repair kit. I scoured the aisles and could not find it. I asked for help. Voila! The staff member took me right to it. Service with a smile. I also found out that Transponder keys or chip keys can be made at Walmart for a fraction of what I purchased it for at ACE Hardware. Walmart price $30-45 per key. ACE price $75. I was informed that I couldn't check out my groceries at the automotive counter because they didn't have a weighing machine. Kudos to the cashier because he gave me the information before I waited in line. I paid for my automotive supplies there, then went to the self checkout in the front.

""Did you find everything you needed?"" 
""Yes,"" I replied, ""Everyone has been very warm and friendly today. I think I will challenge my students to greet at least 5 people a day."" 
""I recognize you, you're the teacher, right?"" Department Manager Estevan was there returning items to shelves when he recognized me from my visit last weekend. I complimented him and his team for such a friendly experience. He told me that this store was pretty active in hiring people living with disabilities and encouraged my students. ""When you start school, please tell them from me that if they work hard and try their best, they can work and hold a job."" Never did I imagine that I would be inspired during a visit to Walmart.

ceZ27HfFSFInGcpOSWcVZg,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,4,1,2,1,"Zooey-Mama!  This place has some decent 'que for being a chain.  I mean that in the nicest way.  This is some good stuff!

It was 'date night' recently and the lady and I finally decided to go visit Famous Dave's since we've always talked about it but never quite made the committment to try it.  So I gassed up the ride, put on some Mr. Bean in the DVD player, microwaved some popcorn, put out a couple Klondike Bars (hmmm...what wouldn't I do for a Klondike Bar?), and said ""Later, kids!""  And we were off!  Although, thinking back I think I forgot to leave another phone number in case of emergencies.  Luckily, everything was fine when we got back home.  Except the funny English accent my little one gave me upon our arrival (thanks Mr. Bean).

Famous Dave's interior is really...decorated.  This place is like the Disneyland of BBQ!  There's stuff everywhere, I guess this is what it's like to come to a corporate BBQ!  Nothing like those down home places where all you smell is smoke, the walls are dingy, and the chairs are rickety.  Looks like Dave's been making a healthy buck on his 'que.  But the place was inviting nonetheless.  

Famous Dave's has a good menu that includes lots of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, soups, and BBQ combos.  But we were there for one thing only, the infamous 'Que for Two' for $19.99!  Sorry, payday wasn't until the next week and it was all we could afford.  Hard times I tell ya!  Upon ordering this from our server with some cold drinks, he was on his way.  20 minutes later our BBQ bliss had arrived.

I heard from co-workers that the Que for Two wasn't enough for two people and that I would be hungry afterwards.  Me being a 'husky' sized Asian boy was a little let down upon hearing this.  But when our platter arrived, I sure wasn't disappointed!  There was more than enough food for two!  We had four of Dave's 'Famous' ribs, 1/2 a BBQ chicken, 1/2 a serving of chopped pork+1/2 a serving of beef brisket (I couldn't decide on which one so I asked for both..ha ha), Famous Fries, two cornbread muffins, and a side of garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  I gotta tell ya'...it was all pretty good!  The ribs were moist, flavored well, and cooked just right with a tiny bit of bite in em'.  The chopped pork and the brisket were very good too, and tender.  But the biggest surprise for me was the chicken.  Often times chicken can get dry in a BBQ pit but this one was super succulent and moist, and the rub was great.  This was my fav of the night.  And it was all so good with their sauces!  I liked all six of them but my favs were their original Rich & Sassy, Sweet & Zesty, and the Devil's Spit (sucker is spicy hot!).  Service was good, our server kept up with us and kept us stocked with wet naps and our drinks full.  

Next time, I'm taking the kids with us and we're so gonna have the All-American BBQ Feast...old school and served on a trash can lid!  The lid is lined with paper...of course.  I saw it that night on a table...and the sucker is HUGE!  It can easily feed four people...unless you're a mighty Samoan...then this would be considered your 'Que for Two'.  

We had enough food leftover to take a doggie bag home for the kids.  Admittedly, I finished the last rib that night as a midnight snack.  But I did leave the fries for them!  But I did also manage to finish the little one's Klondike Bar.  Boy, am I a big lil' piggy.",2010-09-15 17:38:03

At another counter, I got a double burger.  The only choice for cheese was cheddar, but the burger was actually a relative bargain, at $8.25.  The two greasy patties with nicely melted cheese, with tomato, lettuce and onion, turned out to be a good choice.

We were in Montreal looking for apartments before our move there this summer and chose this place based on location and Yelp reviews. Although expectations were high, the restaurant exceeded expectations! We loved every. single. dish. What's more - portions are big for tapas and priced very reasonably.

I started with a cucumber mojito. The small pieces of cucumber were like bursts of freshness in my mouth!

The sorocco salad was made with extremely fresh vegetables and was topped with a generous portion of manchego cheese. The croquetas were crunchy on the outside with warm melted cheese inside. I have never had calamari like those here! The pieces were very meaty and cooked well, with breading to compliment, instead of overpower, the main feature. 

If you want one recommendation from the menu, definitely go for the fried cauliflower! I was worried we were getting too many fried items, but the cauliflower was not deep fried. It was cooked perfectly, with generous amounts of truffle oil.

We finished with the churros and, although good, I would highly recommend the house made cookie, which was served to us to sample. To call it a cookie does not do this dessert justice, in my opinion. It starts with a layer of dark chocolate, followed by caramel, and finished with a short bread cookie type base.

Open only for dinner service, reservations are highly recommended, but if you go later in the evening finding a table should be easy.  The interior is all very nice and worthy of bringing a date, but the staff seemed young and poorly trained.

Portion sizes were a tad small so factor that in when ordering. The lack of Green Papaya Salad on the menu was the first hint that things were amiss.

Most of the visitors there were in business wear and presumably taking a fancier lunch break from work.  

I ordered the clam chowder to start, and it was one of the best ones I had - definitely comparable to what I tried when I went to the east coast.  Creamy and flavoured to perfection, I can't even.  

I also had a spoonful of their special French onion soup.  Oh em gee.  The first and only time I ever had it was unfortunately at Timmie's.  My impression of French onion was forever tainted after that time.. but Duncan House saved this dish for me.  The cheese coated the soup perfectly and the onion flavour seeped deliciously through.  However, it's definitely a very filling soup as the people that ordered it all felt somewhat full after finishing it.  

For the main, I had the special of the day which was a 6oz New York steak with crab cake and seasonal veggies.  The surf and turf combo was nice since the resto is supposed to be known for both.  However, I found the crab cake a little salty.  I had my steak medium rare, and that was done just right with nice, subtle seasoning.  

Recommended for a special occasion as the dinner menu is definitely on the pricey side - but ambiance is great and good for bigger groups as well.",2014-11-08 07:03:43

Procare balances those concerns well. Visits are usually pretty quick, and it helps that they have an on-site pharmacy to fill your script before you go, so another stop isn't necessary.

As Brandon L's review puts it, this medical center is not the best or the worst, but your treatment will depend on who you work with. My guy and I drive significantly out of my way to come here. Have met with a few different doctors and PAs here, and I prefer to work with Dr. Ida Sorongon when she's available- good bedside manner, efficient and informative.",2016-06-19 07:48:09

What a great place.  Wonderfully comfortable chairs outdoors - such a nice private space and great ambiance.  We enjoyed some white wine and prosecco and the crab dip.

The crab dip was one of the best we have ever had, and the drinks wonderful and cold.

I have to say - the Ritz has ""it"" right.  The ""it"" being service.  We went in and the front bar was closed so the concierge escorted us to DEQ and helped us find a table.  Then Megan looked after us for the whole time we were there.  She did a fantastic job (thanks Megan!).

We had actually seen a movie at TIFF Lightbox and tried to get a drink at the Luma bar afterwards and after sitting for a while at the bar being totally ignored, we left and went to the Ritz.  Best move we ever made!!

Folks -- this place is in the same price cat as Luma or any other of the nice bars like Canoe, or Bymark and so if that is the kind of spot you enjoy then try out DEQ, you won't be sorry!

I used to frequent the Mimi's in Orlando for brunch, lunch, and dinner often and I am so glad they've finally opened one up in Charlotte.  

I love the unique menu selections and -- pardon the NOLA pun -- ""jazzed"" up traditional American items.   This past weekend, we went for brunch, and I was sad to see the crabcake benedict missing from the menu.  Although good, but not as tasty, I tried the Tuscan Vegetable Omelette which was supposed to be spinach & artichoke dip in an omelette, but it was more like just artichokes...without the dip.  It was still good, though, but next time I'll stick with one my other favorites:  Cajun Chicken Sausage & Eggs or Crab & Avocado Omelette.  As usual, my egg dish came with one of Mimi's huge, fresh muffins.  I went with their seasonal pumpkin one (instead of my favorite buttermilk spice), and I wasn't disappointed!

My partner had their seasonal Pumpkin Pancakes.  They were SO full of delicious autumnal flavor that the caramel cinnamon apples on top was overkill.  'Tis the season for pumpkin, but try 'em without the apples!  

We were a little concerned that the service wasn't going to be very good as it took our server Ty a little while to first visit our table with all the new tables she'd just been sat, but once she did arrive, everything went very smoothly from then on and she provided excellent service.

SERVICE: Slllllow. Well, slow if you're sitting outside. Have not experienced the indoor service as of yet. Had to go in and ask for our waitress a majority of the time.

ENTERTAINMENT: Awesome, guys. Love me some patio action with some corn hole and watching my VCU v. Butler game on two wide screen plasmas outside. Good location.

DRINKS: We spend a decent chunk of time there, so drinks are as follows:
Bloody Marys: Crappy. Weak, and not enough hot.
Margaritas: Also crappy Very syrupy, and very weak.
PBR buckets: Can't really go wrong there.
And the winner of the night and my new all-time favorite is....:
BAILEY'S BAR SHAKE WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM. May or may not have been the highlight of my night. Dunno why I've never thought to make one, but these things are friggin delicious. Hope it catches on in other establishments (hint hint, nudge nudge). 

FOOD: The teriyaki chicken skewers are deeeelicious. Great, great bar food. Wish they had more options like this at other places instead of just either having fried or nachos. Kudos, Jackalope. Also, the onion rings were delicious and you get a ton.. Heard compliments on the gyros as well.

This afternoon, I dined here for lunch and was pleased from the get-go. I arrived a little bit before my fellow lunchers, so I put our name in. It must have been perfect timing because about ten minutes later, the place had a line out the door. So for note one, I say to come at off hours, so for example, come at 11:50 instead of 12. 

The atmosphere here is open, airy and fresh. I love the sidewalk patio and the windows so that even if you aren't eating outside, you can still experience the fresh air and outdoor feel. The bar is seated in the middle and I noticed several local brews on tap. I also noticed several tasty drinks such as a skinny berry mojito. Since it was the middle of the day on a Tuesday, I didn't get the chance to try it, but you better believe that I will definitely be back! 

Now let's move on to the food. Have you been to Culinary Dropout? If you answered yes, then you will be well familiar with this food. Sam Fox did an excellent job of mirroring the menu from his Scottsdale restaurant for the Arrogant Butcher. I saw that they have a similar Turkey Pastrami on the menu and I was told that the sweet potato tortellinis are to die for, more like dessert. Unfortunately, I personally didn't try either, but I did have the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh with avocado added. It came in a rather large bowl and I will admit that I ate every last bite it was so good. The dressing is an Oregano vinaigrette and the salad is graced with grilled chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, almonds and a couple other secret ingredients they didn't list on the menu. 

After our ""ladies who lunch"" 'esque meal, the staff happily validated our parking (making my parking free!) and sent us on our way. As we walked out the doors, we were met with the carpenters union who decided that today was the day to protest, but that's what happens when you're in a real city right? And if that's the case, Downtown Phoenix...you are well on your way!

This seems like the perfect spot to eat at before a game, especially since they accept reservations and they are across the street from the stadiums! I did overhear the hostess say that there aren't many tables that seat more than six, so if you are coming with a large party, you should probably call ahead to ensure seating.

I love the staff and their outgoing personality but they need to cut back the chatting when the lines are 10+ deep.  I do not mind waiting for staff to acknowledge each customer that buys product, but do they have to take 3 minutes with each? I no joke waited over twenty minutes for a coffee. That to me is ridiculous and I do not think I will be stopping by the Goodyear location anymore during the morning rush. Coffee is still great but if I get laid off for being late to the office, I won't be able to afford any coffee. :)",2016-05-06 08:17:37
egOd2SLn8UdU7sQHzlTnKg,nffEoRhzQYVIL3Y6bFhcGA,BqnxN4hHahZ-zZGXDDGLsg,5,4,0,2,"I have a long love affair with the BLT chain.  It started a few years back at the location in West Hollywood, my favoritE of e three I have visited. Been there many times, it is in close competition with mastro's for my favorite steak house in LA. I also visited the original BLT in NYC, which was certainly fine but not in the same class as the WH & Scottsdale locations.

The Scottsdale location is in the elegant Marriott and matches the southwestern theme perfectly.  We had amazing service from the moment we were greeted at the door til the moment we strolled out the door stuffed to the gils and happy as clams.

Popovers: always one of e best parts of the meal.

Chicken liver pate: THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL. so good I have made this at home. I ate most of it myself.

Starter: beet salad with sprouts and goat cheese. Five stars.

Entrees: petite filets all around. Five stars, Every steak cooked to perfection. We shared the horseradish sauce which had an interesting whipped texture. I also insisted we try the peppercorn sauce which was everyone's favorite.

Sides: creamed spinach, five stars, what is in this stuff? It was the best creamed spinach I have ever had. I would bathe in this stuff.

Baked potato, hard to go wrong, perfectly baked, ginormous, five stars. 

Mignardises: soft warm little gooey brownies. I was too full to nom, but my friends gave them five stars.

The sommelier recommended a bottle of Stags Leap Hands of Time red blend...outstanding rec. We told her our likes and dislikes and what we were attracted to on the menu, and she suggested the Hands of Time which was fabulous. I would have liked the wine to be served about 10 degrees warmer, but once it opened up it was beautiful. I will buy this if I come across it at a wine store.

Everything was wonderful food & beverage wise, and every moment of our service was sheer perfection. Thank you for the lovely evening, BLT.",2011-04-11 20:03:26

But those tacos. Oh! Those tasty, tasty tacos. They rival some of the best tacos I had while traveling in Mexico. You'd be seriously missing out if you eat here and don't order at least one taco. So, do what we did and order tamales AND tacos. I recommend the chorizo and pastor. My BF loved the asada. Honestly, I don't think you could go wrong with any option. Except the tongue (lengua on the menu). I don't think I'm brave enough to try tongue. 

We ordered enough food to feed a small army -- we wanted to try a little bit of everything, ok?! -- and our total bill was $20. So, tastes amazing and is kind on the wallet. Si, por favor! We'll be back often.",2016-03-05 17:09:59

Every time you order some meat or cheese, she will show you a sample slice to see if the thickness is to your liking, and then insist you take that piece as a sample.

Next time I'm jonesing for a great sandwich, this'll be high on my list of options. So far, I've tried the turkey and the pork. Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but the servings are huge.

S_IzX782UXtgzZEgQzh6Mg,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,2,5,4,3,"Randomly ate here yesterday as my wife had a meeting down in Town Square. Ordered an Emma (turkey, bacon, swiss, sprouts, honey mustard) on wheat. Lots of bread, sprouts. Weak portion of turkey. Honey mustard was overpoweringly sweet. Johnny McGuire's is banking on the Blue Martini and Cadillac Ranch crowd. ""I'm too drunk to go down this escalator! Ooh let's get a sandwich baby!""

I'm surprised that the LV location didn't grill my Emma's turkey, bacon and swiss together like they usually do at the Aspen location. I wonder if the Nevada health code is tougher than Colorado's because Johnny McGuire's in Aspen does a lot of raw steak action on the grill combined with putting whole sandwiches on the grill, then grills turkey, then some more raw steak, then grills bread, and so on, all with the same spatula. 

NOT surprised that the guy and girl working behind the counter in LV were both on the rude side. When I didn't order chips, fries or a drink with my sandwich the guy looked at me like a vending machine that got his Snickers bar stuck. With the tone of ""I've told you 10 times before, and I won't tell you again!"" he told me to pick up my sandwich on the other side of the counter. Roger that, buttface! Also not surprised that other Yelpers have been experiencing the same Johnny's bad attitude. 

Having been an Aspen local for 7 years and an unofficial local (summers only) for 4 years before that, I have had my share of the Aspen Johnny McGuire's experience. Eating at Johnny's in Aspen is pretty good and safe at breakfast, but because of the same-spatula phenomenon that happens there, any other meal is a 5 to 1 crapshoot. I can't count on all of my fingers and toes how many times friends and acquaintances who ate a Johnny's sandwich complained of a twisting knot in their belly and either threw up or had the runs for the rest of the night. Truth is that all of that random grilling madness makes their sandwich taste great (and greasy) but it takes about 2 or 3 twisting knot episodes to learn to tread lightly (go for breakfast or when it's not busy for less cross-contamination).

The staff at Johnny's in Aspen usually consists of a hard-working and energetic (usually Hispanic) spatula master and one or two other 'hater' 20-something snowboarder/skater types (the kind who get mad at you if their girlfriend checks you out). Johnny's has historically attracted a rude audience - four long-time 20-something customers were convicted of multiple armed robberies and grand theft of a Range Rover a few years ago. They ate at Johnny's almost every day.

Bottom line: The LV location doesn't taste as good as the Aspen one. Same ingredients, same skimpy meat portions, even the same weird big-ass cookies. Wondering if the LV staff was trained to prepare for the same punk-ass clientele that the Aspen location attracts. If so, Johnny has it wrong. The LV location should try to be nice - from what I saw their customers are half LV locals and half tourists. Men and women can actually walk into the Las Vegas Johnny McGuire's without getting tripped by a skateboard, hit on, or spat on! 

Johnny McGuire's makes Subway look like Capriotti's.",2010-05-01 03:38:19

My friend had the strawberres and cream and liked hers as well. My waffle was not cooked all the way in the middle, and I didn'even blink an eye I just kept swooping that delicious forkful of belgian inspired wonder right onto my tongue. Coffee is priced fairly cheap just drip coffee buts ok in a pinch for coffee. I love lattes and cappucinos so I would love if they had this option on their menu, but that would make it more of a patisserie than a waffle shop. All in all fun little stop great snack to warm you up from your shopping trips down murray ave.

 I don't know how it compares to Oh yeah's over in shadyside but after comparing yelp reviews I chose it over the 3rd waffle shop which is close to Oh yeahs (name escapes me). The only gripe I have with some of the shadyside eats and treats places including Oh yeah's are the hours catering to nightlifers. That may be good for business but you're missing business from us thirty somethings who graduated kindergarten and love to enjoy brunch at brunch time (sunday morning to afternoon!) :)",2012-02-25 17:59:28

The prices are affordable. This restaurant isn't the most beautiful place I've ever laid eyes on, its just okay looking inside and out. The food though, is fantastic.

dZL6MluHo2RdxD5TbSqwfA,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,4,9,2,8,"In spite of only seeing a couple of Yelp friends' reviews to date (seriously, guys, do some writing), the hype machine has been in full force for Brew Tea Bar. It's not close to my part of Henderson, but I made it a point to stop by at my earliest opportunity, and I'm making it a point to write a review ASAP.

Brew Tea Bar is one of those ""Asian"" places with milk teas, flavored non-milk teas, slushes (not smoothies), and also freshly brewed premium teas and crepes. It is not all-star tier in my book (yet?), but they did a really good job on most of what I tasted, and they're at least as good as local Yelp darling Kung Fu Tea.

They were empty when I arrived before noon (although this would change quickly), and they greeted me with a smile and a laminated menu. This menu has a little Brew Tea Bar logo next to what they call their most popular drinks. Oddly enough, this distinguished selection doesn't include their namesake ""The Brew"" milk tea (described as a premium black tea with milk).

I did end up with a so-called popular drink, a taro milk tea ($4.50 for a large 24 oz) with honey boba (+$0.50). They didn't have to tell me that it had fresh taro because I taste it, and I could feel the bits of taro root. At default sweetness, it was not too sweet. It wasn't very sweet at all for my palate, actually. It's probably the best taro milk tea in town just because of the natural taro that they use, which tastes nothing like that artificial powder junk. The honey boba was nice and chewy, and it wasn't overly sweet either - after all, it does tend to take on the sweetness of the drink. It's on par with what I agree is a great boba add-on at Kung Fu Tea.

I took a sip of a friend's passion fruit slush ($3.95). It's too sweet by default, and it's probably made from an artificial syrup. I might order or try to sample it with less sugar just to get a better read on it. I also tried a ""Classic"" crepe ($4.95). It was a thin shell filled with strawberry, banana, Nutella, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream (+$1.00), and topped lightly with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar. I loved the fresh fruit, reasonably vanilla-y ice cream, and chewy crepe dough. It was not too sweet, and I might order it for myself if I'm ever around here and not full and/or sugar-loaded.

Finally, I ordered their new off-menu large coffee latte ($5.13), which comes with sea salt cream just as their tea lattes do (sea salt cream seems to be new to the Vegas scene, by the way). They had mentioned it during the decision-making period of my initial purchase. While I'm not a coffee drinker, I've had the famous 85°C sea salt coffee enough times to make a comparison between the two.

Guess what, folks? Brew Tea Bar's version is better. The coffee flavor is more prominent here. Although they will prepare it with or without sugar, I had to go with ""with."" Now even if they add the same amount of sugar as 85°C, the potent coffee flavor throws the ratio off. Fortunately, they will tweak the sugar to your liking either when making your order, or after you've mixed the cream into the coffee and tasted it. Although I could have handled the drink with the default sugar level, I requested more sugar and really loved the result. This adjusted drink was still not as ""sweet"" as 85°C, which again speaks to the coffee's strength. By the way, I still have about 2/3 of the drink sitting in my fridge since I don't have the caffeine tolerance that others might. This particular drink is worth going out of your way.

The service is great. As I implied above, they will adjust and remake drinks until you're happy, which is an awesome policy. They gave egg pudding samples (reportedly good, will order next visit), so maybe they'll provide other samples? They add a cardboard sleeve even to cold drinks, and they actually hand-cut the sleeves to fit regular 16 oz cups. They bring your drinks to you if you're sitting at a table or bench. They also cook the crepe to different doneness levels, provide a buy-10-get-one-free stamp card, and even take orders over the phone.

I'm saying that Brew Tea Bar gets 4.4 stars for now (mathematical OCD makes me wanna round up for 4.5), and I'm even more excited now to try more of their drinks. They seem to make their drinks more balanced (aka not sweet) than other places do by default, they have good tapioca pearls, and they clearly care about their customers. To me, they're already one of the best tea / milk tea spots in town. Hopefully, they will continue to innovate while maintaining their standards. Maybe this also bodes well for the overall boba scene of Vegas.",2015-07-26 22:43:14

This place is seafood heaven. They have at least 20 types of oysters at all times. You can buy all of them per dozen: however, some oysters you can get in a box of 50 or 100 for even cheaper! We bought a box of 50 PEI oysters for $48.88. 

The oyster shucking knives are only $4.99 and work like a charm. I got the small black one with the plastic guard and didn't have any trouble opening all 50 in one sitting. 

The guys who run this place are very welcoming and friendly, not to mention, knowledgable. Ask them anything and they will have an answer!

Our server Renee was awesome! She was very patient as we took our time to decide, and was very attentive to our table.

We decided on shrimp and grits and fish and chips.
Both were absolutely delicious.
The shrimp and grits was just the right portion size. 
The shrimp was just the right amount of spicy and the andouille sausage gave it a nice kick. Grits were creamy and well seasoned.

The Fish and Chips were served in a cute tin bucket which kept the heat in throughout the meal. The fish and chips are served with coleslaw and tartar sauce. The brownish color of the coleslaw admittedly is a little strange but i assume it was beer based to make it that color but the flavor was excellent.

For all of the St. Ignatius fans seeing the Reisch burger on the menu will put a smile on your face.

The only thing i was a little puzzled about was the entry. It is rare to see an entry with no option other than to climb a set of stairs, albeit only 3 to get into the restaurant Maybe i missed another entrance but if you have issues climbing stairs or have a family member that this will challenge call ahead for entry options.

Clearly it's the food.).

There's two big differences about Aloha Kitchen that make it one of my preferred Hawaiian places:

1.) The inside is actually a really nice place to sit and enjoy a meal. You can take out if you want, but if you aren't in a rush, you can sit and relax a spell in a nice, clean, comfortable (albeit small) dining area, and enjoy your food at your own pace. Some Hawaiian places feel like they're being run out of a box, and that's fine when doing take-out or delivery, but sometimes you want to stay and enjoy the food right from the kitchen.

And

B.) There's something about the mahi-mahi here. It's amazeballs. Now, I'm not a big judge on authenticity, I've never been to Hawaii, I don't know how the locals make it, but I'm a big fan of their food and eye candy, and in both I know what tastes I like. (Heyooooo...) So while other places fry their mahi-mahi (and that's tasty, don't get me wrong, me and fried are best buddies), Aloha Kitchen uses, like, this egg batter, then kinda flash-fries it. It's hard to explain, but it's SO GOOD. You get the mahi-mahi, and you're like, ""Hey, Aloha Kitchen, you can't fool me! I ordered fish, not an omelete!"" It seriously looks like you ordered an omelete, but you bite in and it's delicious Hawaiian fish that's A-Mahi-Mahi-MAZING.

(""A-Mahi-Mahi-MAZING"" trademark 2012 R. Bates, Inc.)

I seriously can't describe it any better than that. It just has to be tasted. So go taste some Aloha Kitchen. Then eat it, because just licking things is weird and probably unsanitary.",2012-11-05 02:22:50

This place came highly recommended by my sister, who was a pastry chef at the Bourbon Steakhouse. She's eaten here a number of times and loved it. Since she's Miss Picky Eater, I took her suggestion to heart and came here on my last night in town.

I was not disappointed.

I arrived in time for happy hour. I was able to grab a few drinks and a seat at the sushi bar. It was an honor to have Chef Yasu see to all my dining needs. He provided excellent suggestions. 

I ordered the ankimo monk fish liver, ocean trout nigiri, Japanese snapper nigiri, cream scallop, bistro green beans and the bistro albacore tuna. My favorites were the ankimo, ocean trout, bistro albore tuna and the red snapper nigiri. I was SUPER pleasantly surprised with the snapper. Past experience gave me the expectation that a red snapper is one of the more tougher fishes for me to eat, especially with that bit of tendon that never gets removed. Chef Yasu proved that it could, in fact, be soft, tasty AND delicious. 

If you couldn't tell, I stuffed myself silly.

Based on recommendations from yelpers, I wanted to try this out as my 100th review of the year / Yelp 100 Challenge.  I wanted my review to be on a restaurant, and something to compare.  I was very happy in Sakana!

a.  Crowded - Oddly not very busy. Only three of us at the bar.This was at noon for lunch.
b.  Ambiance - Very nice, trendy, and at same time comfortable. 
c.  Service - Key attribute here.  Everyone is nice and friendly and always available!
d.  Food - Ahhh,  this is where the placed excelled!

-To test the quality of this place, i chose the basics that I eat at all sushi places 
- Amai Ebi - Loved the small and delicate shrimp.  The fried fish heads were perfect, 
- Uni - Ahh, what a unique way they prepare it.  Absolutely delicious.

Based on these two, the taste, texture and results were 5 star.  We also had Hamachi and Tuna both belly fat cuts. Tobiko, Mirugai,  We had a fine selection of nigiri sushi that Chef Sai made when I told him I wanted to focus on traditional sushi.  I would say, what a great chef and great choices.  We had a special tuna with jalapeno on it and that too was darn good.

What I really enjoyed besides Chef Sai reading my mind and starting to make me some great stuff, is that all the nigiri sushi came with a very small amount of rice, so you had plenty of room for the fish.  That was awesome. I basically asked the Chef to make me some traditional nigiri sushi and I like the weird stuff, no rolls.

This place is definitely going to come to you.  Great Quality, great taste.

Cafe Zupas is actually completely different, you start by picking a soup, salad, then sandwich if you want a combo. You can order the half sized soup or salad (4.39) depending on your appetite or a whole size. Usually a half will fill me up plenty (and I usually have a large appetite).

To do's: I would recommend the lobster bisque and tomato basil for the soup. Both are rich and creamy, and the tomato basil comes off with a slight sweet but good balanced taste. It also comes with 2 rolls, and for every item you get ie. A soup, a salad, or a sandwich; you get a free chocolate covered strawberry.

To don'ts: I would keep away from the clam chowder, although it isn't horrible, it has a strange cheesy flavor. Similar to parmesan, but it just comes off as a little awkward and rich tasting in a chowder; it just didn't belong.

Must try: the chicken pesto panini. The outer crust is a little hard and crisp, but the fillings taste great and the alfalfa sprouts in the panini don't over power any of the flavor.

Sure why not: the crab salad panini was mediocre, and had a little bit of a tuna melt taste to me. I wouldn't recommend it, but if you like that kind of rich flavor and soft texture, then I say go for it.

On days where I'm driving by, I'd recommend coming here for a quick lunch, it's definitely a good spot to just grab a bite on break from work.",2015-12-16 17:03:00

My second favorite then I ordered the (I think it was ) the braised tofu which was fried tofu and mixed veggies again yum and great cold the next day too!!

I ordered a Pisco Sour, the typical peruvian drink, its in between a margarita and a moijo, without  mint.  It was on spot.   We enjoyed a Ceviche Mixto as a table appetizer.  It was very nice.  It had a kick to it.  Of course, I had the Aji de Gallina.  This is one of my favorite peruvian dishes and they didn't disappoint. My hubby had the Carapulcra, very tasty.

We've been to this location a couple times per year for the past few years and it is always pretty good. The sushi? There's better in the valley. The tepanyaki? Same. The drinks? Pretty good. The prices? On par with everyone else and the happy hour specials are pretty good.

But let's be realistic here. Most people come for the chef's table birthday special. The coupon has gotten worse over the past year. It is now a discount with another purchase, cannot be combined with happy hour prices, and the times you can come are more limited. They are all fair policy changes since businesses need to (and deserve to) make money. But at full price I do not find the food or experience to be worth the trip across town. There are areas with better sushi, better tepanyaki, and better prices.

It is good but not great. If there was a location in the west valley I could see going here when I got the itch to sit around a table grill.

Hands down, we think this was probably the best Italian food either of us have had since we were in Priaiano on the Amalfi Coast and we became addicted to a family-owned restaurant called La Strada.

It's not a big place, but the booths and tables are set comfortably spaced and the ambiance is warm and cozy.  DH and I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table at 7 pm on Saturday night----the dining room and bar were full of happy eaters!  The smells were out of this world and we just got hungrier!

We got seated and within moments, Uncle Louie himself came to take our drinks order since the servers were super busy.  I chose an Angeline Pinot Noir and DH took the Leese-Fitch Adobe Merlot.  I am a fan of Angeline and there's always a few bottles in the rack at home, so it was what I expected, but DH said his merlot was very good.  Again, only a couple of minutes passed before we had our healthy pours and we took a look at the menu.  A lot of lovely offerings without being overwhelming.  I decided to start with the Lobster Bisque (not the most Eye-talian choice, but it was cold and a hearty bisque sounded good) and DH selected the Uncle Louie's house salad.

Italian or not, the Lobster Bisque, as our server said when I ordered it, was off the grid delicious.  Creamy and rich with a hint of sherry and FULL of chunks of succulent lobster.  I could hardly eat it fast enough!  My only caveat was that it could have been hotter.  It wasn't cold or even cool, but how incredible it would have been warmed a few more degrees.  DH said his salad tasted ""just picked"" and the light balsamic vinaigrette was delicious.  For my entree, I had the veal picatta and DH went for the chicken saltimbocca.  We had the choice of pasta or a medley of fresh sauteed veggies---we both had the pasta.  Well, there is a reason the veal picatta is the house specialty.  It left me speechless---probably because I was stuffing my mouth!  The quantity of perfectly cooked veal scallops was generous---I really shouldn't have been able to eat it all along with the mound of pasta, all deliciously soaking up this lemon and caper and wine sauce---oh, my!  Yet, I did.  And DH had absolutely no problem scraping his plate clean of his chicken saltimbocca, he said it was perfectly executed, without the over-reaching saltiness you often get with the prosciutto-wrapped chicken, and the chicken itself was so tender and moist.  Oh---I can't forget---my veal picatta was accompanied by two crusty wedges of buttery toasted bread and the most wonderful bruschetta...  It was juicy and garlic-y and all the things you want from a bruschetta.  Our server suggested the tiramisu to finish, but really---we couldn't.  We were ROTUND, at this point.  Which was sad, because everything was so good, we just wanted to eat more!

As I said, ambiance was comfortable, Uncle Louie and Marie and our server made us feel welcome and cared for.  We can't wait to go back.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is: 1) I SELDOM give five stars---I mean, that's the ultimate, right?; and 2) the lobster bisque and our entrees themselves could all have been a little hotter.  I know it was pretty cold for an Arizona night, but even so.  A pity they don't have the facilities to warm their plates, that might have helped.  But really---I have often mentioned that Italian food is not my very favorite cuisine, but I tell you---Uncle Louie's could change my mind.  Can't wait to return!",2016-01-10 15:31:17

Let me just say, I am not into haunted houses and zombies that much anymore. When we arrived, the place was packed! The reception area is quite small, so you will be rubbing elbows with strangers. No biggie though.  I think check in could be a bit better, but maybe it would have been better if there weren't so many people.  I think if employees made announcements that people needed to sign waivers that would be helpful.  Or a sign above the counter might be helpful.  We finally got checked in and our boys were given a story I believe before entering.  They were then allowed four practice shots before being led into the zombie filled course.  The parents were allowed to go into the party area.  The party area is just a temporary tent with picnic tables, nothing fancy but perfect for a kids party.  Next to our party area there was a caged area which held two zombies.  They were always playing the part, growling at us and trying to get over the fence.  A few times the gate was left open and the zombies entered our party area while the kids were still shooting.  It was so much fun watching the parents scream as they ran away from the zombies.  I spoke to the manager about doing a school event there and he was very polite, extremely helpful and answered all of my questions.  When our kids finally joined us, they were so excited and had a great time!  Then near the end of the party, some zombies came into the party area again and let me tell you, it was awesome!! The kids were screaming, parents were screaming, it was such a great time. There were zombies around the wooden fenced areas we had our party at and were putting their hands over the fence.  In the party area, the zombies never grabbed at anyone at any time, they just walked around and would growl at people.  At the end of the party when we were checking out the pictures, zombies busted into the reception area and they had to be rounded up.  Such a great experience all the way up to the end.  For entertainment value, two thumbs up.  I did make a suggestion to the manager about adding infrared cameras so party guests who don't participate can see some of the action.  I think the addition of cameras would put this place over the top.",2016-05-14 15:43:03

We had another 5 star experience, maybe 5+ stars.  We were seated immediately at our favorite table (no. 27) which is ringside to all the action in the open and busy kitchen.  Bandera's cocktails are always near perfect and generous in size (Manhattan straight up and an Elderflower martini).  We started with their seasonal grilled artichokes which taste like an artichoke steak accompanied by their signature skillet cornbread which is almost a meal in itself.  We split an entree plate and added another side so we had just enough room left to finally try their banana cream pie which was good but not spectacular.

The hummus was okay not very good but edible, again fell flat on flavor. The baba ganoush was the worst I have ever had, took one bite and it definitely was not fresh and tasted terrible. The Tabbouleh was okay and was much better than the hummus or the baba ganoush. The rice was good but again on the cold side.

Decided to sit in the patio area under the awning but a brief thunderstorm with a torrential down pour tried to thwart our enjoyment of it, but the staff at Istanbul Sofra refused to let it.  The owner and his staff were very attentive to all the guests sitting outside during the storm and protected the food when it was coming out and tried to help all the drips and drops that were coming down from the awning.

But on to the food-I would give it a solid 4 stars for food.  We had the small appetizer sampler with hummus, baba ganoush, piyaz, and haydari (there may have been one more but I can't remember).  All were flavorful and fresh.  Folks have complained about the pita, but I thought it was good and served warm and they give you unlimited refills!

We shared the Sofra Mix Grill and the Shrimp Shish Kebab.  I'm not a huge fan of lamb but the lamb pieces in the Sofra Mix Grill were seasoned very well that I didn't mind eating a piece.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but I wished it had a bit more flavor. 

For dessert we shared the Kazandibi (milk pudding with a caramalized sugar coating).  I'm a big fan of creme brulee so I thought there may be some similiarties.  Not really though but it was still good.  It's very rich, creamy and sweet and perfectly accompanies the somewhat bitter taste of Turkish coffee.  The coating is crispy like how it is in creme brulee and you can definitely taste the milkiness.  It was a perfect size to share with 3 people.

We went on a Saturday night which of course was busy but I think this place is most likely busy on all nights.  We were able to obtain a reservation for 9:30PM.  

I thought it would be slow by then.  Wow.  The place was still packed and they quit serving around 11PM.  

Everything was delightful.  Nice and warm with the Southwest flair.  We were excited about the prospect of ordering dessert as well, however, the appetizers and the meal filled us up so perhaps next time we will order dessert first.  :)

hnWo-iHhUj9-V2OUssdRJA,76V_yP6iFp9xYNnyWIzm8w,kVqj5hrjUnoDV6nb6oRFbg,1,8,6,4,"What a dump.

This place USED to be good, say, about 12 years ago before Nick sold it.  I was hesitant to do a review about this place considering I have not been there since New Year's last year, but my brother convinced us to join them on a recent trip - this brought back to the surface the horror of what I thought was my last dining experience ever at Nick's.  I would like to share this story with you.

First off, even with reservations, we were waiting over half an hour and when we did get seated, we were seated 1 foot away from another table.  The restaurant has not been renovated for as long as I have known it to exist.  Think Three's Company, Regal Beagle type decor and a 70' steak house amalgamated into this hot mess.  It is a HUGE place with a lounge area as well but it is in dire need of a make over.

The menu is extensive, I will give them that but the lack of quality really speaks for itself.  The last two times I have gone there, it was just horrendous.  The wings were stale, they were made ahead of time and sauced up when we ordered them.   The starter ""salads"" are basically bagged lettuce mix with a wedge of tomato and cucumber on top with your dressing of choice.  They come in a stylish assortment of wooden bowls for those with eccentric tastes.

Hubby ordered the honking 24 oz steak, it came back bloody when he asked for it to be medium well.  They took it back 3 times and it was charred and burnt on the outside and still bloody on the inside.  It was a really thick steak and we even told them to butterfly it, which they didn't do.  The acting manager, a young chap who I thought was a waiter who took off his apron, basically apologized and brought us one of their cheaper deserts, TO GO and did not comp the steak which was barely touched.  When I mentioned the stale wings, he assured me that he would speak to the chef about it and again, did not remove them from the bill, even though we did not eat them.  P.S.  The owners were there as well as Nick himself, neither of them said a word to us and we were a large group.  Having said that, my rib eye was good, and yes the portions are generous but not for the kids meals!  My little guy got 2 nuggets and fries for his meal and he is not a big eater and I ended up ordering him another plate!  I ended up paying for an adult entrée essentially for 4 nuggets and fries.

Service, slow.  Those poor waitresses.  Obviously have way too many tables per shift.  Ours looked like she was going to faint, she was a bit older and I could tell she was having a hard day.  She was very apologetic and said it was an ""off night"" but we still generously tipped her, it was not her fault that the kitchen staff has the same cooking calibre of an 11 year old.

Yes, they pile the food on but what's the point of it if its inedible?  Sure there are pizza's, buffets, and breakfasts but from my last two trips I could honestly say that Nicks has made it to the top of my X'd list.

Seriously, for the location and history, this place can be phenomenal.  Obviously a reno needs to happen and the menu should be cleaned up and minimized, too much going on there thus creating sub par food.

In closing, DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT $200, you'll regret it.  And parking is a mess if you go during busy times.  One small tiny parking lot and the rest is street, and for those familiar with the area, good luck finding street parking.

Man they subpar (and that's putting it lightly), yet you can't help but adore them the more you attend games. They're like the Cubs a.k.a. ""The Lovable Losers"" of the Minor League; They always lose, never make it to the World Series (or whatever the championship is called for the Minor League), but the fans never fail to embrace them as their very own. Maybe they did win a couple of championships, I really don't know. But in the end, it doesn't really matter because ultimately I'm just going there to have a good time.

On most nights they have $1 beer and the food selection is baseball-certified with hotdogs, chips, and nachos. The stadium seats are arranged nicely good views are everywhere in the ballpark. I love how there are so many foul balls and the anticipation of catching one is worth the trip in itself for me.

In between innings are some crazy things like racing, spin around the bat, hula dancing and the like. They give away cool prizes and it's nice to see the martian alien mascot. I wanna say Las Vegas has some of the best sport mascots man: UNLV with their mustache man and the 51ers with the alien are some of the most bizarre and unique mascots I have ever seen.

If you have a friend in town or want to have a casual discussion, I think attending the game is a great idea. There will never be an awkward silence because the game is going on, and you can equally have deep conversations because nothing too eventful is likely to occur (except a double-play here and there by the opponents, ouch!).

Great for families, friends, or maybe solo. Whether the 51ers win or lose, I will be attending again for sure.",2012-06-18 06:52:54

uZ8BzKGpy8nzdzrpTi4wCQ,jsEzCXrpP4jiHVLiAmCwdA,PD3ganU8NAGkqkcIXYPSxQ,4,5,0,1,"Fudao is my new favourite noodles place downtown! It's conveniently located in the central parts of Chinatown. And based on my experience, it's best to visit during a weekday for dinner than between Friday to Sunday, or else you will definitely need to wait in line. There was a Friday that I went at 9PM, it was packed even after we finished eating. ITS THAT CRAZY, for noodles.

Eating at Fudao is super simple. On the sheet of menu/paper they provide, just follow their instructions. Step 1: Pick your soup base that ranges from mild to spicy. Step 2: If you don't want their signature noodle, pick whatever else you like.

Most people order their rice noodles that come in a stone bowl with the noodles and 10 toppings served on the side. The best part about this restaurant is you get free noodle refills if the first bowl doesn't fill you. And secondly, if there are toppings within the 10 you don't like, you can exchange for something else more suitable to your tastes. But to be honest (after eating at Fudao twice so far), some of those toppings I still have no clue exactly what they are.

My most recommended soup base is the Fudao Rice Noodle in Thai Curry Soup. For someone who doesn't eat that much spice, this base is perfect. Although it has one chili sign next to it, it's not too bad at all. While you dump in all the toppings and noodles to fill the bowl, the curry soup simmers and mix together everything deliciously. The curry soup gives a kick to your meal yet it blends in well. Fudao is best eaten when the weather is cold too. I also have to give credit to their noodles as its really well done in terms of texture and chewy-ness.

Two interesting things I would say is that sometimes it's quite difficult to find back all the toppings I've dumped into the soup since they are so small. But it's also fun to dig around for them, it's like exploring for treasure in an ocean. And secondly, the background YouTube music videos and songs they always play is super hipster! First time there it was all rap, and second time it was top billard R&B and Hip Hop.",2017-12-14 02:52:10

Appetizer Platter for 2 ($28)
This dish came with 4 items: Smoked salmon, grilled octopus, caprese salad and grilled calamari. The presentation was definitely a disappointment as it didn't look that appealing. Essentially it was just grilled calamari and octopus served with 2 different salads. The Grilled Calamari portion is comparable to the calamari/octopus in this platter, if not less, so essentially you are paying an extra $13 for the 2 salads? I would not be able to justify the portion of the 2 salads worth the $13. Ingredients were fresh but this platter was nothing special and over priced in my opinion. 

Grilled Calamari ($15)
This was nothing special - the calamari was grilled nicely, not too chewy. It was served in an orange brandy sauce which wasn't much of my liking.

Oyster Rockafeller ($13) 
The baked oysters was probably the best dish of all that we tried. It was baked with bacon, spinach, cheese and panko crumbs. Comes with 3 but we ordered an additional one ($3.25) since we had 4 people.

Crab Cakes ($12)
Comes with only 2 crab cakes and arugula salad. It was tastey, but could definitely use more crab meat. I really liked the spicy mayo drizzled along the sides of the plate

Steamed Mussels ($17)
The mussels was served in a creamy sauce wih crispy fennel, green onion and pancetta. I really enjoyed the mussels - ingredients were fresh and the sauce was very flavorful. Portion was big as well, good for sharing. Definitely a better appetizer to order in terms of value compared to the other options.

Ahi tuna tartare ($18)
This was one of their specials for the day. I found the price was very steep, as the portion was fairly small. I did enjoy this dish though, tasted very refreshing with the the mangoes adding a nice tangy taste. They should have included more pieces of chips though as 4 definitely was not enough to go with the tartare.

But who knows maybe I'll get someone better next time. I also didn't like how the men and women were whispering to each other in their language. Don't they know we're all here to relax? And the bathroom along with the backdoor is right next to where everyone is getting their massages. Every time someone would enter or come out you would hear everything. It wakes everyone up. 

Now after everything was over and I tipped my gal already, I come outside to pay.. The receptionist girl obviously knows nothing about customer service. Whoever decided to put her at the front should know she's going to cost you many customers. She was not pleasant to begin with, when I arrived she did not greet and welcome me. I had to say hello to HER and mention that I have an appointment before she even decided to look away from her phone. She also did not care to ask me ""how was everything?"" when I came back out. Haha, and that wasn't even the end of it. After I paid she ASKED me if I had already tipped. What? How unprofessional and rude. I understand gratuity is appreciated but here it's required. There's even a sign that says they would like at least $5 tips. Makes me think, why did I give my girl a $10?",2014-05-20 22:28:13

Let me be very clear here, I have posted unfavorable reviews based on food for other restaurants, but have always been willing to go back because everyone has an off night. I will never patronize this place again simply because the owners were so appallingly flippant.

Went here tonight with a friend while in the area and we both ordered the cavatelli. It said it was handmade and all dinners come with bread and salad. Salads and bread started off good, but then the pasta came. I kid you not, it was gray and translucent, not to mention so gummy that it stuck together in big clumps. We both sent it back and only a few minutes later were presented with basically the same exact bowls of pasta. 

Knowing the cavatelli wasn't going to get better, we ordered the angel hair and spaghetti. They came out a little too quick. The angel hair was more like a thin spaghetti and not a true angel hair, and was so underdone it was crunchy. The spaghetti was mushy. We sent both dishes back again and said we would just pay for the side salads we ate. The waitress said she would talk to the owners.

We see her go over to the husband and wife owners, they both look over at our table and disappear. A few minutes later we are given a $10 check for the two salads and never once were visited by the owners. We take the check to the register on purpose so we can tell the wife of our experience, and told her very matter of factly that it was disappointing and why. She said, 'Oh really?' And then went on to give excuses like, 'the angel hair is fresh cut so it takes a little longer to cook.' Wrong. Fresh cut pasta takes less time, and there's a difference between al dente and raw. She never once apologized, had a chip on her shoulder during the whole conversation and took the basic attitude of 'oh well, we have good food and you're wrong.'

The wait staff are all high school girls that are very abrupt and not attentive at all, the cooks look to be about high school or early college, and when we asked if the regular chef was working our waitress informed us that the entire kitchen staff was new, as are the rest of the workers there. That's a red flag.

Santos, I'm going to give you a bit of free advice- if your 'cavatelli' is translucent and gray, you're using too much water in your dough. Angel hair should be thinner, and if you break a piece of pasta in half it should not be white in the middle. Or translucent. Or gray.",2016-09-15 01:52:21

The Cleveland Museum is a beautiful space with a great covered atrium with trees and tables and space for kiddies to run around.  (Reminds me of the National Portrait Gallery in DC)

The food service is great - lots of colleagues from Case Western across the street come to the museum cafeteria for lunch.  

The exhibits are well displayed and curated.  I saw a number of important pieces that I was familiar with from the impressionist and surreal school and was introduced to some new artists in the modern and contemporary section.  I zipped through the historical art a little quicker - the    indigenous Americas art was quite good, though I have to say that the gallery with Central Asian/Middle Eastern textiles was one of the most memorable.

If i have one quibble, it was that the gallery seems to focus on providing  a little something from every region/school/era, without any exhibits organized outside of these  geographic and chronological selections. This approach makes it great for school groups but less so if you're looking to be challenged by new ways of looking at things or eclectic groupings.

Overall, this museum stands out as a very good middle-city museum along the lines of Richmond, Buffalo or Montreal but not quite as good as any of the former.",2014-04-11 16:52:42

hETzV29RKDHDXdJQj73TXA,aDYNz8cujkDdmbiOh95ANA,k-drEjxKmfqllwfY90STfA,3,2,1,0,"We met some friends for dinner there last night. The hostess was very accomodating and said that she could go ahead and seat us but we decided to wait for our other friends to arrive so we stopped by the bar.  The bartender was a little distracted, &  I didn't have a chance to order a beverage before our friends arrived.  But, no matter since we were seated immediately anyway.  

I would have to give our server 3 stars for service.  Maybe we just caught him on a bad night, but he was not attentive about our drinks and did not seem overly helpful when we had questions about specific items on the menu.  

Also, one member of our party asked if she could have onions left off a taco and he said absolutely not.  I know  that a lot of chef's are ""offended"" when patrons ask for changes to a dish, but it sort of leaves a bad taste in my mouth when restuarants are not willing to entertain any kind of special request.  After all, a place like this you would expect the food to be cooked to order...  so if someone wants their taco without onions, it should not present a huge problem. 

While there were a couple of stand-out  items, overall, I would have to rate the food just 3 stars for this visit. 

Of course, we started the evening with house-made tortilla chips served with a side of pickled veggies and fresh salsa. 

We also placed an order for Queso Fundido (imported Mexican cheeses melted with fresh herbs and chilies - $5 for a small, $7 for a large).  Without question, that is the best queso I have ever eaten. 5 stars for this dish alone - I would go back anytime just for that!  The queso fundido is served with a side of soft flour tortillas- which was perfect with a little of the vegetable mixture and a big scoop of queso. Yummo! 

I decided to order off the Authentic Mexican menu rather than the TexMex menu.  There were several items I really wanted to try, but our waiter said the Tacos Dorados were his favorite, so I decided to go with that.  The Tacos Dorados are described as ""Crispy shrimp, crab and scallion tacos. Topped with Mexican crema, cabbage, and Valentina hot sauce. Served with Mexican vegetable rice and black beans D-$12"".  

First off, the mexican vegetable rice & black beans were absolutely DELICIOUS. I am a huge fan of black beans and theirs were seasoned perfectly.  

However, sadly I was less thrilled with the actual main dish.  The taco shells were fabulous - obviously freshly made in house and appeared to be deep fried after the shrimp & crab mixture was put in.  The shrimp-crab mix had a pretty good flavor but was a bit on the dry side.  The real problem for me was that the Mexican Crema and Valentina Hot Sauce was Missing In Action - there was a little on top of the entree but not enough to enjoy on each taco.  I think the dish would have greatly been improved if these 2 elements were more abundant. The mixture on the inside seemed to lack any cheese, so the crema was really needed to give it that extra flavor and texture.  I also like things on the spicy side and it seems our chef either forgot the spicy sauce or thought we couldn't handle it - so I had to use the salsa that came with our chips along with the stuff out of the bottle to give it a little kick. 

One of my friends ordered the Cantina Chimichanga (described as a Crispy burrito filled with a choice of chicken or steak, black beans, pico de gallo, Mexican vegetable rice and mixed cheeses. Topped with Ranchero and Chile con queso sauce. Choice of grilled vegetables or rice and beans $12).  This turned out to be a gigantic burrito! Better bring your appetite if you're planning to order this one (or you'll have one big doggy bag!) 
 
But, all-in-all, I would like to go back and try some of the other menu items...and I will definitely go back just for that fabulous Queso!!",2011-09-20 18:42:28

When I first went consciously vegan when I was much younger, I got very into cooking myself. Eventually, I realized that I could make more than just stirfries for dinner every night if I had the right resources. Queue my amazing padre driving me into Calgary soley for special vegan groceries when this location opened!
Community Natural Foods was initially very overwhelming to me, coming from a rural Albertan town that had an IGA and Co-Op only until recently; each boasting one kind of soy milk, and a handful of organic cereals and maybe some tofu, or organic peanut butter if I was lucky. I was floored when I would go to Community Natural Foods, and I could have treats such as vegan iced cream, dried pineapples, bulk teas, Earth Balance for baking, ingredients such as nutritional yeast and coconut oil that I had only dreamt about after hearing about these things in magazines! This is also where my family would purchase our annual Tofurkey meals for Thanksgiving and Christmas time. 
These were my favourite trips in the city. A decade later, I still get equally excited for my trips to this Community Natural Foods, although some of the charm and wonder of easily attainable Earth Balance does wear off when all of a sudden you have to order 30 pounds of it because you're putting on a bake sale (yes, I was once the proud owner of 30 pounds of Earth Balance)....
Also, I like this Community Natural Foods more because they see my face less. For awhile there, a gentleman at the 10th Ave SW location was keeping track of how many heads of kale, and tofurkey products I would purchase in a week (not all of them were for just me... I have roommates!). Therefore, I feel more free to binge on all of my favourite things here because I will not have to take the walk of shame back into their store later that week when I've already devoured all of my kale salads and expensive grapes!

This time, I ordered the arcadian court chicken pot pie as it appears to be another one of Yelpers' favourite dishes at this O&B restaurant. I was quite anxious because I wanted something warm and hearty that night since I wasn't feeling all too well. 

As it arrived on my table, I felt the presentation of the chicken pot pie was quite boring compared to their other dishes. There definitely could be some improvements in that area. Besides that, I thought the chicken pot pie was very filling and unfortunately, way too salty for my taste. It was so salty that I just could not take many bites of it. At least the mashed potatoes and gravy were pretty good...

Even though I was quite disappointed with the dish that I chose this time (perhaps it was just that one particular chicken pot pie...or maybe this 'comfort food' concept means food that is too salty for my liking?), I still enjoyed the ambiance, the music and the setting. The staff, again, were very friendly and polite. I also loved their warm s'mores pie last time and I had every intention of ordering it again.

I was hospitalized on May 17th and was unable to renew my registration due to being hospitalized for a couple of weeks (I did not drive my vehicle).  I called the DMV customer service phone number on June 8th and was told that the reason I could not request a temporary moving permit online was because I had exceeded the 60 days of temporary permits (I had ordered a personalized plate last year) and that I would need to bring my vehicle to the DMV the next morning to obtain a moving permit. I went to the North Decatur DMV on June 9th at 0900 and was given my temporary moving permit by employee number 6861.  Later that day at 1645, I completed my smog check.  Today (June 16th) I went to the Decatur DMV and was told by employee number 7874 I would have to pay a late fee for driving my vehicle to get a smog check.  I let the woman know that I drove the vehicle to get a smog check AFTER I received my temporary moving and tried to show her my temporary moving permit receipt and smog receipt to prove the times.  She refused to look at my paperwork.  Employee number 7874 then got a supervisor named Keisha (Keisha refused to give me her last name).  Keisha also refused to look at my paperwork.  Keisha was extremely rude and I told her I wanted the name and phone number for that DMV's manager as well as Keisha's first and last name.  She gave me the manager's information and only wrote down her own first name.  I felt like my integrity was questioned, Keisha embarrassed me by raising her voice at me in front of the employees and other customers, and also tried to make me feel stupid.

At first i thought that these were virgin, until i continued to see empty beer and wine bottles everywhere.  I had to finally ask someone, ""can you drink on the streets here"" and they were like ""yes.""  I was amazed,  and then it all made sense.  Seeing all of this, i started to crave a margarita badly.  After passing Cabo Wabo a few times, i thought that this would be an appropriate place to quench my thirst.  There was a slight wait to get into the cantina, but the outdoor elevated patio was worth the wait.  Upon being seated our server told us that they were out of menus, so we just asked for a margarita and a mojito.  We started with some chips and salsa.  The salsa had a really smokey background, but not that much flavour.  Shortly after our drinks came, after taking one sip, we both realized that these were very water downed drinks.  We were both very unsatisfied with the drinks, mine literally tasted like just a lime slushie, no alcohol.  We basically just wrote off the night as a poor restaurant pick, but then our bill came.  My drink was $10 and my sisters was $14, i have never felt so ripped off.  I think that is why Cabo currently has a low Yelp rating, because people are feeling ripped off.

For starters I had driven to this place three times only to discover they were closed each time. The hours are not compatible with my belly. Either are the sandwiches.....

Let me say that the sandwich tasted amazing and I was ready to be in a monogamous relationship with that bread. Insanely delicious. The meat was flavorful as well. I ordered the Italian heated. I was really happy. My guest ordered a different sandwich and clam chowder. The soup was a bit runny, but he did enjoy his sandwich. After we left we both felt as if we were in our last trimester, but we were still all about the good food. We head to Best Buy.

While my guest was looking at televisions I noticed I started getting super stomach cramps. I excused myself to sprint to the ladies room. Nothing happened-still cramping. My stomach cramps lasted for 24 hours. My guest ended up with explosive diarrhea and 48 hours later his stomach is still hurting and having Octomom contractions...... 

Now, I really support new, neighborhood businesses and want them to make it and make me happy with their food. I am unclear on why we both fell ill from the food, but it's not okay for that to happen. They are a super clean and friendly business who maybe just needs to throw out the mayo. I don't know.

Wait... We're supposed to talk about the food, right?..... Haha, my bad.

Anyway, you should come to this gem of a restaurant located inside of Tivoli Village. I guess it was restaurant week, I had no clue what that even was until Tien N. informed me. DOH!

It was so great of Christina W. to plan this fun outing! I got to see some familiar faces, as well as meet few new ones. Oh Yelp, you bring such awesome people into my life :)

I have tried the pork belly here, and it's not as good as at Gordon Ramsay, but it's damn close. So tender, so decedent.

The RW choices I made was the Tomato Soup to start with. Such a great choice! It was light, flavorful, with a swirl of something extra inside it. I don't know what is was, but it made the soup taste even better somehow. I got to nibble on Vanessa N.'s Watermelon and Goat Cheese salad too. I don't know if you guys knew this, but goat cheese on watermelon is the best!! YUM.

I had the Monkfish with dill after. TOO MUCH DILL!!! It was kinda crazy how much garnish they put on top of it. But honestly, if you have fingers then you can just pick it off, so it really was not a big deal for me. The fish was firm, yet still light in it's texture. I had never had monkfish before, and I love the texture of the fish. It had some meat to it, not flaky at all. 

For dessert, I had the Strawberry Sake Shortcake. The black pepper whipped cream was to DIE for. Really great touch. I didn't really taste much sake in the ice cream, but I'm a drinker, so I really like to taste the booze in something if it's supposed to have it in there. That's just me, though. 
Kevin P. let me try some of his Miso Ice Cream with Chips. I really thought this was a clever and fun dessert concept. I loved using the salted potato chip to scoop up the ice cream, and the combination of the two flavors worked well together. The chips were a bit on the salty side, as Regina P. had pointed out, but I like salt so I was alright. But I could see how it might overwhelm some folks who don't like heavily salted food.

A very fun time! Service is always second to none here. The servers are great, and they put up with our drunk as*ses all the time and never complain! We also got to meet Angelo himself, and he complimented my name and my hair.... Very sweet man :)",2013-03-12 20:18:56

I had went to Target earlier, to pick up a sheet. Of course, I didn't read fully, and got two flat sheets, instead of a flat, and a fitted sheet. So, I went to return the flat sheet this afternoon.

Of course, the place is busy. I didn't expect it not to be for the day after Christmas morning. However, I didn't expect to be treated so.......weirdly (?)

I head over to the returns, which is now registers 1-3 not where the phones are located. I stand patiently and wait while a team member is helping a set of guests. I see another employee sitting on a stack of boxes, (or something to that affect) an employee walking by lets her know that ""there is a customer waiting to be helped"" (meaning me).

The employee huffs and puffs, and complains about not getting a break. That she is tired, and that her feet hurt. The other employee says that after she helps me, that she can take her break. The employee angrily snaps back, ""it doesn't matter anyways, I'm leaving in thirty minutes.""

She proceeds to tell me how swollen her feet are, and how she hasn't got a break all day....Kind of put me in a weird position... I just want to return this sheet.

I get my refund, and go walk around the store to pick up some other items that I also had previously forgot. Other employees were complaining about the schedule, and who was on it, and who wasn't.

I was looking for eye glass cleaner that I couldn't find in the pharmacy/contact lenses isle. When asking an employee to help me... she said that it should be over in pharmacy, on an ""a"" isle.

PROS
- Pretty cool pool area.  In my opinion, this is the best part of the hotel.....it's tropical, has real pink flamingos, and is fun.

- Cheap rates.  You can find rooms in the high $30's to $40 range here often.  I send my budget minded friends here.

- Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville.  This place is a lot of fun.  It overlooks the Strip and has decent eats and fun music.  I'll have to write a separate review one day for it.

- Cheap gambling.  Most of their table games have low minimum bets.

- Location.  It's center Strip and It's on the monorail line.  Easy access up and down the East side of the Strip from the Sahara to the MGM Grand on the monorail.  Reasonable walking distance from Paris to Palazzo (50% of the Strip).

CONS
- It's old and it shows.  This place peaked in the mid-90's.

- It reeks of smoke.  The last time I was there I walked from the parking garage to Margaritaville and back without stopping in the casino.  However, when I got home my clothes smelled as if I was out all night gambling and smoking cigarettes.  Blech.

- Parking garage has small, tight spaces.  This is one of my least favorite parking garages in the city.  The spaces are small and I'm always afraid that my car is going to get scratched or dented.....because it has happened in the past. 

- They have timeshare sales people that will bother you when you walk by their booth.  I'm not a fan of this at all.  Who wants to be bothered like that on vacation or on a night out?  It's no different than those escort card smackers on the Strip.

Overall, you have to understand what you're getting here and it's cheap.  So if you're on a budget, this hotel is for you.....but don't have high expectations otherwise you'll be disappointed.

I am surprised by the negative comments directed toward Steve, as I have always found him to be a wonderful host and his serving staff are friendly, efficient, and always willing to explain the menu. It is indeed something of an unusual ""factory"" decor because the business is based upon supplying pasta to Pittsburgh's upscale restaurants, but I find that charming and unpretentious.

It is in the plaza with Tacos & Beer and Satay -- the plaza right across from Howard Hughes, which makes it very convenient for those of us who work in the area to go. I highly recommend making an appointment because this place does get packed around lunch time (makes sense given the geographic location).

Something else great about this place is that it is opened pretty late -- according to Yelp and the girl who did my nails, 10pm. That is definitely a perk if you need your nails done at an unconventional time, as most nail places close around 6pm. The interior of this place is also very clean and nice, and the employees are very friendly and personable.

Overall, for $35 for a gel manicure, the ladies here do a pretty good job with it. My nails do not chip off or rip and stays on for the entire 2-3 weeks.

so last night around 9:30 me and my friend were walking by and saw this place. looked pretty cool and I love Korean Grill so we said ""why not, let's""

first, it wasn't busy at all yet it took someone to approach us around 15-20min from the time we walked into the door.

so first the waiter blatantly LIED to me lol.
i ordered the Korean beef dish with veg friend rice.
and my friend orders the spring rolls and veg fried rice

so the order came and i got korean beef w steamed rice
my friend got a plate of veg fried rice.

they basically threw the plate down and left. To even get someone to help us was a mission. AWFULL.
i finally gave up and walked over to the bartender, i let her know i wanted the fried rice and we never got our spring rolls.
so she speaks in her orient language to another server who finally manages to track our server (this was about 30minutes - NO LIE)
ironically the table beside us had no issues with getting their food or a server that came over a few times to check on them.
now that the food is cold, the original server tells me ""NO , the beef comes ONLY with steamed rice"".
i was so furious at this point i stared right at him and said ""REALLY????""...(now note, I'm not a mean person, i was just so shocked because at the time when i ordered i confirmed twice if i could get the fried rice and he said yes on both occasions)

so i said ""never mind"" and unhappily ate my food.
so 10minutes go by and again no one came (we were talking a lot too so we noticed the time in horror)
so again i go to the bartender and let her know we never got our spring rolls.
so 5 minutes later spring rolls appear at our table - UNCOOKED!!!!!
i couldn't believe it....
in my life - seriously - ive never had a restaurant be so awful.

we didn't end up eating much of our food.
- DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALLLLLLLLLLLL -
considering we don't speak Korean but love the food, it was awful how they treated us.
its not worth it at all. There's so many fantastic international cuisines and if every restaurant began treating people this way, then no one would appreciate the cuisine itself.

p.s :
the rice was over sticky , the beef was mainly the fat and cold
the veg fried rice was the only edible thing and even that got cold quick.

The strip offers one of the largest varieties of restaurants all packed in one area.   Famous chef's such as Emeril Lagasse and Gordon Ramsay have all opened up several restaurants to dine in.

It's not just dining, there are shows galore to see.  Comedians, music concerts and the Vegas staples that are here on a daily basis.  If you know way in advance of the dates you'll be here, I'd recommend buying tickets ahead of time for some of the headlining bands or comedians.

We kept putting off our meal here due to things coming up, but finally I insisted that we eat here for Cinco de Mayo.  I arrived around 6, sat down and was immediately greeted by a server with chips, salsa, and a menu.  She started speaking to me in Spanish so I did my best to answer but then she alternated between Spanish and English with me the rest of the evening.  As a native Texan, I took Spanish from 1st through 11th grade but unfortunately am better at reading and writing it than speaking it, a travesty.  However, it was fun to practice.

I got a giant frozen strawberry margarita, which was rimmed with salt and something like Tajin (the fruit seasoning that is chile-limey), a water, and a tostada con ceviche de pulpo (Octopus tostada) while I waited for Eric R. to get there.  The ceviche tostada was huge for $5, and piled high with octopus, tomato, onion, cilantro, and a half avocado garnished the plate.  I sliced the avocado onto the tostada and enjoyed it crunching along.  I think I was there over an hour before Eric R. arrived, so I watched the mariachi band play at tables and had several visitors from hawkers (a child selling snacks, a man selling DVDs, a woman selling jewelry) but they left me alone when I did not show interest.

The server came and checked on me multiple times while I waited.  Eric R. finally showed up and got a frozen strawberry margarita too.  The server gave him a fresh basket of chips and we ordered the molcajete de combinacion (shrimp, beef and chicken).  It came with nopales (cactus), a tomato, radishes, queso fresco, a half avocado, 2 chiles, roasted scallions, and a side of tortillas (we ordered flour and got corn so we ended up with both)!  The molcajete was bubbling over when it arrived.  The tortillas were almost too hot to handle!  

We really enjoyed the meal, but the beef was quite tough.  The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the shrimp was fine.  I am not sure if the fajita molcajete would have different meat, so next time I would probably order a chicken molcajete.

My only complaint about this place is that they could have designed the space better. The waiting area is HUGE! If they took out a third of it they could have enough tables to seat those people that they've put out benches for. I get that they're only busy on the weekend, but how how many people do they lose because they don't want to wait 30-45 minutes for a table?

Our server was fine. He greeted us and got our drinks quickly, gave us enough time to browse the large menu before bugging us to get our order, and checked on us once we had our meals and to offer refills. 

The food took a little longer than expected to get to our table but it hit the spot. I ordered the breakfast sampler. All of the meats were cooked nicely and the scrambled eggs weren't over done or dried out. The pancakes were light and fluffy.

To drink I got the Splashberry. It was the highlight of the meal. They just take some OJ and put in a splash of lime soda and a scoop of the strawberry topping they use on the pancakes and french toast. Because of the chunks of strawberry your best bet is to skip the straw and just drink fro the glass directly.

Side note: They have the all you can eat pancakes deal on right now. I thought about this instead of what I ordered until I did a quick calculation. To get a similar combo to the breakfast sampler ($10.69) with the AYCE pancakes its $15.25. This means you're paying almost $5 extra for ACYE pancakes. Unless you're going to eat an additional 4-6 pancakes on top of the two you already get with the meal, the ACYE pancakes are NOT a good deal.",2014-01-11 20:19:56

No they're not authentic or fancy, but they're just some cheap and yummy tacos. The day of the week I end up here the most is Mondays. I am a huge fan of their all you can eat crab leg night. It's $29.99 and comes with a salad (basically lettuce in a bowl) and hush puppies. They do get pretty busy on crab leg night, so get there sooner rather than later. It's a pretty solid start the week when you can get down on some crab while enjoying a nice night on the patio.

Wednesday is trivia and 1/2 price burgers. They have TVs on the patio. If you come here on Sundays for football, just be aware that they are a Cleveland Browns bar. I'm sure they'll welcome you with open arms if you are not a fan. What's the saying? Misery loves company? Poor Cleveland sports fans.

Last night we ate there to celebrate a special birthday. I mentioned to the waiter twice about it thinking maybe an acknowledgement by the establishment would bring a cheer or a candle on one of the birthday boy's sushi. Nada. 

Fortunately the jittery waiter seemed eager to please which diffused chuckles around the table. 

Our birthday boy ordered the Sushi & Assorted Sashimi dinner which the waiter  mistakenly ordered the Assorted Sashimi Dinner only.  Two ordered the Tekka Don which tuna sashimi was cut very very thinly on top of mounds of rice.   How can you taste the fishiness with it being so paper thin? We could see the rice through the sashimi!!! 

No pro sushi or experienced Japanese cuisine chef there last night. Many foreign ""workers"" behind the sushi bar...sure they will verbally welcome you and thank you for being patrons which is a fun thing BUT if you're paying $$$, not $$, you should expect what you pay for, right? A well run sushi bar doesn't need ten+ guys. That's where my full slices of Tekka Don tuna went...to their paychecks and not to my tummy. 

Granted, the mounds of quality sushi rice was perfectly cooked and prepared but we didn't go there just for the rice! We had a birthday boy and a visiting sister from Seattle...how disappointing. Zannen zannen!

Pie was okay. Dough not cooked enough, much better after cooking a few extra minutes in a pan on the stove. They tout the pepperoni as being ""special"" and ""from Chicago."" It was fine but did not taste better than any premium pepperoni you can purchase at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. 

Chicken wings were small and dry. Fried pickles were large and juicy but lacking in flavor. Luckily they were both saved by the BEST PART of this order which was the RANCH DRESSING. Yum. It's like a cross between ranch and an aioli. The best ranch I've ever had, anything will taste good in this stuff.

But with the recent groupon deal and the fact that they focus on more healthy, comfort food fare I finally came here with some of my family that was in town for Thanksgiving weekend.

There were many hits and misses, and while this has the potential to be a really good place, I think it still has some ways to go.

Service - really bad.  Food took a long time and they forgot to bring some items we ordered.  They also didn't clear plates almost the whole time we were there.  Really could use improvement, and they are almost too snobby and pretentious for their own good.

The food was decent, with some very very good items, but some really didn't work.  This is what we ordered (there were 8 of us):

Soup of the Day - this was a free bowl they gave us as a sample.  Weirdest soup I have ever tasted, it was a hot cranberry puree with wild rice.  It was very tangy from the cranberry, and completely purple/red in color.  My husband and I thought it was unique and a little weirdly tasty, but my mother and some of the others absolutely hated it.  This would probably delight some of the veggie/vegan people out there.

Puffy Tacos - holy moly these were absolutely incredible.  They give you one of each (chicken, pork, beef) or any other combination you want.  All three of them were fantastic.  I dream about these, they were so good.  If you like them spicy, these might seem bland to you, but honestly I didn't miss the spice they were that good.

Cobb Salad - I didn't try this but my brother in law seemed to really like it.

Roasted Veggie Sandwich - my sister liked this but I think she only ordered it for dietary reasons, as I caught her munching on a cliff bar as we were eating, since her sandwich obviously didn't fill her up.

Lobster Club - I didn't get to taste this either, but my friend who ate this said it was good but not fantastic.

Prime Beef Chili - some of the best chili I have ever tasted.  Seriously.

Half Pound Burger - now this burger has potential to be one of the best in the area, except, they ruin it by using the same bread that they use for the sandwiches for this, and cut it into a round.  The bottom of the burger was soaked through and that really bothered me to the point where unless they start buying some regular buns, I don't think I'd eat this, or I'd ask for a lettuce wrap instead.

Penne Arrabbiata - this was so spicy it was almost inedible.  I tried to talk my husband into sending it back but he wouldn't do it.  One of the worst things we had.

French Fries - my niece and nephew had some fries (they are babies) and everyone at the table liked them so much we all ate them up.  Probably the best fries I have had in this area.

Anyway, give this place a try.  It needs some serious improvement but I want to give it a few more chances and try some of the dinner items.",2010-12-16 07:56:39

I really wanted 2 like this place but it's not a 'Gr8' anything except @ giving violent lengthy sessions praying 2 the porcelain gods as a result of giving them a try (a gamble I was pretty quickly sorry 4 having taken if it weren't 4 my lunch companion's insistence).

   I wasn't expecting much & everything I tried seemed 2 b @ the right temp & most items ranged from decent-good tasting, but 15 min8es in I fell ill w/ severe pain & loud thunderous disapproval stemming from my extremely unhappy stomach. Not sure exactly what the culprit(s) were, but I noticed the lo mein noodles were far greasier than they looked present8ion~wise b4 being on my pl8. I also had some green beans & mixed veggie dishes in addition 2 some EFY, couple bites of an imit8ion crab looking casserole, & a couple Crab Puffs w/ the red sweet n sour sauce. Whatever disagreed w/ me certainly gave me a 'sour' stomach & such painful forceful heaving that I thought I'd literally c my guts coming up any moment as I felt pretty much turned inside~out.

   I wasn't intending 2 visit their restrooms as I have a gr8 disdain 4 public 1s (which turned out 2 b a 'case~in~point' why) but it was either that, or lose it all @ the table. If u need 2 throw up, the condition of the bathrooms or even on ur way 2 them will easily push u over the edge (not that I needed it as I barely got there w/o cre8ing a spectacle as it was). Funky rancid stench & stepped on fortune cookies etc carelessly left in ur path on ur way there as u pass kitchen/janitorial workers who r 2 busy hanging around the soda fountain thinking it's a QT.

  Do urself, ur body & health a favor of skipping this place. I've never been so sorry as I was yesterday 2 give the benefit of the doubt 2 an establishment  by unknowingly risking myself in the process. I guess it coulda been worse = by spending full amount instead of the discounted price (thx 2 a coupon) 2 get an instant case of food poisoning.

   Well, can't say I didn't give them a shot but take heed, ur better off not giving them the same chance I gave 2 prove I shoulda been more cautious about the neg8ives st8ed in previous reviews....... This is a case of shoulda stuck w/ my 'gut' so I could keep mine, instead of being talked in2 something against my better judgement..... ;-(",2014-06-06 02:30:11

very limited seats.. about 10-15 people can sit at a table with chairs and the rest of space is used for waiting of complete orders.. 

decor is your typical ikea essentials with some cool wall art..

It was a bit loud, but being there with just one person I could manage fine without going hoarse.

Anywho, when I check out most pizza places for the first time, I almost use their White Pizza as a test. Some people love the concept here, and they pile everything but the kitchen sink onto their personal creation.

For me, I like my pies simple and straightforward. Less is more IMO when i comes to pizza. No more than three toppings, any more than that, your tastebuds will be confused!

So I get my white pizza and I gotta say I wasn't a fan of the alfredo sauce on my pizza.
Linguini Alfredo? Yes. White pizza with alfredo?...meh...Least I can say I've been here, done that, but with places like Rocco's, Novecento, and Settebello, I'd rather pay for their white pies which I feel are more enjoyable. ALOHA!!!",2013-10-14 17:16:46

I've been here for service several times and have normally been very happy with the service and work done.

At Earnhardt they treat you like you are the most important person to them.  This last service was a major one that they estimated would take 3 hours.  I brought my laptop and waited for the car to get done.  The waiting room is very comfortable, and they tables and chairs for me to set up my laptop on.  They also provide free Starbucks coffee, hot chocolate, juice, water, donuts, hot dogs and popcorn.  The 3 hours went by very quickly and my car was done exactly at the time they said it would be done.  Vanessa emailed me a copy of the service report and also came out and told me in person.

We drove up and actually parked and went inside. Smallish inside.  A few tables and then bar stools surrounding the perimeter so you can sit and use the counter as a shelf.  Placed my order for a Lucky Boy 1/2lb cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate shake.  Total was just over $10.00.  Nice gentleman working the counter.  I think his wife was manning the grill.

Shake came out first.  Decent sized shake.  It was good (When is a shake not good?) but not great.

Lucky Boy Burger-  (They have 4 ""types"" of burgers here...each one corresponds to the condiments they put on.  Lucky Boy is ketchup and mustard.  See my menu pic for the other ""types"".)  This burger looked great.  It reminded me of little burger joints from LA like Piggies etc.  It came with lettuce, onion and pickle.  It had two 1/4lb patties and 2 slices of cheese.  I bit in and it was good.  The bun was toasted but it also seemed kind of stale.  It almost fell apart on me a few times.  The burger meat was good and I ate the whole thing.  Was it the best burger ever?  Not even close.  Was it good and did it fill a burger craving?  Yes.

Fries-  Standard fries which were salted ok.  

Overall this place was A-OK. Supposedly its been here since 1951 which is cool.  I hope people keep on coming back and keep this place in business. Nothing was wrong with it at all but I wasn't blown away by it either.   I would probably try out other burger joints in the area if I ever had a burger craving in this part of town again.  

Side rant.............we did get hounded by a dude ""asking"" for change while walking back to our car.  A little Hispanic dude on a bike.  He reeled off about 30 words and then said ""uno dollar"".  That's the only Spanish word I could understand.....here is a tip buddy.  If you are going to beg for change/money in the US, you might want to pick up some English and learn how to say ""Can you spare some change"" or ""Can I have a dollar?"". You will have much better success on obtaining your $$$ that you are seeking ;-) Anyways.............",2013-04-02 06:20:37

Vv2Jr8IL2EfwgqkP2kkk2w,nHxQfB9CRettoPKJmkDx_A,Ul6JwluSTm12PVDIqnNaTg,4,5,1,4,"After attending an event in the Strip, I decided to get a bite to eat with a fellow attendee.   We weren't looking for anything too formal, but were interested in getting some quality fare.  I had been to Kaya many years ago, and remembered having a good experience, so we stopped in.

It was a warm summer evening, and many hungry patrons were seated outside enjoying tropical drinks.  It was quite warm, so we chose to sit inside.

The interior at Kaya is festive.  The walls were covered with warm tropical colors, and the tile on the bar was in a mosaic pattern.  The entryway and front end of the restaurant are narrow, so we had to be careful while we were being shown to our table.

We ordered a Corona (with lime) and white sangria- both drinks adequately quenched out thirsts as we looked over the menu.  The food at Kaya is described as island fare.

I immediately chose the Tuna Tartare (11.00) as an appetizer.  We also wanted to try the Conch Fritters ($9.00) with tropical tartar sauce.   Other starters included Salmon Crab Cakes with Jalapeno Remoulade ($9.00), Sweet and Spicy Baby Back Ribs ($11.00), Crisp Calamari ($9.00), and Blue Bay Mussels ($10.00).

The tuna tartare arrived first and was served with poblano, scallion, avocado, lime, chile oil, crema, and large curly bands of deep-fried bananas.  The tuna was perfectly fresh and buttery.  The scallions and chile oil added necessary heat to the mild, raw fish.  Oily chunks of ripe avocado provided texture, and taste balance.  Placing large scoops of the tuna, crema, and cilantro on the crispy banana proved to be particularly scrumptious.

The conch fritters arrived looking a little over-cooked.  After a few bites, I concluded that the quality of the dish was suffering from some aged fryer oil. 

That being said, the battered treat was flavorful and crisp.  The tropical tartar sauce helped cool down the fritters, and enhanced the soft flavors.

Our entrees were served immediately after our appetizer plates were cleared.    Since our bellies were quickly becoming full, we would split the Crispy Fish Tacos ($17.00).  One of the reasons I chose the fish tacos, is because the tortillas on which they are served are provided by Reyna's.  Reyna's is a small Mexican food outlet that provides authentic food products.  They're famous for having hard to find items like real enchilada sauce (Las Palmas), homemade salsas, and even Mexican jumping beans!

Our fish tacos arrived on two separate plates (a kind gesture considering I asked if we could share an entree- restaurants frown upon this).  The flour tortillas were grilled, and stuffed with corn meal coated fried tilapia.  Also inside were cabbage slaw, avocado, spicy crème fraiche, and cilantro.

The tacos were amazing- the fish was perfectly cooked, and the soft, doughy tortillas were warm and chewy.  The shredded cabbage slaw was seasoned, and tart; it added a nice crunch to the dish.  Silky crème fraiche and perfectly matured avocado slices concluded the flavor-festival.   

Kaya is a great place to go for a meal.  Not only does it have a festive atmosphere, the food is excellent.",2012-08-02 04:02:51

I remember driving from my small town to the closest Big Lots store an hour away and strolling down every single aisle searching for bargains with my Grandpapa. Back then, Big Lots was more of a crapshoot but now, they are pretty organized. Remember that it's STILL Big Lots and you never know what they'll have in stock so frequent visits are rewarded. 

This is truly never the same store twice. Big Lots buys overstocks, discontinued and other random items. You'll find name brands next to store brands. If there's a certain food or beauty item that you love but can't find, chances are it'll eventually be on the shelf at Big Lots. Oreo has discontinued their yummy sugar free cookies (sad face) and while I gladly would pay $5 a box for them at Vons, I found 8 boxes at Big Lots for $1 each! 

The store is reasonably clean and organized and the employees are helpful and friendly. If you know your prices you can get some great deals. My best advice: if you see it, BUY IT. If you are wishy-washy and come back a day later, most likely what you wanted will be GONE.  If there's something I love I usually clean the shelf because it mostly likely won't be back. 

Sign up for their FREE Big Lots reward / shopper card and they'll send you discount coupons to use throughout the year. The best promotions are their 20% off everything in the store deals. You also earn points based on what you spend. The best departments here are the furniture, health / beauty, food, toys and cleaning products.

While I sat waiting, I noticed a police officer walking through store with two Home Depot employees following behind, mocking and saluting her. They had time for this disrespectful nonsense, but no time to take a $6000 carpet order. 

I left the HD store, and went to Lowe's which had also completed a measurement for me. Lowe's was happy to take my order.",2015-10-16 18:53:20

Their Lunch special is cheap, with a whole page of selection from Curry to noddles for $12 (with your choices of beef, chicken, veggi or tofu). If you like seafood then it will be $14. I got the green curry with chicken and added coconut rice ($1). The curry has a lot of veggi and chicken and very flavourful. The coconut was okay, does not have much flavour to it, but it has a creamier taste than normal rice. For lunch the portion was just enough for you to want more ;) 

When we were there we saw a poster for PAD THAI CHALLENGE! 7lbs worth of pad thai and if you finish it, it is free or else you owe them $80!

When I came down to Veggie House, I was overjoyed to see the menu resembling what I was familiar with down by the Equator. And then, I found out that chef/owner Kenny Wang is a Malaysian! Mystery solved. 

The dishes that I have thoroughly enjoyed here include the following:

Roti Canai - With a heavenly curry dipping gravy that is ditto what I used to savor in Southeast Asia

Pork Chop - You can get a half order of this. Very inventive - 3 different textures (soft, fatty and then crispy) welded together and deliciously seasoned

Braised Tofu - The preparation of tofu is just fantastic. Soft beancurd lightly fried and then immersed in a brown gravy. Perfection. The vegetables on this dish were also so crisp and fresh!

Curry Vegetables with Tamarind Sauce - I love this take on curry. In Asia, it's called Assam Curry and is widely available and one of the most popular and tasty dishes. However, it's seldom prepared well outside Southeast Asia...Kenny's done a stellar job. Crispy potato pieces, brimming with veggies in a delicious curry sauce with that amazing tamarind tinge. 

Fried Rice and Flat Noodles - Yummy. Prepped the way I love it. Simple, tasty and satisfactory. 

Prices are very reasonable. Less than $7 for a lunch special (choice of brown/white rice or bread) served with soup. The restaurant itself is very pleasant...bright, clean and reasonably furnished. I love the waitresses. They are awesome!

I ordered the carne asada fries $8.15. They were delicious. Fries, carne asada, sour cream and cheese (I opted for no guac). No beans came on them. The taste was there, they were really good. Unfortunately the portion size was small and   Wasnt smothered in toppings. I was able to eat it all in one sitting...usually I can make 2 meals from the one at robertos. I will not be ordering this from here again. 

We also go the carne asada chimichanga$7.49. It was also smaller in size, but not complaints...the boss said it was GOOD and he would def. get it again. Even with it's smaller size he was full after he ate, good thing. :) Lastly, we got a bean and cheese burrito $2.80 and a wet bean and cheese burrito special w/ drink $3.90. 

It was kind of busy when we went since it was Friday evening  so some of the tables were filthy. No biggie. The salsa bar was stocked and clean which is a plus.

They had everything we needed in stock except for a special order lock for our storm door that we had to buy online.  Everything else they had locally which was a nice breath of fresh air.  

The store is clean with plenty of ample parking and the employees have always been helpful and friendly to us.  For example, we asked where the pesticides were and they could have pointed up at the sky and said, ""Uhhhhhhhhhhh.... like... it's like.... over... like... on one of those aisles that ends in the number 4 or sumthin'?   Or uhhhhhh.... maybe it's 5?   Dude....... I have no idea.   What's a pestycyde?""  ]

They have a new fall menu so I decided to try it again.  I have to give it mixed reviews. We got the appetizer portion of the Greek Style pork ribs with the slaw and cucumber yogurt, which was very good. My friend got a steak that he said was well prepared but disputed whether it was a NY strip as listed, thought it was more like a sirloin steak. I got the butternut risotto which was bland. Typically this dish is prepared by cooking in pureed butternut squash with the Arborio rice which imparts a squash flavor and an orange tint to the dish. Their dish was a basic risotto with cubes of cooked butternut squash stirred in, it would seem after the risotto was cooked, not during. It was white in a appearance with a few lumps of squash. They topped it with some herbs and prosciutto, but overall the dish lacked flavor. Definitely not what I expected. 

Service seems to be an issue here. The first time we sat in the bar area and felt that our server was inattentive. This time we were in the main dining area. The server did not seem to have a good command of the new menu; he was not able to give detailed info on some of the dishes we asked about.

We both can't wait to go back.  I had some pomegranate green tea to drink that was really yummy.  Then we shared the Stetson Salad.  I am a vegetarian so they substituted the chicken or salmon for chunks of avocado.  Yummy!  This was just the best chopped salad every.  I don't think I can remember everything in it but the many different colors, shapes and textures were just thrilling.  It had dried corn, couscous, the avocado, lettuce.....and some pesto ranch or something like that...

For dinner I had the mushroom panfry.  I have to say that I am not a huge fan of mushrooms.  I like them but I don't love them.  That said the waitress said it was the best vegetarian option and the reviews on it were so good that I went ahead and got it.  It has like 14 different kinds of mushrooms all cooked together in a tomatoey sauce with a couple triangles of polenta to eat with it.  It was good.  I was impressed.  Now I don't think I would order it again but that is just because mushrooms aren't really my thing.  If they are your thing I bet you will drool all over this dish.

My husband had some expresso crusted filet mignon.  He said it was one of the best cuts of steak he had in his life.  He also really liked to flavor of the coffee on it.  I had to feed him a bite just so I could experience the cutting of it with the fork.

For dessert we had the goat cheese cheesecake.  I think that is what kind of cheese it was.  I loved the filling of the cheesecake but not so much the crust or the sprinkles on top.  They reminded me of uncooked sugar cookies.",2008-07-10 20:24:19

I've definitely had bad / mediocre bowls so it's safe to say this place is pretty great. Not sure why exactly, it just is! The açaí portion of it is just the perfect sweetness and I like the amount of toppings they have. I do think sometimes there could be a little more granola and honey but overall great.

If you read my reviews of other Chinese restaurants, you'll know that I love just the basics.

The shrimp was good and tender, the vegetables nice and crisp, and the white sauce not overpowering--just the way I like it.  Rick opted for Sea Scallops with Ma La Sauce, which kind of surprised me.  He rarely has seafood out.  I tasted the scallops, but they were a little too spicy for me.

While we love the eggrolls here, they are the melt-in-your-mouth type, we opted for something a little different this time.  We had the fried dumplings for an appetizer.  They were not at all greasy or heavy.  Rick has also eaten the boiled dumplings, saying they are delicious.
