C5taUZSGpZKLjrryD-cNtw,gCp21sfvL6HnQOvapeV7sw,11bhfBbcFypczdz3N_w6iw,4,0,0,0,"I'm working out at Litchfield Park this month so I finally had a chance to try Senior Taco--a place that always seems packed at their Fountain Hills location the times I am up there. 

This is sort of a Filiberto's-style place. It is fast food, it has a similar menu. The prices are similar. However, the food was quite different. 

I tried three things, trying some of each and bringing some back to the office with me. First, the carne asada torta. I would say this is the most similar in flavor to Filibertos. Not bad, but not super great. It would have benefited from more meat and less guacamole. I also had a shredded beef, hard-shell taco. This was quite a bit different than Filiberto's and, in my opinion, better. They did not fry it as much, and it had a lot more cheese than I usually get at Filibertos. I also had the carne asada soft taco. The size was large and it was very good. Nothing here is super great, but the tacos were especially yummy. 

Service, cleanliness and all of the rest were average or above for a fast food restaurant. 

I give it 3.5 stars--leaning toward four due to the size of the dishes for the price.",2012-09-26 21:21:01
LFFK2Gfw3ro7rERvXXdAng,QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,4,14,5,9,"I've had this place on my radar screen for a very long time.  I finally decided to give it a try when I was in the area recently.  The name is kind of misleading.....I was expecting a sit-down restaurant with table service, what I found was a Coffee Shop (a la Starbucks), except it's locally owned.  I was a little disappointed because I had built up a huge appetite and the menu was very limited.

After a few minutes I decided to get their Cheese Pannini.  When I arrived, there was only 1 person in front of me, so I thought the service was going to be fast.....it wasn't.  It took almost 15 minutes to make my Paninni.....which for a sit-down restaurant wouldn't be bad, but for an order at the counter type place, it's kind of a long time.  I arrived just before the lunch rush (11:30 am)....while I was waiting, it got very busy with 10 people in line or so.  They are single threaded here with their food preparation, so I can't imagine how long they will have to wait for their food.

Anyway, when my food came out, it looked great.  I couldn't wait to take a bite of the Paninni.  It was as good as it looked, very good!

The Tomato Sauce in the Paninni was great and full of flavor.  The Bread was very tasty too.  The Paninni came with a very small side of greens which also went well with the dish.  I wish there were more greens.

Overall, it was a good experience.  However, for those with large appetites, I wouldn't suggest it....the portions are too small and ordering two Paninnis wouldn't be cost effective.  The joint is situated between a bunch of office buildings and is suited more for that crowd than a casual diner.  The staff is very nice here and makes a sincere attempt and getting to know their guests.  They asked me what my name was and where I was from, where I heard about the place, etc.....and they knew several of the people who stopped by for lunch by their 1st name....I'm guessing by the way they were dressed that they worked in one of the buildings nearby.

uf2z3YTahwfgefJFLvPSmg,3QFq-MJR6VcgpcgXNkc4gg,7LIxuMlLsQp_znezKPBRaA,4,5,0,0,"At the recommendation of a couple in our group, ten of us descended upon this gem of an Italian restaurant last night.  What a great experience!

It's exterior is unprepossessing, though efforts have been to make it stand out from it's more commercial neighbors with huge pots of colorful flowers and a cleanly swept entry, but pass over the threshold and you have entered a casually elegant restaurant that hints at it's European roots without hitting you over the head with checkered tablecloths and wax-dribbled chianti bottles.  

We met up in the bar, which is very handsome with shimmering bottles up-lit behind the bar and lots of comfy seating---both stools and high-tops.  The bartender was warm and courteous.  After collecting our starter beverages (DH had the house cab and I the house pinot---both very good!), we were led back to our very own private dining room where we could talk and laugh as loudly as we'd like without disturbing the other diners.   A long, narrow-ish room, there were windows on either side---to one side, looking out on the landscaping and the other into the dining room, so we didn't feel isolated at all---just special!  It was a wee bit chilly so a gas fire was dancing on the hearth at one end while a fountain burbled on the other---the feng shui rocked!

Other reviewers have complained about the service---what are they talking about?  Johnny, our server, was fantastic.  Lots of personality, professional, knew the menu, and showed admirable patience because couples had ""mixed"" so he had to track who went on which ticket, a task he accomplished with aplomb.

DH and I shared a Capreze salad.  Now a Capreze salad is pretty basic---tomato, mozzarella, basil, dribbled with balsamic vinegar.  But all the ingredients were very fresh and bursting with flavor and the presentation was beautiful.

I ordered the special---a MASSIVE veal chop layered with a slice of eggplant and then laid over with a blanket of melt-y, gooe-y cheese.  It was supposed to have marinara served on it but I asked for the red sauce on the side because I am not a huge tomato sauce fan and I like to be in control of it.  To accompany, I had the choice of veggies or pasta.  I chose the veggies.  The chop was perfectly cooked, so moist and toothsome with the perfect amount of crisp breading.  The marinara sauce---am I really saying this?---was really good!  Not too sweet, not too tangy, nicely seasoned and the perfect texture.  The veggies were cooked to the point they were tender with such a hint of bite----the plate was dominated by carrots and I might have liked a bit more broccoli, but that's a minor quibble.  I ate and ate and ate and still had a healthy portion to bring home.

DH got the Chicken Parmesan.  That's his go-to dish for judging an Italian restaurant.  (Sort of like chiles rellenos are mine for Mexican!)   He said it reminded him of the Chicken Parm he enjoyed several times at a favorite restaurant on the Amalfi Coast when we visited Italy----need I say more?  DH was very, very pleased with his meal.  He, needless to say, had no leftovers to bring home!  

The other eight members of our party ordered a variety of dishes---one ordered the Chicken Martini, La Prima's signature dish, and DH says he'll get that next time.  Another had a Veal Marsala that looked so delicious I almost---almost!---regretted my chop for, it looked so good.  Another ordered the Ciopinno, bursting with mussels, shrimp, salmon, clams....  Everyone had something different.  As DH said, we were cheerful, noisy group until the plates were delivered and then the table fell nearly silent except for moans of appreciation as everyone enjoyed their meals.

Johnny offered a wonderful dessert menu, but we were all replete, so the ten of us all finished our meals with cappuccino that was accompanied by a lovely biscotti cookie, and the owner of La Prima Donna was thoughtful enough to offer to us all glasses of port to partner with our coffees.

Did I mention that the owner/chef---I believe his name is Gino---stopped by our table?  You can see his passion and love for what he is doing in word and action.  The couple who suggested La Prima Donna said that he has been chef in some of the finest restaurants in Phoenix before opening the doors of La Prima Donna.

All-in-all, a very good dining experience and one DH and I look forward to repeating soon.  Thank you Johnny and Gino and all our friends for a really enjoyable evening!

I happily recommend La Prima Donna to all my fellow Yelpers!",2013-11-02 14:33:56

rtSKBmyu_LmQ_MOCyh6gbw,KgFOJnWXxVuz0b-xfo6jjw,qUWqjjjfpB2-4P3He5rsKw,4,3,1,0,"Simple self-serve Italian franchise just north of Chinatown. Everything about this restaurant is great:

1) Casual environment
2) Great food - homemade pasta and the Peking Duck Pizza!
3) Relatively quick
3) Reasonable Prices

I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they were overwhelmed on a Thursday night with Uber and other deliveries leading to a few issues that happened that affected my table. However, the franchise owner/manager was very kind and genuine and made it up to us by reimbursing me for my meal and offering us two desserts on the house. Because of these actions, the restaurant is now in my good books and exemplifies what a customer first approach should be like.

Some minor suggestions to the restaurant: 

1) Do not accept reservations if it is a self-serve operation
2) Not to sound cheap, but putting a tipping option in the credit card machine when some customers pay upfront may not be the best idea especially since it's self-serve. Difficult to assess service and food quality before sitting down to enjoy the meal. Either do not have a tipping option if customers pay upfront or have one if they pay once the service is rendered.

Definitely will come back here again because of the food and service, but hopefully some of the operational kinks will be ironed out. Since there is has been an uptick in food deliveries with all of these new apps, I hope they have a plan in place to ensure their service and food quality do not deteriorate.",2016-10-07 23:48:00

So the Girl Posse and I went here recently to check out a new documentary.  We went to see ""Anvil, the Story of Anvil"", which was about a metal band called...Anvil!  The band has been around for 30 years now and the guys are all in their 50s.  Even though the story is funny in places, and the film does stray into ""Spinal Tap"" territory a little bit, Anvil is a real band.  It's a great documentary, worth checking out.",2009-07-06 13:45:38

So you get table with the hostess and they give you menus to order from.  And then you have to go up and order at the order desk and give them your table number so they know where to deliver your food.  

We went with hummus to share, chicken shwarma plate, chicken shish taouk platter, and a strawberry mango drink.  This came out to around $ 45.00 for the two of us....I was like, ""Wha?! Uh...okay, debit?""  It seemed expensive for a place that had me ordering at a counter like a fast food place. 

But then the food arrived...first the complimentary pita pillowy and steamy from the oven.  I realized early on that the bread is unlimited so eat up!  My chicken shish taouk was DELISH!  The chicken shwarma was equally as good, but the complaint was that it was a smaller portion than what he's used to.  GARLIC SAUCE.  Way creamy, way indulgent, it elevates your meal to a whole new level.  

If you have kids, there's a play area where they can run around and burn off the falafels they just inhaled while you enjoy some more pita and garlic sauce.  And then maybe some tea and baklava.  

The service was great-we had 3 different people stop by and ask if we were enjoying our meal.  One girl asked if we needed hot sauce but we were nearly done and didn't even think of it so we told her, ""Oh!  We didn't know!  Next time.""  She comes back with two hot sauces, one to enjoy now and one to take home.  Impressive.  Impression made.  We'll be back.",2014-03-28 01:19:55

I only picked up a crocodile briefcase $7, and I saw many more handbags under a $20 price range. Furniture, ehh not so much but they did have a nice selection of artwork, cushions, and housewares. The only real con here I can find is that clothing seems to not be labeled according to size, so it may take you several seconds to figure out where your size is located. 

I cannot comment on the selling experience only that I watched other people doing it and it seemed like a painless process, credit for more clothes or cash! Items were kept very clean and there was no gross musty smell typically associated with such places. 

Customer service is amaaazing, they have a super friendly woman manning the counter who will take the time to answer your questions, chat, and had true patience while showing me many items in the case (trust me that is not easy, I take forever to decide).

As Victor said, they're extremely fortunate not to have a ZERO star option because I would have branded them with such.

I was chauffeuring a friend/coworker around who had just given me a rather frantic phone call that her car had a flat tire with a massive gash, the spare was flat and also had a huge leak, and the air pump at the gas station she pulled into was broken as well.  

So we went to this particular Pep Boys at 7:55 to see if they could help us.  We saw them rolling down the garage bay doors on the side so she leaped out and knocked on the glass door.  When she saw them take view of her and TURN AWAY, she ran to the side to see if she could catch them before they closed the bay doors, pleading for some help.

At FIRST they pretended like they didn't see her or ME, waiting in the car glaring at them.  .  

THEN the mechanic acted as if he couldn't understand English well enough to help her.  

Miraculously, he managed to know enough to inform her, ""No, I don't know of any tire places that open, we're closed.""  And closed the garage door on her.

She walked back to the car in the rain and we found another location.  I wrote a letter and mailed it off since this is completely unacceptable on a level of human decency let another on the level of a business transaction.  

What gets me is that I've gotten decent service at other locations of Pep Boys, such as on Lake Mead and Tenaya.  

Dear Pep Boys:

However, despite banking own my parents & the millennium scholarship, I love being a music composition major.  

I don't know what other colleges offer or how their programs run, but I'm quite satisfied with the music program so far. 

Tuition: 

Over priced & only going up because of the wonderful state of Nevada. 

Professors & program: 

Bearable but often times enjoyable within the Music department. Downside for me is that music classes are often 1 - 2 credits per class. It takes 12+ to be considered full time, so I end up taking around 7 classes a semester.

Campus:

It's Vegas. The weather reaches extremes dependent on the season, so is the weather on campus.

The renovations on certain buildings make the campus cleaner nowadays. MSU & the Rec Center are places to hangout if you're not in class.

My favorite part of campus is on closer to Flamingo where all the trees are which coincidentally is where the music classes are :]

I ordered the teriyaki beef plate.  It came with rice and macaroni salad.  The beef and the macaroni had great flavor.  The rice was rice, and tasted like rice should.

I've stopped by here a couple of times, grabbing something for eating on the plane or to take home after a late night arrival. Depending on the time of the day, the lines can be long, but they do move quickly - faster than their neighbors it seems. The team of three or four each has a specific role in the assembly process which seems to help speed things up. However, the means that none of them care about the final product. While the burrito is fully stuffed, it's not mixed at all. A pocket of beans here and a spoonful of guacamole there, there is no opportunity for the flavors of these ingredients to mix and meld.

Still, it's way better than the ""nothing"" that most carriers serve in coach and it's possible to eat it without needing a whole lot of room to spread out, or a knife and fork.

The steak wasn't amazing.  It pains me to type that.  I expected to bite into that steak and be like ""mmmmmmmmm"" but it was more like ""mmm.""

The sides I tried were excellent - the truffle mac and cheese was outstanding and the flavors and textures of the creamed spinach made my mouth happy.

The bathrooms were filthy.

With so many amazing steak places in Vegas, I expected more here.  Ah well.",2010-10-25 04:13:55

I ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu so my meal came with an appetizer, entree and dessert. The tabbouli salad was nothing like typical middle eastern tabbouli (still not sure why they called it that) but it was good and flavorful. The portion of the salad was huge and I was able to share it with the entire table. For entree, I ordered the crab stuffed chicken. To me, it was a little dry and the flavors weren't amazing. My husband ordered the scallops on the regular menu and although the portion was a nice size, he didn't care for the flavor. His dish came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes and green beans, which I thought were the best part. The salted caramel pudding dessert was by far my favorite part of the dining experience and I would definitely come back for that again. Apparently it has won awards over the years.

Overall, I thought this place was just okay. I know this is a Fox restaurant but I prefer the food and upbeat environment at Culinary Dropout (Tempe).",2015-09-22 18:33:47

The burger I had was okay at best. Somewhat larger than a regular burger, but not worth the price tag it came with. 
I got a sub Caesar salad, also not worth the extra few bucks. Best part of the meal was my beer. Tap water here is non-existent, they would rather charge you $2.50 for a water bottle that probably cost them $0.15

Place is tiny. Literally the size of a walk in closet. Only a few tables, which all wobble. Nothing more annoying then eating and having a beer on a wobbly table. Patio outside also small. Can't do much though, space is limited, just a heads up to those who have never been here. 

I wanted to return to try the wings, but my first visit wasn't great, so the chances of me returning to this joint is slim to none. 

*also, to the *** of an owner that runs this joint, you're in the business of making food and selling it to people in the hopes of making a profit.

XBtgFcAGSfWmMFmTmRdGJw,Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,zcFP7ObRK5vVUoLol8anng,4,12,6,7,"The Montreal public transit system is pretty sweet. For $3 you can jump on any bus (heads up they don't give change) or metro (they do) and get to most places on the island. Most of the core metro stops were originally built right before Expo 67 - in other words, a bunch of urban planners and artists spent a bunch of money to make beautiful transit that would help showcase Montreal to the world. Each original station featured a different Quebecois artist, so sometimes you'll pop out of the metro below giant stained glass, or come up the stairs to face an enormous sculpted tree. The Mtl subway system is the most used system in Canada, the city has been coordinating forms of public transit since 1861 and you do get the feeling that, though not perfect, it's something Mtl takes seriously and tries to do right. 

The subway and buses are very clean and even kind of chic compared to Toronto or NYC's, and the system is simple to navigate: eg unlike other city's subways you won't have different trains running the same track, stopping at the exact same spot requiring you to read a sign on the train itself to make sure you've got the right one. In Montreal if you stand on the right platform, you're getting on the right train. 

The monthly pass is called the Opus card, it costs about $70 a month for unlimited rides if you're an adult, but you can also just buy 10 or 20 rides at a time on your Opus card and they won't expire at the end of the month - a sweet cheap option for a commuter like me who doesn't need to use transit every day. When you swipe your Opus card at the metro turnstile it shows you how many rides you have left so you know when to refill. It doesn't have a photo on it, but you can register your Opus card number at Berri, Jean Talon, Snowdon, or Lionel to protect you in case of loss or theft. 

If you're a visitor you can check out the 1 day or 1 week rates, but these have set start and end days and times that I find confusing personally. When folks visit me we just buy the $20 pack of 10 tickets - these can be used on the bus or metro, they include transfers, and they don't expire for a year (or more?) so whatever my guests don't use doesn't go to waste. 

When using these tickets on the metro just slide the ticket into the slot as indicated, wait for it to pop back up, then remove it and push through the turnstile.

The metro stops downtown - eg McGill, Peel - connect to the underground malls, so you can shop and wander indoors for miles in the winter. Calling this an underground city is overselling it, but for mall basements connected by tunnels and metros it's arright.

The metros generally stop running around 1am, except during nuit blanche when they run all night. There are useful night buses that run most of the major arteries, and the lineup for these at 3am is jovial, boozy and ridiculous (the one to Montreal West and the West Island leaves from Atwater). 

In general I've had great experiences with the drivers and staff at the metros and on the buses - special shoutout to the singing driver who is beloved on every route he drives. The staff are mostly but not always bilingual, but anyway all the automated tellers have an English option. There is confusion every time they change the system, but that's to be expected and doesn't happen too often. There was a brief period when STM bus drivers all seemed like jerks because they would drive away from passengers trying to cross the street or running up at the last second to catch the bus, but someone seems to have changed their mind about this jerkiness being a good idea and now they act like kind-hearted humans again, waiting that extra second for little old ladies trying to catch the bus, and things are much better.",2011-12-12 17:33:34

The only reason I would even come here in the first place is the Oyster Bar. Well now I am going to add one more thing to check out at the Harrah's casino - the Mac King Show.

This is one of those shows that often get overlook pretty easily because Vegas has so many big name shows like Cirque du Soleil, Blue Man Group, Criss Angel / David Copperfield, etc. You want to watch any of those shows I just mentioned? Well the cheapest seats are typically AT LEAST $50+ per person (unless you have hotel comps ... but those aren't something everyone has access to).

Price: I visited the Tix 4 Tonight booth and got one general ticket for $29 (including tax and other fees). In hindsight, Yelp actually offers a pretty good deal ($24 for a voucher redeemable for $50). You can also visit the Harrah's Total Rewards for a discount voucher, but I didn't want to pay more (general admission price was about $40 ~ $45 per person) for two for one buffet, free upgrade to VIP seating, and free drink at the bar.

Show time & location: This is one of the few shows in Vegas that starts at 1 PM & 3 PM. To find the theater, just locate the cashier cage in Harrah's and take escalator to the 3rd floor.

Contents: Lots of clean PG13 adult humor as well as kid humor. Expect rope tricks, card tricks, audience participation, the ""invisible"" trick, and the signature gold fish trick.

For what you are paying for, I think this is a pretty solid Vegas magic show.",2017-01-07 21:45:29

We came last night with the 10yr old to celebrate his first week of school and we had a great visit! Hubby and I shared the Cheeseburger in Paradise and it was AWESOME. The fries were crisp and well seasoned. The burger was perfectly cooked and delicious. Son had the fish tacos and they were amazing. The side dishes were even well thought out and delicious. I had a side salad with our meal and it was cold, fresh, crisp and not some pre-packaged slop on a plate. We also had a slice of cheesecake and a slice of key lime pie for dessert. Food was EXCELLENT.  I had the wildberry margarita and it was AWESOME. My hubby had a rum and coke and said it was perfectly balanced. 

Our server, Jimmy, was polite, friendly, and very professional. Our drinks were never empty and he was never intrusive. Our food was served at the right temps and never seemed to have sat around under heat lamps. I hate when that happens. 

The stiltwalking balloon guy was just super. He was friendly, kind, and genuinely glad to have us visit his place. In fact, we remarked that he looked just like the Jolly Mon from Jimmy Buffett's childrens book of the same name and he thought that was awesome. :) He made the most amazing Spiderman balloon creature that we've ever seen. 

Son has been raving about this visit for the last 12 hours and made a point to tell me to be sure to YELP this place as soon as possible.

The Pros: 
    -they USUALLY have everything that I need in stock  
    -the prices are reasonable on most items (e.g., I purchased a 24 pack of bottled water for $2.69 yesterday) 
    -most of the clerks are very friendly and quick to ring items up
    -plenty of parking
    -they have a STARBUCKS inside!
    -the number of healthy/organic items they carry is always increasing

The Cons:
    -even though the parking lot exits onto both McDowell and 7th St, you cannot turn North onto 7th and trying to head East onto McDowell can be somewhat challenging at certain times of the day
    -there are almost always one or more homeless people standing outside the entrance

I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed the cupcake that I ordered.  I do appreciate that they are a little larger so it makes it easier to share and feel like you had a whole dessert.  I think the key is choosing the right flavor.  There were plenty of options that I know I wouldn't have liked because it would've been too sweet, too much frosting, etc.  I have gotten a strawberry and cream type of a cupcake before and most recently, Boston cream pie.  I appreciate the cutesy decor and staff have always been friendly enough.  I've even had the mini cupcakes before at a work party and we didn't have any problem eating all of those.  I find these cupcakes to have more moisture and different types of frosting whereas another local cupcake shop always seem a bit dry to me.  Colossal is now open late which is great because you can get a quick dessert after going to a show or a game.

On my first attempt to visit I decided to call ahead to verify that they were open so I could swing by on my way home from work. I called on a Friday at 1:30 p.m. and the phone rang and rang. After three phone call attempts, I assumed they were closed. Weird.

Saturday morning I decided to try again. Went to the website this time and noticed they didn't open until 10 a.m. A bakery that isn't open early in the morning? Ok. No biggie. I go around 11 a.m.

Like many other reviews noted, the place is tiny. Slade was there and very nice. However, I was taken aback by the lack of selection. He had four muffin choices, a few croissants, and three (maybe four) cupcake choices. From the looks of the website, I assumed there would be cookies, cakes, etc. Not a big deal, I really only wanted muffins and cupcakes anyway. I bought a lemon poppy seed and chocolate muffin, as well as a red velvet and vanilla creme brulee cupcake.

The muffins were ok. Nothing special. The lemon poppy seed was also kind of dry. Again, no biggie, I knew the cupcakes were what it was all about anyway.

I actually really enjoyed the look of the cupcakes. I liked the way the frosting was applied and the fact he used parchment paper instead of muffin cups. However, the red velvet cupcake was also just ok.   The frosting was good, the cake was a little dry. BOO. I haven't even bothered to try the vanilla cream brulee cupcake yet. Maybe my hopes were just too high.

I have read most of the other reviews and it's clear with Wicked there are some inconsistencies. Maybe I just went on a bad day. Not sure if it's worth it to try again though.",2009-01-18 17:14:37

Their menu is very English friendly so those who don't know Chinese can actually get by easily! But the best part is that their menu is really comprehensive in terms of having pictures for many of their items, which corresponds to the number on the ordering sheet. Good stuff!

$6.50 for 15 dumplings in many varieties seem like a pretty good deal. We tried the beef and radish, and and some pork dumplings, and well as the larger pan-fried dumplings, and beef noodles. 

For the dumplings, the beef ones were definitely better than the pork ones and they were way juicier, not only with the soup inside them, but also in terms of the meat itself. The pan-fried dumplings were very good as well but could be a tad crispier. The beef noodles were also good, however beef and vegetables were on the skimpier side. Then again, it was only around $7 for a large portion.

I ordered the soontofu and pork kimchi stew. The broth was amazing!! It was the perfect balance of spicy and sweetness from the Kim chi. BUT... the portion was small af. I was still a bit hungry after eating it and I always get full quickly at restaurants that my boyfriend has to finish my food for me lol - not the case here .... there was just way too much tofu and I'm not even kidding, I literally had three pieces of pork. Really ? That was a joke.. disappointing, because I really did enjoy the broth. 

My boyfriend got the same thing but with tuna, he could not find any tuna and again, way too much tofu. And if I was still a bit hungry after finishing my food, he was still really hungry after his meal! Our stew was $13.50 EACH for a small ass bowl of soup that is 3/4 tofu. 

We also ordered the dumplings, they were super tiny! $10 for 15 tiny dumplings seem a bit ridiculous. 

I've been here before, I'd say go for their value meals/combos because it is more worth it. Their black bean sauce noodles are really good and they have a bunch of combos around $12 for half size noodles and another item of your choice. 

Service wise it's ok. I like that they have the button to call for help, though it still took a while for a server to come to my table. Also, I found it weird that our stew came out before our rice? Our rice came about 5 minutes after ... it isn't long but when you're hungry it feels like an eternity and the girl who dropped it off didn't mention anything about the rice being served later so we assumed they just forgot....

Will I come back? Likely, but only for their combo meals with the black bean sauce. Every time I order something other than that I get so disappointed with the portion.

Loved the selection but wasn't a fan of the charcuterie, and wished there were more crackers (rather than bread). We also sipped prosecco all evening, which was divine.

Took about 10 mins for the wait... The food came quite fast as we ordered almost 11 items for 3 people. The dim sum qualities weren't terrible, taste pretty much like regular dim sum at most places. The most interesting dish was the Chiu Chow style beef ball- 4 beef balls in a bowl of soup. The soup was quite tasteless, and the beef balls were not as flavorful as regular steamed beef balls. 

Overall, prices were descend, not too too bad for the early bird price ($3.28 S, M, L dishes) and the discount valid Mon-Sun until 1130am (except public holidays). The atmosphere of the restaurant reminded me of the ones in HK. I will come back again when I am around that area.",2018-05-17 15:38:13

When we arrived I thought there was a private party going on but apparently every Friday and Saturday night they have live entertainment. As per the other reviews below, yes the entertainment is super annoying. I couldn't concentrate ordering with my server because yes the singing was bad. Note to self - don't come on Fridays and Saturdays. It seemed pretty packed when we arrived and people end up clearing out by the end of our meal.

The food is decent. Usually I go for koobideh which is their ground beef with basmati rice. Today I felt like having half salad and their garden salad is typical iceberg with thousand island dressing (don't recommend it). Today it was good. I usually add butter to the rice because I find it slightly dry. We also had shirazi salad (cucumber, tomato and spices) which was nice. I enjoy their bread as well. 

Our server was super nice, my friend often sees her and she is very sweet and courteous. We finished our meals with tea and by the time we were done the restaurant was closed and they didn't rush us out which is nice.

I've previously never heard of Tasti D-Lite but I learned it is big in New York and after trying it I think it will be big here as well.  I'm always looking for desserts that are tasty yet won't make me fatter or send me into carb/calorie overload so I was very excited to try this place.  Tasti D-Lite's main thing is that it is supposed to have very calorie-lite and tasty frozen yogurt/ice cream type stuff.  Although I'm still not sure if it is ice cream or frozen yogurt.  They even have a nutritional comparison with most of the other ice cream/frozen yogurt places so you can see how this place stacks up.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Upon entering the place you will notice that it doesn't look that much different than the 75 other frozen yogurt places that have sprung up around the valley over the past couple years.  What you WILL notice is that each of their frozen treat offerings clearly show the amount of calories in it.  Friggin GENIUS!  Almost every other food selling establishment should take the hint from Tasti D-Lite and start doing this.  I understand that the average Joe doesn't care how many calories are in what he eats, but I think a lot of people would be way better off if they are given proper nutritional information of what goes into their mouths.

So far I was impressed.  The place was nice and clean, the girl behind the counter (Megan) was very helpful and friendly, the prices were reasonable, etc.   BUT....did the stuff taste any good for having only a few calories per bite?  After sampling every one of their 5 or so flavors I was quite surprised.  Everything pretty much tasted like what it was supposed to and actually were very good.  It wasn't the best frozen yogurt stuff I've ever eaten, but it is pretty good.  Its not the creamiest, richest, or sweetest, but it is quite satisfying.  For under 100 calories for a small cup you can't go wrong.  But don't worry, you can still load your cup with the usual not-so-good-for-you toppings.

Listen, if you want something that tastes like Chunky Monkey then this is not your place.  But if you want some decent frozen yogurt stuff that is lite on your wallet and calories, then pay Tasti D-Lite a visit.",2010-04-16 16:05:45

Goat cheese bruschetta was really good.  I'd go back for that alone.

Prickly pear chicken was ok.  Because of the marinade they use the meat comes out pink looking and most closely resembles ham in appearance rather than chicken.  Kind of weird honestly.

The Italian sandwich was meh.   The meat was average at best and that's being generous (just slightly north of Subway quality).  Quite frankly this is really a shame because the rest of the sandwich (bread, veggies, vinaigrette) were very good.

Overall pretty good.  Not a 4, probably closer to a 3.5, but I'm giving a 3 because of the sandwiches.

The pretzel appetizer was good, but for $8, should have had double the amount of pretzels, considering it comes with a vat of cheese.  Sadly, there were just 4 little pretzel logs on the plate.  My husband said his pork schnitzel sandwich was dry and lacked flavor.  I ordered the brisket sandwich.  While you can take the girl out of Texas, you most definitely cannot take any expectations for decent brisket out of Texas.  The meat was hardly brisket, more like overly fatty chunks of flavorless pot roast served on an equally flavorless bun.  I've enjoyed more flavorful ""brisket"" at a chain.  The most atrocious item was the kid's meal.  The cheeseburger was burned to a crisp.  Sadly, the fries were also burnt.  My poor son would pick up one, say ""No, Momma"" and place it on my plate.  Luckily, our waitress brought him some orange sections and he enjoyed the grape tomatoes that came on my salad.

Perhaps it was an issue of being understaffed, but the reality is that at this price point, sub par service is not acceptable and is something that will cause me to patronize the abundance of OP's competitors that are in the same genre.

We went on a Friday, before a Blue Jays game.

I even have to say that the appetizer of grilled vegetables and goats cheese was a very impressive and 5 star quality appetizer. But then we waited. And waited. And as every group in the restaurant that arrived after us and received their food before us, my disappointment grew. Maybe they thought we were actually there for a slow social dinner, and everyone else vocalized their going to the Jays game which is why they received preferential treatment. I don't know....
All I know is that it took us 2 hours between the time of being seated and actually receiving our bill.

For my first course I chose tzatziki and substituted the roasted cauliflower hummus for the baba ghanoush that normally comes with it. Those dips came with regular and pita bread to share. My son ordered the chicken shawarma which came with a grain salad.

We loved the tzatziki dip. I thought the roasted cauliflower dip was just okay but once I got into it more I liked it a bit better.

I let it go because I see that she's with postmates and the owner probably wants to just get the to go order finished. Okay cool, whatever it's no big deal. Soon as she's done with that she goes over to the sushi chefs and completely forgets about me. When she comes back, I'm still in line patiently airing for her to pay attention to me. Literally as soon as another couple walked up, she took her eyes off the receipts and counter and tended to them. Even..though...I was RIGHT THERE... in FRONT of her being skipped for the SECOND time now. Finally after a long time of waiting she takes me order. Simple California roll. After all that hassle the California roll was missing the cucumber . I still ate it, however I noticed immediately and will not be going back.

Has a backyard feel to it. My order was wrong ordered croissant not a chocolate and they almost insisted that I ordered chocolate. Also saw something similar happen at a neighboring table. Maybe a little better job of listening to the customer and certainly avoid arguing with pateons. Diverse Workforce. Order at the front bar and meals are delivered to the tables. Kind of a loft reading area going on in the back with bleachers that you can sit on. Cool retro bathrooms. I can see myself becoming a regular.

It is located on highway 7 in the southern most part of Richmond Hill. It's in the same plaza as McDonald's. There's lots of free parking and its at the valleymede viva stop.

They have roasted and BBQ pork, chicken, whole duck, cuttlefish, chicken feet, and lots of other food.

You can buy the meats by the pound. You can also buy a whole or half roasted pig as well, you just need to pre order.

I get the combo. There's a small and large one. It's rice, with one or two meats on it. With a sauce and ginger and scallion salsa. I get normally the chicken and BBQ pork. Tonight, the pictures are of something different.

I got the roasted pork and BBQ pork with extra roasted pork. Roasted pork was amazing. Crispy skin. Omg!!

We had a great time and the atmosphere and service were fantastic, but the food in relation to the prices left something to be desired. I teetered between a 3 and a 4 star review, but ultimately decided on 3.

For drinks my husband had the Kiltlifter (on tap), I had the Hefeweizen (on tap), and my mother in law attempted to order Fireball, but apparently they don't carry it. The waitress said it was too obscure, so she ordered a Jim Beam and Coke instead. Overall, the drinks were good, but to be fair, they were easy orders.

For appetizers we got the deviled eggs (3 halves for a total of 1.5 eggs for $3) and pretzels with provolone fondue ($10). Both were absolutely delicious. The price on the eggs was a little steep, but they were very good. On the other hand, the pretzel appetizer was very large and was a surprisingly excellent value. I believe they have it in happy hour for like half price, too. The cheese was delicious and the pretzels were really good. I would definitely recommend.

For the entrees my husband got the prime rib special ($32), I had the New York strip ($36), and my mother in law had the crab stuffed chicken ($23). My husbands prime rib was thick cut and looked incredible, but he said it was a little dry. He said the au jus was really good, though. My mother in laws chicken was not stuffed. It was two fried (but not breaded) and pounded chicken breasts with the crab sandwiched in between. She said it was good, but just not at all what she thought it would be when she read ""stuffed"". My New York strip was really, really good. The meat was excellent, but the accompanying potatoes were really plain. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, though.

For dessert we had the peanut butter cup, which was not a cup at all. It's warm peanut butter mousse with a tiny scoop of chocolate gelato in the middle. It came with two peanut butter cookies on the side. The mousse was excellent, but it needed more gelato to balance it out. We also had the blueberry cheesecake, which was really creamy but not very sweet at all. The sweetness was more in the blueberry compote on top, which I really loved, but it might not be for everyone.  

I am not sure we will come back here. It's definitely possible, but we weren't really wowed by anything that would compel us to return. We would likely try one of the many other Phoenix restaurants before returning to see what they have to offer.",2016-08-21 04:03:51

My omelet was good, but the cooks foiled my attempt to make it healthy by cooking it in oil. I literally picked up the omelet and put it on a napkin, and the napkin soaked up its oil. Gross. My pancake was very dense and kind of dry. Not light and fluffy like pancakes should be. 

My husband's waffle was pretty pathetic. Also dense and flavorless. Here's the scary part: the server dropped off the syrup and it was all frothy...we tasted it and we think it was fermenting.

Make sure you spend time looking at the main museum items too.  Much of this was owned by Anna Parks who was the owner of many of the items that are on display.  Her collection of ""stuff"" from the area is marvelous and her collection of Indian baskets is superb!

Enjoy the County museum.  It's a bit of a drive from the western part of the Valley, but it's well worth it.

Not sure if many of you folks recollect but the beers here used to be ""flat"". Like, that was the intention - their claim to fame - was flat beers. Little to no carbonation. It was a hard start and people really talked a lot about it. Maybe it was intentional to get people in the door? I donno! But they did a big upset and flipped it all up one day.

They apparently hired a new brewmaster. The beers became stellar! Now you can find all manner of seasonal and small batch brews alongside their regular line up with lots of reliable flavors spanning the whole list of beer types. None of them flat! The bar staff is extremely helpful even at popular times - and they get a LOT of attention these days. So much so that the parking lot can be quite a bit of a pain.

I stopped in here on a rare rainy day for lunch and was shocked by the long lines at 11am. The phone was raining with call in orders and the line grew. This was a good sign.

There is the over head menu full of the usual Mexican taco burrito total fare, and s small black board with specials.
 
I overheard the lady in front of me asking for a veggie burrito $.3.50 (a black board special) and to get it toasted.  I decided to do the exact same and added some chips for $1.
  
The burrito was great filled with beans, peppers onions and more. The toasting made it quite hot and added a extra crunch to the tortilla I could have lived without. 

The hot sauce was still hot from cooking, a decent Smokey spice note and very thin, I really liked it. The chips came in a small paper  tray not much for $1 but they were good and thick.

Despite the crowd seating was decent with many 4 and 2 person tables in the long narrow setup.

There is a small soda fountain with the usual. And a free spiced carrots that were great, mostly spice not vinegar!

Atmosphere: Very friendly atmosphere. The waitress was eager to help with menu suggestions and describing each dish as it came out. The owner would also stop by frequently to chat, check on how we were doing, and to make sure we knew how to eat each dish because we were new.

The line was out the door and up the sidewalk, mostly people out of town.

We finally get in and to be honest I was ready for a let down another over hyped place that relied on its name rather than its food.  Thankfully I was wrong!

Menu is quite large there are alot of breakfast staples and some new twists on classics so there is something for everyone.  People are packed in a bit tight but I guess it beats waiting in line longer.

I got a eggs bacon and pancakes and my companion got the California omelette and a milkshake.  Food came out pretty quick and was really good and the portions were generous.  

Definitely lived up to the hype and was high quality diner food.

Only let down was it being cash only.

I had the BBQ Jerk Chicken with rice and peas, and black beans. Be prepared, the jerk chicken is spicy! The BBQ sauce was a good addition and gave the chicken a slight bit of sweetness. 

My husband had the chicken sampler platter which comes with curry chicken, brown stewed chicken, and jerk chicken. All three were very good and full of flavor. The curry chicken was nothing like Indian or Thai curry - but why would it be? The jerk chicken was a bit too spicy for him, though.

A glass of their homemade ginger beer soda really helps to quench the flames in your mouth from the spicy food - and it's also good for your tummy!

Whether you are dealing with the Geek Squad or one of the regular Blue Shirt salesmen on the floor they always seem to go above and beyond to help me find what I'm looking for. In fact if they don't have it in their store they offer to order it for me or tell me where to go and pick it up locally.

Case in point, Today I wanted a newly released CD, Yes I'm one of those die hard geezers who wants an actual disc and not some digital soft copy. 

They had it advertised on the shelf but no more copies in the bin. Now the Flaming Lips are popular but since the release was just this week I found it hard to believe there was more than 2 or 3 die hard fans who still wanted hard copies and that they had all came to this store and bought them out. 

The end result was a Blue Shirt hunt and found a very eager and enthusiastic young kid who also couldn't find the mysterious disk and called for back up.

The Blue Shirt sales team jumped to the rescue and searched online, the back rooms of the store and even through the shelves thinking someone may have hidden a few copies behind another album as the store computer claimed their was three copies left.

Less than 10mins later I walked out of the store with one of the two  remaining copies left ( they surmised that the other was probably five finger discounted and said that was a big problem now as hardly anyone ever buys these relics anymore and they don't watch that corner as hard as the rest of the store) after thanking the search team for all their help I eagerly awaited the drive home listing to my new purchase.

My burger came with a small fries. The only negative is that it had to be the messiest burger I have ever eaten. lol I also got a coconut and pineapple shake to go and that was very good. I think they won best of Phx one year for their shakes. The man behind the counter is pretty friendly once he warms up to you. I would go back for sure.

As a few other reviewers noted, yes they are very picky about no outside food or drink since it is heath code law violation. However, there is a big sign on the door so you can not really plead ignorance. I know a few other reviewers noted this as a reason not to come back and I find that childish. Yes, some other restaurants do overlook the law it but the fact is, it is still illegal and gross. Just leave it in the car folks and stop complaining about it or holding it against the owner who is rule following. Since it is illegal I never in a million years thought it had to do with greed. I do not fault them for that and they have been open since 1950.

 I do admit the no refill soda thing is a bit old school and they should reconsider changing that policy. However, other places still charge for refills too so it is not totally unheard of.

First off, the service was very friendly and accomodated our party of 12.  He was very knowledgable about the wine and gave us some tips on what to order.  We had a very tasty house Cabernet.  The bread that they serve is fantastic.  I've been to France and the bread here is certainly up to par.  They dump the cactus looking bread in the middle of the table.  I think I ate enough bread to last a whole week without going hungry.  Anywayz, our party ordered similar dishes, it was either the lamb chop, salmon, or steak.  The lambchops were excellent as well as the salmon.  Maybe one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had.  The steak wasn't bad, nothing I've never tasted before.  My gf had the clam chowder which was very tasty.  For dessert we all split a Dark chocolate mousse (very good), Creme broule (decent), and some kind of waffle thing served with chocolate sauce (not good).  

I had a great experience here and will definitely be back for lunch (update... they only have brunch here. Oyster bar starts at around 3 while dinner starts at around 5).

Service was excellent - I found staff to be super attentive and quite pleasant. Now to the food ... I had the chicken tandoori pizza; can I say yum? It was great; the pizza was flavourful and the crust was super thin and crispy. My dining companion had the pad Thai - it's quite spicy so if that's not your thing, skip it.

Let's just say you have a Blackberry Pearl 8130 and the roller ball does not work anymore. Hypothetically, of course.

okYxDXHVZjwuh1mJSTIDuQ,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,LLOCKcFIKbeWmiyCGytBSg,4,9,5,7,"As if it wasn't obvious already, my favorite breakfast food is hash browns. Next on the list would be eggs, usually mixed together with my favorite shredded potatoes. If I can't have them together, I'll usually choose eggs on their own for how versatile they are. This is where Eggspectations comes in, a downtown Montreal brunch chain that specializes in all things eggs.

In spite of it's cheesy name, my expectations were high for Eggspectations. Packed with locals and tourists alike, the place is considered large for the establishments around here, yet there is almost always a wait. Best find what looks worthy on the menu before being seated since service and food can test one's patience on any hungry day.

The food hasn't disappointed so far. While I've had their breakfast eggs straight up (sunnyside up, over easy, scrambled) as noted in their regular platters, I'm much more a fan of their omelettes and eggs benedict, the latter of which has it's own section complete with all the benedict variety one could ask for. Favorites in that section include the florentine benedict (spinach, gruyere, hollandaise), breton benedict (crepes, ham, gruyere, hollandaise), and the boca raton (spinach, guacamole, gruyere, hollandaise). Most of the eggs are poached to perfection and the toppings make for a nice kick in the overall flavor, they just need more potatoes to soak up some of that yolk. 

Feel like going the traditional route? Try their regular platters and enjoy the egg-y names like the egg-chilada, (an ode to a Mexican eggs style i.e. huevos a la Mexicana), egg-stravaganza (french toast platter), oy-vegg (Jewish style breakfast), egg-CITEment (strawberry flambe + eggs), and many more creative naming schemes. What matters is the food is simple and certainly brunch fulfilling, even if there are few items under $10.

In the end, this place is just a glorified Denny's with a special emphasis on eggs. It would've been fitting for it to be a Canadian chain but I learned recently it's also in Virginia and Maryland (huh?). Chains are one thing, breakfast is another, but breakfast chains will almost always get a thumbs up in my book. Eggspectations gets my vote for a solid option in good ol Montreal.",2011-09-14 06:09:29

So I'll admit, I'm real keen on the 'other' Pho guys closer to W.T. Harris and Tryon. I've been generously visiting 'em for nearly a decade. So to give another place a try was challenging. It seems like a lot of places are offering the dish now and I hate it when it just becomes another thing that's thrown on the menu with little thought or respect for the process. Flamin Kitchen has Pho right on the front of the building, gotta be good right?

Ordering to-go, still got a sick girlfriend at home and the power of Pho can make anyone feel better. There isn't much to the dining area, but clean and bright. Nice, friendly hostess got me my food (which was ready 5 minutes early!) and I was off.

First off, lets talk about a quick technical detail: They give you a tall container with the pho broth and a soup bowl style container with the meats and noodles separately. I love the fact that this bowl is big enough for all of the broth! You would think it's a no brainer, but I've been to restaurants where I guess they assume you'll place everything in your own bowl. Not only does this dramatically cool down the food by putting it in a new vessel, but you're going to spill broth, no doubt! A nice touch for sure.

Pho itself, was borderline divine. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT forget to add the sriracha and the hoisin sauce! Rare beef sliced thin and flank steak had awesome texture. The beef meatballs, firm and savory. I'm a real fan of the tripe and tendon, you're missing out if you forego these yummy morsels. The broth had this fragrance that if the lid wasn't airtight, you'd pull over on the way home to drink it. Great onion and beef body with subtle licorice notes from star anise and a great pungency from the ginger. The sriracha rounds everything out so nicely, please don't skimp out on this!

They've got a whole menu to explore and judging from the broth, they know what they're doing! From Crawfish Boil to Bahn Mi to Viet-style smoothies and teas, I'm a believer and they've successfully broken me free from my one-pho ways!",2018-04-24 00:56:52

They don't have a designated dance floor, so you either have to dance in place or just forgo it all together. 
The bathrooms are pretty cool, but there's only 4 or 5 for both guys and girls, so that means there's usually a long line.  The bathroom doors frost over when locked and remain see-through when unlocked. So be careful to lock yours or everyone waiting outside will get a show.",2007-01-30 00:59:37

I've stayed at 5 star hotels on the strip who offer great views and world class customer experience and I've never had to deal with tasteless service as this place. 

Strike 1: High Deposit Fee for Locals. Upon check-in, I was greeted by a friendly guy who was extremely helpful. He completed his speech about my 2 night stay, hotel amenities, resort fee and deposit charge of $250 for the stay.  BUT the agent FAILED to mention AND highlight the the incidental deposit of $250 PER NIGHT as a local. (Note: Expedia & other third parties don't tell you there is a different deposit amount for locals. The actually Palms Place website says that locals have a higher deposit, but they don't specify it until you check-in). Its customary to have a deposit for approximately $50 to $100 a night, but my goodness, $250 per night?! I've stayed at 5 star properties located on the strip and I've never had to put $250 per night. I've also had experience working as a front desk agent, so I know my primary concern would be letting the customer know their total cost by breaking down each total. The agent did not mentioned my total amount.

Strike 2: Dirty Tiles and Walls. The room looked good from a distance, but you'll notice a lot of wrong things upon close inspection. There was dust every where in the room especially on the chairs. The glass windows and wooden walls had hand prints. As for the bathroom, there was grime and mildew developing between each tile closest to the standing shower and inside the standing shower. I also saw yellow stains in the jacuzzi tub.

Strike 3: Overcharged. I wanted to settle my bill the night before my departure. When I approached the front desk, a different front desk agent stated that my bill was $722. I asked her why and she insisted that it was because of the deposit that was charged to my account of $250 per NIGHT, resort fee, and room and tax. I told her I wasn't told that there was a nightly deposit of $250 because the original front desk agent said ""for the stay"" not ""per night,"" but in a rude tone she insisted that it was included in fine print. She was so focused on the ""Daily Deposit Fee"", she failed to realize that I was overcharged. After being rudely treated by the front desk agent, I went to my room to speak with a Room Reservation Rep who listened to my situation and forwarded me to her manager. The manager, Victoria, listened to my concerned and insisted that my bill was $722. I asked her to please break it down for me because if you are telling me that I should have only been charged a ""$500 deposit"" + resort fee + room for 2nd night & tax, then my amount should not have exceeded $700. Upon further review, she pointed out an error made by the agent who charged me an extra $100 and removed my resort fees for both nights (as they should). 

The room: It's modern and pretty, but I question the cleanliness of their rooms. I had a spectacular view of the strip on the 30th floor, but I was not at all comfortable during my stay.

The service: Needs major improvement. My experience with the front desk was sub par. In fact, the room reservation agent was more assisting and understanding than the agents scheduled in the front. The front desk agent who provided me the total on my bill was rude and snobbish as well as unconcerned about  customers. Had she taken an extra look at my bill to see what was wrong, I wouldn't have been so frustrated by the time I got a hold of a manager on the phone. Her carelessness and insincerity won't do their business well. As for the manager, I appreciate her patience and ability to analyze the situation to discover the discrepancy on my bill; however, they will be getting another phone call from me for any overdraft charges due to their carelessness. I also feel that removing my resorts fees (approximately $60 worth) did not adequately compensate the fact that I was overcharged and underserviced. 

Summary: I won't be coming back again nor will I recommend anyone visiting or wanting a ""staycation"" with this property because of my overall customer experience.",2015-03-18 07:43:16

No more mac n cheese side choice or fresh vegetables. No more grilled chicken dinner. Guess we won't be back and we are here 1-2 times a week and brought our business lunches here. I was the duchess guess someone else will be now. Can't believe it's been converted. Loved that it was close to home too. I can hear the people next to me complaining too.

My friend had the ox tail, something I'd never had nor had I ever really wanted, lol, but I tasted it & it was very yummy. For desert we shared a small coconut flan with citrus sauce.

Im not going to go dish by dish, but you should know that the presentation on each and every dish, especially the desserts, is the best I have ever seen! Perhaps I had built up my expectations too high, but the taste of most of the dishes was good, but nothing wowed me, especially for the price tag of about $900 each!

Service is where they really fell short.  While our waiter was on top of everything, the sommelier often poured our wine to taste with the food well after our dishes arrived.  Super high end places like this serve the food at a temperature to immediately eat and I hate cold food so this was a big miss on there part.  We finally complained after I had finished my main entrée and no wine had arrived until I was done with he plate. The head waiter did make an adjustment to the bill of about $100 but the annoyance clouded our view throughout the night.

- Replace the beer with a killer list of brown libations and seriously crafted cocktails.
- Replace the been there, done that, prettied up pub grub with in your face, up end, back yard BBQ.
- Toss in some rabbits in the decor (although there are none to eat on the menu).

In a word, yes.

Note:  This is social dining, order dishes in flights and share.

In general, flavors are very bold.  Sharp acidic contrast in flavors, spicy elements in dishes that will make you sweat, and underlying pleasant smoke throughout (hints of smoke permeate the restaurants so even if your dish doesn't have direct smoke flavor, you will still taste it).  Go for the bold.  You will be rewarded.

The octopus crostini exemplifies the style.  Loaded with tender slices of octopus, it is sat on a spicy, smoky roasted eggplant puree with bits of tart, pickled peppers and golden raisins.  Smack you in the face flavor that just works with any drink.

A ""board"" of wood grilled sausages packs a spicy punch, accented by grilled spicy peppers on a very acidic, tart, sauerkraut.  It sets your mouth on fire but the flavor of the individual sausages is impressive epically the merguez with its distinct lamb flavor and Northern African spice notes.

For larger plates, top props to the mesquite grilled whole branzino.  Blistered, charred skin adds a bitter component that makes the mildly sweet flesh of the fish come to life.  Flavors are boosted even further with a tangy olive and caper vinaigrette and slices of grilled lemon.  Very good.  

Steak lovers, it's all about the grilled wagyu skirt.  A great butchers cut, loaded with beefy flavor.  The smokiness brings out the sweetness.  A salsa verde enhances the natural metallic flavors of the beef.

Excellent cocktail program.  Well chosen list of craft cocktails backed up by a huge list of brown libations (there is a second high end bar in the back of the restaurant for those wanting to savor these treasures including the impossible to find Pappy's 20).  Typical resort markup.

Service is friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.

Maybe I've just been there so many times that I completely forgot to.  Jacks is the closest bar to my house.  I could throw a baseball and hit it if I wanted.  Needless to say, I go there frequently.  Mostly to drink.

They ALWAYS have a drink special and it's usually a pretty damn good one. The $2-3 beer special is what I go for most of the time.  It's an extremely cozy bar inside too.  Low ceiling, lots of TV's, unique decor, and a friendly bartender.  The bartenders here are always great from what I've experienced.

The food is pretty good considering, you know, you're at a bar.  I'd definitely consider it above average for a sports bar.  Check out the brunch though, it's a fun place to work off your hangover on Sunday morning.  The mimosas I had last time were on point and I'm picky on the amount of OJ some places will use.

They stated that the valve was broken and replaced it at no charge. We were super grateful, but the next day, she walked outside and her tire was flat again. She ended up going to a different tire place and they found a nail in the tire. In addition, they found that the prior tire sensor had been shoved into the tire which cause additional wear on the tire and put my sister and her family at risk of a another flat or blowout. THIS is not even what got me. The next day, my dad dropped by the tire store to let them know what had happened so they could coach the tech who did it, but the manager on duty told my dad that he was on duty yesterday and it was most certainly not the same Big O Tire location that it happened at.

Everyone knows Whisky as the classic uptown scene of the buff bouncer, the crowded club (but great for dancing!) and the high-priced drinks on the weekends. But have you been to the restaurant? 

I highly recommend the buffalo dip. Creamy and a good heat - nothing too spicy so perfect to share with anyone. The BBQ sliders are good. They are served only with onions and on every table are four Dale Jr BBQ sauces to try. I dig the gold, nice and sweet with a mesquite hint. If you go, might as well try them all though!

And hidden secret - ask for the mini pork tacos. Not on the regular menu, and can only be found on the happy hour menu, these mini tacos are served in a crispy wonton shell with pulled pork and topped with a slaw mix. Taste explosion in your mouth. Oooo and the pimento cheese balls! 

Only disappoint I've found are the salads... OK, OK, I know they are promoting themselves as a BBQ place, but I appreciate a good salad variety! I had the pulled chicken salad which was nothing special and the chicken was bland, no seasoning or marinade, which could have turned the whole salad around. 

And the service has always been friendly and helpful but at times quite slow. And seeing how I usually take my lunch hour to go to lunch, not always the best option.

I am a fan of Bibimbap Dolsot. If you are not familiar, it's a smokin' hot rock bowl full of rice, veggies, meat, and a raw egg.  The idea is that the rice gets nice and crispy from the hot rock, and the egg cooks through the mixture due to the heat.

I just wasn't impressed by their bibimbap offering here.  the egg was pre-fried before being added, there was very little meat (I had steak, gf had seafood (out of bag)) and the rice was relatively bland.  They did have a huuuge table ahead of us and perhaps that's why it was an off night.

The free sides were decent, however; we received 5 and most were tasty.  

One thing that did surprise me, and a reason that I may go back, is the sushi.  Not because it's the best sushi in Pittsburgh, but because it's decent, and for the price it's surprisingly good.

The noodle dishes don't come with fried rice though, but nonetheless you still get a lot of food for $5.95! Whatever dish we order or try, it always comes out delicious.

This place is also always so clean, people complain about the smell when they walk in. I've gotten used to it. But it is clean and you can sit anywhere. At least when they get health inspections, they always pass. Grand china always fails their health inspections. I wonder why? 

I also come here to get their taro boba. I love boba and theirs is just sweet and the boba is nice and chewy. Sometimes it can be a little 'too' sweet, so you might ask for less sweetness if you'd like.

It's a cute little bistro tucked on Baldwin Street, and we were craving the brunch food they serve.

The woman who greeted us was very nice and friendly and gave us a choice of seats, took our coats, and gave us menus. She came back soon with glasses of water. A very positive start! Unfortunately, that was the best it got at Caffe La Gaffe.

There were only a couple of other tables, not too bad. We smiled when our server came over, so I don't think we did anything to set her off. The word my husband used to describe her was surly. Apt description. 
She came over to the table and said ""do you know what you want?"" while scowling. She only half turned toward us while taking our orders, and when I passed her my menus, she looked me up and down and never looked at my face! I couldn't believe the rudeness. And it never improved from there.

I really would have given them a break if the food was better. Unfortunately, I had to pick the seeds out of my mimosa. I appreciate fresh squeezed o.j., but use a strainer for God's sakes. My first sip was chock full of seeds. As I didn't have a spoon or a side plate, I proceeded to pick the seeds out with a fork and pile them on the table. Final count? 14 seeds. Disgusting.

My eggs benedict were not much better. The first bite had an overpowering taste that did not belong. After picking it apart and analyzing each element, I realized the peameal bacon was sickeningly sweet, and the hollandaise sauce was way too lemony. The egg and english muffin were fine, but I barely ate it. The salad was delicious, however, and so were the homefries, and the toast that came with my husbands eggs, so I was able to make a meal of it.

There is absolutely no good reason to go to Cafe la Gaffe. The service was bad and the food was either really good or inedible. In a city with as many restaurants as Toronto, there is never a need to go to a bad one.",2009-11-21 19:43:53
NoYD0V-5vzemqMK0jZGZgg,djpMXOA1ic5wv3FPtubHNw,1dAKYE4NOY9XqnDqgRRgIw,2,11,4,5,"VIP is a decent pool hall located downtown near Yonge and Gerrard. As for as pool halls goes, this is a not too shabby joint and as far as rates go they're reasonable -cheaper than Rivoli if I remember correctly. There are plenty of pool tables around (good for groups!), drink service is quick and there's a jukebox for further entertainment. However the last time I was here-nobody was putting any money in so unfortunately our music selection for the evening went all over the map from Metallica to soft 80's ballads.

A wise tip to any pool goers here would be to avoid ordering food here, stick with the booze. Chicken wings and fries are nothing to sneeze at and they have the saddest plate of beef nachos! For $12.99 you get a tepid plate with tostitos, a meagre sprinkle of cheese, sour cream and dingy salsa and finally-what looks and tastes like some rank chopped up bits of hamburger patty. You'd be better off eating at the doner place up on the street. 

So yeah stay away from the food here and stick to the beer and pool playing.",2009-09-06 00:30:24

The good part is that every trip was great! I was really, really skeptical when my co-workers informed me of a ""good"" sushi joint in Anthem, so it took them a while to convince me to take a trip here. I'm definitely glad they did. 

What's different from other sushi restaurants is probably the most important. I like that they have several, really delicious, no-rice sushi options. Very cool for those that want to watch their carb intake (diabetics!). Also, this is a non-AYCE sushi joint. Not everyone's cup of tea, but I think that attributes to the freshness and quality of fish.

My favorite no-rice dishes are the Spring Mountain Roll (spicy soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, radish sprout, eel, wrapped in rice paper, topped with spicy mayo and sriracha) and the Screaming Orgasm (tuna sashimi or seared, lots of julienned daikon, sauces galore, tobbiko, green onions). The Spring Mountain Roll is probably my overall favorite sushi roll. The last time I was there, the chefs gave us a bowl of tempura jalapeño. Not something I would ever order, but they were so good! And not terribly spicy either. 

My only gripe was the terrible quality of the Ikura on my last visit. It was not good. But, to their defense, I hardly find really delicious Ikura or Uni in the valley. Other than that, it's just really busy during dinner. Service is usually pretty good, no complaints, but nothing amazing.  Overall, great place for a sushi fix!",2013-08-23 08:52:41

The menu rotates, but it seems that chicken tikka masala is always available for those who are spice averse. Today, they had fish curry, aloo channa, dal tarka, chicken biryani, malai veggies,and coconut chicken. If they have rice pilaf available that day instead of just rice, pay the extra quarter and get it. If you are unsure whether you will like a dish, ask for a taste before you order it. They are happy to accommodate. 

Chai is sporadically available and my coworkers swear by it, though I find it too sweet. Occasionally, they will have a dessert available - get it!

But one day, I was taking my dog home from the vet, where she just had surgery. My dog loves chicken, so I thought I would buy her some El Pollo Loco, as a special treat on her difficult day. I thought, if this location did not brown the skin properly (as was the case in the past), it be no big deal, because I would be removing the skin from the chicken anyway for the dog. When I got the chicken home, it was cooked perfectly, and the skinned browned properly. So i ate some of it, and it was great. But I was still leery in going to this location, because they have had good days in the past, only to be followed up on my next visit with undercooked chicken. Well, I tried it again a couple of weeks later, and the chicken was perfect once again. Then tried it a third time about a week later, and it was perfect again. I have now been there at least 15 times in the last year, and each time the chicken was cooked properly. So it looks like, whatever cooking problem they had in the past, has now been fixed. So I am going to give this location an upgrade to 4 stars.",2017-10-21 22:46:10

The selections on the carts are numerous and inexpensive.  And they don't just make the rounds once and disappear, they keep coming until you either explode or summon the willpower to say no.  I always eat too much at these places.  I can't say no to bbq pork buns, or bbq duck (they have these hanging in the front window for sale at reasonable prices if you're feeling the need.  I'm the only duck commander at my house so I usually have to pass, but they'll do 1/4 to the whole thing.  I'll be back).  I ate until I physically couldn't any more.  Everything from dumplings to shrimp toast to green beans to chicken feet-- if there's something you want, they have it on one of these carts rolling around.  And if you don't know what something is, they're happy to tell you.  This is super helpful if you're new to dim sum, or even if you've had it before but spot something new to try.  I just wish they'd cut me off before I need a bucket! Be prepared to wait a bit, but not too long to lose interest and move on.  Be prepared for an awesome meal and good service.  Our tab for two large mammals who ate to the point of misery was under $40, so its reasonably priced.  The only drawback is that they only do dim sum for lunch.

Not to epic, douche-like proportions, but let me say that Starbucks just can't cut it anymore. Since my return, I have been searching for coffee that is close to the crazy tastiness you get in each cup in Italy. So far, my search has proven to be fruitless...until I decided to spend a Saturday searching for coffee at the Venetian. I tried every coffee bar on the property and this one was by far the best -- and the closest to a real European coffee experience. 

I walked up to the bar and ordered 2 macchiato espressos. I love this place because you actually can stand and drink your coffee at the bar (the true Italian way). The barista was skilled and the coffee was the Illy brand, which is superior than anything else you can get in the U.S. in my opinion. Best of all, the coffee was served in a dainty little ceramic espresso cup. Paper cups piss me off and I like having my beverage in a REAL container. 

The coffee was good and was very close to what I had in Italy. It was rich with a slightly bitter coffee taste and a nice presentation. Smooth, hot and delicious. Of course, where I paid 90 cents for the same thing in Europe, here is cost a whopping $3.75 per cup (yikes)! And don't order ice water, they will only sell you bottled water for $2. 

I would recommend this place and it is definitely worth a trip to the Grand Canal Shoppes if you are a coffee lover. I cannot comment on the food since I only visited the coffee bar, but they had lots of takeaway yums and ginormous pastries. And pizza in the back too. There's also an adjacent sit-down restaurant but if you just need a java jolt, head into the market. The coffee bar is to the right, right up at the entrance. If you prefer to sit to drink your coffee there are a few tables out in the ""canal"" shopping area.",2012-06-19 00:55:02

It was indeed, great things that we shared on a Sunday night. Hobak Korean BBQ is a popular KBBQ chain from Korea that made its arrival in Las Vegas just few weeks ago. Hobak definitely set the bar high and is easily my top favorite for kbbq. 

Lots of banchan offered just like any other kbbq. I'm usually not a fan of banchan at other places because they are usually bland and flavorless. I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed all the banchan here. We got the set menu which was for 3-4 people. It was little bit less than $100 and came with brisket, boneless short ribs and skirt steak, along with two desserts (green tea/vanilla ice creams). 

Brisket is always my favorite and brisket here exceeded my expectation. Quality was like no other, perfect cut and super juicy. They offer two sauce options, the Hobak sauce (soy sauce + vinegar?) and salt. Server recommended me to dip the brisket in Hobak sauce, then to eat it with their vinegar rice. Please do, because it was the best I've had.

Boneless short rib was also good. Amazing marbling and was tender and juicy. Skirt steak was marinated and again, melt in your mouth tender. 

Lastly, their green tea and vanilla ice cream. It is ice cream sandwich and reminded me of Japanese monaca ice cream I used to eat all the time. 

Server we had was Andrea and she was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. I can see myself coming back here again and again. Believe the hype.",2016-04-18 03:08:47

First of all, I have to tell you, I'm not a foo foo, girly, tea and crumpets type person.  And, to top it off, I don't really like tea!! I  prefer coffee with lots of cream and sugar so it tastes like syrup! 

I have gone to a ""tea party"" at one of those foo foo tea places, and it wasn't for me.  The cups were pretty, but I don't wear gloves and boas, and plus, those little cucumber sandwiches may be cute, but they leave me hungry!  Hey I grew up on a farm where we ate meat and potatoes every day!  

Anyway, The Urban Tea Loft is not like any tea establishment you have ever been to.  It's more like a modern bistro or restaurant bar, similar to a Bamboo Club, or Ra or something like that.  It's decorated modern and elegant and comfortable for both men and women to visit.

It is owned and run by a lovely couple.  Glynnis has a miraculous story of which she so kindly shared with us.  Her husband Eric isn't much of a server, or so he said, but he sure knows how to recommend chocolate cake!  I almost foundered in it it was so rich and delicious, I couldn't eat the whole piece!

Some of our party had fondue, others had red pepper hummus, or salads, another had chicken pot pie.  Every meal that came out was fresh, plentiful, and dare I say, healthy!?  I had already eaten dinner but I tried the hummus and it was delightful!  Just the right amount of flavor, fresh and creamy, served with pita triangles and fresh cucumbers!    All of the food was beautifully presented too!

What I also liked about the Urban Tea Loft was that they have two private rooms.  One is called the VIP room, luxurious, intimate, leather seating, warm, inviting colors, comfortable surrounds, great for a private party.  Seated about 12 or so.  The other room called the AV room, seated over 20, had a private bar, LCD TV which hooks up to your computer and a long conference table; a very private comfortable place for a business meeting, or family dinner.

Lastly, I have to talk about the tea. Since I'm not a tea drinker I was skeptical, because it all tastes the same to me.  But I had a berry tea which was quite refreshing.  Not too strong, but not too weak.  And me being the sugar fanatic I am, I didn't even need to put sugar in because it was naturally sweet!

Anyway, what a treasure of a find in downtown Chandler!  If you haven't gone there, you should!

""Hey, when is last time you ate at Jason's Deli?"" Neither of us could remember. But I do remember that the food was pretty good. Upon entering, we were the only two people on the entire deli. We got really lucky, or the food was not going to be good. I ordered a pastrami sandwich and my friend ordered a roast beef sandwich. Before long, the entire restaurant was filled and there was only about three empty seats. After about 15 minutes, people started receiving their food. I found that kind of odd, since we were the first ones in there and ordered a long time ago. I went to where that sandwich pick up area was, and they quickly apologized and said our food Would be right out. After another 5 minutes, we did receive our food. I asked them why it took so long and they just apologize and asked us if we wanted a free cookie. I said sure, I'll take two! About 30 seconds later, another gentleman came by and profusely apologize for the delay in food. By then, I had already eaten a quarter of my pastrami sandwich. It was incredibly delicious. After making some small talk, I found out this gentleman was actually the district manager. Long story short he made up for the delay in the sandwiches. Getting back to my pastrami sandwich, the meat was tender, not too fatty, and very well flavored. The sauerkraut and dressing was a great addition along with the bread. I would've preferred the bread to be a little bit more toasted, however that's my personal preference, overall it was fantastic. My friend had never had a pastrami sandwich before so I offered him a bite of mine. I thought to myself, ""who has never had a pastrami sandwich?"" Anyway, he found it delicious also.

OK, so be ready to wait in a long that goes alllll the way to the patio if you come during lunch time... not too slow of a line, but still enough to drive me away or just make me plan on coming earlier than 12.

Their staff here changes a lot so I can't really speak for any of them as far as their friendliness or quickness, but overall, when you've ordered, they are pretty damn quick at getting you out.. which is very helpful when you dont' want to kill a whole hour for work lunch.

I would say that my only complaint is the 'natural' claims on their proteins.. this is not always the case and rarely do they actually post the signs that say ""sorry, we have conventional X/Y/Z"".  I totally understand that the good stuff runs out but I'm pretty sure it happens often, so when I don't see the sign often, I'm sure they're just not putting it up when they should.

But Chipotle is a great option for people looking to have a more healthy eating experience..

Had a few customer service issues redeeming my deal, mostly pertaining to the receipt- face value of my deal was for $18, yet I only received credit for $15.36 and somehow owed about $2. Employees were unable or unwilling to explain why the transaction happened this way.

In any case, the food was fairly tasty.
Beef tagine seems to be a frequent special, and it smells amazing. Taste isn't quite as delicious as the smell though, but I did appreciate that the dish was served on a bed of rice and with a drink (though they didn't give me mine). Beef itself is on the dry side, but it's a saucy dish so it did not ruin the meal.
The chicken shwarma salad is decent: moist chicken and fresh veggies, but a bit too much rice for my liking turned it into more of a bowl. Tahini dressing was on the bland side and slightly chalky. They charge 50 cents to add a tablespoon of feta to your dish- and they literally measure out it with a spoon, which is bizarre and stingy to me.

I wouldn't hurry to rush back, largely because of their lack of transparency with billing, but there are so many other places that do Mediterranean in Vegas that I'd rather try another. I can say though, if you are craving beef tagine specifically, this place will probably hit the spot- flavors are correct, but hope it was just an off day for the meat.",2014-04-30 04:26:24

There's nothing special about the restaurant. I have nothing to rave about or say that it tastes super amazing. It's normal Chinese food- nothing spectacular. I went with a group of a total of 6 people. Now since we had a lot of people, we ordered a ton of food. Now, on it's own, each dish was not terribly spicy. With the combined dishes, the food was spicy! 

Before we ordered, they served a complimentary spicy cabbage (raddish) dish. We ordered, shang hai dumplings, cold rabbit dish, hot and sour seafood soup, lamb with cumin, mapo tofu, string beans, szechuan pepercorn fish, chicken with a spicy garlic sauce, and  a shortrib dish. 

The rabbit dish had a large amount of peanuts, and the dish was rather small. It was suppose to be a cold dish, but it was more lukewarm. I think they brought us the wrong soup because it wasn't hot and sour at all. But we drank the soup already, so what can be done. The shanghai dumplings were in a mini pie tin. It was annoying to take them out of the tin. The spicy garlic chicken was delicious. The mapo tofu wasn't the same flavor that I was used to, but I liked it. It was really spicy and the tofu was so soft that it melted in my mouth. They didn't have any pork in it. 

They took forever to bring out food out. It literally took at least 30-40 minutes before they brought out the first dish. What's strange, though, is that they waited to bring everything out all at once. They brought all the dishes, and there wasn't any room on the table. Isn't it typical to bring out each dish as it's ready. And isn't it typical to bring the soup at way earlier? As a result, some of our dishes weren't as hot as they could be. The food was all okay. There wasn't anything special like this is the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas or anything.

I'm also a big fan of using Square App to process credit cards because they email you a receipt instead of waste paper. I've only ever been for coffee on Sunday mornings to study, work, and read. However they do have a lunch snack option and serve wine and craft beer.

Restaurant presentation alone gets me so excited. Service is also on point. Food was just ok for me. Maybe it was so hyped up, but it was so so. I spent more here than Mastros the night before and did not enjoy it as much. We started with the highly recommended tomato soup dumplings - delicious as you would imagine, but not something I would order again due to the price. Next we had the chicken meatballs- just so so. I was hoping for more flavors. Then we had the filet, which was super tender but again the flavor in the meat alone was just ok. They did provide roasted garlic and a few sauces, which made it more tasteful. We decided to try the Caesar toast and the pasta last minute. The chicken skin crumbles on the toast made the dish. I personally don't like the focaccia bread. Seems a little dense but I also understand it needs to be stiff enough for the food. The pasta was just so so as well. The pasta was not quite al dente. The chorizo was flavorful with hint of spicy. Overall, I still enjoyed my experience. I may just wait a few more years to come back again.",2017-10-22 22:07:48

This shop came with glowing reviews from Yelp and my brother-in-law who is very hard to please. I was recently rear ended and the other person's insurance was taking care of the repairs and rental car. The experience started out good. Last Wednesday, I came in for an estimate for a repair on my rear bumper. They told me it would be $567 and I told them I had to contact the insurance to make sure we were all good. I told the insurance company that I would drop the car off on Monday morning and was told that an estimator from the insurance company would go out to the shop to quote the job. I called ABC back and set up a drop off for Monday morning and told them that the estimator would stop by sometime that day.

Monday morning rolls around and I am there at 8:00 sharp when they open. The front door is open and no one is inside but there is a guy working in the garage who gives me 2 pieces of paper to fill out, 1) Authorization to let ABC do work & 2) Contact information and a box where I checked that insurance would be paying for the repair. I fill everything out and let the guy know I left my keys with the paperwork. He says all good and I leave.

Later that day, I call to see if the estimator had come and the lady at ABC tells me we have a problem. Apparently their people did not read the paperwork and were near complete with the repair by the time the estimator got there so now I have to pay them to get my car. I said ok, let me talk to the insurance. I talk it over with my insurance and they say it should be fine, they are waiting for the report from the estimator but the amount seemed ok and there shouldn't be a problem. I asked if they could release the payment directly to the shop and they said OK.

So, I call ABC back with the good news that they will receive payment from State Farm for the repairs, and the lady says ""Great, as soon as we get the check we will release the car."" I say what does that mean and she says they won't release the car unless they get paid in full. I say so you want me to come out of pocket for something that was not my fault. She says it's ""a law"" that they can't release the car. I inform her that this problem was all cause by their people and she said it was because I signed the authorization for them to work on my car. I said you would have needed that paper either way, she agreed. I said, ""Didn't I also signed a paper that said insurance would be paying for the repair?"" She said ""Yes"" but still wasn't budging. She said they just needed to get paid. I asked how this is normally handled, and she says ""well normally the estimator could cut the check at the inspection but in this case it was too late because they had already done the repairs"". Again not my fault because they didn't read their paperwork or make notes on the repair, but still no budge. So I said let me see if the insurance can send the estimator out again to cut a check.

Talk to the insurance and ask if they can send the estimator out again with a check and they say nope, it doesn't work that way. In addition, insurance informs me that the rental car that I was given would only be covered until the repairs were done, which would be the next day - meaning I would be without a car for at least a week if the shop had to wait for a check to arrive. Luckily everyone involved in the initial accident had State Farm insurance so at this point I have to get my personal agent involved to see who is telling the truth on what because I don't believe this is at all my problem and my car is being held hostage for an accident and repair that wasn't even my fault.

So after a few more phone calls, my agent calls me and says they told the shop a check would be cut, and it would be sent to them but... no budge. Finally the agent asks if it's ok for me to front the charge to get my car and I will be reimbursed promptly for the full cost of the repair. At this point, I have no recourse. I figure I'll charge it and pay the credit card with the check before I get the bill. The next day (today) I head over to pick up the car. The lady asks if I got everything squared away with my insurance, like she even really cared. ""Yeah,"" I responded, ""we settled that I have to come out of pocket for your mistake."" She asks ""Debit or credit."" I say credit and hand over the card and of course ""We don't take AMEX"". So my only other card is my debit card so now I'm out almost $600 waiting for a check from the insurance all because this shop can't read their own paperwork, and won't own up to their own mistakes. 

The only reason for the 2nd star was because it looks like they washed the car inside and out. Yay.",2016-04-06 00:50:04

It's not often that I come across a restaurant that hits so many elements that create an amazing experience for me. Usually I settle for one or two of the 5 things I look for and choose to be happy with that. For me personally my experience last night at Sparrow + wolf is worthy of an explanation.

Location: Center of town and easy to get to from anywhere with tons of parking = No stress getting there or leading up to walking in.

First Impression: Room is gorgeous, Music choice and volume is instantly noticeable and pleasant and the instant view of kitchen and staff working has a good vibe.
Bar Stools: Are comfortable AF with nice backrest and arms. As someone who loves to sit at the bar for a drink and a couple appetizers THANK YOU!!!

Menu: This is as close to a dream menu that I could have imagined or have come across. Last time I saw a menu that made me this happy was at The Eddy in NYC. Not to many choices to choose from and every dish seemed to be a signature item like the Udon Lam Sausage, Chinatown Clams Casino (Favorite Dish) and the Beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings. Cocktails were also amazing and I found my new favorite spirit which was like a 100% Agave Gin.

Staff: I ate at the bar last night so this is about the bartenders mostly and they were on point. Sara and Cody were attentive, aware and focused on guest experience. They were also knowledgable and passionate about the food and drinks they were about to serve our group of 5 at the bar. The food runners and bussers also did a great job because the food was delivered and cleared seamlessly. Obviously the back of house killed it because everything I ate was stupid good.

Congratulations Chef Brian Howard, Chef Justin Kingsley Hall and GM John Anthony for everything it must have taken from patience to passion to bring all these elements together. What a gift it is for this community to have an establishment like this available to us and thank you to the entire Sparrow + wolf team.

To be clear...I am a fan FOR BREAKFAST BUFFET ($8.99 if you have an A-play card)

A-Play card takes about 5 minutes to get...look for the signs or ask security 

I wondered in about 4 years ago on one of my walk abouts in Vegas.  I walk early in the morning and the buffet opens at 7am.  Learned quickly about the card discount and the buffet is varied and extensive with endless coffee/non-alcohol drinks.

I tend to eat healthier and they can accommodate that.  Started with various sliced fruit and had eggs with some baked ham (sliced) ,  They had chicken fried steak, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy, breakfast tacos, various kinds of potato etc etc etc.

Take your time, eat slow...enjoy...its upstairs off escalator on 2nd floor.

Not a huge deal for me but it definitely would be for my husband. 

I got the shrimp tacos with no beans and extra rice. It was $11. I asked for the crema sauce on the side since I can't have a lot of dairy. The waitress was fine with that and even repeated it back to me. About 10 mins later she serves our food and the crema sauce was all over the shrimp tacos. Annoying but I didn't complain because I didn't want my friend waiting. My $11 shrimp tacos were chopped up shrimp. They weren't even full shrimp. My rice was a small portion for what it was.

I  booked my table a week ago to have a business lunch with a colleague. When I arrived I was disappointed to see that I was sat at quite literally the last table in the restaurant  we were in what felt like a long corridor, and while the front of the restaurant was bustling, we were in the back where it was empty and dead. 

The food - so disappointing. As a vegetarian I didnt see a lot of options, so I had the grilled cheese without bacon with the tomato soup. 
While the soup was tasty enough, the grilled cheese was incredibly average - Ive actually had a better grilled cheese at the Blackfoot diner! 
In general all the food that I saw going past  us  was decidedly small - small portions and expensive. 

The service was slow - we waited approx 10 minutes to have our order taken, and when you are clearly there during your lunch hour - unacceptable. 
Its a shame as Belgo looked promising.

The service here was rock-solid: the waitress actually cooked ALL of our meat and we didn't have to lift the tongs once! And at the end of the meal, the waitress fried kimchi and rice on the grill and we had that to eat as well. 

Second time eating here was as delicious as the first although I was a little sad we didn't get the perks of someone cooking our food and we didn't get that kimchi rice dish at the end either.  We had a party of 9 and had to sit at 2 separate tables because they couldn't be moved. Ordered the same combo platter x2.

I usually base my reviews almost completely on the food, but Artisano loses a full star for being completely disorganized. The system seems to be set up pretty well:

1. Wait in line to make your order
2. Take a buzzer
3a. If you're taking out, wait for it to buzz and pick up your food at the back
3b. If you're sitting in, stay at your table and they'll find you

The problem is that the cashiers are extremely slow and can't seem to find any items on the computer. Then the kitchen at the back seems to have only one panini press, so if there are multiple sandwich orders you'll be waiting a while. How often are there multiple sandwich orders? ALWAYS because that's pretty much ALL they serve (plus pizza).

As for the food, it's decent.

For lunch I had the grilled chipotle chicken with avocado sandwich. Good bread, fresh ingredients, a solid sandwich when you're looking for something simple and tasty.

For dinner my date and I split the Hawaiian and Chicken, Brie, & Goat Cheese pizzas. They're a little small with too much fluffy crust for my liking, but (again) the ingredients were fresh.

I ordered online with 7 other co-workers; which is a great feature their website and one you should DEFINITELY take advantage of no matter how small or large your group may be. Otherwise, get ready to WAIT. Seriously. The line was capital E - Epic and the atmosphere was chaotic to match.  I will say this - their online ordering system was down today, so the pick-up of our order was a little messy.  But the manager eventually made good on all of our orders, so I'm going to let it go.

Our selections ranged from my own Bangkok Curry to a couple of Pad Thais, a salad and a few Italian noodle dishes thrown in for good measure.  Out of 10, the highest rating my co-workers gave to their own respective dishes was 8 and the lowest 6; though after further thought I might change my 6 to a 5.  My Bangkok Curry was totally fine.  Fresh broccoli, well-cooked noodles, but lacking in spice. Just nothing special and now I smell like an onion.  Definitely not worth waiting in that insane line for (even though I didn't, as an online orderer), but worth it enough to pay $5 for.

It sucks that I have to drive all the way down to Chandler just to drink some (unless there's one that's open at the Chinese Cultural Center that I don't know about -- * note to self *). 

I've been a big fan of boba for ages - going out of my way cross-town in San Francisco to my favorite joint in the inner Richmond District, getting a custard, Thai iced tea, watermelon or red bean slush packed to the gills with tapioca pearls. Moving to a city (Phoenix) where the population isn't at least 40% Asian means boba is just a tad more scarce. 

Boba Tea House has a giant drink menu - several different kinds of milk teas, slushes, juices, and snows that you can have with or without the boba. But if you don't want boba, why even bother coming here? 

Since my tolerance to things dairy took a nosedive a few years back, I've been limited to what I can have when I'm jonesing for this stuff. And since slushes are basically juices and/or flavors blended with ice, I stick to this column on the menu. Which is all good, because this joint makes a great, refreshing watermelon slush as well as a tasty chocolate mint one. Word to the wise, though - sometimes the slush gets stuck in the straw, and if you inhale a little too strongly you might find yourself choking on a couple tapioca balls.

Therefore, do not attempt this while driving, or you will have the Mesa cops on your ass in no time.

Perfectly cooked all around and with that gooey eggy goodness that makes things messy. It's that blurry line between annoying and satisfying.

We were in and out within an hour, went for happy hour (3pm-5pm). We parked in the private pay lot right next to the restaurant and for an hour it was only $3.  We walked in through the busy patio which was very well done, super cute. We chose to eat inside - nice interior also and we were seated right away. The pizzas were on special for $5 with a choice of about 6 varieties to choose from. We had a ham and pineapple and the mushroom and cheese. By far the tangy red sauce on the Hawaiian just made it better than the mushroom one (no red sauce so it was quite bland but totally edible). Loved the crust on these pizzas. We decided we liked this pizza far better than Pucinella's and Unas. On par we would say, with Famoso. There was love put into making these thin crust zas and the price could not be beat. We got 2 and were allowed to take the leftovers home. You can ask for chili oil too and it was for sure oily but in no way spicy, sadly.
Beer was on sale for $4 and red or white for $5 a glass. I tried the red and it was not bad at all. Italian of course!
Service was not as good as the food. It is very casual, some would say not so professional but we have had way worse.
One thing I would change is if you are going to give out the same paper menus over and over to people (they were so dirty), maybe laminate them! Would make a huge diff.

Our party of 4 was their for their very first brunch service ever, in fact, we were the second table to be seated... EVER!

Our table was evenly split between orders of the frog legs and waffles, and the green eggs and ham (duck egg ouef mollet).

Both dishes were very creative, presented nicely, and most importantly, tasted great! The frog legs were perfectly seasoned and, in my opinion, tasted better than most chicken and waffles. 

The only criticism our group had was that all four of our dishes weren't very hot. Our waffles were barely warm, and the green eggs were literally cold. I'm not sure if the eggs were supposed to be cold or not, but the waffles I know definitely shouldn't have been.

However, since this was only the 2nd table the kitchen had ever served, I'm going to assume this was just due to them ironing out the kinks and give them the full 4 stars I think they likely would've gotten with a bit more experience.

- Bring cash. A lot of the beer vendors are cash only and the ATMs here charge $2.50 to pull money out. Food spots take card. 

- Arrive early and possible leave early. If the game is a blowout, either way, leave early. Depending on how full the game is the traffic here can be insane.

- Have fun! Don't be that guy or girl who gets wasted and ruins the fun everyone.

It is such an improvement over the former Magnus (both the South American and Scandinavian incarnations). So many things to love about the menu...Cesar salad with fresh anchovies (not oil packed), seaweed slaw, shrimp po' boy, lobster roll, fish & corn chowder, raw bar, oysters, fresh Lake Michigan white fish, whole red snapper, exceptional French fries...I have never had a dish I did not like. Even the little touches, like house-made tartar sauce, are spot on.  For those who need meat, the Tempest burger and steaks are just as amazing as the fish. 

The bar makes solid, quality cocktails - not craft cocktails, but well executed. The wine menu is short, but well considered with plenty of options that are appropriate for the food. You can come for drinks only in the bar and listen to live jazz some nights. The bar is uniquely modern with green glass and purple stained glass windows. 

Service has always been friendly and attentive, appropriate for a restaurant in this price range. Like most restaurants in Madison, customers dress in levels of attire that range from casual (for men, jeans/collared shirt/leather shoes) to suit/tie. In summer, there is outside seating where I have seen people in a smart shorts outfit. They have a private room that can seat 36 for dinner or 50 for standing event. 

One complaint...the acoustics are challenging, creating a noise level that can be an issue for some. If you have good hearing and can easily separate conversation from background noise, you will be fine. If not...when the music stops for a brief moment, the guests seem to stop talking in unison and you can get in a quick word!!!",2017-03-13 01:11:27

Wife and I like to check yelp for places to eat around us and I refuse to go any place that has less then 4 stars. Thanks to yelp and the reviews of naked bbq I now found my favorite place for bbq. 

Walked in and they was about to close soon. Customer service was amazing they explained what they had and allowed me to try what I wanted to so I could pick out what meats I wanted. 

I got 2 meat platter with 2 sides. 
Pulled pork, Brisket, Mac and cheese, and potatoe salad. All of the above was great and I was stuffed by the time I finished it all. 

Wife got pulled pork, links, Mac and cheese, and potatoes. 

Luckily she was full before eating all her links so I could try them, now I know I want that on my next trip to naked bbq.

The only reason they are only getting 4 stars is that the coconut rice is too mushy for me, I would give this place 4.5 stars out of 5. I prefer the jasmine rice. I overheard the girl at the counter explaining to new staff what coconut rice was and I think the rice is mushy because they cook jasmine rice and then pour coconut milk in to finish it off just before it finishes cooking, that sounds like too much liquid for the rice to me. So far I've had the tukky sticks, green curry chicken, and Kra Prao Beef (The Flames on the menu). The dishes come out freshly prepared and piping hot. The food has a nice spicy kick to it without being overpowering and if you like it really spicy they are happy to bring the heat up a couple of notches.
This is definitely fast-food Thai as the tables and chars are large and meant to allow people to have somewhere to sit and eat and they seat between 8-10 people. There is one small table tucked in next to the tuk tuk. The chairs are more bar stools and the tables more like counters. The packaging is definitely eye catching and whether you stay or take-out your main dishes come packaged in cardboard containers that fold into a flower. 
The flavours are fresh and authentic and I could smell the basil gently wafting through the hole of my flower box. Fresh and fast is what Tuk Tuk Thai is about. Prices are reasonable. There is always some pre-made papaya and mango salads as well as the Thai version of salad rolls waiting in the cooler ready to go.

My favourite was this condensed milk and roasted soy bean butter (kind of like peanut butter but nut free). It was 36 degrees outside when I was there so I added a couple scoops of coconut icecream which really helped cool me down!

Reservations were made 30 minutes ahead and we arrived at the agreed appointed time yet even in a half full restaurant our table was not ready. We waited ten minutes and a few of us gravitated to the bar. The bartender was pretty efficient and had a great attitude. He was having fun and still did his job well.

Once seated everyone mentioned the wobbly chairs and surprise the restaurant wasn't full. We sat for awhile and chatted about the day. Drink orders were taken and before they were delivered to the table our server tried to get our brunch orders, The only problem with that is we had yet to see a menu.

Our server seemed kind and polite, but very stressed out. she was often seen ""running"" around the dining room. Orders were taken and food delivered, and that's where my true disappointment set in, my lunch just wasn't very good. It was a salad that was just lackluster. honestly this could have easily been served next door a Denny's. The salad was also missing promised menu items like ranch and cheese. It appeared that sour cream was subbed for the ranch. Sorry, I don't send food back ever, and I was starving so I dug in. it was really just OK.

dJ8nD0dQRHlXCeKWgDNwcQ,xyZTBonmmlLVCfGKkRZ8pw,1Gn3uBluQgNc_G5ExF3gHQ,1,1,0,0,"Update on my experience with Peoria Ford. 

Minutes ago, I received my fifth call in five months from a salesman wanting to know if I was interested in trading in my 2014 Mustang GT for a newer model. For the FIFTH TIME, I explained that I no longer own the 2014; I bought a 2017 Mustang from Peoria Ford on February 28. And for the FIFTH TIME, I requested that they update their records. Stop calling me!

In addition, last month I took in the 2017 for my free oil change, which ended up costing me over $500. First of all, one of my tires was low. I had known that, a week after I'd bought the car, when I was playing around with the computer; however, since I hadn't brought that to their attention, on the day I'd bought it (and of course, who would check tire pressure on the day of purchase?), it became MY problem. They told me that the tire had a nail in it and couldn't be repaired, so they charged me for a new one. 

Then they couldn't remove the tire because there was no lug nut lock for it. I've never taken anything out of the car, so it was never put in my console or glove compartment; hence, I had to purchase a new lock and lug nuts for all four tires. (The missing lock doesn't surprise me; as I stated in my previous review, the owner's manual was missing, too.)

Finally, I purchased a spare tire and inflation kit. I know that the missing spare tire isn't Peoria Ford's fault because quite a few American cars nowadays are not equipped with spare tires, but come on, Ford Motor Company, stop being so cheap!

ginXl9fSApUhhlMs23bfGw,TOexoXiiTWyhJ76UfJ1J5w,Grr2wJ3nYD_7qUyespDglA,4,0,1,0,"Located in the Entertainment District.  It's a nice cozy place to get some Italian and Greek eats.  They got burgers, souvlaki, gyros, and of course meat ball based foods.  The store's front sign actually says: WE GOT BALLS! right underneath Corrado's. So be on the lookout for this double entendre.

As you enter in, it will definitely transport you back to the early 1990s by which I don't mean you will  actually travel back in time and hear Tetris noises and Kurt Cobain screaming, but rather because of the retro 1990s interior decor and menu style fonts displayed above the ordering counter which is not a bad thing at all.  The only thing reminding you that you haven't traveled back in time is the TV in the dining area with the news on.   

I have gone to this place a few times already and it has always been beyond satisfactory.  Their chicken souvlaki and crispy fries are great.  The owner/chef is kind and courteous.  Definitely a place to stop for lunch, dinner, or whenever time of the day you are hungover.",2017-03-12 03:31:55
aHif3LJkjoCI1noqoi2nqA,_w22R_jg5Y2SEii3ioYGWQ,F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,5,9,1,4,"I have been to Momocho more times than I can count...each time my experience has been quite awesome. I have been here for dinner, happy hour, appetizers, and just drinks.  

I have never made a reservation for this place and have never had an issue getting in, sometimes we've had to eat at the bar, but I really have no problems with that. Even though I have never had issues getting in (I live just a few houses away and usually only go in the middle of the week to avoid the crowds) I would still recommend making a reservation if your heart is set on eating here.  Living close by, I have seen lines to get in before they even open on Friday and Saturday nights.

When you go here, you have to order the guacamole and margaritas, so very good. I think I have had almost all of their guacamole's and tasted all of their margaritas. You really can't go wrong with any of the choices, but my favorites are- Guacamole- goat cheese; gouda; and crab (these are the main ingredients in each one, they do contain other delicious flavors). This comes with a big basket of house made tortilla chips, perfectly cooked and salted. You will not be able to stop eating these. The margaritas - Red bell pepper, spicy mango and the cucumber, each come with a spicy pepper salt rim and a perfectly spicy taste. The guacamole and margaritas are also served as samplers, you can choose three different kinds and taste more than one flavor. (Singles approx. $8; samplers approx $15).

My usual dishes are the carnitas (pork), machaca (beef brisket) and tinga (grilled chicken skewers). These are also my favorites. The machaca can be a little on the salty side, but still delicious. These all come with tiny corn tortillas and two sauces on the side, a green tomatillo and an additional sauce specific for each dish. Carnitas has a honey-chile chipotle sauce that I want to just drink straight from the bowl, machaca has a side of the traditional guacamole and the chicken has their house made pico de gallo. (Approx. $15 per dish)

Definitely try to come here if you haven't already, or visit their other location in Lakewood (El Carnicero), also great food and a little more variety (they have tamales).

Just remember this is not traditional Mexican food, it's Mod-Mex...Equally delicious, just a little different than traditional.

Also this isn't the cheapest of places to eat.  When we come for a full course, margaritas, guacamole and dinner it is definitely for a special occasion. Otherwise we stop by for happy hour, a couple drinks and a guacamole.",2015-01-30 00:39:39

ltKmTqgJJb3vsAraF1CF-w,fhNSa1szPhXYvtcGzPXLiw,-zo0R_6vW6JlJeoX2GHA-w,3,0,0,0,"A couple of weeks ago we headed out to Milestones Bar and Grill to get some chow.  We frequent the one in Scarborough quite often however this was the first time I had been to the one located on Yonge Streeet.  When we got there, we noticed that it was actually a two-floor restaurant.  The bar for the most part was located on the lower floor while diners could eat in the upstairs.

We got there roughly around 7:00pm that evening and the place was pretty busy.  The waiter was pretty good in that he had prepared the place for not one but two kids and the other kid had come in on his stroller.  He gave us the menus and we proceeded to order off the menu.  For this evening, the six of us went to share their signature Famous Hot Spinach and Artichoke Dip and I decided to go with their new Crispy Haddock and Frites.

 I was actually looking forward to the meal however about 5 minutes in, the waiter came back and told me that they had sold on the haddock.  A little disappointed, I went and ordered their other new product the Fire-Grilled Salmon.  Thinking that I had finally settled down on the meal, the waiter once again came back and told me that the special rice it came with actually was all gone and asked if me if I was willing to settle for some white jasmine rice instead.  Although there were other options given, I settled for the rice wondering if this would be the last change that was going to be made.

The nachos arrived first and it looked pretty good.  The dip itself was nice and creamy and the nachos were nice and hot and crispy.  Of note, rather than giving us potato nachos, they actually served us with sweet potato chips instead.  The hot spinach was not spicy hot at all and the whole dish was actually a nice dish to start off with for everyone involved including the kids. 

My fire-grilled salmon arrived soon afterwards and I could tell it looked for a better lack of word, unattractive.  Taste wise it was exactly as it looked, quite plain.  I actually thought the salmon was way too dry and with the white rice staring at you and with no real sauce to really mix the rice and salmon together, I thought overall it was a healthy dish to have but not really worth the price to sit down and have.  On the contrary, my friend ordered the Chili Crusted Tilapia and this was very, very good.  My wife herself actually ordered The Slow-Roasted AAA Prime Rib AAA and that too was also acceptable and very juicy.   The waiter did not really offer me a second choice so I was stuck with the salmon and rice.  He did offer an explanation in that the ice storm and lack of electricity the week before depleted some of their supplies.  Although that may very well have been the case, there are numerous ways where one can mix the rice and salmon together and make it very juicy and tasty.  The meal they served was so plain that I didn't even bother taking a picture of it.

The staff was quite nice to us and coming from Toronto, I could understand some of the challenges that they have faced especially in light of the recent lack of electricity in parts of the city.  However having said that, I expected a little creativity especially if one is offering me different choices outside of what was on their menu.  Just serving me white rice and a slab of salmon was about as simple as it could be and they still charged me $24.00 for it.  I'm not usually one to complain to the staff as I always say how you serve it the first time especially in the restaurant business should already be your best shot.  One should never let the customer dictate what is good and what is not.  Honestly, if you ever try Milestones, go with some of their other dishes as they seem to be more acceptable and more bang for your buck.  If you had what I had, you will wonder why you left the house in the first place.",2017-02-15 01:46:11

They had different sections (sushi, salad, hibachi, Chinese, dessert) so there were tons of options but not as tasty as I'd like in any of the sections.  They did have crab legs (plus) and other seafood dishes but the sushi was a downer - no sashimi pieces and none of my standard favorites (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, unagi).

They have a salad table, the cheese and basa were not bad. Gives you a break from the meat.

Each table have a paper button to tell the waiter to continue to serve or to slow down depending on which side you flip.

Every time when the waiter comes, you have to have your tongs ready to pick up the meat. They give you small tongs, so it took me half the meal to adjust. One thing I don't like is if there is a type of meat, maybe you had it five minutes ago, they just end up serving the table beside you. Anyways, some cut of the meat were better than others such as the one with the Parmesan cheese and the one with the cheese in it. The flanks and cubes, I find it a bit rough. The cinnamon glazed pineapple was good as they thinly sliced and warm and it was good for dessert.

The first thing I have to comment on is the smell. Did anyone else get a whiff of weirdness? They use truffle oil in some stuff, so maybe it's just that but it was just really throwing me off. Thankfully our second visit they had the doors open and I didn't notice it as much.

Anyway, the beer list has a fairly decent lineup of craft beers. I personally think they should have more Ohio beers represented -- this isn't a chain burger place, why not give your home town/state a little bit more love? What caused me more distress was that neither one of our waiters seemed very familiar with the beer offerings. The second time we were there I ordered an IPA that they ended up being out of. Our waiter offered me samples of two other IPAs to try (without me asking, so thumbs up for that) BUT I'm not convinced he actually knew what they were. I hadn't heard of either of the breweries he mentioned...tried to look them up and came up with nothing.  I still enjoyed my beer, but I like to know what I'm drinking...

Food: you won't find juicier burgers around CLE than at this place. I'm not knocking B-Spot or Jammy Buggers or The Rail; I'm a fan of all of these places. But damn...be prepared for some oozing with these bad boys! That's a good thing! For me, the One Red Door is absolute burger perfection. They don't skimp on the brie, and the date/bacon aioli is a combination of two of my absolute favorite things ever. We've had the sweet potato fries, and they were fine, but the onion rings are the way to go. The buttermilk batter is reminiscent of tempura batter, so it's light and crunchy and somehow the onions don't get all slimy.

I called and spoke with a man who seemed pleasant enough.  Placed my order and he said 10-15 minutes until it would be ready.  Fair enough.

My boyfriend gets back and being as sick as I was, urged that I did not pick it up and instead suggested we change the order to delivery.   I plead against this because I didnt want to have to pay for a delivery charge when htis place is literally 3  minutes away but before I knew it he was on the ph one with them trying to change the order to delivery. 

Next thing that they said:  We don't deliver.  Even though on their front door it clearly states ""We Deliver"" and also on their website.  The employee my boyfriend was speaking with even got an attitude (how is a merchant going to give a paying customer attitude?) and started arguing with him while my boyfriend was simply asking why their ""delivery"" advertisement was still up on their front window.  This is just false advertisement if you ask me.

The sizable appetizer portions left us too full to finish the tender, meaty lamb shank special (served atop mushrooms, greens and a buttery potato puree) and the curiously crispy gnocchi accompanied by endive, Kalamata olives and even more goat cheese.

Yes, you heard right.  A straight man who loves to be loved and pampered like a star. I was on the way to the amazing pool at Wynn when I stopped in to see how much I would have to drop to get a proper shave. The lovely and magnificently pleasant woman at the front desk said ""just 65 dollars sir."" To which I responded ""JUST 65 huh? Thanks, but no thanks."" My immediate gut reaction tends to be the one I stick with when it comes to making decisions about money, women and sex. Who am I kidding!!! I almost always go against my gut and I did it yet again in this case too! I was sittin poolside, baking in the heat and it must have been the heat stroke (that's my story and I am stickin with it) that made me pick up my blackberry, call the salon and schedule the shave. 

So, I walk in there all sweaty and lookin like a mess, which was a bad move on my part b/c the woman who hooked me up with the best shave of my life was F-I-N-E FINE!!! We talked for a few before she got started and I let her get to work. Now let's get down to business. 

A proper shave is tough. I've tried it before and the guy who shaved me pretty much butchered my face and I was pissed! Not this time friends. 
Jessica started with a nice lather of moisturizer, massaged it into my face very slowly and it felt awesome. Then, she applied warm shave cream and covered my face with a piping hot towel and let it sit for a few. That's when I heard it. As she was walking to get something, I heard the sound that I love so much, but just am not used to hearing at the barbershop. The sweet sound of high heels hitting the tile. Now that's sexy friends!! Back to the shave. She applied another layer of shave cream and started with the straight razor. She was very gentle and thorough and told me that my hair is very coarse and grows in all directions, so she mentioned she was gonna take her time with me. That's what I love. A barber who takes their time and makes sure the job is done right the first time. She shaved once with the grain and then lathered up my face with moisturizer, shave cream and hot towel and repeated the process against the grain. At the end she covered my face with an ice cold towel to close the pores. She also gave me a tip for doin this at home. Listen up gents. Take a wash cloth or hand towel and cover with tap water. Pop in the microwave for 2 minutes and boom, you have a hot towel to open the pores and start your shave off on the right foot. 

Jessica noticed that my haircut, which I got done prior to my trip, was less than stellar. She was nice enough to fix the sideburns and make it look as close to ab fab as humanly possible. 

Let's get real gents. $65 for a shave sounds outrageous at first, I know and I agree. But, in the end I am all about lookin and feelin good which is why I was willing to drop the cash it takes to get me to that place. 

Jessica, thank you for treating me with love. You are the most ab fab barber a guy could meet AND gorgeous too!",2010-09-07 17:47:39

I had some type of pork salad as my entree (I can't recall the name!) and it was very tasty as well. Serving size was quite large and the dressing was very good. The pork was cooked perfectly with a nice crisp to it. Overall, VERY satisfied and pleased to finally find a Vietnamese place near me that isn't mediocre.

Went with one other person and we decided to go with Dim Sum rather than anything off the kitchen menu. I saw our waiter come by a few times, but he was very observant and waited until he saw us put down our menus before asking if we were ready, which made it feel much more relaxed and on our terms. He was quite friendly too.

Atmosphere was pretty quiet, all things considered. It wasn't terribly busy, but everything was kept to a low murmur. The cooking area was completely open, which gave off the comforting (but rather quiet and distant) sound of cooking utensils and pans clanking against one another, food sizzling and steaming, and filled the restaurant with great smells, getting us excited and hungry for our meal to come.

We got 6 different items off the menu (5 mediums and 1 large) and the portions were great. Everything was hot and looked/tasted like it was made with love. We didn't get a huge variety though - mostly buns, potstickers, and rice - so I can't speak for all the items.

We got enough food to stuff ourselves, and it ended up being around 30 bucks total, which kind of blew me away with how cheap it was, especially considering the quantity AND quality.

When you go into the exhibit you are given a device that has recordings for each art piece so you are able to learn about each piece as you go through the exhibit. It was kind of small but it was the perfect size for me. Since I'm not an art fanatic and just wanted to see the main pieces it was great.

The summary? I enjoyed it - it was okay, but will not be going back, especially for the bill I paid. 

The atmosphere is pretty cute, it's in a little house-like restaurant in a small shopping center tucked away on Camelback. But it's pretty quiet inside, so I'm not sure I would really like that for a date. Also, the bathroom is outside, which is a little strange. 

I had a glass of Malbec that wasn't all that great, but I'm willing to forgive wine. The other two had cocktails which they really enjoyed - so I think I just ordered poorly.

Then we ordered 5 appetizers and two entrees to split between three people as we wanted to try all that we could. We had the plantains (they were good, but not the best I've had), then plantain chips with bean dip which was amazing! That was the best part of the meal. We ordered three more appetizers that I didn't really eat, so I can't judge them. 

I ordered the chicken with the mango sauce that came with beans and rice. For the price of the meal I was very underwhelmed. It was a really sizeable piece of chicken, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce and the beans and rice were just so-so. 

The service though was awesome though. The waiter was great and answered all of our questions and recommended great appetizers. 4 stars for the service for sure.

$115.68??? When called to the management's attention I was given a song and dance about not wanting to give customers prices because it appears rude...are you kidding me??? You still overcharged me!! In short, the restaurant has done nothing. So I am currently disputing the charge with my bank. Again, the management did nothing, except offer to comp me a meal.

It's easy to miss this restaurant hidden amongst non-descript buildings on Dundas West.  Through the windows we could see the warm glow of candlelight.  The venue was packed with happy patrons.

Walking in without a reservation on a Friday, we didn't think that the place would be so crazy busy.  The hostess said recent reviews had caused an influx of new customers.  We were told that there was an hour wait to be seated.  We were able to sit at the front and have drinks since the bar was reserved for dining as well.  

The drink menu was a pleasant surprise.  An extensive list with a lot of classic cocktails with a twist.  I had a Manhattan with orange which was fantastic.

We actually didn't have to wait to long for a table.  The waitstaff was attentive and moved our drinks over and provided us with menus right away.  The menu is small and changes daily.  If you are a vegetarian, this is probably not the best place for you to eat.  The meats are supplied by the Healthy Butcher and everything was prepared perfectly.

We ordered a few items that were all fantastic!
* Calamari - Lightly seared and fresh.
* Duck breast with apple slaw
* Halibut with pesto sauce
* Steak - Juicy, tender, lightly seasoned

The highlight of the evening was the dessert.  
Everyone was ordering the salted-Caramel budino with good reason.
OMFG.  Salted caramel pudding with crunchy chocolate meringue.
I haven't been this wowed by a dessert in a long time.

I've lived in the area for a while now but I'd never tried Jaipur Grille. I'm a huge fan of Indian food, so expectations were high.

First of all, I should mention that the food arrived extremely fast; so fast, in fact, that it was still hot! That's a win in my book.

Our mains were Saag Paneer and Chicken Tikka Masala. The Saag was solid, to be sure, but I will admit that it wasn't quite as flavorful as other versions of this dish I've had. It seemed just a little too salty, somehow. The Tikka Masala, on the other hand, was exquisite. It was flavorful, spicy, and just all around delicious. I could've eaten another eight containers of that stuff.

We also ordered a couple of samosas and a cashew salad. The latter was surprisingly tasty and full of delicious vegetables, while the former was good but not spectacular.

But being a huge fan of Art Nouveau and not going to French bistros very often, I couldn't care less. Overall, it is an unassumingly charming little place and apparently has a heated patio? Definitely a great little romantic date spot, low lighting and all! Our server was a little pretentious but nice and attentive, for the most part.

My friend got a crepe and she said it was ""pretty good"" but nothing to rave about. I got the Moules Frites Normande. The mussels were plump, and while I liked the broth, I felt like it could've used a little more...something. It was just kind of boring and bland. No bread was given to sop up the broth, either. The fries were not very good in my opinion, and did not come with any sort of dipping sauce. I tried dipping in the broth. Still not very good, and now soggy. Basically I just wish this place was Point Brugge? Or maybe I should have ordered something else and accepted that PB is without a doubt the Moules Frites champion of Pittsburgh, and I need to stop comparing everyone else against them.

I was looking to pick up some side dishes for a picnic, and decided to stop by the deli to peruse their prepared dishes. I ended up going with the signature potato salad, which a hit at the picnic!

My club is near here, and after a club meeting I found myself staring with bewilderment at the ridiculously named restaurant with great curiosity.  This space used to occupy an Indian restaurant, and from what I gathered, the décor of Big Mouth retained much of the glory of it's predecessor.  The neighbourhood is Toronto's prestigious deer park, but I just don't see the owners investing on the kind of money to design this restaurant to it's current ambiance.  Either way, it's a good thing because it's a rather comfortable environment with a stunning view of Yonge Street.  I should have picked this up as a indicator of the prices.

The waitress and the kitchen staff here are Mandarin, but spoke to each other in English, I think it might be the official language on the dining floor.  This made it seem kind of tacky...I mean, really?  The place is called 'big mouth luck!'  I expect some energetic shouting.
The biggest table here sits six, I wouldn't come here with more than that.

The menu was just a piece of paper on the table, but I had to wait for my table to be cleaned before reading it, as the only good seat by the window I've chosen was left unattended to.  The waitress apologised and I forgave her, she was polite and pretty cute, I guess.  But as many overly polite waitresses are, she had the bad habit of saying the word 'sorry' a bit too much.  Because I ordered a total of six dishes, I had to tell her ""it's okay"" almost twice as many times.  
Seriously!  I am NOT offended by you bringing me the food which I've ordered..!!  Promise.

I didn't bring any reading material and my phone was out of batteries, so naturally I took out my pocket calculator and started doing math.  I did 16 minutes of math until my first dish arrived.  In a Chinese restaurant, this is considered a long wait, but then I guess I can rest assured that even at 9pm, I can trust big mouth to freshly prepare my dumpling from scratch.  

By the way, this place is hella expensive for a dumpling restaurant!  Most dishes cost $8+, and that's a considerable amount as the dumplings are rather small in size, and not mind-blowingly delicious.  Look, I'm from the North, meaning that I take dumplings as serious business.  Size, portion, and yumminess are integral to us Northerners.  At those prices, I should at least be eating like the Emperor's favourite courtesan.  
As I have said before, if you're charging me champagne room prices for Chinese food, I expect to be loved a long time afterwards.  I wasn't feeling the love here..

Located in a large plaza at 5115 Spring Mountain Road it would be deceitful to suggest this diner had even heard of Island Malaysian Cuisine before exiting another meal just one hour prior, but occasionally deferring to the interests of others it was at the top of a concrete staircase just past eight o'clock that the surprisingly popular restaurant was approached.

On further research apparently the most well-regarded place in town promoting an ""authentic"" Malaysian menu it is to two distinct signs but only viable door that patrons are greeted and with warm welcome inside by a duo of hostesses it was to a four-top at the front of the restaurant our duo was led, the menu of more than one hundred items perused in English alongside one featuring pictures as a few tables of CES conventioneers and locals sat dispersed about the large room.

Decorated in a mix of ethnic items and NFL banners, a TV and Pool Table close to restrooms in back, it was after careful deliberation that a four-part order was crafted, the kitchen expedient with golden pockets of curried chicken arriving a few moments later, though the spice profile was mild while starch overwhelmed protein.

Moving onward to better things, a crisp fold of roti served alongside a small bowl of vibrant red sauce and bone-in chicken, it was next in a comically large $6.50 bowl of boiled rice soup that appetites were entrusted, the texture more heterogeneous than typically associated with congee even before the addition of sliced century egg and chicken, a follow-up of fragrant noodles mostly pleasant despite being liberally oiled and tossed with duck that was almost 50% bone.

A pleasant space to sit and talk, the service timely and noise level not-too-loud, the menu's back features a fair number of sweets and although options trend a bit more pricey than other Chinatown spots the portions are quite generous, a ""Banana Pancake"" textured not unlike the roti more than enough to share with nothing more than caramelized natural flavors used to sweeten it while the ""Chef's Special"" offers several scoops of panna cotta textured coconut milk that reminisces the flavor of chilled Tapioca Pudding.

***Just under $30 each after tax and tip for a meal not-inappropriately large for two - even after substantial eating elsewhere - it would be difficult to call Island Malaysian Cuisine a bargain considering the ingredient quality and uneven execution, but all-in-all a pleasant enough place with a really good staff it may warrant a return visit at a later date in order to sample more things",2016-01-13 22:40:43

My 17 year old went, on his on, to pick out his tux for his prom. They were very helpful to him making recommendations to ensure a close match for his date's dress.  My son wanted to handle all the details himself and me being the nervous and slightly neurotic mom that I am, I was unsure how successful he would be.  The salesperson selected a nice dark gray Vera Wang tux instead of the typical black one. He matched a nice salmon color vest and tie to match his girlfriends dress. While it wasn't a perfect match, it was as close as they could come. When he picked up the tux, it was a perfect fit and all pieces were clean and perfectly pressed.

I've got the usual- bad cough, mucus coming up, congestion.... I've had bronchitis enough to recognize the early signs (seriously, I get it twice a year because I work with kids. They love to share their germs!) The doc that was working today told me it was too early to diagnose anything and didn't ask me any questions regarding my symptoms. No ""what color is the mucus you're coughing up? How bad is the cough? Have you had a fever?"" Mind you, it was 102 last night... As I'm sitting in front of him unable to really breathe he tells me to go home and drink fluids. I just paid $150 for advice? They also don't keep prescriptions in house any longer so I went and found a Nextcare (since this place is now Banner) and they were able to give me a treatment and a prescription because they actually asked me questions regarding my symptoms. I won't be back which sucks because the staff is really nice but I'm cash pay so I can't afford to be going from doctor to doctor all day. 


I'm updating my previous review after going for my second time today. Still same great and amazing care. I couldn't breathe when I got in and they spent over an hour with me giving breathing treatments and medication to help open up my airways. They also got me in pretty quick but that could be a combination of the fact that it was in the middle of a Tuesday and they could probably hear my god awful cough in the waiting room all the way in the back.

The HH menu is pretty good for a group of people to order off of, although not everything is really shareable. My group just asked the server which would be best to share and she obliged.

Hummus was great - three different styles (traditional, red pepper, and edamame), but I wish there had been more grilled pita. The addition of plantain chips for dipping was very nice!

Spinach & Artichoke Dip - Meh. Not very good, and a small portion (the dish is very shallow!). Plus there were just a lot of fillers on top of the dish, making it hard to get to what you actually want - the spinach and artichoke dip, of course! 

Lettuce Wraps - Comes with seared chicken, cucumbers, carrots and a soy sauce glaze. These were OK - but the lettuce was a bit wilted when it came out making these a bit less appetizing than they should have been. 

Chart House Sampler - This one is a weird one, and you'd think it would come with more than just a few items considering it is called a ""sampler"", but the portions were kind of meager and the lobster/shrimp spring roll (1) is not good for sharing.

I ordered a steak burrito and loaded it up with just about everything that didn't cost extra.

After it was said and done, I had a $7 burrito that wasn't bad, but was lacking in a couple areas. I don't think the portion size is as large as chipotle, and I also think the meat quality isn't as good either, but it was hard to tell as my burrito had a lot of rice. I did like how they mixed everything up before rolling, I feel that sometimes the ingredients are too segregated. Veggies are also extra whereas at Chipotle I do not believe they are. 

Panchero's might have a better quesadilla than chipotle, though. It was interesting to see how they quickly they heat it up like that!

I was also a fan of the salsa verde, as well as the free sauce they have on the condiment table, surprisingly spicy and good.

Overall I liked it but still think Chipotle might be better. I didn't know this was a chain until I looked it up, but it is. I was also given a punch card where when I buy 10 entrees I can get a free one. This might be useful if it was in a better location, at least for students!

Maybe because there's a lot of selection?  Maybe because I like to risk a bad tummy ache?  It's probably a combination of all these things.

We usually end up visitin Krazy buffet because of the coupons...yep!  I've been able to find them almost weekly in some of our local neigborhood papers.  Not only there but you can sometimes find a coupon in the online version of the Las Vegas Review Journal, they have a coupon area on the website.  The coupon we use is good for 10% off lunch or 15% off dinner.  Or is it 15% off lunch and 10% off dinner?  I can't recall right now.  Either way, with lunch being only $6.99 and dinner being $10.99 (all you can eat seafood none the less) it's not a bad deal if you're pinching pennies or want a change from Panda Express.  That coupon helps, especially in our broke-A$$ economy.

The selection is not bad, but for myself I prefer lunch items over their dinner items.  I say this because darn near all their lunch items are served at dinner, with the exception of the addition of crab legs, sometimes a steak option...and sometimes fresh oysters.  One night there might be oysters but the next night there might not be.  I know, it's a bit of a throw off so check the buffet line at dinner if you really want oysters!  I prefer lunch because I don't eat that much crab legs, and I'm not all that hot on oysters so for me the savings of $4 is worth it.

The selection of food is pretty good at Krazy Buffet (there's more choices though at Buffet @ Asia) and they keep things pretty fresh.  Their operation is also clean, which is a big plus for me.  If you read my Buffet @ Asia review you would know that they have some sanitation issues (but why that doesn't stop me from eating there I don't know..I'm guessing it's their awesome garlic fried wings).  

Anyway, they have a lot of your typical dishes you would find at a Chinese buffet.  They have the requisite orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and fried rice and chow mein.  They also have things like sauteed mushrooms, steamed tilapia, teriyaki chicken, coconut shrimp, stir-fry veggies, and pork chops.  There's a sushi station but I kinda stay away from it because nearly everything is California roll-ish and not particularly great.  They have a decent salad station with fresh lettuce, fresh veggies, and a large bowl of shrimp for shrimp cocktail.  The soup station is limited, mostly your Chinese staples such as egg drop, won ton, and hot and sour soup.  They do have miso soup sometimes which of course is Japanese.  Krazy Buffet does have an array of fried foods (yah of course) that has fried chicken wings, egg rolls, chicken skewers, sweet and sour shrimp, sweet and sour pork, and even some Chinese doughnuts.  Most Chinese buffets have pretty basic dessert areas, and Krazy Buffet is no different.  They have pre bought almond cookies, fortune cookies, chocolate cake, carrot cake, and some smaller dessert stuff.  But they do have fresh fruit like strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, and canned lychee.  Of course there is a soft serve ice cream machine with vanilla or chocolate.  

Overall, not a bad deal for under $9 for lunch, tax and tip.  Especially if you got that coupon.  It's not a revelation in culinary arts, but the food will keep you full for 2 hours or so...like most Chinese food does for some odd reason.  Clean and efficient, not all Chinese buffets can achieve that.  I just wish their fried chicken wings were as scrumptious as the ones from Buffet @ Asia on Rainbow!",2009-08-27 16:31:10

It's a small place located by the Hallmark store. 
First glance, it's very organicky in appearance. Like many smoothie places, they divide the smoothies into categories: tropical, just fruit, power, green, etc. They also offer a variety of juices, lunch wraps/panini, and create your own bowls (make a base with acai, chia pudding, etc, then add topings). I chose a medium size Acai Power which included acai, blueberries, oatmeal, chia seeds and some other stuff. 
Then I was dismayed when my total came out to over $9! For a smoothie?! Wtf!?! Yeah. I am not ok with that. I paid, and talked myself into,  ""well, this is my lunch, so not entirely a waste.""
The smoothie was good, as it should be for that price. (I am NOT cheap y'all but prefer to spend money in the right places)

I looked over the menu for some time and opted to eat healthier than normal.  I ordered the Shaken beef salad with house dressing.  It was a nicelyu done mix of greens with tender, warm beef slices, and topped with the house dressing,  The flavor was a little spicy which was good.

They're downtown pretty often, but for some reason I've always missed them.  Not this time.  And thank goodness.  Otherwise I'd have missed out on some cajun deliciousness that's pretty hard to duplicate.

Effectively what they're doing is serving cajun food in a mexican food presentation.  Some of the dishes have more of a mexican flare than others, but at the heart of every dish is traditional cajun soul.  The menu is actually pretty expansive despite being a food truck.  In addition to the dozen or so items they regularly sell, they also have a number of specials (the big special tonight was a blackened catfish).  They've got burritos, bowls, tacos, and even quesadillas.  For my first venture into the unknown, I went with a chicken jamburrito.  Chicken étouffée, jambalaya, andouille sausage, cheese, lettuce and creole sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla.  I also got hush puppies as a side.  Total cost was $10 and it was ready within about 3 minutes.

First off, the burrito itself is huge.  They slice it in half for you which is good because this could easily be shared by two.  I took this one down myself because, well, there was just too much awesome going on.  The burrito was fantastic and I think the two keys that make it are the creole sauce and the jambalaya.  It actually wasn't crazy spicy as I'd anticipated, which made it even more enjoyable.  The hush puppies were also outstanding and they gave me at least half dozen of those.  For $10, I was plenty full and happy.

So if you're in Downtown Phoenix for Food Truck Fridays or an internet connection to Jamburrito's calendar, do yourself a favor and track down this truck.  The portions will more than satisfy and the flavors will bring you back.  And be sure to make room for those hush puppies.",2014-12-11 03:52:05

I think Extreme Fitness gets a bad rap, but this gym is super clean, 5 floors, with upbeat instructors and a jam-packed, dynamic class schedule. Fit2Ski, box classes, jump rope and power yoga are some of the best-- plus, they are scheduled for real professionals. And the crowd is good.

We went during summerlicious. I got the chicken and cornbread waffles to start. The chicken was cold by the time it came out, and you could not tell that the waffles had cornbread in it. 

The cod cake was absolutely amazing, and they didn't skimp on the fish. The cake had a good ratio of fish to potato, and you could hardly notice that the potato was there. 

The desserts we ordered was the rocky road mousse and the strawberry shortcake. The mousse was mostly made up of this chocolate like bread that was accompanied by a dab of mousse. The strawberry shortcake was dry and the icing tasted like the kind from the tube.

I noticed most of the bad reviews were for larger groups - there were 6 in our party, but again who cares about excuses.
Maybe we should've known not to go since it was a Friday night and only 2 tables were taken out of probably 15. But the name is so cute and it had generally good reviews on yelp.
So we went, had some overpriced $12 soju (retail $3) and everyone got all you can eat. The guy wouldn't let me start w kalbi and spicy pork - said no do the brisket because it cooks faster. That wasn't a suggestion he wouldn't let me start with what I wanted. They brought out the sides,like 4 things - more regular kim chee, radish, some kind of fermented fish and these cute little pancakes. The selection sucked I asked for cucumber kim chee she said we don't have that, soy sauce potatoes ""we don't have that"", more of the pancakes pls ""you only get one"" WTF! 
Brisket is done and they bring out another pile of kim chee and bean sprouts to cook. Its pretty obvious they were trying to fill us up with the cheap sh*t. They brought out kalbi finally when it was done we asked for more and we were told it was 1 order per person, which it does say in the menu. I told him no there are 6 ppl and the amnt you brought out was serving for 2 or 3. I didnt say it but F*ck that. He went to the back and brought out more. Yay....
I asked for shik-hye for the end of the meal ""we don't have that"".
Everyone on yelp said the best part was the fried rice they make on your grill. I was looking forward to this light at the end of a craptastic tunnel. The kim chee fried rice was ok, nothing special. We got the bill which wasn't itemized just a bunch of prices and a total, so we asked what everything was.  Those mofos charged us $4.95 x2 for that fried rice! Maybe this goes back to the not being Korean issue but I never saw a charge mentioned in any other reviews. 
We paid and left w out leaving a tip. Not something any of us normally do, but that really was the worst dining experience I've ever had. I almost hoped they would come running out asking about a tip like I've read in other bad reviews on this place. 
My suggestion - don't bother w honey pig! Go to woo che its in the same shopping center right off of spring mtn, its where we normally go for Korean bbq.

First, as with other Yelpers, I was a bit taken aback by the counter person. When we walked in the store there was no one at the counter. A few moments later, a young man comes out from the back to assist us. We had never been there and we informed him of this but he didn't seem very enthused, more like annoyed. Ahhh, then a young lady comes out from the back to ""assist"" him with our order. Hmmmm. C'mon, you know how it is. When 2 seemingly high school age kids, boy & girl, come out from ""behind the curtain"" one can only imagine what they were doing back there. But, I digress . . .

We each ordered a different cupcake. They looked beautiful and I would say for the price, $3.50 ea., they were appropriately sized. Both employees offered very little if any help in deciding which cupcakes to order, the differences between any of the cupcakes offered or the history behind GiGi's. Basically, we could have gotten the same experience at a grocery store. And, paid a lot less.

C had a Red Velvet cupcake. He liked it (I would like to point out that while I'm normally impressed with C's palate, he is 10, it would be difficult to find a cupcake, cake, dessert in general that C didn't like). K & I didn't like it that much. In fact, K & I didn't like any of the 3 cupcakes. They all suffered from the same issues:
The cakes were dry. Not horribly, but enough towards the crumbly stage to unimpress me. The frostings were just overwhelming. Honestly, so much frosting which made the cupcakes cloyingly gross. Too sweet, too much and not the best texture. Yuk. 

Now, as I said, C liked his. He said his was fine so I have to take that into consideration. But, K & I didn't enjoy ours and we both came to the same conclusion.

It's flavorful and filling. I always get my order with a side of plain chips.  

Don't forget to ask about the vegan desserts. Some are labeled, but not always.  And I've learned that the employees are not all educated on what is and isn't vegan, but one of the co-owners informed me that their apple pies are always vegan. I'll have to try the apple pie a la mode next time!  I have tried their brownie a la mode and their homemade toffee. Yum!

Right when I walked in i was greeted with a big smile. I started looking at the wall of flavors and was quickly offered samples. 

The samples are the killer because they are so generous with them but i actually bought 3 additional bags after trying the samples. 

Right now my favorite is BarBQ. I am looking forward to cracking open the honey garlic next. 

I was surprised by the prices. We all took our guess at how much a bag would be and we were all wrong. Its the same price as a bag at the convience store but so much better quality and flavor. 

I like this jerkey mostly because of the preperation. I am old school about my bizz and like that oberta from 20 years ago that you had to actually naw on for 5 minutes. I like to get the flavor out and take my time which this jerky is pretty good for. Tender enough with still a good chew.

We showed up around 5:00 on a Tuesday to an already packed house, but were able to somehow score a table outside without a reservation (but you should make one, seriously).  Typical Meat & Potatoes, Butcher & the Rye service:  hoverish without being annoying, super helpful.  We had a slew of staff bring us menus, some fine tap, and had our drink orders taken before I could even look at the ""make your own guacamole"" sheet.  Unfortunately I'm not a guac fan, but it was a really cute idea that you get to fill out this scan-tron menu of traditional and a little bizarre options that come with a box of incredible looking chips.

The special (dollar off) frozen margarita was apple so I jumped on that instantly while +1 opted for a mango Jarritos.  We started with the papa bravas to start which were these confit lil' potatoes in garlic red sauce and a bit of cheese in a silver bowl of my new favorite thing.  I was barely done woofing them down when my pollo asado tacos came up.  Spicy but not hot chicken cooled with avocado and white cheese crumbles.  Somehow the best part were the tender (and really sturdy!!) shells. Pretty traditional compared to other options; the +1 played it safe but spicy too getting the al pastor tacos which were gone before I could even see what was in them--caught a glimpse of beef and pineapple. They were a hit with him.  And not to get tacky, but everything was priced well too.  I actually took one of my tacos home (and not just because I filled up on tequila!).

I grabbed a passion fruit margarita before heading out.  Super sweet but just as good as the apple, although not as unique.  Their frozen margaritas, by the way, are perfect.  Nothing syrupy and heavy on the booze. I really wanted to try the lychee, but I could not have more than two of these guys.

They have a good beer selection and the prices are pretty fair. You can't have liquor on Sunday although I am guessing that could be a because they just opened.

I got a free entree coupon for my birthday, for signing up for Big Burrito's mailing list, and decided to revisit Casbah.  The good: we got to enjoy the patio even though the weather was a little cool because it was heated.  My maccheretto, a pasta entree with white beans, sun-dried tomato, pesto and walnuts, was very good.  The pasta was al dente and the white beans were perfectly cooked (not mushy).  It was maybe a touch too salty (the fontina, maybe?), but I was happy with the choice.  

Now, onto the weird.  After taking our orders, our waiter asked if we wanted bread with our big-calorie pasta dishes.  Checking if we want bread is fine--but, umm, he could have left out the comment about the pasta?  My friend and I are both twentysomething women.  Luckily, we're not that insecure about our bodies.  We like to eat.  Yes, bring the bread.

When he brought our entrees, he sang ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you"" under his breath as he put my pasta in front of me.  I don't like people singing to me at restaurants, so I'm grateful it wasn't audible to everyone else on the patio--but a simple ""Happy birthday"" would have sufficed.  Then when he cleared our plates, he asked if my dish was ""everything [I] wanted, and more.""  I appreciate the gestures, but it felt artificial.

He asked if we'd like to see the dessert menu--and added that he was supposed to ask that, that we shouldn't feel obligated.  Uh, what?  I think this and the bread/pasta comment bothered me the most.  

To redeem the birthday coupon, you have to show an ID.  I recently cut my hair, so it's different than my license photo.  When he returned my ID to me, our waiter said, ""I like the short hair.""  If this had been the only unusual statement he had made during the meal, I would have taken it as a compliment.  I guess it is one.  But when considered with all the other weird things, it just felt like he was trying way too hard and my friend and I both felt awkward.

this is a nice well-kept property, but could really use a little burst of fun & modernization; this appears to be coming soon with the planned opening of Pizza Rock in March, and potential longer term opening of Mercadito & its sister bar Tipple; miles of slot machines here for the locals; meeting rooms on 2 floors; also has a 10-screen theater; I like how the hotel area & check-in is segregated on a lower floor, and is quite serene & classy, including the cool bar off of the lobby; the real shining star at Green Valley is the outdoor/pool area, which looks fab; you can also walk across the street to shopping & some eateries like Elephant Bar; the sports book is impressive & regal; probabaly a 3.5 stars property, but I'll kick them up to 4 in anticipation of Pizza Rock opening soon; best craft beer bet = it's pretty bad right now, but Pizza Rock should change that if it's anything like the downtown LV location.

Drink: Mocha (One size)

Atmosphere: Another simple-looking coffee shop. Reminds me of Sweet Flour Bake shop with its' brown colouring and contemporary design. There were a lot of people today, because of the Junction Arts Festival, but they still maintained great service. The cashier was adorable and had a welcoming smile not like some intimidating baristas. Thumbs up.

Verdict: The drink was okay, I think it wasn't as strong as I'd hope it to be. Tasted a bit watered down. On the other hand, the design was so warm and pretty. It's always a shame destroying coffee art, but hey, tasting the art is always a million times better.

We walked in and didn't realize that the girl with her head down and eyes glued to her phone sitting on the bench was the employee. I let her know I had shoes on hold and she grabbed them. Before she swiped my card, I opened the box and saw they had been worn. She told me they hadn't been worn out of the store though. At that point, I wasn't really sure of what to do- instant gratification or order a fresh pair but have to wait?

Honestly, if it weren't for such a great first experience at the Cheyenne location, I probably would have walked out.  Especially considering that the girl wasn't very pleasant to deal with. But I literally drove all the way from the North side.

Visited ESM on a Sunday for lunch. We've dined here once before since my boyfriend won't stop raving about their unlimited salad and bread. I hated the food last time, and I hated it even more this time for lunch. 

On a Sunday for lunch, the restaurant wasn't packed like our previous visit. Waiting to be seated at this restaurant would be a joke. Please do your palette a favour and turn elsewhere. 

Service was fine, oddly enough we had the same server as our first visit. She was nice, with bright red hair and lots of tattoos. The only thing I found odd was she got rid of my boyfriends half-eaten caesar salad when she dropped off his pasta dish... It was clearly not finished and we assumed she'd bring back a full one since it was unlimited... Or so we thought.

A loaf of garlic toast was served after we placed our orders. Standard garlic loaf- at least it was warm.

Throughout my meal I was miserable as I knew I wouldn't like the food. At $9.99/ pasta I would expect something much better. I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it was unmemorable. Michelina's frozen pasta dishes are 10x better than the pasta here.

I sat there, picking out the edible things- bland, frozen chicken, mushrooms, red and green peppers. The linguini left untouched, as it was extremely soggy and drenched in their ""rose"" sauce which had zero flavour.

I knew what I had gotten myself into, and I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. My advice? Stay away, buy some Classico pasta sauce and mix it with some veggies and you've got a meal 100x better than any pasta served here. Gross.",2015-11-15 23:27:34

They came out to replace them not once but twice now and the quality is shot, even the delivery guys (who are awesome BTW) said they wouldn't accept them either. #3 our chest of drawers the seams are coming un glued, they again tried to exchange it not one time but 2 times and even the 2nd time the dresser had a dent in it and was faded the 1st time.  Now its day 2 after the 3rd delivery exchange attempt and I emailed them yesterday and no one has call back from them at all. Even just to apologize.

For a couple months i had noticed that when the company was bought out not only did they up the price(from 18 to 25 for a couple months then down to 19.33) but for some odd reason neither LA Fitness or Pure Fitness has a lot of employees working for them that are just NOT pleasant when you first enter. Whenever i see these scowling faces at the front desk i want to hurry and run to whatever machine i can get on STAT!  Secondly, i understand some of these kids working as a personal trainer who looked old enough to be my little brother and no nice looking muscles and what have you basically told me i was obese and not fit and you know that whole deal and how I should sign up for their personal trainer thingy where you see them once a week or whatever is part of their job but not everyone is well endowed. Cmon kid look at the economy, I am 24 years old i am not working out at home that should give you a little bit of common sense knowledge.At the time I was working for the worst company ever(SEARS) and didn't want to feel tied down to something i am not sure I could commit too not only for financial reasons but personal reasons.  The best workout you can get is to go with people who Were personal trainers and/or friends for motivation. Going by yourself is good for you don't get me wrong but having someone to talk too is much more fun than listening to songs on your ipod over and over.  

Third thing, when i refer someone to join you would think I would get some kind of reward. Not here.  Or they are holding out on me(which i wouldn't be surprised in the slightest).  So my friend who is moving to chandler soon came to work out one day, Some big douche bag sitting in his desk had the audacity to tell her she cannot be a guest because you need to register online. So we thought okay well lets use our smart phones. He then tells us No we need a print out. Okay??? Well geez dude you could have said that to begin with.  My friend was willing to pay 15 dollars just for the day to get this twat waffle out of the way and on with our 2 hour session.  So the T.W(did not get his name i will next time i go and ask though)  had gotten up and another big guy with bulging muscles sat down with a rose looking tattoo was nice enough to state everything in a clear nice friendly tone like someone with better customer service skills would show for their company.  Signed my friend up and you know what I lied for referring my friend I had received a Thank you and a lanyard OOOOOH BOY EXCITING!!!  

The gym itself is packed after 5 o'clock weekdays.  Oh and as a FYI do NOT read the door outside. It says the gym is only open til 10 Mon-Fri but really its open Mon-Thur until 12am and fri til 10pm! Thank God!!! I like to go when there's less people which is after 9pm.  I like this gym because its close and i like the layout much more than the one that was on alma school and elliot for some reason don't ask why. I don't know!  So the gym is okay enough to go to nothing special  but its whats close. So can't complain too much unless I have to deal with the employees more than id like to is where we have problems. I seriously do not understand how companies hire females that have their snotty behavior going on and big guys that think they are the S*** because they are a personal trainer and find everything you say to be incorrect and don't want to sign people up apparently and make everything more difficult than it should be your an awesome T.W of an employee dude keep up the ""GREAT"" work(or lack of)!",2011-10-21 09:05:08
YmghzBPfS_VZ5HaF8gMHjw,EJ7ZhRHsMWj8du77LX34gw,MX2gz2fbO_4LZwc3rGkl6g,5,8,5,5,"Dr. Dominic is amazing. His practice is holistic and takes into account more than just adjustments. Flexibility and strength are highlighted as being integral components of successful treatment. One strikingly different ideology Dr. Dominic has is that he only treats individuals who are going to improve. He is not here to indefinitely bill your insurance.  I was quite frankly shocked at how adept his adjustments were. After only a few visits I can feel a significant difference.

Hands down: Awesome.

Alright, so that was a very professional sounding review. What I should have written is that Dr. Dom is the bomb diggity. 

I go to see Dr. D for an entirely different reason than when I met him. I came to him with an unfortunate list of ""BLEH"". Everything hurt. Sitting. Sleeping. Standing. Walking. I was a mess (post car accident - damn drivers in New York!) 

A few months later I was discharged. I never thought that was possible when I walked in. Honestly. I was seriously thinking old age would great me with a walker before 45. (Not a good look for someone single. Aaanyway.)

I was able to join a gym and regain my mobility in life. (I've dropped a little over 50 lbs since late Oct. '12) I am not the same person I was when I met him. I see him for adjustments from the vigorous workouts I maintain in the gym. I'm a gym buff. Not very good, but I go to the gym. 

The thing about Dr. D is that I don't have to tell him what is off anymore. Unless something is shrieking in pain (which, admittedly, would be bad), I lay down. He pokes the fingers of god around my back, hips, and neck. This dude (sorry, doctor d, I call you this sometimes) KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.

Don't be nervous, he will be able to safely adjust your neck. Give him your trust and you will be a happier person.

Fair Warnings:
1) He will know if you've had drunk sleep (and can fix that)
2) He has a very well defined sense of smell (and can name the scent of a lotion - putting any boyfriend to shame)

Also, and damn him, he's just a nice guy.",2013-07-28 07:57:53

Shuttle service.  Runs on the hour, takes you to the Monte Carlo.  From there if you need to get further down the strip, I suggest walking across the street to MGM and catching the rail.  Faster than taking a bus on the strip.  Once a day, there is another shuttle that takes you to Vons grocery store.  I hit up the Taco Bell in the same shopping complex and some groceries.

We visited on a Sunday night so it wasn't too busy. Our waiter, Omar, seemed inexperienced but didn't make any mistakes so at least he was well trained. The wine list is not as extensive as other high end restaurants, and they lack a cellar, but there are plenty of reasonable options.
We started off with two of the classics: the Caesar salad - very nice, though I prefer the pieces of lettuce smaller; and carpaccio - also very nice, but too much arugula and they shouldn't put tomatoes on it. The mains were even better. The beef tenderloin medallions were excellent - soft, perfectly cooked and juicy. The bison ribeye steak was fantastic - massive flavour, perfectly cooked and juicy with that bit of gamey chew you get with bison meat. I would order this again in a heartbeat!
For dessert we settled on the chocolate cake - expectedly decadent and rich - washed down with some fine old port and cognac. because our mains took a while to arrive, the manager comped us a couple of Grand Marniers - nice touch, shows some class to take care of his customers.
All in all, we were both very happy with our dinner here, and would be happy to return the next time we are in Montreal.

A solid breakfast or lunch option in the busy hospital row area. The simple white decor is aesthetically pleasing and makes eating/drinking here feel a bit nicer than most counter-service spots. It's a great place for a work meeting or a quick catch-up with friends in the middle of the work day. In the summer, the patio area facing University Ave. is a nice spot. They have newspapers to keep you entertained if you come alone, as well as a flat screen TV playing random movies (a bit odd). 

They serve Illy espresso and Mighty Leaf teas - yummy! For breakfast, I like their cheese croissants. For lunch, there is a nice selection of sandwiches, quesedillas, and wraps, as well as 2 soups every day + side salads (caesar, greek, mixed greens, fruit). Most recently, I had the mixed mushroom sandwich on a focaccia. So flavourful and delicious, and it comes with a dollop of herb mayo which adds to its awesomeness. The side salads are pretty uneventful, but fresh. My friend likes the jerk chicken sandwich. A sandwich & side costs about $9.50. It's a bit pricey, but worth it IMO. 

This place gets packed between 12-1pm, so plan accordingly. If you come during that time, it might be hard to find a table. However, the staff are pretty efficient. You get a number with your order and they bring the food out to your table.",2011-11-11 22:23:13

To start we had the tortilla soup and some guacamole and both were decent. We ordered enchiladas de camaron, they were good with plenty of shrimp filling and cheese, it comes with two enchiladas and rice and beans to share. Also ordered the pollo al horno which it was very flavorful and juicy, it came wrapped on banana leaves and in a paper bag. Authentic? Who knows, it all depends from what area of Mexicos food you're accustomed to, all I was hoping for is some good food and I was not disappointed.
Service was great. We were greeted by almost everyone in the building, we were served in a timely manner and glasses (mason jars) refilled constantly, no problems there.
I love what they did with the place. Modern industrial look with exposed ducts and brick and imported Mexican tile. The cool bar with some gothic touches and saints, giving it a feel of a religious altar where I could just pray all night to the agave gods.
 I do have a little problem with the rest rooms. Saloon swinging doors don't really work in bathrooms, I really believe that bathrooms doors should completely seal all bathroom activities from the rest of the restaurant, and also using Jesus and the Virgin Mary as marking signs for men and women is going to far, a bit insulting.
 Prices are a little high, but the experience is worth it, I doubt I'll be a regular since this place is far from where I live and parking is not abundant but if I find myself in downtown again I'll make sure to stop by and try other items on the menu.

I was looking forward to the Fab rooms because they're all new - the standard rooms have all been redone in a retro/mod hybrid of laminate floors and funky furniture and the pictures of those rooms look cool. But we arrived at 10 in the morning, so we were offered the opportunity to upgrade to a Go Deluxe room with a view and get into our room right away without paying an early check in fee or come back a little bit later, pay an early check in fee and get into a Fab room... or wait until 4:00 in the afternoon for a Fab room at no extra charge. It was still a good deal, and we love the spa type shower in the Go room so we bought the upgrade. We ended up with a room directly across from the fountains in front of Caesar's Palace and if you stood to the side of the window you could see all of the Bellagio's fountain show.

We had a great time in the Go room as we did a few years ago, but our room definitely had some miles on it. Everything worked (and it was awesome to hit the button on the electronic drapes and watch the sunrise from bed) but the LED display on the Denon stereo was starting to fail and the iPod cable was missing. The feature of the room we used most was the spa type shower with side jets, and the funky mood lighting in there was pretty cool. Just make sure the jets are turned off before you turn on the water or you will make a mess. (don't ask how I know this)

They've been doing a lot of work here, adding a Carlos & Charlies in part of the casino and the Margaritaville Casino and 5 o'clock Somewhere bar is recent. The restaurants are kind of meh, but the 5 o'clock Somewhere bar is great. 

The Margaritaville Casino is a fun place to play with hotter cocktail servers than the rest of the casino. Cigarette smoke is more pronounced in the casino than others on the strip. There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel - O'Shea's is gone and they're building the Linq and remodeling the Inferior Palace (now the Quad) on one side and Bills was closing for remodeling the week after we left.

Like all Caesar's properties, there's no mandatory resort fees, but you will pay steep fees for WiFi or the fitness center, so if those things are important to you, that will even out.

My wife and I had a good time, and I'll be back here in a couple of months for work, but next time we come to Vegas for fun we will probably try someplace new just to change it up a bit.

First off, you have some dimwit teenager texting behind the counter as I walk inside and he was the damn cook. The other worker was in the bathroom and she was pretty unwelcoming as well. They used to have large chunks of white meat chicken, but now the $1.50 white meat upcharge is just tiny pieces of chicken cooked in the magic sauce and dumped on top of rice. The veggies were different too - they seemed frozen, not fresh. The place is nice and neat with hot sauces now and no limit on that magic sauce stuff, but nothing ever stays the same and I have made my final visit to the Flame Broiler - RIP.",2018-03-10 19:16:30

1. The Taiwanese engine is what you are looking for. If extraneous parts are made in China (welcome to globalization, every vehicle you buy will have some of it made in China) it's not cause for alarm. The important parts are made in Taiwan. 

2. Some Assembly is required once these bikes arrive and the repair shop knows what it's doing. I trust Scooter Invasion to sell a quality product, because I have one that I drive everyday.  [NOTE: ""Chinese"" scooters are not worth the shipping cost so they send them here to be assembled by the ""dealers"" (similar to IKEA packaging) and you are relying on the ""dealers"" to make sure the product is assembled correctly.]

3. I was never over-charged or talked into anything I didn't need at Scooter Invasion. They actually talked me out of a service the last time I was there and saved me some money. [If you want to have someone make you feel special and then really know what being overcharged is like, visit the Yamaha dealership. They'll give you free bottled water and tell you all about their trips while they justify their brand name price tag.]

4. If you can't afford retail prices (you want to spend less than $1,800) you can always buy used and have your bike fixed up like new at Scooter Invasion.

I recommend Scooter Invasion, because I've been driving a scooter for the last 7 years and I feel Scooter Invasion service was the cheapest and fastest service I've ever had.. I've owned/driven Yamaha and Vespa and I still love my Buddy 125. I've driven thousands of miles from long trips up the Taiwanese coast for fresh seafood, to daily driving in Taipei/San Francisco/Berkeley/Phoenix/Tempe traffic.

A friend of mine is pregnant and her family and I went out to get some maternity shots. We went on a clear side trail (wide worn path, off main trail, connected to other trails, several other people also on the trail). We placed our items on a rock on the side of the trail. A City of Scottsdale asked us to get on a trail, we responded that we were. He then walked closer to us (still in shouting distance) and told us we were not on a trail, (we were standing in the middle of the trail). He then stated that we were on trail that wasn't a trail because it was made by ""people doing the same thing you're doing"". Okay we followed the trail we were on to the main trail and walked past him, he then followed us past the visitor center and continued to watch us take shots (again on a trail not blocking anyone while 2 other large groups took photos). We left a little late (7:10, the park closes at 6:59 we recognize this is our fault there were plenty of other people there and about 5 cars in the lot). He came around a corner and questioned us regarding time as we said our goodbyes. He stated the time, we apologized, he then told us we might be fined for trespassing as the gate ""may or may not open up, I guess you'll take your chances"". At this point as we questioned us, never identifying himself or his purpose, I started saying ""okay"" and not reacting. As we tried to leave again he said ""are you a professional photographer"" I said ""emmm semi-pro I guess I do this for fun and my friends"". He then looked at the couple and their son and said ""are these your friends"" and I said ""yes I've known her 3 years"". He then stated I needed a permit, I told him no park says you can't take photos of your friends this wasn't a professional shoot. Keep in mind I didn't even have a tripod, it was me and a camera. Also keep in mind that there were 3 total (including us) groups taking photos near us, we never saw him approach them or speak to them. At no point did he mention his name, title, purpose or intent. He approached us in the dark to vaguely threaten police action, he did not speak to the other groups and followed us as we finished up.

Pros:  overall variety of food is good.
Shrimp sushi roll then deep fried-good
Some funky sticky rice -too thick and sticky-,not good
Shrimp noodles, good. A texture I'm not particularly fond of, but flavor good.
Lo mein type noodles--good
Duck-good, despite not a lot of meat
Twice fried pork, really good.
Chicken wings-really good ( not really Asian or Chinese but I really like crispy wings)
Shrimp shumai really good
Greens-i think they were some sort of asian broccoli.

My favorite things were the tea, sesame ball with sweet filling and shumai.

Con's,:  way too busy and crowded but there's nothing you can do about that. That's just the way dim sum is

I don't like getting passed up by anyone with the carts. Some don't speak any English so you don't know what they are offering and combine that with the din and the language barrier, it got a little frustrating.

DVIosFuTvndX0kSFjn4_Ow,PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,0p0PqX7Zsm_0lvXzEWpwWA,4,2,1,2,"SELF-SERVICE LIBRARY
Library staff have been relieved of the drudgery of helping patrons with menial check-in/check-out tasks.  It is now up to patrons to handle their own transactions using the library's automated terminals.

The staff of course are thrilled but it feels to me like a harsh reduction in service.  A librarian assured me that no staff members were dismissed as a result of automation.  I suppose this frees them for more librarianly duties.

The familiar customer service counter is now closed.  The slots where you once dropped your materials are now hooded in black plastic.  There are signs directing you to a self-check corral.

I suppose like any self-service initiative, we'll come to accept and maybe even like it.  

SCULPTURE REMOVAL
I posted a picture of the library with a big iron sculpture in the side yard.  One day the sculpture was gone.

I asked a librarian about it.  ""What sculpture?""

I asked another librarian.  ""We don't have anything to do with the sculptures,"" she said snappishly.  She probably thought I was going to lodge a complaint.

Regardless of who manages the sculptures, you would think that library employees would take at least a passing interest in what goes on in and around the facility.  

The Sahara West branch has more than its share of snooty, snappish employees.  There's a high turnover.  The librarian you get to know and like may be gone next time you visit.  

Not that I blame them.  A degree is required for what is in many ways a menial job.  Dealing with sculpture inquirers can't be fun. The poor things probably get into it for the love of books and wind up hating anything and everything to do with books.

From the Complimentary Limo ride to the spectacular service and elegant food's...our night at the mansion was superb! The walk through the mansion to the front of the restuarant felt so long and maze-like but wewe finally made it there!

We were seated in the main dining area in one of the corner booths, which was a fabulous seat. Throughout the 3.5 hours that we were there we probably saw more servers than diner's, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. They just seemed so well-organized and everyone seemed on point.

We started the evening with a bottle of wine, and I was pretty surprised to see bottles under $100! I enjoyed the 4-course meal and the bday boy got the 6-course meal. I don't want to go through every course because we each got different items and just tried each others. I do, however, want to highlight some of the better items we enjoyed: 

Bread Cart: felt great to indulge in some carb-loaded goodness. 

Appetizer: my Foie Gras was amazing and the plating was spectacular. My hubby's carpaccio easily takes the cake for one of the best presentations I've ever seen...it was so colorfully done! 

Main: my farm roasted chicken was tender and so very delicious. 

Dessert: I enjoyed the ""Happy Birthday"" cake they brought out to us more than my own dessert...it was extremely good. 

I found the bread cart, cheese cart, and mignardises cart to be a bit overwhelming. Even though they take the time to go through each item with you it is still a little hard to follow. The key is to just remember the ones with the key ingredients that you like(which he will point out)....for me it was: milk, raisin, coconut, peanut butter for example. He put together a nice sampling of cheeses for us to try since we weren't too picky on it.

Without becoming a Mac commercial, let me just say that the Apple Store is MUCH cooler/better than any other electronics/computer store, and the one in the mall here is even more efficient than other Apple Stores I've been to in other cities. 

As has been mentioned before, the people who work at the Apple Store know EVERYTHING about the products they sell. But not only will they help you learn about their products; they'll help you fix problems you're having with other equipment and help point you in the right direction as far as ones you need to pick up. 

If you're a tech geek, you'll really love this place, 'cause you can fiddle around with all of their devices--you can see how the iTouch works, you can try out their newest laptop...it's all at your fingertips. And again, the staff can walk you through your purchase or even your perusal. 

Go there even if you don't need anything. If you're in the mall, it's a great place to waste some time or to re-connect with the technological advances going on. And, hey, you can always check your email there, too.",2008-10-06 17:20:29
JYikWp96SDKzDrDvST_oVg,HWLr60IBXAy9HD23W3Xmfg,jCpB1D_Hsc_dlF0ErNO-7w,4,0,0,0,"Kintori!!! Oh yes, it must be read with the three exclamation marks behind it. It's part of the Kinka Family chain group, you see; another sister restaurant to the raucous Guu Izakayas. Like, a darker & cooler Guu sister that smokes...meat on a grill.  

Yakitori in its literal translation is meat, but Kintori has veggies and other proteins on charcoal-flame licked skewers too.  The most surprising veggie standout for me was the Tokyo scallion, where the milder tastes comes to life through the charred, black grill lines.  

The meats still make up the major part of my meal though, since there's a much bigger meats menu.  They're all good, expertly and carefully watched over and turned over with precision. 

A couple of things to watch out for if you're a somewhat squeamish eater: the reba/Mennonite chicken liver is served rare on the inside, so don't order it if the idea makes you wanna toss cookies.  If you like it though, it's pretty awesome, especially when it's cooled down and takes on a silky texture. 

Second, the bonjiri.  What's up?  Chicken butt.  No, for realsies, it's the tip of the chicken tail slash literal chicken butt.  It has a sort of rubbery texture that only chewing on pure fat will give you.  I'm fine with it, but if you're used to a low-calorie diet, it may groce you out. 

Last tip: You may want to sprinkle some of the sea salt served on the side on some of the skewers. 

The only thing that deters me from giving Kintori 5 stars is the price.  I wish it were just a little less than the $2-3 per skewer range, considering the price of meats in Canada are not that high (in comparison to Tokyo anyway).  That said, you can literally see the hard work in the boiling hot kitchen though, so I consider it mostly payment for the service which is the case for eating out anyhow.

I settled for the deep fried shrimp spring rolls, beef brisket with crepe noodles and shrimp and ped pod dumplings. The spring rolls were good but with them being so greasy, I could not eat more than two. I guess my waistline is thankful for this. 

Beef brisket was extremely fatty. I hardly got any meat. They did however fill the bowl with crepe noodles. Meh...

Customer service at this corner suite at the mall was nice. It wasn't busy and the 2 workers were attentive and patient with the 4 of us (me, my 2 girls, and one of their friends).

The place was clean and the worker was helpful in directing us to the nearest bathroom (about 20 steps away).

Only surprise: the size small was too much! All of us struggled to finish passed half way. We should have ordered the mini. Now we know why it's on the menu. 

I paid $3.80 each. Sounds pricey until you start eating it. We definitely feel like we got our money's worth. Plus, the size small, when they fill it, towers over the top about 1-2 inches!

I can't promise I'll frequent this place (I mean, I DO have a waistline to consider), but I definitely recommend it.

Work buddy & I came to King's Kitchen right after arriving in Charlotte - she was looking for something farm to table-esque & had been here before & liked it a lot

Started w/ a couple of beers & man oh man do they have an awesome selection!  I chose the Duck Rabbit Stout & it was bold & creamy & had a lovely chocolate undertone - perfect for me!

Work buddy chose a darker IPA, as recommended by our waiter & he steered her right - she loved the balance of hops but no bitterness

Offering NO real veggie entrees except for ""Plate of Southern Vegetables"" which is a combo of 4 veggie side dishes & a biscuit ( pathetic! ), I got an appie & a side for my meal & chose the Sweet Potato Fritter and the Mac N Cheese

The fritters were awful - I was expecting something semi-light like a hush puppy but these were dense & heavy & completely over-fried to the point they were almost black & hot as napalm....totally burned my mouth throughout the meal - they never cooled down!  

Even so, these fritters were still raw on the inside - not sure how that could be accomplished.  There was way too much ginger & not enough sweet potato flavor & the honey dipping sauce which I suspected had a ton of corn syrup in it, due to its abnormally thick consistency, just put everything over the top

The Mac N Cheese came out in this teeny bowl & it also had a greasy consistency to it - no stringy pulls of cheese but a gloopy, congealed bechamel w/ strong white pepper flavor

And from those glowing descriptions, it's obvious I was not a fan of my ""meal"" at all - left over half & this is coming from a Southern girl who loves her comfort food!!  - 2 stars!

Work buddy got the Shrimp & Grits & it was classic NOLA / Southern deliciousness - creamy grits & they didn't skimp on the shrimp!  She was a fan - 4 Stars

yXpFyPMokvqAP9NxaM3XaA,3Av38uh8aHDvZMV_1eojQA,woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ,4,3,1,1,"So winding out the end of year in Pittsburgh and decided after flying in a little bit early to give Tako a try. I had heard quite a bit of mixed reviews to date and it had been on my bucket list for trying out so glad I was finally able to do so. Since I was in relatively early on a Sunday, there was no wait and there were plenty of seats to be found at the bar. I pulled up a chair as close to the right end of the bar as possible so I could get a glimpse of the chefs preparing the food. The décor is the whole dark/mysterious/casual vibe with the DJ like music playing in the background. 

They provide their menus in newspaper format with a list of separate specials if you desire to peruse. I will admit the prices are a bit steep here for the portion but where else can you get something like this in Pittsburgh. The menu is broken down into multiple small plates and then multiple varieties of tacos. They also have a relatively large selection of adult beverages and the bartenders are pretty knowledgeable even with the standard curve balls of ""surprise me with an awesome drink."" The tacos are a decent portion and if you do not eat tons, I could see one order of tacos and an appetizer being enough to satisfy the hunger. If you are super hungry then I could see two orders of taco doing the trick. The multia was a special and pretty solid. It came with mole and avocado. All ingredients were blended well together and I loved the freshness of the cilantro and onion sitting on top. It was a solid way to start the meal washed down with their version of an old fashioned. I followed up with waiting for my Korean tacos which came out quickly afterwards on a wooden board branded with the words tako. The tacos were well made and did not skimp on the ingredients. They were packed with flavors including kochujang and loved the cucumbers sliced into it. I would definitely recommend asking for the housemade hot sauce which adds a nice kick to the overall dish. I wrapped up with some lychee drink which was solid but the hummingbird at the end was the solid closer. 

All in all, I thought this place was great and im a fan of what they are doing. Not sure how easy it is to just swing by for a bite but definitely a place I will try to hit back up in the future. The bartenders were also super friendly and very helpful. Def a plus",2015-11-30 01:07:33

Garlic bread was bland/favor-less. Not worth the price. Caesar salad was also bland, small and wilted. Totally not worth the $11. (It used to be my favorite thing at Buca, but clearly the dressing is not the same nor is the overall quality). The meatballs were ""okay"" but not the normal spectacular-ness. The quatro al forno/stuffed pasta combo plate was also okay, but nothing like it used to be. We also got some wine, a Buca Chianti, and it was also not worth the price tag. Overall the $100 price tag of this meal was a complete rip off. It was worth more like $40. We should have gone to Olive Garden -- at least you get what you pay for there.

There are also a ton of gluten-free selections; the broad rice noodles here are something I ordered ... every time! Take note: those with nut-allergies should stay away as peanuts are served in quite a number of their dishes.

My only problem is that the dishes are somewhat small and the cooks were sparing with the amount of tofu and mock meat that went into each dish.  What I can commend is that every piece of kai lan, broccoli and sweet pea is a choice selection, you'll never get a bruised leaf or an overripe tomato in your dish. The vegetables here are organic, which bumps up the price a bit. Still, I'd be better satisfied if the portions better matched the prices charged.

The peppers, asparagus, and other veggies were grilled to perfection. Inside was also just the right amount of cream cheese and seasonings.  The potatoes were a nice colorful mix cooked just right.

The Some Like it Hot is an imaginative southwestern twist on breakfast.  It has two jalapeno corn cakes, three strips of spicy jalapeno infused bacon, and two eggs.  Whoa...this was amazing.  I put my two over medium eggs on top of the corn cakes and let the yolk run down all over.  This was heaven on earth...the warm yolk was a perfect compliment to the savory corn cake.

I was washing my hands in the restroom before eating, and witnessed a waitress not wash her hands and return to work. This kind of thing really grosses me out, especially because at this establishment, they cook for you at your table. There are some flies that kept landing on our food at the beginning. But once they began cooking the meats, the smoke kept them away. Still, gross. Also they mandate an 18% tip for a party of 5 or more. Usually it is 6 people or more that is considered a large party. Usually we tip them well here because they do cook for you, but I dont like being forced or told how much to tip, particularly when I am now questioning the cleanliness of this facility.

Ordering from their online site is a cinch and delivery is always a few minutes early, or on time to the minute.  Their delivery drivers are also professional and friendly as well.  

The food is always fresh and delicious each and every time, and it always comes with all the plates, napkins, utensils, ice, cups and other accoutrements needed to serve it too.  Among my personal favorite items from Jason's are their wraps, and in particular their vegetarian wrap with mushrooms, Asiago cheese, bell peppers and Romaine lettuce).  Their Chicken Alfredo pasta is just amazing for lunch on a cold day and another favorite item for a cold day is their Tomato Basil soup which is absolutely delicious and served with a side of soft bread.  

Another big plus about catering from Jason's Deli for work lunches is that you accumulate 'Deli Dollars' with each order and over the course of a year's worth of office lunches I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars to pay for all the food for my teenage daughter's 15th birthday party.  Then by the next year I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars once again to cater the food my baby daughter's 1st birthday.  It was wonderful to be able to hold each birthday party for the girls and not have to worry at all about preparing the food.

I had Jason's Deli catered in today and the only thing wrong with today's lunch was that the pasta salad was very oily (which isn't normal for them) but aside from that I have absolutely no complaints about today's lunch delivery...

The wait service for my last meal with a group of friends was better at 6:30 PM on a Saturday. We've got service from 3 different wait staffs. They were serving everybody else too. Not just us.

The food came out fast and the taste was right on this time. They were out of egg plant. We didn't tell them that 99 Ranch Supermarket was 2 doors down.

nKHCFNrVMS2qt3WuIblKpw,3cC726zwgerKNNasnidAww,QZFIdWmIWzL_3QNE6Qq10A,4,1,0,0,"Garbanzo offers up a fresh and healthier option in the Desert Ridge food court.  While it's prices aren't expensive,  I honestly would rather pay a couple dollars more and head across the street to Pita Jungle for some much better mediterranean food.  But if you're already in the district, want to avoid a wait, and/or don't feel like driving around, then Garbanzo is a more than suitable alternative.  Also; All of the employees were very friendly.  Every worker who was there on Saturday were just teenagers, but it really felt like they were going out of their way to make sure customers understood the concept of this new restaurant and had a good experience.

Ordering an entree is similar to Chipotle.  Pick your protein as chicken or steak.  Or go vegetarian with mushroom or falafel.  Choose between a pita, wrap, or plate.  Pick from an assortment of mediterranean condiments.  The food is good.  I went with a chicken pita.  I guess I'm traditional like that.  The pita is more dense than I would prefer, but I guess that keeps it from falling apart.

My wife had the chicken kabob.  It comes with hummus, rice, and a vegetable salad (pretty much just chopped up fresh cumbers and tomatoes) and a pita.  The chicken kabob itself was good.  It was cooked to order which was a pleasant surprise, but a little odd that we had to wait and extra 5 minutes for one of the meals.  But they did cooke the chicken and peppers perfectly. The plate is big, but it's filled mostly with the hummus and rice.  The hummus is okay,  not terribly flavorful, tastes a lot like a supermarket brand.  The rice and veggies were good.  The pita is the same that's used for the entrees.  Since it's so dense it doesn't work well as something to dip into the hummus.

I would say that Garbanzo is a solid 3.5 stars.  I'm rounding up to four since it's probably the healthiest option for fast food in Desert Ridge and the employees are so friendly.  I recommend at least giving it a try if you happen to be at the mall.",2014-04-29 23:24:45

I was late for breakfast on the way to work and curious to try their cronuts. Wait. WTF are cronuts you say? No not crow nuts. Not the nads of a bird. Not the testicles of Croatian or Cro-Magnon men either. Cronuts are croissant donuts. Wait for it. The Cronut™ brand and product is a registered trademark of Dominique Ansel Bakery internationally. There - so with that out of the way, Crack In The Box can't officially use that term to call them that. So I found myself feeling stupid when I actually went to the drive thru and asked for cronuts. Huhhh??? was the response I got. Oh. I mean ""croissant-doughnuts."" You know? That freaking pastry formerly known as a cronut? So then she understood and I could pay and GTFO and on my way to work. This location does the credit card slider on the outside so you don't have to give some sketchy degenerate your credit card to actually hold for too long - you just do it yourself. Extra star for that. Now I've never had the real trademark Cronut but I had something that resembles it at a convention once. These that I got from Crack In The Box were donut shaped and not croissant flakey at all. In fact, the outside was indistinguishable from a regular sugar donut. Well, maybe not THAT sugary but still sweet from some sugar and cinammon. I cracked open the package to make sure I actually got 3 croissant doughnuts and not anything else like a chicken head or any of the stuff you hear about in urban folktales/the internets. MMMM. It actually smelled nice and fresh and cinammony. So I get to work and instead of getting straight to work I'm taking pictures of my food. See photo - money shot/centerfold of a croissant doughnut doing the splits. Smelled great and is actually fluffy like a croissant in the middle. Had to try it once.

- Everything we ordered was delicious.  You can't go wrong.

- The menu they give you has a very small selection, but then there are a whole bunch of other options on chalkboards (like more options than are on the actual menu).   Now, I do usually hate a chalkboard, but these were pretty visible.  There is more than one and the place is small enough that you can see them from your seat without too much trouble.   
- BYOB, but the corkage fee is kinda high.  $5 for the first bottle and then $2.50 for each additional.   We had 6 bottles and I don't think he even charged for all, which helped.  
- Service was great.  Prompt and friendly, with good descriptions of the menu items.

Black pepper beef tenderloin - I'm pretty sure it was not beef tenderloin pieces, which sucks because I specifically paid extra for this item. There was a lot of broccoli and not a lot of beef either, and the beef was chewy, not tender.

Steamed rice - meh. it was ok. Just a little too soft and almost mushy in texture though.

Overall, average Chinese food. There's not many other options in the neighborhood unfortunately, but I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here.",2013-06-10 03:51:42

Since they don't take reservations, our group decided to head there early on this past Friday. Oh, by the way if you didn't know, this place is a private club with a membership needed to get in. I signed up online before it opened, but you can pay your $10 membership at the door before going in. Overall it was a pretty easy process to get in. The entrance is very unassuming as well, and it's in the backlot of the Park road shopping center, just look for a loading dock type area.

Once inside, we are led down a long dark corridor and the host greets us to take us through  another door and finally our table. The interior atmosphere is very classy and dark, kind of like someone's large fancy study or library that just so happens to have a bar in it. As others have mentioned, it can be a fairly boisterous space, and we noted that the volume definitely increased as more people filled in. While we needed to speak loudly, I never really felt like I was yelling or screaming. If anything, the dim lighting was more of a challenge to deal with initially, but the eyes adjusted. Now onto the menu, the drink list is extensive and I'm sure that they can make you pretty much anything with all the bottles that I saw. As a group, we tried the vesper, the hot box, negroni, the bi-plane, a Moscow mule, the final countdown and the front porch punch. All the drinks were well made, and my favorites were the negroni and Moscow mule. Some of the prices seemed marginally high, but nothing crazy and premium drinks demand a premium price. As for the food, this is the part of the experience that fell flat for me. We tried the gravlax, oysters, octopus, charcuterie, chicken skewers and beef tartar. Overall the concept seems to be small plate style. The gravlax and tartar were my favorites by far, but nothing really stood out. We received our oysters already dressed with horseradish and mignonette, as opposed to those being put on the side. The oysters were also a little warm, which may have been from the warm mignonette, I'm not sure. Either way, they were fine. Having all said that, the service is the last matter to cover. Overall, service was very good with some hiccups, such as twice food presented to us that was for another table and once when our food was presented to another table but ultimately made it to us. Also, they need a whisky/spirit list, as they apparently have an extensive list. And one last thing would be to explain the components of the charcuterie plate, which cheeses and meats are on the plate. I don't think that they were noted on the menu or by the server when the plate was put on the table. 

I know that this is a long review, but I really like the concept of Dot Dot Dot, so I want them to do well. At this point, I would be more inclined to stop in for drinks and maybe a snack as opposed to a full meal.

Last night was only their fourth night open, and I'm giving them a solid four stars.  The Becketts and partners Scott and Katie Stephens did a remarkable job with the renovations of what used to be ""That's Italiano.""  The environment is extremely comfortable and warm.  The staff was spot-on, starting with the hostesses.  And throughout our meal, Court, our server, made plenty of recommendations and answered all of our questions about the menu.  We happened to see a handful of friendly faces and friends dining while we were there as well.   

We started off with the mac n cheese with pancetta and the oven roasted organic root vegetables (both a bargain at 5 dollars each).  Next up was the romaine salad and brussel sprouts, which are not to be missed.  The pickled golden beets in the romaine salad were unique and delicious, as were the hot appetizers and sides.  When I couldn't place one of the vegetables, Court was right there with the answer for me: parsnips!

We paired our first course with the Pilsbury ""One Night Stand"" rosé and liked it so much, we had another round.

For our entrees, I had the blood orange glazed salmon and J went with the fork tender short ribs.  Both were large servings, especially the short ribs, and the description for these is perfect; no knife needed.  I actually liked the short ribs so much, that i ate more of that than I did the salmon, which had a bit too much orange glaze for me.  

As if that weren't enough food, we finished up with an order of the fig & pecan pie...it is served with a cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream, the perfect sweet ending to our meal.  The only suggestion that Jared had for this course, was to also offer a Root Beer Float.  Perhaps we'll see that on the menu in the future?!

Combining aspects of Malaysian, Japanese, Chinese, India, and Singaporean cuisine, if you and everyone that you are with are unable to find at least 10 irresistible menu items, then there are greater problems at play here.

The menu (which is actually a spiral bound BOOK) is filled with appetizing rice, noodles, curries, grilled meats, and sushi items.

I wanted something that had parking, was a quick takeout service and delicious.  Of course I found all three at this location.  Thai has its own allotted parking area but they share this with a Cleaners and a Travel Agency so although parking is available it can be very messy if three or four cars are moving at the same time in this small area.

Upon entering and from the outside I expected the place would have tables but it is solely a takeout place which was fine with me, I wanted something to nurture me while watching videos tonight.  And what I saw was a huge mouth watering menu and about 40 bubble tea options many using fresh fruit. Thairiffic!  Just to mention a few: watermelon, lychee, mango, banana, honeydew, coconut, jackfruit, kiwi and taro. 

Expect spring rolls and oriental salads, oriental soups, rice or vermicelli bowls and what Thai Tai is known for of course; subs! Your usual choices of lemon beef or chicken, tiger prawns, and vegetables.

Tonight I ordered a lemon chicken with tons of cilantro and a cantaloupe bubble tea with pearls.  When I got home and unwrapped my sub I was reminded at how large these are, approx 10 inches and for the same price I have paid for a half sub at Subway which is approx only about 5 inches.  

The bubble teas here are around 4.95 and there are places in Calgary that you can buy these for lesser prices but at Thai Tai it is served in quite a tall container.  All in all twelve dollars for my whole take out meal, so satisfying and so refreshing.",2009-11-26 07:08:59

Frankly, there was 25+ minute wait at the Boiling Crab, so we hit the Yelp app, saw some decent reviews on this place, and went to try it for ourselves.

Started with the lamb and chicken skewers. A few of the lamb skewers were served medium-rare, just in case you care about meat temps. Chicken was white meat, good quality and perfectly grilled. But, both the lamb and chicken were over-sprinkled with their signature orange seasoning salt. My first impression was, ""Salty!"" Got the grilled corn-on-the-cob and it also had the exact same seasoning salt on it, and too much of it for my taste. If I could order these things again, I would order them with 'less salt' as they really were doused with the stuff. For $5, you do get a generous number of skewers (8 per order I believe) so that is kind of cool.

Got the pot of cajun-inspired peel-n-eat, head-on shrimp. Garlic style, extra spicy. The 'extra spicy' spice level was a solid *hot*. But, the chili pepper flakes were the crushed, and not ground variety, which made the texture of the pot sauce not very fun to eat. Strangely gritty, actually. Like chewing on small, tough bits of bay leaves. This affected the in-pot corn cobs as well. I did love the chopped bits of garlic in the sauce, and I wish there were even more garlic in it as I ran out of garlic bits by the 10th or 11th shrimp.

The head-on shrimps themselves were large, and the *exact* shrimp count was 16 in my one pound order. Pretty standard. (Boiling Crab sometimes gives you 17 or 18 by accident; Hot & Juicy 16-17 but 5 of them are usually headless or total runts; District One only gives you 14.) Four of the Hot Feel shrimp were on the borderline mushy side - a pet peeve of mine when it comes to this dish. Hot & Juicy is the worst when it comes to this. I always end up enacting the cajun shrimp exchange program at Hot & Juicy when I show them the mushy ones.

Anyways - I did have a very slight allergic reaction to the Hot Feel shrimp about 30 minutes after dinner. Not a biggie, but worth noting. That does not happen when I eat the shrimp from the aforementioned competitors (even the sketchy Hot & Juicy).

Super nice staff, and pleasant environment. They've got TVs with 4 different sports channels which is cool. Potential - yes. Would I go back? Maybe. A *huge* difference between this place and say, Boiling Crab, is the good variety of things to eat aside from the pot-o-cajun seafood. Hot Feel and District One have this in common.",2014-03-26 10:27:35

Then I tried Lotus of Siam's lunch buffet which was even tastier (and don't forget all the accolades too), except that is only available monday-friday. I haven't had it in years now, since I work monday through friday- day shift. So, my sister told me about this place- said it was ""small, but good,"" I looked up reviews and decided on this place to celebrate my birthday with my side if the family. We were able to enjoy it on a saturday (the day after my actual birthday). When we reached the place, I recognized it, but it had been years and back then it was just a thai restaurant, not laos also- think 90s college days with one of my college friends (a longtime friend, she ended up being one of my bridesmaids BTW). 

My favorite thing here was the spring rolls with vermicelli noodles- let's just say, I had more than one. So very good- my BIL really liked them and asked if they were handmade from scratch. I had the pad thai- a basic thai dish, pretty good, ground chicken dishes- one of them was way on the salty side- even my mom noticed and said the same thing, beef with broccoli, beef salad (except the beef part was a little lacking), and I'm sure I'm forgetting some other dishes. I went back a few times, but it's not like there were any buttons popping. (The first few years of living here taught me to not overdo it a buffet.) Pretty good for $6.95 a pop. My sister's oldest really liked the chicken wings- fried. My husband liked the soup- there were several choices. Thai Tea comes in 3 sizes- small, medium or large.

Sure, the area is a little questionable, and it's a hole-in-the-wall- some reviewers here refer to it like it's a bad thing (large parties sit in the middle, while the booths are on each side of the walls). But the food was pretty good, and where we were sitting, we could see when the new steaming hot food was placed in the serving trays. Some items went fast! There was a decent crowd. 

I'd come back again. I don't really have thai food a lot, because my husband really fancies chinese food (had lots of it in my hometown, SF). Maybe on a half-day, I'll check out Lotus of Siam again since it's on my side of town.",2012-12-20 03:19:20

I've been here three times to their ""Vain"" events. It's usually three local drag performers and a headliner from Rupaul's Drag Race. The place itself is beautiful on the inside. There is a lounge area, a restaurant area and the main dance floor that's stands next to the amazing waterfall wall. There's also a second floor that overlooks the dance floor and has a separate bar. It's hard to describe the theme of the place but I would describe it as new age gothic. Once you go, you'll get what I mean.

I saw my wife climb a 30 ft wall, and I actually got a up a 22 footer myself. We and two of our friends had a great time. 

Now, the pluses. Friendly staff, lots of walls of varying types, from the basic beginner boulder-type wall, to various sheer inclines, overhangs, and different walls varying in intensity and difficulty. Chris and his guys were super-supportive and helpful, and overall, that was very positive. 

On the down side, the gym's a little bit hard to find. It's in an old warehouse complex that used to be a steel processing plant off of old St. Clair in Euclid. You have to go around back of the place and there's very little signage, so you might have to look. Also, the place is a little dusty and shopworn, BUT, to me, that only enhances the feel that this place is SERIOUS. We saw people practicing free-climbing and working on their strength training, and the place is not for the wimpy. 

In addition, the equipment, while safe, is a bit shopworn; again, you'd expect this from a place that does a lot of business. 

Overall, I think that this place is grand; it's simple, to the point, and what's more, for a guy like me, it helped me get past a bit of my fear of heights, and that's worth it all. 

The prices aren't terrible,and include shoes, helmet and harness, and they're constantly trying to improve the place.

We didn't mention it to management because it is what it is, but we won't go back and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. They don't offer many breakfast combos or platters, so you're forced to order pancakes separate from eggs and a side. I don't recall the name of my combo but I had two scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, grits, and pancakes. My turkey sausage was awfully dry and lacked flavor. The grits tasted good and it's pretty much impossible to mess up scrambled eggs so the meal was decent. NOT $15+ worth!! I ended up taking my pancakes to go but didn't have an appetite for them when I got home (probably because I kept thinking about how ridiculously overpriced they were) and they ended up in the garbage.

The entire service start to finish only kept getting worse. We had 4 different people not sure which one was our waiter. I ordered a mixed drink of the menu and the guy had no clue what I was ordering and said he never heard of it. I had to explain and show him the menu. The forgot to bring rice three times after asking a new person brought it out. They forgot a entree and all of our egg rolls. In our party of 6 all the food came out separate. 

I requested a drink refill twice and had to go to bar to order a drink and pay separately. It was horrible.

The food and service were pretty good.  Our waitress hopped to it when we said we were in a hurry.

Bread basket: (yes, I consider this a course) disappointing. I like my bread warm and fresh from the oven. These offerings were too cold to enjoy. 

Appetizers: got the romaine salad, gala apple salad, and the tiger shrimp tamale. I could have skipped all these dishes and saved more room for dessert. The tamale was good, but the flavors didn't have me singing to the high heavens... And the salads left much to be desired. The romaine salad lacked dressing and the croutons were way too soggy. The apple salad was mostly just chopped apple so it got too filling. 

Main course: definitely get the lamb chops or the glazed salmon. Both were perfectly cooked and I licked my plates clean. Delish!! However, skip the collard greens. They weren't worth the stomach room. But the table next to ours were raving about the Brussels sprouts, so I wish I gave those a try.

Period! We live very close by, and South Boulevard is FULL of non-descript Greek places (Skyland, Greystone, Light Rail, etc.). However, all pale in comparison to owner Chris's tasty and authentic Greek food. Take his Gyros, for example. He toasts his Pita's with butter and then serves them to you hot. Oh so tasty!

We took my VERY fussy Mother-in-Law here and she said that her Pork Souvalaki was THE BEST she's ever had! And THAT is a compliment, because she is surrounded by Greek food in her Montreal neighborhood.

Yes, this is NOT a ""romantic"" place. It does look a little worn down from both the inside and outside. But, it's the FOOD that is the star here! Ask Chris what his daily special is, and order it. He usually makes a whole-roasted Greek Chicken with potatoes, and that is EXCELLENT!

One major plus is that they do actual combos, which offer you more in quantity than just picking from a la carte. For example, if you buy individually, it's by the pound while the combos can range from 1.4-1.75 lbs depending on what you get. You get your money's worth alone from that. I was absolutely stuffed. 

I really like that if you do order the combo, they serve it to you in pots which I've come to learn is SO much better than the tiny bags restaurants usually stuff your seafood in. By letting all the seafood spread out flat inside the pot, it's able to soak in the sauces more and just flesh the flavor out to its max potential!

The urban mix sauce is also my favorite sauce out of all the similar restaurants in the valley. The flavors just meshed together so well and left me wanting more even when I was completely stuffed. I left as a very very happy costumer.

I started off with a glass of milk (skim) while my hubby opted for dr. pepper. FYI- they only have bottled sodas, cute but at $6 a pop too damn expensive! My parents arrived & my dad started off with a bloody mary & my mom got her usual sprite, hers may have been a tad cheaper at $4 but still ridiculous. They really should invest in a soda fountain, just sayin. For apps we ordered the quesadilla (which had bacon, onions, potatoes & cheese with a delicious drizzle) & the bruschetta. The quesadilla was amazing, I wish I ordered 2 more for my entree! The bruschetta was just ok. For our entrees: dad & hubs ordered the breakfast enchiladas, mom ordered their signature mushroom dish & I ordered the fried egg & bacon sandwich. The boys enjoyed their enchiladas, mom didn't care for her mushroom dish & my sandwich was just ok. Disappointed with my entree I wanted to order dessert, but no one else did so I opted for a bag of their chocolate & bacon caramel popcorn to take home. I loved the popcorn, the sweet with a lil bit of salt from the bacon was such a yummy combo.

What annoyed me about this place were the prices, even with my $30 coupon our total came out to $87 (not including tip). Not too bad, about $30 per person, but my dad was the only person who got cocktails (2) & the food was pretty average at best. I'm glad I finally tried this place out but I don't think I'll be returning.",2011-05-11 00:08:20

I'm a little indifferent about the location. There's a small parking lot and additional street parking, so if it's busy, you might have to drive around to find some parking like we did. Even so, we found a street parking spot within 5 minutes, so it's not really a hassle. 

Inside Vesta, you can see how it appeals to a younger, more hip crown. It's modern, and the decor is clean and bright. Usually, you'll see people working on their laptops or just meeting up.

This little bakery and cafe has won me over!  Hands down!

I stopped in since I was in the neighborhood going to a friend's house and I had been wanting to check it out based on the other reviews.  I ended up with three cupcakes: creme brulee, chocolate molten, and red velvet.

Some thoughts:

** All of the desserts displayed were immaculate.  The presentation is amazing and very professional.  Any of them would be perfect to take over to someone's house or devour solo.  Chocolate and wine anyone...?

** You won't break the bank here.  The prices are very reasonable and worth every penny.  These aren't your local grocer's baked goods, we're talkin' gourmet here!

** The cupcakes had amazingly great flavors, but were a little too rich for me.  I like the cake part more of cupcakes and I only needed about half of the frosting, but that doesn't make for the same great presentation.  For those frosting mongers out there, you won't be disappointed.  Hook up the sugar IV and enjoy!

** Slade might just be the most genuinely nice, courteous, passionate-about-his-work entrepreneur I've found in this city.  He really takes it up a notch when it comes to personal service.  He answered any questions I had, told me about what's up and coming soon, and you could just tell he really takes pride in what he does.

** The variety is bonkers here and I can't wait until I am back again to try something else from that delectable case o' desserts.

** Slade has a blog and teaches cooking classes, so take advantage of both.  I plan to eventually!

Thanks Slade for a great experience here!  I will definitely be back very soon. =)",2008-03-12 22:23:56

Service was upscale. Ambiance was ok. It was a bit noisy and there were many more kids than I would have imagined. A lot of AZ tuxedos (polo/button down and shorts with sandals). 

It was cool to see the chefs cooking your meal in front of you! We had a white sangria and a strawberry margarita. Both were very good, but I don't think my marg had much tequila. 

The cheese plate was exceptional, the pairings were spot on. Be careful, the blue cheese is very strong, so that might be off putting for some. We both like a good funky cheese so it was all good. My fave was the goat cheese and tomato spread.

For dinner I ordered the chicken and the man ordered the ribeye. My chicken was surprisingly very delicious and moist, as were the sides. My green beans were a little crunchy for me, but still good. The steak and gouda mac were fabulous! High quality beef cooked very well.

I ordered duck fried rice and papaya salad. The salad was OK, a small portion, nothing very spectacular. I guess since it cost only $5.95, I can't be disappointed.

We started with the ahi tuna poke. It has sesame oil which I personally love so we really liked this dish. Tuna tasted fresh and no funny fishy taste that some tuna dishes leave you with. 

We had the gnocchi dish with a very flavourful and cheesy tomato sauce, as well as a wagyu beef sauce pasta dish. Seems like the chef tasting menu, as well as their regular menu changes quite often as I don't see it on the menu online. Both pasta dishes were full of flavour and extremely good.

Tried the green tea parfait. It was small but if you are a fan of matcha, you would definitely enjoy this. Also tried the tiramisu which was also on the smaller side but presented beautifully and tasted great. 

The restaurant itself is a bit awkward. I think the layout is a little bit weird and I think it only holds under 40 people. But I think that's also why this place works; they have an open kitchen where they cook everything right there and serve it to you right away.

The casino floor is nicer and more open than the rest of the casinos on Boulder Highway. They have a large selection of table games and machines. Their sports book is pretty usual to, with less TVs than most books have. They're also less busy than Sam's Town and Boulder Station if you don't like crowds.

They give you freeplay three times a week, which is probably their biggest plus. I would play here over the Stations anytime. Their payouts are about the same as the Stations, which are pretty typical for local Casinos. Sam's Town does offer better payouts, but their players club isn't as generous, so the call is yours on which you'd rather gamble at.

The biggest downside to the Cannery is their lack of dining options, are really anything else besides the casino. They don't have a theater or bowling alley, and they only have their cafe, deli and steakhouse to eat at. They just closed their buffet and changed their menu at their steakhouse ""Carve"".

The cafe and deli are good, but the new menu for Carve isn't nearly as good as it used to be. Heck, I don't think you can even call it a steakhouse anymore, as they only have prime rib and filet mignon now. No sirloin, no New York, no ribeye. Just a shame considering they used to have the best steaks on Boulder Highway.

Sadly, we only come here anymore to play or freeplay and get food at the deli. There is no reason to come here besides just gambling, so if that's all you want to do then stop by.",2017-06-11 21:56:25

Arriving at your table hot, and made fresh to order - the dumplings are delicious and consistent. The texture of the dumpling themselves, just right. Not chewy or overly thin.  I only wished they also made xiao long bao. There are quite a variety of dumplings, featuring pork, leeks, chicken, chive or a combination of those ingredients and more.  You are bound to find a dumpling that you will like.  You can have your dumplings steamed or pan fried, it's up to you. 

Another favourite of mine that they offer is the  cumin lamb, and the jellyfish salad with diced cucumber over a bed of soy sauce and sesame seed oil.  The lamb is absolutely wonderful, a fine balance between the spices that do not overpower the senses yet fragrant upon being served. A must have for all lamb lovers!

The food was average.  The Potato Skins were bland and quite small.  The Cheese Sticks were just OK.....so were the Nachos.  For a sports bar type lounge, that surprised me.  Usually, they get the bar food down pat.  

The service was so/so too.  One visit, it was good....the other it was bad.  There are too many other choices in town.

After about an hour and no show, I called them back. They said they normally only operate on the strip and in Henderson and that they hadn't gotten a driver to take the call yet. By the way, the destination was even further from the strip than my house. 

Why didn't they tell me that from the start. They had my address and knew where I lived. I said fine, just let me know when you're coming. In the meantime I called another cab company. They said 40 minutes to an hour so I figured I'd just wait. 

After about another hour went by, I called them again. They said they still didn't have a driver taking the call. They asked If I had called another cab company and when I said yes, ""only to get an estimate on time"". Whittlesea stated, ""you can't do that"". 

Anyway, I got a call from my mechanic stating they couldn't wait anymore around 4:30 p.m. I had to call Whittlesea back to tell them forget it. At that time they still didn't have a driver assigned.

How much do you want to bet if I told them my destination was the strip, I could have gotten somebody. Guess what, in the customer service industry sometimes you have to take jobs that don't always pay as much.  

I told them I'd have to pick my truck on on Monday and sure the hell wouldn't call them for that  to take me anywhere, EVER.

I will definitely be back to give them one more chance but the initial visit's first impression left me wanting more, with the picture perfect appeal of every nook and cranny is not enough to draw me back asap. Side note, I would definitely be back here sooner or before Chatime or Ramen Hashi haha.

Walking up to the wooden door that marks this place just reminded me of a Harry Potter quote, ""If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask."" There is no obvious sign like a normal business, leaving those wondering where it is, but just go with your gut feeling when you see the wooden door. 

When you walk in, you are greeted with a very bright and picturesque industrial space. Nice air conditioning and air flow, perfect for summer. The signature piece of this place is the green house in the center where the small prep area kitchen is housed. I don't recall being greeted as the cashier was busy explaining/helping a group of 5 at the register. 

Luckily the wait to place my order was not long. Looking at the menu, I was disappointed as the desserts I wanted were hand written that it was not available until ""3pm."" Which also explains why the bread/pastry case didn't display the desserts. 

I place my order for DanCoffee with is your choice of flavors (vanilla, white chocolate, condense milk, honey) and a couple other options which I cannot remember off the top of my head. I requested condensed milk and asked if they can do almond milk, which she 
gladly informed me they could. While I wait for 3pm to roll around, I ordered a charcoal bun. I asked the cashier if it had a filling to which she said no and described that it was a yeast bun with activated charcoal mixed in (which I know what it is and appreciate she gave me that information, so kudos to her giving me the explanation) but I just wanted to know if there was a filling which on turn I presented my next question if there was a spread available. She said there was a sweet cream that can come with it and I requested for it. I then paid, given a number by way of a cute little pail with a painted number on it. 

After a few minutes of waiting for my food, same aforementioned barista comes in search of me to ask me again what flavor I wanted for my coffee like I never told her. I politely requested for condensed milk again. (In my head I'm thinking .. NO)

Now comes the food being delivered: charcoal bun with no cream and the coffee with printed latte art saying ""Legends Are Born In May."" Charcoal bun is nothing special, just for the color and ""the gram."" In my head, I am thinking why my bun was more wrinkled compared to the girl's charcoal bun right next to me was smoother. Hey. I know why. Great that they bake at different intervals of the day to keep the product fresh is what I would assume l. 

I asked the food runner where the butter was and she just said something along the lines of ""Oh okay"" and walked away after dropping off my order. I also mixed the latte art and tasted the coffee.... not that good. Typical bitter coffee taste with minimal sweetness, especially with the requested condensed milk flavor.

That kind of response, I knew right away that I was not going to get my cream, so I took it upon myself to go back up to the counter. I asked the person who seemed to be in charge for am extra side of the sweet cream spread. I told him she never told me it was an extra charge and I don't care because an upsell is an upsell. If I asked for it and it normally doesn't come with it, I will pay for it, but at least train employees to say such things. I told him that's fine I'll pay but it was something I asked her for and never received. He was very nice and gave it to me free of charge, however I wish I saved the receipt to make sure she actually charged me for it or not. 

With the 1/4 filled shot glass of condensed milk to fix the lack of flavor requested on my coffee I am satisfied. The sweet cream for the bun was much needed as it was just a typical flavored bun that needed a spread to go with my coffee. Now that it's 3:11pm, I don't know if I want to order the desserts now! Maybe next visit aftet 3pm.",2018-05-27 17:44:38

The Matador (a cinnamon mocha) is as good as it gets - iced or hot.  I find myself craving them... and nothing else will substitute.

The route is very scenic even beautiful at times. There's plenty of path to visit, almost 15 KMs worth of it and its of good quality. The route is urban but surrounded by trees and buildings that went the extra length to be visually appeasing. Very cultural activity if you want to explore Montreal.

Most of the terrain is flat with some hills, nothing too difficult. Several maps to check where you're located and a lot of stops to enjoy your time, take a breath and so forth.

You can walk it, jog it, run it. I went with the healthy activity of renting a bike for a few hours. Grabbed food from Atwater market and had a picnic.

The kitchen is at the front of the restaurant when you first walk in with the host stand on the edge of the kitchen (interesting).  One of my only gripes is the decor in this place. I am not an interior designer or anything and not everything has to be super chic but this place is just bland.  White walls, two pieces of art, cheesy chairs. This place has so much potential just needs some CHARACTER! 

I was starving so I order their mushroom bisque (even though I never eat creamy soup) and it was heavy but delicious! I ordered the crab cakes and YUM! Big chunks of crab meat!!! Delicious and HUGE. 

I also had two bloody marys during the meal as well which were very spicy and tasty. 

My dad got their Banana Creme Pie Ice Cream which was AMAZING! Their list of interesting ice cream flavors was impressive (even my dad was impressed and he is an absolute ice cream connoisseur)

If I go there it's normally to go to the Apple store, Puma or Urban Outfitters. This mall offers PLENTY of upscale stores for the more ""money ain't a thang"" shopper.  It amazes me, no matter how bad the economy is, or how high Charlotte's unemployment rate is, this mall stays busy constantly.

This has one of the better food courts of any of the other local malls.  You can just about find something to suit anyone's taste. They even have a Yoforia!

The burrito was mediocre. It was smothered in green sauce that was pretty good but the inside looked and tasted like I was at Chipotle.  It needed more flavor. 

The steak fajitas were delicious. The meat was tender and cooked just right. They were served with corn tortillas.

Upon doing so, I came across several reviews on YELP and BlogTO recommending several places. The Chickery was one place that stood out with several positive reviews so...I decided to give it a try and see for myself! 

My friend and I really enjoyed the buttermilk marinated chicken fingers here. They were not too greasy (almost dry on the outside) and very tender on the inside. It was also obvious that the fingers were hand breaded - unlike most places who serve pre-frozen fingers. The fingers also had a slight crisp to them and a bit of black pepper seasoning (but nothing too noticeable). They also came with a delicious side of gravy (or a great selection of other sauces. I chose gravy because it wasn't extra $$) and shoestring fries, which tasted similar to McDonalds fries, all for $12. The portions were also fairly generous (they sometimes add an extra finger or two depending on who is working). The Chickery also serves naturally raised, hormone free chicken, which is probably why it is a bit pricier than other chicken places. Overall, I would definitely come back here for the fabulous finger taste and quality ingredients.

On the whole, I think Banknote is a fine pub and probably one of the better ones in its area.  The Wheat Sheaf (across the street) is more ideal for a pint-and-wings-night, blue-collar-with-a-hint-of-taste experience, where Banknote makes for a fine pub when you're out for a business lunch or some other dressier occasion.  Portions are sometimes low, but their food is normally very good.

However, my recent experience to enjoy some martinis left me disappointed.  Bartender Dan is a knowledgeable, classy, entertaining fellow with an insight into what's good and enjoyable, so I have to believe that it's the owners who keep one of Dan's hands tied around his back. 

Gordon's is the gin of choice when you order a standard gin martini, and to my palate, Gordon's is like drinking medicine.  Over the months, I've also noticed that the sizes of their martinis have been gradually decreasing.  That seems to be even more the case should you order with a higher-end gin, such as Hendrick's, which barely filled half my glass (yes, olives included).  For the price, Banknote simply isn't giving you your money's worth when it comes to martinis.

But don't blame Dan.",2013-09-23 22:02:55

Service: Was absolutely great!  The guy we had was very cordial, made sure our glasses were always full (big plus) and was very pleasant.  Towards the end of our meal, the manager took our leftovers and personally placed them into individual boxes (YES!). 

Food: The sauce that accompanies a lot of the dishes I got the spring rolls which were perfectly crunchy and flaky without destroying the contents.  The drunken noodles were a yelp favorite? but really wasn't that great.  It was like a 80:20 ratio of vegetables/meat to noodles and the noodles were more like sheets.

The food is pretty good here.  My favorite items are the Pulled Pork Quesadilla, Hickory Smoked Wings, and Rueben.  

The Pulled Pork Quesadilla surprised me...I've never had one before that I liked, but theirs is fantastic.  It's also very filling.  I don't recommend getting it as an appetizer unless you have 3 or 4 people.  If you eat two pieces of it, you'll be full.

The Hickory Smoked Wings are very good...and addicting.  They have a sharp, smoky flavor and the Meat is moist and holds the flavor well.  I highly recommend trying these.

The Rueben is pure heaven.  They use Marbled Rye here, which is my favorite.

Overall, this place does a good job.  They have friendly servers and there's plenty of big screen TV's all over the place, so it's awesome to watch a game.

Overall, we were all left with kind of a ""meh"" experience.  Our server seemed pretty disinterested and slow.  I think the low point was someone ordered a steak medium rare (for $38).  What came out was a well done and COLD piece of meat.  It looked like a hockey puck. 

When he sent it back, no apology...and no change in the bill.  I at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say ""We've taken it off the bill"" or SOMETHING.  Nope.  He sat there watching the rest of us finish our entrees before his replacement steak arrived.

The rest of the entrees were good and I would go back.  But probably with lowered expectations.",2012-05-13 18:36:59

J'ai trouvé la nouvelle adresse bien jolie à l'intérieur. Par contre, la terrasse extérieure, surtout celle en avant du restaurant a vraiment besoin d'amour, de plantes, fleurs, etc.

I have been here just one time before and both times the food and the drinks were excellent. Although Senor Tequila is located in a strip mall, they have recently expanded and the space inside is beautiful and spacious. Sitting outside on the tiny sidewalk still feels a little bit odd, however. 

Sometimes, I can be swayed to love a Mexican food place even if the food is a little bit lackluster, IF they serve amazing chips and salsa. Unfortunately, the chips at Senor Tequila are light, crispy, and freshly made but they are not salted. I hate that. Thankfully, my food has been so delicious both times that I have eaten there that I will overlook the chip issue.  

My second favorite part about a Mexican restaurant is, of course, the margarita! Senor Tequila does not disappoint. They are a nice size and have great flavor.

I left the onions on as it was my wife who asked me to order without onions.

The pizza was just average. The crust was kind of soggy.

The BYOS includes 4 toppings and then every one after that is an extra 79 cents. The dressings, OMG, I've never seen so many options!! They put 2 dressing with each salad that you can choose from or you can be adventurous and try your own! Beware, some of the dressings are spicy! 

I originally got the palm beach salad but I didn't realize the dressing was spicy. I can usually had me a bit of spice but this was intense so I had to ask for a new one.

Last minute reservations were made easily online.  Met up for dinner with Daniel O. and his sister.  They arrived just before me and started the night off with a pitcher of Sapporo ($17).

I got a hearty Japanese welcome when I arrived (similar to Guu but that's probably where the similarities end).  Kingyo's dining room was spacious and relatively quiet, only a few tables where filled but these got snatched up as the evening progressed.  We were seated near the wall with all the potential seizure-causing video game machines.

We ordered:

- Spicy Soft Shell Crab Sui Choy Salad ($11.80)
- Garlic Tuna Tataki & Ponzu Jelly ($8.20)
- Ume Seaweed Hotate Carpaccio ($10.80)
- Stone Grilled Beef Tongue ($10.20)
- Famous ""O-Sho Restaurant"" Karaage with Magic Powder ($8.60)
- The Legendary Chicken Wings by ""Kinchan"" ($8.20)
- Pork Tantan Ramen ($8.20)

The dishes were all delicately prepared and beautifully presented especially the hotate carpaccio (scallops) and tuna tataki.  

The karaage and chicken wings were both deep fried, but not greasy.  The soft shell crab salad was one of my favourites - tangy dressing with crunchy greens, could have used a bigger piece of crab though.  

The grilled beef tongue was just okay, probably more novelty as you can grill it on a hot piece of stone that accompanies the dish.  

We opted for a second pitcher of Sapporo rather than ordering dessert.

Out back in the minimalistic patios, it's quite nice even under the blistering afternoon sun. This was going to be a good one I felt. The menu just looks fantastic with interesting items and of course their own signature Lil' Baci dishes.

How can anyone resist gourmet meatballs? Especially one with their own name on it. With alluring flavours like truffles and turducken how can anyone possibly resist?

Two words would describe these balls; unfulfilled potential. Turducken in a ball sure sounds a lot tastier than it did. While the ball was tender it seriously lacked in the flavour and texture department. I wish they had used some herbs to elevate the flavours. The mish-mash of duck, chicken and turkey was difficult to decipher; what am I eating really? It all tasted like chicken in the end. Somehow, meatballs were void of any substantial meat flavours or that meaty texture. The cream sauce that it's bathed in is well...creamy. Void of much salt, herbs or any flavours for that matter. But perhaps the greatest disappointment of all came down to the duck fat potatoes. I could live or die by those words. The very thought of this stuff gets my pulse racing a bit and sweat coming out of my pores. Not these potatoes. Dried and void of any flavours is really the theme here. Last but not least, it was like salt on the wound to have my egg fully cooked; yes, a pan fried egg with a yolk solid as a snooker ball. I was confused and in a bit of disbelief but long behold my partner has her eggs the same way. Perhaps, I am just bringing drama but I haven't met anyone who would ask for their egg yolks well done in my life recently.

It saddens me a little that such a fantastic space with a cute name, great menu items and fantastic service would serve up mediocrity so well.",2016-08-10 20:14:12

Its definitely a nice environment, its huge and has a lot of seating choices; bar, table, party room etc. which adds to the experience. Another great thing about All American Pub is that they have daily drink specials which are usually a great deal. A few Sundays ago I went and they had 2$ mimosas! So this is definitely something to keep an eye out for!

As far as the food, I wasn't extremely impressed. It was less than I expected, I got a buffalo chicken wrap and I almost couldn't eat it because I kept biting into fatty pieces of chicken. And the portion size was much smaller than I expected as well.

I had been here previously and had a burger which wasn't terrible so if I were to go back I'd probably stick to that again. 

If you like football, this is the place to go. During football season every Sunday All-American pub is packed so if you do show up throughout the day you'll be on a wait. But it's usually not too long, about 15-20 minutes and the service is pretty quick for how packed it usually is.

I love the flavor of the salsa that comes with the complimentary chips to start the meal. The Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos are delicious. It's hard to go wrong with bacon, loads of cheese, and jalapenos. The Zonkey Nachos are huge and were more than enough for three of us to share as an appetizer. We all loved the flavor of the sauce on the nachos and that the toppings were evenly covering the nachos. I could make a meal of just the nachos.

On my first visit the tacos didn't wow me. They weren't bad, but not the best tacos I've ever had. On my most recent visit I had Our Famous Pink Taco and thought it was delicious. The taco was a little on the greasy side, but everything in the taco worked well together. Our waitress said tacos could be mixed and matched. I'd recommend getting this as one of three tacos since it's on the heavy side. 

The Churro dessert was so yummy! It was served as churro bites filled with caramel and topped with a nice scoop of ice cream. Our waitress overheard us talking about my friend's birthday and later appeared with a complimentary and delicious dessert. Nice touch!",2018-07-15 16:06:49

We decided to grab lunch here too and were not disappointed. The restaurant was pretty dead when we were there around 11 on a Thursday but that is probably to be expected on a weekday. I am sure they are packed on weekends. I had the Cuban Sandwich and was really happy with it. Any they gave me soo many fries with it that I couldn't even eat them all. The waitress and manager were great checking on us just the right amount of time. We were all really happy we got lunch here too. 
Now for the shooting part. After eating in the restaurant we went back out front and checked in. Each of us had to signup for a membership to play ($5/person). Then it was $25/hr. There were 6 of us and we split the cost evenly so it came out to being $10/person. We were given a case and walked to a shooting gallery. In the case was 2 handguns and a battery for a rifle. The host walked us through how to operate the guns and system. The fact that we could shoot 2 people at a time was great so we were able to pair off. And taking turns helped give our arms or hands a break from having to pull the trigger so much while playing. (The zombie games were pretty fun but requires a lot of trigger pulls).

The Food Truck Festival welcomed us with a hot dirt lot filled with thousands of people standing in zig-zaggy Disney Land-esque lines with maybe 20 - 25 food trucks.  The promotions for this event stated ""over 30"" trucks would be there, but I guess that doesn't matter since you wouldn't be able to try all of them anyhow.  Each line was 50+ people deep and took 20 - 30 minutes of standing in one to get a bite size sample. 

You had to stand in THREE lines to get a beer. One for ID check. One for wristband. One for beer. 

For some reason, children were admitted for free - this created a mess of strollers trying to push through lines and unattended children running around, bumping in to people. 

The Mister and I were here for 2 hours and tried itty bitty samples from four trucks.  I was so disappointed and frustrated in this event that I asked for a refund.  I was presently surprised that that process was very painless, basically no questions asked. The staff and cooks were all very friendly and did a great job, even though they were all in way over their heads.

I cannot remember the last time I had a complaint about a hotel, and this place makes me want to write a boatload of letters.  I'm actually still cooling off enough from our recent visit to write their corporate office.

Without going into long drawn out details, describing the repeated customer service failures we experienced from the time we arrived until the time we left,  I'll simply state my issues:

They have terrible customer service.  They wouldn't know the phrase customer service if it had given birth to them.  Customer service came here to die.  If you come here looking for customer service, expect to die here alone.  The only people that are nice or even remotely FRIENDLY at this hotel are the ladies working the Bingo counter.  The attitudes of everyone, from the valets, to bellman, front desk, and floor workers, are awful. AW.FUL.  Rude, snotty, condescending, discriminatory, disgusting.  No one will try and help you, will lift a finger to be of assistance to you, nor will you be treated decently. 

They treat the disabled horribly.  They give zero consideration to the disabled (and when I say disabled, I am referring to the obviously disabled who are confined to a wheelchair).  They provide the basic ADA requirements (which they have to by law) for accessibility.  Beyond that, their attitude toward the disabled is awful.  I was embarrassed FOR them.

Their beds are really hard, and not comfortable at all.

It's pretty ghetto.  Since this is an off-strip and 'cheaper' hotel, you have to deal with some ghetto people in/around the hotel and casino.  Ghetto people who are drunk.

Also, the buffet is gross.  Save your money.

When you ask for their corporate address, to send a letter, they refuse to give it to you and give you a business card of the front desk manager.  When they ask how your stay was (in a completely generic and insincere way) during checkout, and you say it wasn't good, they interrupt you before you can say why (in just as a generic and insincere way) and reply, 'oh, sorry to hear that'.

On the plus side, their casino was okay and we won a little bit of money on slots.  Bingo was also a lot of fun.  Those ladies deserve a trophy up there.  So sweet, so kind, so friendly.

All in all, I've had better service at every single hotel in Vegas I've ever stayed at.  I've had better service at the dry cleaners. I stayed at Southpoint to evaluate their hotel for a corporate function.  I would never book an event there, or recommend that anyone I know stay here.  Stay at Green Valley Ranch, it's off-strip as well, way nicer, and they are nice to their patrons.  

Check out bingo, though.",2014-02-20 21:35:11

They don't shine in any one particular thing but everything is fairly edible overall. The problem is that the food is severely overpriced for the portion and quality of food you get (although this seems to be the rule in Calgary).

Also, don't expect amazing service. The servers seem to be there more for eye candy than for actual service. Sometimes this is okay and sometimes this really blows.

2xM_OVDZNC8p0UURlKYVRA,le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,5,6,1,2,"Rx Boiler Room was high on the fiancée and my list to try while in Vegas.  We'd previously dined with my parents at RM Seafood and had a very memorable meal in the upstairs fine dining space that Rx Boiler Room replaced.  We'd also previously sampled craft cocktails conceived by Nathan Greene, Rx Boiler Room's lead bartender, when he was behind the bar at Vanguard Lounge.  Needless to say, we had high expectations for the food and drink in their new setting.  

We arrived right when the doors opened since we had tickets to the 7:30 Zumanity show, but wanted to have a light dinner beforehand.  We were met by one of the friendly,  attractive, young, corset-wearing hostesses who guided us to the lounge after stating our preference to sit at the bar.  Much has already been written about the steampunk aesthetic of the place, let me just say I get it and enjoyed the casual and whimsical approach it takes with regards to its food and drink.  If anything, it also means plenty of corset-wearing hostesses, servers and bartenders.  

We started off with drinks.  I had the Smoked Whiskey and Coke.  I liked the use of visually appealing, cleverly repurposed use of an empty Crystal Skull vodka bottle to be the vessel for smoking the George Dickel whiskey.  The Dickel picked up the cherry wood smoke, but was not overpowered by it.  The smoked whiskey was nicely balanced with the not overly sweet house made cola.  It was my kind of whiskey drink!  We split orders of the Braised Oxtail Croquettes Dijonnaise ($9), Rx Fish Tacos in Taro Root Shells ($12), and the Shellfish Shepherd's Pie ($30).  Croquettes were perfectly fried to a golden brown without a hint of greasiness.  The braised oxtail inside was rich, meaty, and savory.  Although they were served with a tasty lemon aioli, they truly didn't need any additional adornment.  Given Chef Moonen's expertise with sustainable seafood, it was a no-brainer for us to have something from the sea.  Three taro root taco shells were filled with a noticeably fresh Kampachi tartare garnished with grapefruit.  While the tacos were a delicious appetizer, they were fairly small.  The Shepherd's Pie was a much more appealing, aquatic spin on a classic dish, containing a generous amount of exceedingly fresh sea scallops, King crab, shrimp and topped with chive whipped potatoes.  Every spoonful scooped from beneath the relatively thin layer of potatoes came up filled with perfectly cooked shellfish.  

Our experience was made complete when Chef Moonen stopped by to ask how we were enjoying our meal.  In any restaurant, especially one from a celebrity chef, it's always good to know that the chef is actually in the house.  Chef Moonen was a gracious host and his passion for what he does shines through in the outstanding food and drink.  Rx Boiler Room is a worthy successor to the great restaurant it replaced.  It's not a cheap night out, but I felt we got what we paid for.  4.5 stars.",2013-07-30 22:24:54

We chose to sit at the bar this time, so we could see some of the chefs at work.  

They have a daily special menu, with discounted items which was awesome. The day we went there was sweet shrimp nigiri, and choice of fried shrimp head or miso soup (add $1.00). It's only one per person, so we tried the fried head, and it was so crispy.  You could eat everything. The nigiri was very fresh, kept me wanting more! Each piece including the fried head was only 2.50.

We ordered some skewers, chicken thigh, tskune, pork cheek, beef.  They were all very juicy and had a nice aroma.  Their blend of house soya sauce was very tasty and not too salty.  

We had the other daily special which was a baked clam (2 pieces), the presentation was very nice, but the clam meat was a little salty, perhaps because of the natural habitat of salt water. 

We tried fried oyster (2 pieces) and this was very nice and juicy.  The outer layer was really crispy with a silky texture inside. 

Fried chicken skin, this was really yummy.  Nice starter, great crisp, and a squeeze of lemon cuts the saltiness. 

Takowasabi, this had a good Wasabi flavour and crunch. 

Yamakeke, we got this last time too because we really liked it.  It's mountain yam with tuna sashimi chunks, salmon roe. The mountain yam is very gooey and has an interesting slimy texture with a touch of crunch.  We mixed it together with their house blend soya sauce.  They put a bit of Wasabi to mix in, and this gave it such a nice kick!! 

Definitely will want to come back and try other dishes next time. We were on a time restraint to catch our plane!!!

I'm aware that Habib has quite the rep for being an incredible tailor, which is why I drove across town for his services.  But, I unfortunately had the worst tailor experience with him... which surprises the hell out of me.

My fiancé dropped off one pair of pinstriped pants about two weeks ago (May 10th).  He was measured and interested in simply getting the waist pulled in a few inches.  His initial experience was perfect, zero issues.. that's until I came to pick them up.  I drove across town (from Mountain's Edge) to pop in and grab the pants today (May 22nd).  After repeating my other half's name literally twenty times (no big deal) Habib was having a hard time finding the pants.  While searching for the pants, he continued to assist other clients behind me explaining that they were waiting.  Even though, I was, well, waiting....  No big deal.  After about ten minutes of searching, he suggested that maybe the pants weren't dropped off.  Hmm.. I politely told him that I don't run around to different tailors in my free time picking up and paying for men's pants.  ""Oh, they're here alright.""  After about ten more minutes, and a couple more patrons being assisted, he said he wouldn't be able to find the pants unless he could see a picture of my fiancé.  Typically, the issued ticket should suffice, but it seems that Habib works off of faces..  No big deal.  After seeing some pictures and more searching, he finally found the pants!  YAY!  Unfortunately, they were in a dusty ball, wrinkled up (mind you, these are a pair of $500.00 pants) sitting on the dirty floor underneath the register.  Looks like a visit to the dry cleaners is up next!   Woohoo!  The best part (sarcasm) was that they hadn't been touched.  UGH.  This is where my patience ran thin.  He suggested I wait another twenty minutes while he worked on them, but at this point,  I had lost my cool and was ready to scream.. It was time to go!

Overall, Habib was very friendly and seems to be a great tailor with a fun personality.  I can see why he's well liked.  He also offered to fix free of charge, so he wins a star for that as well.  Businesses don't always get it right, so this is hopefully a one time thing.

I hope that IF I go back to Habib, the next experience will be a pleasant one.  If so, I'll make sure to update this review.  I HATE HATE HATE giving crappy reviews to local businesses, but honesty is what's up.  Habib could really use some organization and maybe a better system on tracking the items that are dropped off.  Why issue a ticket if you don't use them?

Tip:  Do not have your other half or friend pick up anything that you've dropped off.  Pick it up yourself!  It seems that he works off of faces.. so, me picking up something for my boy completely screwed up his mojo.",2013-05-22 22:49:50

I am a big fan of Shoeless Joes and go to their other various locations however this location always seems to disappoint me no matter how many times I give them a chance. I came here last Friday with a friend..it was beginning to get busy and they had a few reserved signs around a few tables. I got to the hostess stand and asked if their were any booths available. The hostess immediately said no without checking and then brought us to a half booth which was fine. We sat down and our server who was very kind came to get our drink orders after 5 minutes of waiting (fair its busy) however we already knew what we were getting and put in our order. I also asked the waitress if we were able to change the TV channel to Sportsnet One as I wanted to watch the Canada Women's Soccer Game that was playing on various other TVs around the establishment. She said she would check with her manager, 10 minutes later her manager came by and began to change the TV BEHIND ME! I told her if she could change the one infront of me because I obviously can't watch TV through the back of my head. She then got annoyed and said she could only change one TV..which was fine because only I wanted to watch not my friend. She began switching the channels (they only have about 6 to work with!?) and then left it on..however, unfortunately as she put it on TIm and Sid decided to broadcast instead. 

My friend got her french onion soup and enjoyed it but complained a little about how it wasn't as cheesy as she usually has hers. After 10 minutes our food came, I got the classic burger and added bacon and my friend got the burger with mushrooms. I was VERY disappointed with the whole 25 french fries I got..which makes me think that they pre-set plates with french fries for the evening rush. My burger was good, really tender but the meat to bun ratio was off as the burger kept sliding out and making it a very messy experience. 

We looked through their dessert options to end but decided not to go for anything, when we got our bills..I got charged for my friends burger instead and she got charged for mine, we had to get our bills re-done correctly. We ended up paying and leaving..really disappointed. 

Although their food can be really good they seem to crush under pressure during the evening rush and therefore lack in food quality and consistency. I was hoping they would be a little bit more generous and their staff/manager a little bit kinder but you can't get it all with franchises..

I will go back to Shoeless Joes but not this location. Womp!",2016-03-01 20:20:49

Heck the Arby's next door is only open until 10 at night so clearly the chains that have been here for decades aren't as busy as they once used to be. They need to work out how to order here at Taqueria El Buen Pastor. I walked in and they have a menu board that says ""express line"" under all the menu items which would lead anybody to believe that's where you order. I mean it was right there in plain English and I was still confused. I had to go over to a girl and give her my order and pay then wait for it to be brought out. I din't have any problem with that but come on don't plaster ""express line"" all across your menu board if that isn't where you order. 

I got asada tacos and this place charged me .50 cents per taco to have flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas. WTF?! I know a lot of the chain restaurants do this but not usually these mom and pop type run places. I can go to Sinaloa (just down the street on Decatur near Lake Mead) and also Tacos El Gordo who both have the best tacos in town and they never charge me for wanting flour tortillas instead and even if they did, I'd gladly pay it because I know I'm getting a legit taco. The asada tacos here were way too fatty and overcooked. All I tasted was charred fatty meat. The tacos also only came with meat and tortilla so again I say WTF?!

I'm not a fan of craft beers (don't know when palates developed a taste for hops but that's all I taste these days with those beers.  I blame Sam Adams) so I won't grade them on libations.  Lastly, my pizza benchmark is entirely New York/New Jersey (my home base).  Humble has the tools--a nice looking brick oven (temperature was around 625 degrees which is a little low) but the execution is poor.  My friend had a sausage pie and I ordered one with sopressata. While we waited for our pies, we watched the cook furiously poking at the pies in the oven.  We asked the waitress what he was doing and learned that he was bursting any bubbles in the pies!  (Since they had to redo my pie, I was able to request that he not burst my bubbles).  What arrived were two very flat, thin and dense pies with no real character.  In both cases, cheese and sauce flavors were almost non existent. The sausage on my friend's pie was so finely ground it was almost invisible.  I was more fortunate as the sopressata was spicy and tasty.  Neither pie has any sort of rim.  And at $15 each, not a lot of value for the size.  I firmly believe that anyone looking to open a pizzeria should spend at least a week in Brooklyn going from place to place (starting and ending with Di Fara's) and tasting what truly excellent pizza tastes like.

When I call to talk to someone, I expect them to take down the information and try to bring some resolution to the situation.

Brief summary - about 75 people in line to check in, yet only 3 live agents and 1 self service machine to check people in; Noise was horrible - I could hear my neighbors having relations, people in the hallway talking, and my other neighbors talking in the bathroom; Room wasn't just old, but actually looked worn out; Bed and pillows were horribly uncomfortable; They send you canned sales voice mails everyday that flash a light on your phone until you listen to them; I asked for an extra blanket but never got one; and last but not least, the one time I did not have bills to tip with, the Valet stood there and awkwardly starred at me thinking I would come up with something.

They have an adorable little patio, with larger picnic tables for groups and two-people tables for smaller groups. Their drinks selection is very good and they have a daily drinks special every single day of the week - usually it's some sort of discount on their jugs. I've included a picture of their weekly specials menu. 

Their mixed drinks are a bit hit and miss. 

The peach mojito is definitely very good, but it's not really peachy, or much of a mojito either. It's made with vodka, so it doesn't really have that punchy rum flavour to it. It's also not very minty - I definitely like my drinks a little stronger in general. I don't think it's very alcoholic either; the last time we ordered a jug I think I only saw 2 or 3 shots get poured into the drink. This drink is definitely very light, almost watery, and you can definitely taste that it's mostly juice and club soda. However, it's pretty good for a starter drink, or if you just want something cool and refreshing on the patio. 

For the sangrias, I definitely prefer the taste of the white wine sangria over the red. It comes with quite a bit of fruit but I'm pretty sure those are added in afterwards - I feel like this is more of a ""wine mixed with fruit juice"" kind of deal than a real sangria. If you order a jug of the red, they put orange juice in the bottom half so it's a very pretty ombre orange and red color. You're supposed to mix it before you drink. On the weekends they have freshly squeezed orange juice!

They have mimosas on the weekends made with freshly squeezed orange juice (but they run out of the orange juice pretty quickly). It's pretty good, and definitely very affordable - a liter carafe will run you about $21. Their brunch is pretty awesome too - they serve it every day until 4.",2013-08-11 23:55:39

In some weird way I think that's why I keep coming BACK to this place. Not because I enjoy sucky service but because that sucky service keeps OTHER folks from coming back and because of that the place is never too crowded. So this becomes the choice of places to drink and chill when you know your actual favorite haunts will be packed to the gills like say sports bars during an ASU or Cardinals game or during graduation week, etc. We know this place is bound to be less crowded than elsewhere and guess what? That happens to be true 99.9% of the time. The sucky service acts like a sieve weeding people out - the same way some places intentionally pipe in classical music to keep the gangstas out or blast loud gangsta rap to keep the geriatrics out. So here's to sucky service - yeah, I'm a glass half full guy - we still get our beers eventually. So the waitresses here aren't neurosurgeons but you don't need a stratospheric IQ to bring a pint of beer from the bar to a table, right? The food here is also just ok.

We were two of about three other small parties in the place...not busy at all.

My annoyance of the hostess's disinterest in us quickly dissipated once our server arrived at our table. Probably the best part of our experience at this place. She was very nice and very attentive. She was quick to place our orders and check up on us, at the same time gave us the space we needed to eat our food without having someone constantly asking us if we needed anything else.

Food orders: 
I ordered the RRBC Bacon-Cheddar Burger - named as one of their favorites on the menu. So I thought this would have to be a good choice.  The bacon (Applewood smoked) was overcooked, tasted like plastic and was so hard that when bit into it I felt like I was going to break a tooth. The burger itself was okay, but the bacon was inedible.

My boyfriend ordered the California Chicken Sandwich (grilled chicken with avocado and pepper jack cheese). The chicken was overcooked so kind of tough. The best part of it was the avocado (very fresh and flavorful) and the cheese.

Beer orders: Subchaser Hefe-Weizen, hefewiezens are one of my favorite types of beer, this one was pretty decent, but I've definitely had better.  And the Hop Goblin (American IPA).  This one was really good, it reminded me of the Citramax at Market Garden Brewery (which is also an American IPA).

This is not World of Beer Tempe at all! The waitress was kind of awful.

First, I must say, I am not a fan of beer that much. I lived in Ireland (the beer capital of my life) and managed to have a beer only once. Needless to say, beer and I do not mesh very well. However, I love World of Beer because of all the different varieties and you can literally find something for anyone.

So I bring my visiting friends to World of Beer Gilbert. I'm excited to introduce them to this crazy fun little place. But if you go to World of Beer for the first time, it can kind of be overwhelming. That's why the waitress/waiter usually eases you through it - I mean they go to be classes, they're trained in beer...stuff, like, they should know how to help someone find a good beer.

All our waitress said is that the menu is good at describing the different beers and let her know if we have a question. Then she disappears. She doesn't come back until we flag her down after waiting 20 minutes to place our order.

The beer was good. The service was not.

In fact, I was embarrassed that I talked this place up so much and that's what was delivered.

World of Beer - I still have a place in my heart for you, but I highly doubt I'll be returning to this Gilbert location anytime soon.",2014-10-08 04:09:12

Then while I was waiting for my food to be made Lourdes cut the TV's off and begin to mop. All while we were still waiting on 18 minute order. Then while I was eating they begin to mop. I always thought once you're in a restaurant they have to sever you and have the right to dine in.

I can comment on the service though, something I found to be a little unfortunate. While the waitress was adequate, she was not particularly pleasant or helpful. I had to wait for some time at the cash for her to take my order as she had her back to me. When she did turn around, all she said was ""what do you want"". Not a very pleasant greeting. I asked her what type of teas they had and she said ""they're over there"", pointing me toward a row of canisters of loose leaf teas, turning her back on me again and leaving me to read the names and descriptions of each one. I then asked what she would recommend between the baked apple and the green lime tea, to which she replied, ""one's apple and one's lime"". Again, not particularly helpful. 

I decided to get the lime tea and it was good enough. I was pleased with the price though - $1.50 for a loose leaf tea - it beats Starbucks pricing!

It's been on my list for a while now and it was quite a let down despite all the rave from friends. Came here with my gf on a weeknight and were seated at the bar since we didn't want to wait/have reservations.
The first thing you notice here is definitely the decor. There were walls covered by stacks of VHS tapes and various bicycles/parts scattered around. Rustic wood paneling accent the walls as well. An there was a large picture of a woman on the wall. Pretty hip I guess?...

Well it's get to the bad part... the food. We started with the beef pot au feu, we knew we were getting ourselves into something when the bartender warned us that it'll be small but it's also his favorite appetizer. Basically this appetizer is a small piece of beef tendon topped with ravioli shavings (they call this ""invisible"", which they aren't too far off) in ""beef"" broth. Although the tendon was tender it wasn't too flavorful, but the worst part is the broth. It was way too salty, the salt covered almost all of the flavor. Ramen packets make a better broth than this... For $10, this appetizer was a huge let down.
I ordered the pan fried pork chop while my girlfriend had the lamb burger. The chop was decent but could have been a lot more tender. It was a bit overcooked judging from the toughness of the meat. However, nothing was burnt, but there were parts that were too charred to eat (probably burnt sauce/marinade). The chop was wrapped in ham which at first I thought was bacon due to its crispy texture. The best part of this dish was definitely the mashed potatoes with scrapple and red eye gravy. The mash had a nice smokey taste and the gravy was quite savory. The lamb burger was pretty average according to my gf.

Originally, I called the store to make an appointment for a basic grooming. It was after hours, but the voice system directed me to make the appointment on line, which turned out to be very simple. There are several options and levels of pampering available. In my opinion, the basic grooming was a pretty good deal considering it included trimming the dog's nails. It would still be a pretty good deal for double the amount because trimming a dog's nails is a huge pain in the you-know-what!

I drank almost a gallon of water to wash away the salt :(  My friend got the Roast Duck Poutine Pizza, which according to the server - this is the ""It"" dish is flying off the counter.  When she got her dish, seriously it looked like a three year old put together the dish. It was a piece of Bannock with cheese and torn duck piece, plus a pile of fries on top and gravy to top it off. It sure is exactly what the dish name is....Roast Duck Poutine Pizza + .super salt. My other friend ordered the Grilled vegetable bannock. This was semi-acceptable, the grill veggies were tasty but as she got to the end, oil was dripping from the sandwich and the chips on the side were creating a oil puddle of its own. Having had such a salty meal, we attempted to balance it off with the S'mores Pie. It was ok, but unfortunately didn't balance our meal, and left a heavy chocolate sauce feeling meshed with salt in our stomach.

I absolutely hate reviewing restaurants after only going to them once, especially if they impress me the first time around; a fantastic restaurant must have *consistency*.  And here is where Tapino simply excelled (well, in addition to the food, and the service, and the atmosphere).

Each time I've been here, I've conveniently made it in time for happy hour... mmmm... so much deliciousness can be gotten for either $5 a plate, or $5 a glass.  The alcohol and food listed on their happy hour menu, though not extensive, definitely offers something for every taste.  I can have a sweeter Scheurebe while others may enjoy a nice Sauvignon Blanc (yech).  For the non-wine drinker, there's generally 5 drinks (martinis, mojitos, etc).  For the non-alcohol drinker, um... I don't know what to say to you... I'm sorry?

The food... ah... the food.  It's delicious, what can I say.  Admittedly, there have been a few items I have only mildly liked, but it was more buyer and user error.  If I *know* I don't like a particular flavour, I probably shouldn't deliberately order something with it.  Sigh.

While I could tell my sandwich maker was trying and was pleasant you could just tell he was overworked and didn't seem to have any support staff.  His section was out of items and no one was quick to help him refill.   He was extremely pleasant and apologetic - I really felt bad for him.
It wasn't until I was eating my sandwich did I realize the bread was wrong, but so be it.
I hope the manager / owner who was walking around can jump in and start organizing and training a bit better.   I think they can be very successful in this location if they can just pull it together. 
I'll probably give it another try, but maybe not anytime soon.",2015-08-14 21:02:01

My absolute #1 spot for dinner in the city. I love long, drawn out dinners from time to time and a 'tapas' style experience like the kind they offer at The Nose. 

It's called Gio Rana's Really Really Nice Restaurant on paper but no one ever calls it that, and there's absolutely no signage outside indicating the name. It's just ""The Nose"". They have no website, no business cards and nothing but a piece of foolscap (what a weird word) for a menu. Totally no frills decor that somehow still manages to wow you with its friendly ambiance.

As a vegetarian I have a lot of menu items to choose from and am able to eat a three course meal including dessert for under $30. The Butternut Squash Crespelle with Fresh Sage and Cream Sauce is on my list of ""Last Supper"" meals and I fantasize about it whenever I'm hungry. 

If you're a meat eater, you have your choice of fish (catch of the day), sexy OR sexier duck, chicken, pork, veal, steak - whatever. And many pasta options as well, in appetizer or entree portions. I'm a big fan of the way they bring all of the 'sides' out on a platter so that you can share.

They do take reservations for larger groups and the place is constantly buzzing with activity. Unbelievably professional, calm and friendly staff that never disappoints, no matter how crowded it is. Make sure to come soon after it opens (6pm weeknights) to avoid waiting too long for a table!

The guys who were going around cutting the meat were very talented but I found a lot of them to be rushing around. There were times when the guys would come around and ask if we wanted anything and I would personally say no and before my dad or mom could ask for a piece they already turned their back to us. I think it wouldve been nicer if the guys cutting the meat would be more sociable or create a connection with the guests.

SALES: It was Memorial Day weekend. We said that we were casually looking around, that we didn't quite need a car but our aging gas guzzling V8 truck has become a nuisance with current fuel costs.

We browsed around and I took a look at the vehicle I originally found on Craigslist. The vehicle wasn't in the best shape (according to my husband, who is a detailed person when it comes to vehicle maintenance). We browsed again at another make and model that was my 2nd choice. It didn't quite feel like 'the one'. The salesperson  offered us to test drive another version of the same car, this time we headed to their sister lot where more vehicles were available. I found a vehicle that I really liked. We drove back to the dealership and started the paperwork. After the basic paperwork filling out, negotiation and back and forth about our monthly payment and who would finance us after bad credit on both our parts (husband and I) due to a recent foreclosure, they came back with an offer that was easy to swallow and with a reputable bank. After an estimated 6 hours, we said goodbye to my always-reliable V8 pickup and drove off in a sportier, smaller and much better on fuel, 4 cylinder sedan. 

Upon leaving the dealership, the salesperson said that we should stop by later in the week to get the car detailed. Alright, added bonus! Or so we thought.

My husband took time out of his work day to get there before the service department closed (at 5pm). I anxiously anticipated a pretty sweet looking clean ride when I got home. What I got was an irate husband.

Which brings me to the next department:

SERVICE: my new sedan was in pristine condition for it being a couple of years old, until the service department got ahold of it.

My  husband called me up and told me that whomever detailed the car messed up my window tint pretty badly. Bubbles had developed on the interior driver door tint, and the front window (which has a light layer of tint) had been cut with a razorblade in several places where they attempted to take off the sales sticker that they have on the front window while at the dealership. Talk about being bummed! I get home to see the damage to the tint on several windows, AND if that wasn't bad enough, the grooves behind the handles on every door had horrible dirty water stains and the rims had not been touched. I took a wet rag to the whole car and the rag turned black. I had to clean my car myself, AND my tint had been damaged. 

Almost 3 weeks later, we are still dealing with having them pay to have someone redo two windows. It's hard to arrange something during a weekday when we both have full time jobs and have to leave work to deal with an issue that should not have taken place to begin with. Their 'tint guy' refuses even a phone call on the weekend and did not know what we were talking about or who we were on the first attempt to set something up with him. 

Bottom line: 

SALES department was friendly, knowledgeable when it came to the vehicle I purchased, not TOO pushy, and was an overall good experience\

SERVICE department: BEWARE. They must use awful cleaning products, use the same rag for your whole car (therefore leaving dirt and residue on the last places they wipe down), AND they take a razorblade to your tint!",2014-06-09 23:19:18

Truth is, I came here on my own accord, on a day where I browse through every stationary shoppe in the city. 
I take my birthdays very seriously, twenty-five is the last birthday I admit to having.

I started from Queen Street West and worked my way up until The Papery, by the time I got here I was so exhausted that the I was thankful of how compact the store was. There are only two isles and a small open area. The shelves are ready to explode with colourful paper things. This was one of those places where I was asked if I need any assistance, and I replied ""I'll ask for it when I know what I'm looking for.""
I needed a hundred envelopes that my female guests would love, but my male friends wouldn't jokes about for the rest of my life. Most of the common looking envelopes were made from Crane & Co, which means that it is slightly over-priced for simplistic designs. The quality is good, but the sizes vary, and it was not sold in large quantities. My budget for the invites were $800, and if I purchased the Crane & Co envelopes that would have taken up half my budget. I looked around some more.
Much of everything else was appropriate only for children, or very feminine occasions, such as a baby-shower, or a passion party.
I've recently learned what a passion party was because my neighbour had one, and when she told me what it entailed, I got the hell out of the house and as far away from my own home for as long as I could. I mean...I wanted to be there, but I wasn't invited. So there was a 100% possibility of me trespassing. 

The Papery retails a lot of stuff that caters to women. I love stationary, but this isn't where I would get it from. It is among the more frugal options in Toronto, and the staff here are rather knowledgeable of their own merchandise. It is by far a one-up from any department store in terms of selection while sustaining reasonable pricing.

Nous sommes retournés en groupe pour le Nouvel an chinois hier (c'est le début de l'année du Dragon et j'en suis un!) et l'expérience fût très agréable. Nous avions réservé (ce qui est particulièrement recommandé au Nouvel an, mais aussi le dimanche en général) et bien que le restaurant était bondé, nous n'avons eu aucune attente et notre table était spacieuse (pour 8) et bien situé dans un coin tranquille mais qui permettait une circulation facile.

Entendons-nous bien, Montréal n'est certes pas la Mecque du Dim Sum et le choix et la qualité ne se compare pas à ce que j'ai pu expérimenté à Hong Kong, San Francisco ou Vancouver. Cependant, je décerne quatre étoiles à ce restaurant dans un contexte montréalais. Le repas de Dim Sum le dimanche matin est une tradition de longue date à Hong Kong et dans le sud de la Chine et on attribut à cette tradition le développement des ""brunch"" en Occident. Dans ce contexte, c'est bien agréable de se retrouver en groupe le dimanche matin dans ce type de grand restaurant où les chariots transportant les variétés de Dim Sum circulent entre les tables. Pour ceux qui ne sont pas familiers, vous faites votre choix graduellement selon les chariots qui passent près de votre table. Prenez votre temps, tout le plaisir est d'allonger l'expérience et de discuter avec votre groupe tout en savourant ces petites bouchées succulentes.

En plus des Dim Sum qui circulent, vous pouvez commander des plats de la cuisine à votre serveur et aller chercher certains mets à un comptoir (nouilles, etc).

Le service était fort attentionné pour ce genre d'institution et nous n'avons eu aucune pression pour libérer la table malgré l'achalandage et nous sommes restés à table plus de deux heures.

Les Dim Sum qui ont fait le plus l'unanimité ici sont les boules au porc BBQ (Cha siu bao) et les boules au sésame (Jin deui). Un favori des amateurs de Dim Sum, les ""pot sticker"" (Jiaozi), sont absents ici ainsi que le dessert favori de mon fils: le pouding à la mangue.

Il n'y a pas d'inquiétude si vous demandez plus de plats que vous pouvez en consommer, le serveur se fera un plaisir de vous apporter le nécessaire pour apporter le supplément avec vous.

En conclusion, ce restaurant amène une expérience suffisamment de qualité pour ne pas se passer de l'expérience du brunch au Dim Sum, mais ne pas s'attendre à ce que l'expérience se compare a celle qui vous auriez à Hong Kong!",2012-01-23 19:14:26

I lied and told her I had an egg allergy, so she asked again and they complied. When the food came out, it was very ho-hum. Huge amounts of rice and the tiniest hint of a vegetable in the middle. Superstore has better portioned sushi.

Another time, we came in with my parents, and my Dad asked if he could have a fried egg with his dish. The waitress said she'd ask the chef, and when she came back, she told him that the chef refused to do it because they were too busy for special requests.

Place - decent, reminds me of your typical Chinese restaurant that just needs a bit more of a reno (that is just me being picky).  The restaurant was easy to find, with their red and yellow sign. Parking may be tough if it is busy, since there are limited spots in the front.  A friend suggested to come early Sat at 11am, to get a table before it quickly fills up.

Food - not great, but good. I guess it is as good as it will get in Charlotte. I do miss Houston, TX and NYC's dim sum food.

The staff here was absolutely wonderful. The experience takes about 90 minutes, with 30 minutes preparing, and 30 minutes doing the hands-free walk.  I'm not sure what we did with the remaining time of the 90 minutes, but I know we spent some time waiting for our photos and DVDs to be made.

The experience costs $175. I was able to find a $10 discount code so we actually got it a little cheaper.  With the experience, you get the hands-free walk, a photo, a certificate, a DVD of the experience, and the memories!  If you want a USB of the photos that were taken during the walk, that is an additional $22. The cost is expensive, but I thought the experience was priceless.  I would not do it again though. Once is enough. =)

The staff made us feel very safe. They tested us multiple times for drugs and alcohol. The safety precautions was much more strict than the airport! They also checked our harnesses over and over and over and also made sure our shoes were tied tight enough (mine were not and she pulled them right off--oops!). They offer shoes if you forgot to pack some during your trip. They also offer extra coverage (a jacket) if you forgot to pack warm clothes.  The weather for us was windy but not too cool.

I was very comfortable with the experience from start to finish.  Of course, we had to sign a waiver agreeing not to sue the company if we died. Thankfully, no one has fallen off or died from this experience. That was comforting to know.

I highly recommend doing this. We booked our tickets the day before because we were not sure how the weather was.  I suggest checking the weather at least a few days in advance.  As the day we wanted to do this got closer, the tickets were getting sold out.  Make sure to check the website periodically so you know when you need to pull the trigger to purchase your tickets.  The tickets are all will-call so there is no need to worry about having them mailed to you. 

You will need to check into an area that is past the CN Tower store, so make sure you do not get into the regular general ticket purchase line.  The instructions on where to pick up the tickets for this event was not very clear to us. The staff is helpful so you can ask anyone that works there where to go.  

The Edgewalk ticket also allows you admission to the observatory, a movie experience, and a simulated ride experience.  Unfortunately the movie has nothing to do with how the CN tower was created--it was about Boeing and airplanes. Your ticket is good for up to two days after you've done the experience so you dont have to feel rushed to use your ticket on the same day to visit all the other things your ticket gives access to.",2013-09-23 12:59:12

At first, the room she had seemed cool. Glass separation in a studio apartment with built in everything.

The other problem was the key cards to get it. This girl was a little strange from the get go but she had like 9 different key cards. I asked her why and she said that security was always changing her access but I took her to the mortgage company to pay her amount due and she seemed all good so why would security be messing with her keys? She told me they spy on her sometimes. I have only known this girl for a short time but I didn't see any reason for her to lie to me. We went to the lobby to fix her keys and I was getting a bad vibe. I don't even know if they fixed the key because I left.

It's right on lakeshore and there are plenty of places to sit nearby with an awesome view of harbour front and billy bishop airport. Since the weather is finally getting warmer now, it is definitely the place to go! 

I love beaver tails. For those of you who don't know what a beaver tail is, it is usually a sweet dessert that involves deep frying a piece of dough and spreading whatever you like on top. Usually my go-to beaver tails are with Nutella or just the plain old cinnamon and sugar! Both are amazing and I've had them for many years now.

I wanted to try something new today so I got the beaver bites. Instead of like a flat piece of fried dough, they're like bite size balls of beaver tails - it's basically fried dough. Then, you get the option of gelato or frozen yogurt on top of that and there are more flavours of gelato at this location than frozen yogurt (vanilla, chocolate, or mix/swirl). I got the frozen yogurt this time (no particular reason). 

The beaver bites with frozen yogurt... I'm gonna be really honest, I thought it was going to be mind blowingly awesome but it wasn't. The beaver bites didn't really taste of anything other than fried dough, but the frozen yogurt was good. I got the vanilla frozen yogurt. Also, it's not super sweet if you're not much of a sweet tooth. You also have the option of putting caramel or chocolate sauce on top. I believe the chocolate sauce is Nutella but I'm not sure.

This is a good place to go by yourself and chill, go with family, friends, or even on a date!!",2016-04-20 14:26:39

This type of fusion fare certainly is a unique one as most Hawaiian food has a heavy Japanese influence. In the end, comfort food is amazing when prepared by people who know it best. The inviting servers here sit you down as if you had just stepped into their home. Our waitress was reminiscent of my Korean friend's mom who would feed us her home-cooked meals. 

The menu is filled with some Hawaiian favorites such as spam musubi and loco moco, among others, but the other half offers Korean dishes such as mandu (Korean dumplings) and meat jun (egg-battered meat; also with a fish option). As with any Korean restaurant, the table is offered banchan and rice water tea. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the meat jun was, especially with the flavorful and tender thinly-sliced beef.

Went to Spicy Dragon for lunch but they were packed, so turned to trusty Yelp for some help. Looking for some affordable lunch specials and Wong's came up with a $. Yes it's in a small divey strip mall but the minute you walk in the door you'll be glad you braved the panhandlers (there was only one actually but it didn't sound as good without the ""s""). 

Nice clean restaurant with lots of available tables, a strong aircon and free WiFi. I was enamored by their delicate cork art (see pics); the detail was so beautiful. The bubbly hostess was also our server. She was the sweetest thing: always smiling and helpful. With her detailed descriptions we decided on.... 

- Hot & sour soup with shrimp - should have gotten chicken because the shrimp were tiny and I didn't like the taste of them; however, the soup was spicy and flavourful and left a strong afterburn.
- Lung Fung soup - if you like egg drop soup, you'll like this. Chock-full of veggies, tofu and chicken.
- Chicken Pakora - crispy and flavorful on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.
- Chili Fish (dry) lunch special which comes with a tiny egg roll (bleh), rice and soup/pop. It was flavorful and the fish was moist.

Didn't see any dessert on the menu so I asked the waitress about it; she must have notice my sad face and went to talk to the chef (who happens to be her hubby). She came back and said that the chef could make us a deep fried pineapple dessert with vanilla ice cream drizzled with maple syrup OH YEAH! Tried the ice cream and I didn't like the taste of it;  but when we paired it with the warm deep fried pineapple and the maple drizzle, it was delish!

Chick Fil A Minis-  Eh...they were just alright.  A bit skimp for the price.  The ""buns"" they use for these things are like cinnamon rolls without the heavy icing.

The pizza is very thin, so one pizza is not enough to fill me up for dinner. But it makes a nice snack.

They only cook the pizza for a couple of mins at most, so if your pizza is loaded on toppings, the crust isn't very crisp. Ours was quite soggy and felt apart while holding the slice. 

They only also have one size for the main pizza (although they have a smaller size for the dessert pizza). So rather than ordering a large/x-large pizza for a big group, you have to order several of these one-size personal pizzas, which can get quite expensive.

For me, it didn't really serve what I came for so I didn't end up buying anything.

I thought getting a latte in a big ol' bowl would be super exciting, but in the end it was a bit sad - too much milk, not steamed super well, and the coffee's flavour ended up just being an afterthought amongst it all. So it could be super! I'll have to go with something smaller and more likely to let me actually taste the espresso next time, I guess. But I should reasonably be able to get a latte I can enjoy.

One option was South Point for $40. While not close to The Strip (or anything at all really), South Point is about 5 minutes from my friends house. And he said the casino was pretty nice, and heard the rooms were fine, so I decided to give them a shot. It was a great decision.

Rooms - 4.5 Stars - great value! I paid $40 for a Sunday night from Hotel Tonight, and only after I booked the hotel did I figure out how to book a second night on the app. But the standard price for the second night was only $50. By far, the best room I've had in the $40-$50 range. Room was HUGE with 2 beds, and a spacious bathroom. It was well furnished and clean. It's not 5-star luxurious, but it's far nicer than many of the hotels on/near The Strip and downtown. 

Casino - 3.5 stars - a bit dead on Sunday night, but was much more active and vibrant on Monday night. They have a decent poker room, but because of the location, not a lot of action going on here. There was typically only one or two NL Hold 'Em games going, and typically a short wait to get in on a game. Sports Book is really nice. Bars are kind of ho-hum, with a rather bland selection of beer. (The best beer on tap was Gordon Biersch Octoberfest - acceptable but not exciting)

Restaurant Selection - 4 stars - Del Mar Cafe is legit, and some of the best bagels I have ever had. Steak N Shake is a nice option, and their prices are the same as their other franchise locations. The late night cafe/diner was acceptable. They also have some higher-end restaurants which are not open midweek, and the obligatory buffet and oyster/seafood bar. Overall, a good selection and variety. 

If you are looking for a clean, spacious, affordable room in Vegas, a good spot to gamble, and location is not important, then South Point is a great option.",2013-02-12 21:42:36

Home is HOME to the BEST CINNAMON BUN in Toronto. The best. Indisputable. It is the winner. I have tried cinnamon buns all over TO, I have walked/biked/driven wayyyy out of my way on just a rumour of there maybe being cinnamon buns, I have spent hours of my time and lots of my $$$ in pursuit of soft warm cinnamon-y goodness. And it's at Home Baking Co where I found it. It's perfect. The dough is amazing, perfectly matched with the buttery, cinnamon-y ooey gooey goodness. It's perfectly baked, not too hard, not too soft. There isn't too much icing, it's the perfect amount. It's perfectly balanced between sweet and cinnamon-y and buttery - not too sweet, not cloying, and perfectly home baked flavor - it doesn't taste manufactured or chemically in any way, it tastes likes someone baked it with love. It's big enough to split and be satisfying for two people, but it's not too big it you want to finish it yourself. One caveat: This type of goodness takes time. They don't make these before they open, so this cinnamon bun is not be available first thing when Home opens, and they open kind of late for a bakery as it is (11am). They maybe start making them when they open or later... and then they are made from scratch, so they make dough, the dough has to rise, this all takes time. On average, I think cinnamon buns are usually available starting at around 1:30pm, and they are often sold-out by 3pm. So check their website and their FB and their twitter or call ahead or do whatever you need to do to guarantee your claim to one of these awesome cinnamon buns. If you go there, there's a lovely girl named Lindsay behind the counter sometimes, and if the buns aren't ready yet she will put one aside for you when they are ready so you can pick up later. That, my friends, is real service, no doubt about it. Home also sometimes has day old buns that Lindsay will heat up for you - go ahead and do that, day old is ok with these bad boys. And enjoy. Because it's the BEST CINNAMON BUN IN THE WHOLE CITY FOR REAL.

I arrived at 7:30 with reservations, the place was half-full and within 15 minutes there was a wait, so definitely make them if you can.  On to the food... 

Ever taste something so good you giggle a little?  That was the cauliflower.  I almost ordered bread to sop up the leftover oil and fried capers.  How do they say, it's ""lick your plate clean"" good?  Light breading, super crisp, soft in the middle and a pure flavor explosion!  The fried capers are a great touch.  

Me and my girlfriend shared two pasta dishes(the pasta is made fresh there); Cacio E Pepe and the Rigatoni Carbonara.  I didn't post pictures because there's plenty of them on here of both.  Cacio has always been one of my favorite pasta dishes because how simple and flavorful it is.  Main flavors are parmesan and fresh black pepper.  

The Carbonara was outstanding.  Carbonara has always been one of those pasta dishes that you can easily mess up, but they do right.  You can really taste all the ingredients down to the egg yolk,, but for me it was the guanciale that really sets this dish off; salty, smokey and super crisp.  

For dessert we had the panna cotta.  This was a super inventive version of panna cotta.  Fresh strawberries, cubes of pistachio cake, rhubarb and little dollops of some kind of basil oil.  I don't know if it was an oil or some kind of extract, but it was a great contrast to the sweet and creamy flavors. 

Can't say enough good things about this place.  I will definitely be back to try some more dishes.  It is a lively dining experience, a bit loud, but I enjoyed that.  I even loved the dishes they use.  The place is artsy meets rustic.

The service was also good.  I can't remember his name, but he was very friendly, attentive and was enthusiastic about the food which really helps with the experience.",2018-02-18 17:39:27

Tip #2:  Bring a refillable bottle so you don't hafta shell out $5 for one there!  There is a water refill station. 

Tip #3:  Ladies, if possible, use an actual restroom stall.  Port-o-potties smell to high heaven...and this is just walking by them!

PRO:
-  outdoors
-  pretty easy to navigate, basically there's only 1 way in/outta this place
-  sound is decent

CONS:
-  outdoors (con if it rains)
-  paid parking, drinks/food are all super pricey!  To give you an idea, parking was $25, a bottle of water is $5, & a tallboy will set you back $13.50.  Dunno, how people still get hammered here when beers are at least 4Xs the price as it is at the LCBO/Beer Store
-  Not super accessible for people with disabilities.  There are quite a number of stairs when accessing the actual stage area
-  absolutely CRAMMED to get in/out of the venue

It usually really bothers me when people complain about the service at nice places not being immaculate because no one's perfect. I generally avoid such complaints and focus on the food. This is going to be an exception to the rule. 

It all started with the BUG in my husband's water! A dead floating little bug! I expect better at a place like this on a nice night out. When we told the waiter, he simply whisked the glass away, softly stating he'd bring him right out a new glass. No apologies, no acknowledgement that anything was out of the ordinary... is this how nice places handle mistakes of this nature? Just fix it and don't dwell? I can appreciate a quick fix of such a disturbing issue, but we were put off by how it was handled. On top of it, we definitely felt neglected from that point forward. The waiter for the tables around us spent time with his tables going over the options in a friendly manner... Maybe after the bug he figured he wasn't going to be able to recover a good tip so why bother with us? It was very awkward. 

Overall, the food was pretty good. The tuna tartare was OK, but not amazing. I had the Nantucket Bay scallop special feature in part because the combination mentioned on the website's menu page intrigued me - scallops, brown butter, almonds and grapes with chives. What they actually brought out had tomatoes instead of grapes and no chives. It was still quite tasty, but left me feeling a bit deceived and wondering what I was missing. We also got the crab fried rice everyone raves about here, but it was shocked at how spicy it was when it said nothing about this on the menu. It was OK, but  I couldn't taste the crab at all because of the spice, which was disappointing because I love crab. Also, the Asian flavors were out of place in combination with my meal, and I had wished the waiter would have counseled us on our choices a bit more. My husband got the steak au poivre that we loved at Wildfish. I wasn't impressed this time, but he still enjoyed it. The bananas foster dessert was spectacular though - don't miss it!

After these issues, this place will not be on my list of places to return, which is a shame because I work 1 minute away. :-(",2013-01-17 05:58:49

Earlier this week, I was feeling particularly antsy. I could see the sun shining outside my office window, and my booty had grown numb, planted in my office chair for four hours straight. Field trip!

I did a quick Yelp search to find the closest indie coffee joints, and Conspiracy came up, at .7 miles away. Ulgh, a 1.4 mile round trip walk. 

But I went for it, and boy howdy am I glad I did! I was served possibly the best latte of my life. The espresso was layered with different tones and flavors. The froth was nice and dense, and even adorned with a lil frilly foo foo. I couldn't even bring myself to sully it with fake sweetener. It had to be real deal sugar. So. Good.

A number of Yelpers noted poor service at Buca but I didn't experience this at all. Our server was good. He answered all our menu questions and made recommendations for their specialty cured meats (on display in the restaurant). 

I like the look of the restaurant, cool modern decor broken into main sections with a large outside patio. Tables were well organized - no overcrowding so you can have a private conversation.  Buca can be hard to find. Just look for the sign on the wall on King St. (just west of Brant, north side of King).  

The food was excellent. We started with two appetizers: 1) The house cured meat platter (3 choices) - Pork Cheek, Wild Boar and spicy Sausage and 2) Nodini - warm bread knots with garlic and olive oil. 

The Nodini was just ok - much harder then I expected. I thought the bread would be melt in your mouth warm & soft but tonight. The cured meat choices were FANTASTIC - easily the highlight of the evening. It's paired with a few different preserves as well. 

For my entree, I ordered the Sea Breeze fish fillet. The fish was top notch, incredibly fresh and cooked perfectly but there was nothing served with it. I thought they were joking at first!  At a $36 price point, I would like some sides? I admit that I have a big appetite but I don't think anyone would be satisfied with this portion.

My companion ordered the Gnudi ($25) - Fresh scallop and Buffalo ricotta dumplings. Also very good.... just melted in your mouth. Portion size also on the small side - more like an appetizer at best.

High praise for the desserts. The blueberry Gelato was the best I ever had ($7) and the Tiramisu ($12) equally good.  

I would likely return but will eat a bigger lunch before my next visit. The Pizza looked incredible and I have to try that (and a good size).

This place bills itself as ""Canadian comfort food."" To me, chicken pot pie is about as comforting as comfort food gets and Bannock's is excellent. The crust was firm but flaky and the filling was hearty and tasty. Ideally it would be 25 percent bigger. The smoothie was very good. Service was good.
I know that my 4 star rating is only based on two items - the chicken pot pie and the smoothie - but that's all I have to go on and the next time I go back, I'm ordering those same two items again!
The only reason I'm not giving Bannock a 5 is because it's a tad pricey - $21 for the pie.

** I love the turkey pot pie at Hot Oven Bakery. It's about four times the size of the one at Bannock. The chicken meat at Bannock is slightly more tender than the bakery's turkey meat but the turkey pie is $17 all-in. The chicken pie here is $21 plus tax plus tips.",2018-02-07 16:52:27

I realize what I've been missing and I won't make that mistake again. The location was cool before, but now with the Cartel touch, it's even cooler. The coffee is the delicious Cartel coffee blend and the vibe is eclectic and coffee shop'esque. But here's a nice twist courtesy of Cartel's elves. Besides basic baked goods, they also serve a simple breakfast and lunch menu. 

The breakfast menu includes items such as breakfast sandwiches and oatmeal. The lunch menu includes items such as a turkey sandwich with a delicious pesto sauce, a ham sandwich and salads like tuna salad. It's a small menu but it's good. Plus you get chips, a salad or fruit with your lunch sandwich. Add a non-fat vanilla latte and you've got yourself a delicious lunch, or at least I did!

Cost: They are fairly priced, but get you with the city tax (only place to do that). Paint costs are also pretty reasonable with other fields like Ft Adobe.

Fields: This is the only place I've ever been to in Arizona that was recball only. The fields were well laid out and fun to play. I think there was 4 fields total, but maybe it might be 3.

High points would be that the atmosphere was pretty cool and the staff was very nice. Also the flavor of the food was quite good. But nothing made me say wow I can't wait to come back. Also, it was expensive for what you get. My ramen bowl had a total of three pieces of pork in it. The noodles and the broth were good but basically it was a very expensive bowl of soup. 

Also the drinks were so small. I thought I was being punked when they were being served to us. The margarita glass was a tiny goblet that was smaller in diameter than the soy sauce dish that accompanies the chopsticks. The tiny orange that was floating in it as a garnish was the size of a nickel. The manager was very nice about it and first suggested that the volume of fluid in the glass was similar to that of a regular martini glass which was kind of laughable. He offered to give us another round for free but that wasn't really the point. They are going to have a very difficult time surviving in this market if they serve margaritas the size of shot glasses for $12.

With that said, some of the items are quite puzzling (I said sushi!).

Ordering the shrimp tempura, I was picturing elongated shrimp in flaky tempura batter, lightly stacked and served with a side of dashi-based, broth-y, tempura sauce.

Instead, what I got was a may-lover's interpretation of shrimp tempura. While I appreciated the lump shrimp that came in a square bowl, it was drenched in ""spicy"" mayo. Enough so, that there was residual mayo remaining in the bowl afterwards. The texture and flavor more resembled Walnut Shrimp from a Chinese take-out joint, rather than a cherished cuisine from Japan.

One of the great secrets in Vegas.  This spa is in the Palms Place Hotel. Not to be confused with the Palms next door. Now this spa is basically designed with the owners of the condos upstairs in mind. So it's great for locals. Close to the strip without being on it (and the tourist traffic).  And since it's kind of hidden, it's usually very quiet. 

The men's side is well laid out and clean. Lockers are large. The steam room and spa work perfectly and are well maintained. They have a large whirlpool and a cold dip pool.  Everything is done in a earthy slate colors and is very relaxing. No irritating music. These people seem to get it, Im there to relax, not get processed thru some massage factory line. 

And speaking of massage, ask for Megan or Becca. They are both fabulous. Altough I have to give extra kudos to Megan. She has hands to die for. If she were single, I'd propose marriage without hesitating. :-) Yes she's that good!

I only have 3 beefs with the place. First, you can never get an attendant on the male side. So getting your slippers takes forever. Two, the front desk seems to have 2 sets of girls to make appointments. Dont know why. I always talk to the ones who are dressed down in work uniforms. They are always super nice and helpful. The chicks standing next to them in black tanks and lots of hair and make-up come off as total bitches. Looking down their nose at you, etc. You know what I mean. I always get a good laugh since I know I make a ton more than they do. Third complaint, The Hamam. They advertise having a Turkish Co-ed Hamam.  Lame.  One, the steam is just high enough to irritate you with humidity. Never high enough to be classed as a steam room. It's always empty. No one goes there. Recently it's also been less well maintained with used towels laying on the main seating area. Plus, due to the low heat, it is developing an odor.  

SInce none of these really affect me. 5 Stars for a nice tucked away little jewel of a spa where I can actually relax and get a great massage!",2008-09-17 15:44:37

We got some fresh pita bread while we were waiting for our meals - it was so warm and delicious, I really wished I ordered hummus.  

The food came, and the cheesesteak was definitely one of the better, more Philly-type cheesesteaks that I've had in Charlotte, but the cheese didn't penetrate through all of the meat, I needed a bit more.

Just around 30 minutes we were called in for the appraisal, which came in under the Kelly blue book value for a trade-in. There was significant cosmetic damage to the vehicle, so that was something that would have hurt it's value, so the appraisal was fair.

We then are directed to a sales office to sell the car. It is just a counter with a few nice ladies that take the appraisal letter, your title, ID and registration. They take about 30 minutes to do their paperwork while you wait in the lounge and then you are done.

Our server was phenomenal -- total sweetheart and knew how to read her guests. She was right there before drinks dried up and she kept all the courses coming.

The food was pretty descent. Started off with the pretzels, which are more like pretzel bites. But they bring you a piping hot dish of gooey provolone fondue as a dip. 

My entrée didn't come out as ordered, but I didn't want to wait for them to remake it -- it was sweet potato stuffed pasta with chicken. Our other entrée was different than described on the menu. The crab stuffed chicken isn't really ""stuffed."" It's really just two breaded fillets with crab in between. Both entrees were okay -- nothing spectacular.

Desserts at the Arrogant Butcher are epic. Clearly a lot of creativity goes into designing these sweet treats. The peanut butter cup was my favorite.

I love shops with that neighborhoody feel. He knew everyone who came in to pick their orders up, and is really easy to chat with. If I was rating Fazio's on customer service it would be 5 easily, but the food is delicious, too!

We've only had their cheese pizza and chicken parm hoagie, but both were excellent. The pizza crust is really thin, and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese. As other reviewers stated, if you want a traditional, greasy pie, this is one of the best places to sate your craving in Pittsburgh. Despite the thin crust, it's never been undercooked and soggy, and we haven't had to deal with a burnt crust, either. As for the hoagie...their rolls are delicious and really help make the sandwich. I can't wait to try some of their other hoagies, but for now, the chicken parm might be hard to pass up for me.

To start, the atmosphere was nice, we sat in an open air section kind of like a covered patio that had a few twinkle lights.  It was a quiet place, perfect for our Sunday night dinner.

We started our dinner with Anthony's Classic Italian Salad.  The small salad was perfect to split for two and the dressing was really tangy and delicious.  My only complaint about the salad was that they charged us to add cheese to the salad....they charged us $2.99 for like the tiniest little cup of mozzarella cheese ever! 

The pizza seemed kind of expensive too and of course when I tried to check the menu for prices online they weren't listed on their website.  I think it was around $20 for the large pizza and more if you wanted additional toppings.  We got a half pepperoni. half arugula pizza and both were pretty good.  The pizza is on a thin coal fired crust and you can really taste the smoky flavor.  The sauce is a more tomato-ey style but it was balanced out well by the other toppings.  Overall a little expensive but pretty good food.",2017-09-27 02:06:25

Since I skipped out on this place for my birthday, I thought I might as well make it the first stop in the road.

I was pleasantly surprised. Our waiter, Andrew, was excellent; drinks never went empty and breadsticks always magically reappeared. The breadsticks were salty, and they were no doubt meant to be guilty pleasures. I didn't care... I ate five of those glorious baked goods. This aspect of the meal was good enough to bump up a would-be three stars to four stars.

Now for the rest of the food. I ordered the Lasagna Classico with a side of salad. The salad was fine but nothing to write home about. My mom could have made a better one in two minutes. Same goes for the lasagna. This cheesy monstrosity was decent, but I've eaten frozen lasagnas that could easily compete with what Olive Garden is offering. I would say that the entree itself receives only 3 stars, strictly for being decent.

I had read about the parking issues, so was prepared to have to walk.  We got ourselves some free parking about 3 1/2 blocks south of the stadium.  Not bad at all.  And the walk sobered us up slightly, which was a real bummer if we wanted to keep loose all afternoon as the booze selections at this field are really poor.  I got spoiled at Salt River Field with all the AZ and CO craft beers available.

I'm not really a beer snob, but given the choice between a Bud Light and a glass of water, I'll drink the water.  Sometimes I forget and drink the Bud and then I'm farting like Larry the Cable Guy's grandmother for 3 days.  Then Mr. M doesn't want to sleep with me and it pretty much ruins my love life temporarily.  

What was I saying?

Oh yeah.  The booze selection gets about 1 1/2 stars from me.  I did see some Coronas, but the stand we stopped at was out, so I just opted to wait and hit someplace on the way home.

On the other hand, the atmosphere was great!  Now this is a ballgame!  The stadium was probably 3/4ths full and the crowd was really into the game.  I'm not a particular fan of either of the teams, but I am a HUGE fan of baseball in general, and it was a fun time.  

I've learned my lesson and we bought cheap lawn tickets and then just roamed around and sat wherever we felt like.  We did sit on the lawn awhile, which I'm discovering is the most entertaining place to be.  I can see scantily clad teenagers touching each others' no-no parts, I can see people get hit in the head with those beach balls they are always batting around, and I can see crumbsnatchers perform death-defying moves in their quest to work out their sugar high and weave in and out all the people and blankets.

Pros
- Go with the ""valet"" service. Yes, it's a little more than their regular (but still cheaper than the airport's ""business valet""). They will pick you up at your car (no waiting), they will drop you off at your car (you're the first off the bus) and they will have your car rinsed off and with the engine running and the trunk open. Bonus!
- Bottle of water handed to you at checkout.
- Frequent Parker Points - ten days of paid parking is one day of FREE parking.
- Speedy checkout!
- Very short (if any) waiting for a shuttle bus.

Cons
- I *once* had to wait four minutes in the checkout line on a Thursday night. That's no longer a problem as they have added a second checkout line on Thursday and Friday nights.
- Maybe some of the buses could use some therapy but it's not that big a deal.

Looked like a great place to sit on a nice day.  Next was the kitchen itself, glassed in and with about 8 people crafting plates.  It was nice to see tortillas being freshly pressed.  The actual dinning room consists of a long line of two person high tables on the left a bar on the right and an upstairs area where some larger booths are located, which can accommodate a group of up to six.  The restaurant is decorated in a Gothic meets modern industrial meets Latin style which was well executed.  Unfortunately it was only about 55 degrees outside and they were running the AC which made the downstairs tables quite chilly.

Drinks: Tried the spicy cucumber marg as well as the anjeo and absinthe one.  Both were well done.  They had a selection of primarily Mexican and Asian beers starting around 4 bucks.  Interesting cocktail list as well and would definitely like to try their sangria at some point.

Food: We started with the Chef's Choice #5 guac which had crab, cojita cheese, and peppers.  It was Amazing!...could seriously eat that every day.  Next we split three orders of tacos, which come with two per order.  I was expecting Mexican style street tacos which can be quite small.  I was wrong.  They were big.  We got the Tako (octupus), Al Pastor, and Korean (short rib).  All were good, but the Al Pastor was the stand out for me.  The pork was cooked perfect as was wonderfully seasoned.  The Korean and Octopus and a little too much sauce for my likely, as it overpowered some of the other flavors.

Service: Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, though the service was on the slow side.

Tips: Make a reservation a few days in advanced if possible.  I called for a same day reservation for two on a Tuesday and they were booked solid.  Nice spot for a casual yet trendy date.  $20 corkage fee if you'd like to bring your own bottle of wine.

Overall: I will be back at some point to give them another try.  The food was solid and drinks were well made.  Lost a star for service and for temperature control.  I should have brought a coat.",2015-05-21 11:47:22

Thus far, this farmer's market is my favorite in Vegas. There's about 3 rows of vendors selling fresh produce, specialty food items, and homemade crafts like soaps, medicinal oils, and jewelry. There's plenty of food trucks to go around - my personal favorites are Tuk Tuk and Garden Grill. Live music and family friendly activities for the kiddos round out the Fresh52 Farmer's Market. If you go, go early. What separates this market from others is the feeling of community and festivity. If only there was a churro cart, then my life would be complete (the kettle corn just doesn't do it for me).

Got the chicken shawarma because I was really craving a shawarma today. Unfortunately, I didn't like it very much. It tastes a bit different from other shawarmas I've had. Hard to describe, the sauce is kind of creamy and nutty, no garlic flavour which I'm accustomed to. I can't get used to this!

RtVZfoHFKLOdS9mLYtmXUw,B3lxewqzRjq309g54zKibQ,IjeyNYr4kefZ2uZfrtJqZg,2,12,2,1,"I have reviewed Cosmo before, but will weigh in now for the new people coming on Yelp to find out more about this park.  Sorry this is long, but these tips come from YEARS of experience with this park and could potentially save you and your dog from a lot of trouble.

1.  DO NOT BRING young dogs who have not completed all their vaccinations to this or any other dog park.  We had to put down two of our dogs because they contracted PARVO from this park, one was 8 mo. old and HAD completed all his shots, but it takes awhile for the immunity to kick in.  

2.  DON'T let your dog roll around in the grass...one of our dogs did and brought home an infestation of ticks which took a long time to eradicate.  Now if we take our dog swimming at the park, we give him a tick bath with tick shampoo before we leave and keep him out of the GRASS on the way back to the car.  We haven't seen ticks since we started the tick baths.

3.  AGGRESSIVE DOGS or dogs that are not well socialized should not be brought to any dog park.  There are WAY TOO MANY owners at this dog park who bring dogs that have no business being around other dogs.  Don't expect other owners to tolerate your dog nipping at, chasing down, or bullying their dogs, they shouldn't have to put up with it.  I actually had a pit bull owner tell me that I should roll my dog over and submit to his dog so that he would stop attacking him..I told him he'd best leave the park.

4.  There is a cement ramp for dogs to run and launch themselves into the lake.  FAR TOO OFTEN adults and children STAND ON THE RAMP to watch their dogs, or throw their dogs in the water.  I can't tell you how many times people have been knocked into the lake by dogs running by them trying to follow a ball into the water.  It would be best IF HUMANS STAYED OFF THE RAMPWAY.  IT is annoying when your dog is fetching to wait for you to get out of the way...and you are risking injury as dogs don't watch for you as they are chasing something into the water..
.
5.  In regards to throwing dogs off the ramp into the water to ""teach them how to jump or swim"", IF A DOG IS TIMID of water, THROWING THEM IN is not the best way to introduce them to swimming and in fact often makes them HATE the water.  Best to let them go in gradually and work up to JUMPING IN...our retriever learned to launch off the ramp by watching other dogs launching off the end, not by us throwing him in.  He eventually starting following his ball into the water...just a tip.

6.  This park is notorious for people leaving their dogs waste everywhere, which is sad, because it ruins the park for everyone else.  PLEASE WATCH YOUR PET and pick up after it.

7.  BEWARE OF RUNNING DOGS.  IF you are standing in the park and see dogs running toward you, just know, they might not stop, best to watch for them and be ready to move out of their way...I have met numerous people who have had broken bones and had to have expensive surgeries from being thrown up in the air by dogs running right into them.  Keep a look out...be ready to move.  Some people stand around chatting and aren't aware that they might be in danger from a pack of dogs running headlong into their path...dogs really don't watch where they are going when they are chasing each other and having fun.

8. Small dogs are safer when kept in the small/timid dog area. Too often I have seen small dogs attacked and injured by larger dogs.  It would be nice if all big dogs were nice to little ones, but that is just not the case, and by the time the big dog attacks the little one, it is too late to stop major damage from happening.  ALSO, SMALL DOGS DRESSED UP CUTE IN CLOTHING might look cute to you, but to a big dog, it looks like an animated CHEW TOY!  Don't put your small dogs in harms way by making them look like something they are not.  Also, you might think it is cute that your little dog is running up and barking in big dog's faces, but inevitably the big dog will tire of it and lash out if you don't make it stop.  Trust me, can't tell you how many times the owner of a little dog will laugh and think it's so funny until the big down takes their dog down for a whooping and then they act like the little dog was the victim...watch your dog...if it is annoying anyone make it stop.

9.  IF your dog likes humping other dogs...be courteous and make it stop..other dogs don't take kindly to being dominated in that way.

10.  If you follow some simple rules, the park can be a great experience for you and your dog...just know there are risks and be prepared for such.",2013-02-07 22:45:00

They have Indoor seating and  a great deck for outdoor seating with sunny and shady spots, lots of tvs and a plethora of adult beverages, so the perfect spot to watch games on tv. Very casual atmosphere.  

Food is good and they have lunch specials.  

Visited on a Friday around lunch time and ordered the fish and chips that was the daily special. Oh my heavens - the fish was lightly battered but absolutely  so fresh and delicious, who would've thought!!?! The fish was served with fries that were seasoned - very worth the $10.  On this day, I also tried their Sundrop Slushie!  Careful, goes down easy but packs a mean yet sweet punch!

On Saturdays and Sundays, they have $4 Bloody Mary Bar which is phenomenal. They have so many BM mixes, lots of toppings for your MB and the largest olives known to human kind.  You wont go wrong by stopping in and having one or three.  If MB aren't your thing, try their $2 Mimosas on Saturdays. You'll thank me later!",2018-10-01 20:56:50

I gamble at the Hard Rock Hotel and because I do so HRH sends promotional literature in the mail. Pink Taco was having an all you can eat special for Taco Tuesday. SOLD! 

I actually came in to Pink Taco twice that same week. Once because of the Taco Tuesday special and second because I had a voucher to use. 

Upon my return, I sat at the bar at lunch time during the week. No one was at the bar other than myself and the bartenders. I was greeted by the bartender and within minutes I had a beer and 3 tacos in hand. 

Al pastor - ROASTED PORK, PINEAPPLE SALSA
Shrimp -  RED CABBAGE SLAW, CHIPOTLE CREMA, AVOCADO
Carne Asada - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE

I asked for no cheese on my carne asada taco. Everything came out fast AND correct. And each taco was SO good. The asada I would love to taste w/ a different choice of sauce or even salsa. It needed a bit more flavor than just pico de gallo. The bartender was a sweetheart. Couldn't have asked for better service. 5 stars on this day.

When I returned again that week, I was hungry for some of tasty tacos I had earlier in the week. Like last time I sat at the bar. Again, like last time no one was at the bar. And much like last time I arrived when the place wasn't busy, noon. Baffled both times I came in and it wasn't jam packed for lunch. 

I ordered the all you can eat tacos for Taco Tuesday. 

Gringo - CRISPY CORN TORTILLA, GROUND BEEF, CHEDDAR CHEESE,
PICO DE GALLO, SHREDDED LETTUCE, SOUR CREAM
Al Carbon Chicken - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE
Al Pastor - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE

Like last time I asked for no cheese on my tacos. When the food came out, guess what was on it? CHEESE! Not a huge deal, as I can eat cheese, but on this day I just didn't want cheese. I ate the food as is and just like last time, the food was spot on. It was a bummer when the food came out incorrectly. The bartender who greeted me was very enthusiastic and friendly, started out strong until this happened. There was nobody else at the bar, but he was distracted by another employee and game going on. 

Pink Taco has certainly stepped up their customer service since the last time I was here. Still could use some work, but has grown.

We were walking the St. Clair strip on Labour Day and found most things closed.   Heads hung low, we were about to give up when Marcellos came into our view.  It was like the universe read our minds and produced exactly the kind of restaurant we were looking for.

Marcellos is laid back, warm and hopping.  We were seated quickly, and the service continued all evening to be just right - attentive but not over eager and fast.

I started with the grilled calamari, which was cooked perfectly - not a rubbery tentacle in sight.  Just slightly charred, tender flesh on a bed of greens with a nice balsamic reduction to complement.

For our mains, we had the primavera pizza and the penne arrabiatta.  The pizza had luscious whole sun-dried tomatoes that were quite sweet, unlike the salty bits you sometimes find on pizza.  The salty green olives were a great combo.  Pizza crust was thin and chewy - really great.

Pasta was a little less interesting.  The sauce was quite spicy, but pretty one-note.  No depth of flavour or roundness that a little butter might offer.  The pasta was also a bit over-cooked and clearly of the dried, rather than home-made, variety.  But we didn't care.  Marcellos doesn't pretend to be fine dining, it's a family restaurant and an excellent one at that.  

We will definitely be coming back often.

Vegetarian Score: 7.5/10.  Some interesting options and lots to choose from.  Vegans will have less (as usual) but veggies have good variety.",2011-09-09 00:38:39

Despite the negative reviews I read on Yelp about there being ladies walking along the ledge and that being part of the experience, I don't those give this place enough credit.  This restaurant fits many PLUSES in my book:

1) From car to cocktail, it is super close!  Valet to the restaurant (be it valeting at Crystals or Aria) is like a 2 minute walk.  I hate to have to walk through big cavernous casinos to get to a bar/restaurant. 

2) You are not cramped inside a restaurant with no natural light!  This restaurant, especially from the vantage point of the bar, has floor to ceiling views of the contemporary Aria structure. 

3) You have to make a good solid martini in the town or you will loose my business!  Stephanie behind the bar made a perfect Grey Goose martini.  Often a bartender adds too much remoothe or assumes a girl wants her drink dirty.  Stephanie really has this down pat and being a martini drinker of 20+ years, I would go back to this bar. 

We had food that we shared and snacked on.  All items were delicious and we ordered what Stephanie suggested.  On a Friday night, the restaurant was quite, which can be concerning in this town.  In all honesty though, knowing that the three big points above were nailed perfectly in my perception, I rate this spot a 4 out of 5.",2014-03-11 15:50:54

I have been coming to Bookmans since I was a kid and I have sold countless items to them, usually for store credit. Really, store credit is the only thing that makes sense. Cash is a rip off.

YOU CAN NEGOTIATE!

This place has very reasonably priced movies, games, books, CDs, etc. It is often very unorganized and nobody working here knows if they have certain items. They use Amazon to determine what section a customer may find a book in. Also, creepers hang out here, just sayin'. Come here if you have time to search out your book, or come here just to browse.

As long as you don't want them to bring the pizza to you, this is 3 or 4 star pizza.  It's miles above Pizza Pizza or Dominos in terms of quality, they always have vegetarian (and sometimes vegan) slices available and they sell coke in bottles.  Amazing experience all around.

If you ever order delivery, it takes anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes. Less than .5km from my house.  (Dominos can get here from Danforth in like 40mins, including the creation of my a-la-carte pizza.)

Sometimes they even call me to ask the closest intersection even though they have delivered here before (and I'm pretty sure since I ordered online they have Google maps). 

So in summary:
- walk in - 3 or 4 stars.
- delivery 1 star.
- online ordering experience not great - sort of complex with the radio buttons - it's like telephone banking, it's just cumbersome and prone to errors.
- Pizza is on the better side of delivery pizza options (but sometimes it's ""warm"" not hot by the time it finally gets to your house).

I will probably order from here again, and even get delivery again, but I'll try to anticipate my hunger in advance of the hours it is going to take to arrive.

I enjoyed the AYCE bread and salad. Both were good and what I expected. I got the double bacon carbonara and it was DELICIOUS! I'd definitely go back and order that again. Tony was even able to bring extra pasta sauce on the side and asked if I'd like parmesean shaved in front of me.

From start to finish there were a few bumps. Atmosphere is inviting, staff is friendly, food could be great, and menu should be kid friendly as far as portions go. No problem ordering off the big kid menu, but you will have the full portion added to your tab if you order for your kid/toddler. 
The portions are generous...most dishes have great portions that leave you satisfied and not gut busting full, these dishes actually felt like it melted as I consumed it. I'm going to have to go fill up some place else.",2013-10-17 03:52:22

I had an issue when I signed up for the Rewards and went to the Ballantyne location, but they solved it ten fold. Now customer service at this location wasn't that great, which is sad, because I only got take out. When I walked up to the counter, I showed him my reward on the App and he responds ""Ok"". So then I say""This is my 1st time here"", because I didn't know their process for claiming rewards and he just stared blankly at me. So I think to myself I guess i'll just order. I ordered the Big Create Your Own Beef Burger with Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce, Spinach, Cucumber, Onion & Pickle, Regular Smash Fries and a Regular Drink. So once I complete my order he tells me to scan my reward, which I didn't know where the scanner was. Being my 1st time, he could have at least pointed to it. But he just stared at me as I searched. Then once I find it, its turned backwards, instead of positioning properly for me, of course I had to do it myself. So I was annoyed with this entire interaction. But the food made up for it. I loved the nice grilled taste of their hand pattied burgers. The fries had a very unique flavor that i could see myself craving later. They were also fried perfectly to a crisp.

The restaurant is both venerable and hip enough to comfortably pass as Scottsdale ""special occasion"" - without breaking the bank.  

Is it as uniformly ""special"" as the finest resort dining room. No. Nobody here is going to fold your napkin into a swan and there's no focal Dale Chihuly wine rack or glorious mountain view. But if you play it smart, a memorable and exotic meal can be had in a charming locale.  

Here's my advice, lemongrasshopper:   

Make a dinner reservation. Table location and service are better when you do.  True most places, but moreso here .  

Get the pot of soup.  Tom Ka Gai is a warming, communal ritual and helps smooth over slow Fri & Sat nite service.  

Solicit server recommendations. Most of the menu resonates and Malee's tailors spice level to individual tastes well, but some dishes are consistently better than others.  

Do all that, and I'm pretty sure you'll have a nice experience. Walk in cold, take a blind stab at the menu, and you're apt to be less impressed. 

I like the atmosphere, especially in the main dining room. It's an older building, with low ceilings and residential style rooms. Dimly lit, but not clubby and masculine like Don & Charlies. An unseen piano gently tinkles in the background.  Older couples, younger out of towners, packs of gay foodies, the occasional family celebrating a birthday.  A pleasant, bustling mix.  

There are art galleries and holiday lights on Main Street (which is more of a  quiet side street at night) and plenty of parking at dinner time.  Fine choice for a date or before a show,when you're trying to impress someone special with your inscrutable melange of bold yet traditional values - rather than simply with your wallet.",2009-11-29 20:54:00

There is also plenty of seating for you to enjoy your ice cream, drink, or pastry.

Service - The staff were available to explain anything I was uncertain about. 

Food and Drink - Love love love! Although I have yet to try their savoury dishes, I would still recommend Tsujiri for desserts and drinks. It's also a good date spot haha. Their flavours are bold and they don't cheap out on the matcha.

He took down my 411 & said the office would be calling between 8-9 a.m. to let me know when a tech would be out. Sure enough the office called at 8:10 a.m. & said the tech would be out by 9 a.m. & the cost again. Bill  explained why the smaller unit was dying at the hottest part of the day etc. Quoted a price & said he'd have to order the part he thought because of the unit brand. He'd be in contact with the info the next day. When he left the unit was working sporadic. By late p.m. it was done.

All of their veggies and topping looked and tasted VERY fresh too.

This 2 part process does take much more time though, but is much better this way, so be prepared to wait a few minutes.

My husband and I had been scouring yelp to find an amazing restaurant for our anniversary and stumbled upon this place due to the reviews. Located in a really cool building with lots of rustic wood and glass displaying the kitchen and dining area. I loved the ""sushi bar-esque"" seating in front of the kitchen where you could literally watch them making your food. I had such high hopes upon reading rave reviews and arriving at this place but the food and service did not back up the aesthetics.

We were told to wait upon arrival because they needed to ""reorganize"", even though there were plenty of open tables. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated without being offered a menu or drinks. When another couple came in and was immediately seated I asked why we were skipped and she said they had a reservation and she was just about to seat us anyways, coincidentally. Would be nice if their website advertised/allotted reservations so I could have done the same. Not one time while we were waiting though did I see any ""reorganizing"", or moving of tables in the dining room.

Upon being seated we were handed menus and I have to say there was a great variety of dishes on the menu that you don't see often. Pig face dumplings and steamed bun assortments.  That was exciting. I ordered the Tofu soft bun and my husband ordered the Softshell Crab and the Pork Belly buns. As we went to pick our buns up from their holders, the outsides of the buns were stuck! Most of it was torn and stuck to the holders which was disappointing. Maybe lightly oiling the holders or having non stick holders in the future would prevent losing some of your bun. Overall good flavor and definitely the highlight of the whole meal. I would almost suggest ordering a variety of those as your meal, asian taco style.

Main entrees consisted of the Roasted corn Ramen for myself and the Seafood Hot Pot for my husband along with plenty of their handcrafted cocktails. 2 bartenders for the whole restaurant was probably not the best idea. We waited a long time for drinks, 15 minutes or more sometimes and thats only because we had to flag down our waitress whom looked a bit lost. It was confusing as well because almost every item was brought by a different waiter/waitress which made it hard to connect with our own server.

Roasted Corn Ramen was rich and creamy with great extraction of corn flavor.Just wish they had either allowed me to add the tempura corn on my own or left it to be plated on top last minute because it was really mushy in the ramen once it reached me and lost all of its crispy crunch. 
Seafood Hot Pot was lacking in seafood. You can't call something seafood and only put out 2 types of seafood. They should call it shrimp and octopus ramen. Thats what it was. Flavor was there though and the homemade srirachas were a great touch. 

All in all it was good, not great, no hard feelings but they should focus more on the basics than what will look cool and different.",2015-08-04 05:03:39

Chef needs to be careful about how the sauce is plated because the fries got soggy from sauces. Also, the bread used was too soft and becomes mushy when the sauce is added to the meats. My Catabrian sauce was too spicy for my palette. The meatball sandwich was on the dry side. My daughter enjoyed her Fettucine Alfredo. We got more food with the specials, but once again, we enjoyed the soup and salad best.",2016-07-30 17:07:38

The chicken in my noodle dish tasted strange- I stopped eating it and haven't been ill. The Pho was good, could use a little more flavor in the broth.

Going to see the new show, For the Record: Baz which is playing across the hall from Lupo, I had the perfect opportunity to finally stop here for dinner.

I was seated promptly.  I was given a choice of inside the main part or their indoor patio style seating.  I chose inside the restaurant to avoid the noise of the people going to/from the parking garage.  

Shortly after being seated, I was brought menus and my server, Miguel, took my iced tea order and it was quickly brought to the table.  After asking a few questions about serving sizes, I ordered the heirloom tomato soup with basil to start, listed as one of the daily specials, and the lasagna verde ""della nonna"" with spinach pasta, meat sauce and béchamel.  For a side, I got an order of lemon cauliflower.

Bread service was brought with two dipping sauces.  The serving assistant asked me about freshly grated cheese and/or pepper, and I got both.  The tomato soup was outstanding.  It was rich and full of flavor.  I highly recommend this if it's on the menu.

The main course of lasagna verde was good.  The serving size was more than ample and the meat sauce was very good.  The spinach pasta gave the lasagna a slightly different taste that enhanced the dish.  The side of lemon cauliflower was very good.  Lightly browned cauliflower with more than a hint of lemon topped with some grated cheese, made for a great side dish.  This was the only thing I didn't finish in order to save room for dessert.

After looking at the items on the menu, I got the mascarpone tart which was accompanied by fresh strawberries and an oval of sorbet.  This was a refreshing end to a good meal.  

I was very pleased with the service and the one SA who brought most of my meal and a new iced tea was a very pleasant young woman with a great smile.

I had planned to sit in to eat but the place was lined to the door and the handful of tables were all claimed so it ended up as take out being shoved in my face in a bus shelter. I decided the mango green tea mousse cake ($4.50) looked good and then by the time I made it to the second side of the display case my eyes caught a croque monsieur sandwich ($4.5) that looked scrumptious. I got those two things and a coffee. It was around $12.

I got into the sandwich first and was so in love. It wasn't the usual c.m. It was turkey and bechamel. The bread was fresh and crusty. The cheese was strongly flavoured. The sauce was deliciously savory and seasoned perfectly. I felt like I was back in Paris. Top notch. Then I got into the cake. It was a creamy delight. The mango was much more pronounced than the green tea but they went well together. On the top there were a couple little crunchy ball things. I only wish the cake had more of the balls. The textural contrast was great. The coffee was good coffee but it was just brewed coffee, nothing earth shattering.

I'll shell out a few more bucks and hit Rosa's. It's more flavorful. While LT has a decent kick, the flavor is a bit ho hum.

The tortillas were nice and fresh...that was the best part of the meal. I had ordered the carne asada burrito. It wasn't spiced as much as I thought it would be. Maybe they were hoping the sauce that was in it would make up for the bland spicing.  The sauce had a small bit of kick and was all right.

This is beside the point this unit was a 2 year old Carrier unit installed by the builder in a new home.   The came out on Wednesday, charged $69 for the evaluation.  Said he would call back the next morning with an estimate.  I hadn't heard from them by about 10:30 so I called them.  They said they would get back to me.  They called about 1 PM, and gave me the estimate of $90/hour for labor, plus parts, if not covered by a mfg warranty.  I knew the parts were covered, so approved the work and they scheduled me for the repair between 1 and 5 on Friday.  At 4:45 on Friday, the tech called and said his last job took longer than expected and the parts store closed at 4:30, so he couldn't get to us until Monday.  It was over 100-110 degrees and we had no AC, only ceiling fans.  Seems to me there were three options for staying within their original, promised timeframe:  (1) he could have picked the parts up earlier in the day, (2) someone from his company could have picked up the parts, or (3) he could have called me and I would have been glad to pick them up.

Monday, he came out about 9:15 AM.  Even though the parts were covered by the mfg warranty, but there was a $69 warranty paperwork processing fee? They also charged $181, which they claim was the time to disassemble the unit on their first trip out (when they collected $69) and for installation and reassembly once they finally came out (after we had a very miserable weekend of very uncomfortable heat), for a total invoice of $250.  I give them a 2 star this time because they did get the work done, and I really don't want to give out 1 star, not sure why.",2017-07-03 18:13:37
IBwrgnbJmFuovFGHQ6uYsg,48Ip5iJtWNvxo9QrdX07Og,_iGvLfEsqDwPUxRUAe6tUw,2,1,0,0,"I went to Findlay Chevrolet back in August 2014 looking to lease an Equinox LS or LT. My father is a GM retiree so we get a discount on purchases and leases. I forgot the name of the salesman we worked with but he was really friendly. I test drove the LT and loved it, but I knew it was out of my price range. I had seen on the GM website that you could build and price the vehicle and estimate what your lease payment would be. I know these are estimates, but I expected to get $5,000 for my vehicle which was around 96,000 miles. I expected the $1,500 incentive GM was offering at the time, AND the GM Employee discount. I got offered $1,700 for my car, $750 for the incentive, and not much of the Employee discount for a 2 year low mileage lease, they said it would be around $289/month with $4,000 down. Seriously? I was paying $246/month for my vehicle before I paid it off and the MSRP on that car was $29,000 back in 2006 so I knew this was BS. I checked the lease payments on the LS model Equinox just to make sure, and it was still over $200/month to lease. I had to walk away disappointed.

I went to Henderson Chevrolet this past weekend, checked pricing on the 2015 Chevy Equinox LT, employee discount, incentive, no money down, and they offered me $3,000 for my trade (Same car I had last year, but now over 100,000 miles on it).  The lease payments came out to $169/month.  Sold!  They even worked the numbers so that I could do the lease for 3 years instead of 2 but still with 10,000 miles a year. I work from home, so I don't drive that often.  

I felt like Findlay was ripping me off and not giving me the full incentive and discount I was entitled to get. My father worked at GM for over 35 years, so you would think they could work something out for me but all they kept saying was put more money down. I even went to CarMax to see what they would give me for my vehicle and they said they would give me $4,000 for it. What a ripoff. I know you need to make money on reselling cars, but when I'm sitting there in shock over the lowball trade in value price you gave me, and you tell me that my car will just end up on Boulder Hwy at a used car lot, that's not cool when you're not going to resell it.",2015-06-02 21:19:08

You'll find their mainstay offerings like Canuck Pale Ale and Pompous Ass English Ale in LCBO's year round, but it's their seasonal IPA's which steal the show for me. Octopus Wants to Fight, Karma Citra, Robohop, and Audrey Hopburn are all names to look out for on that front depending on the time of year.

Beyond LCBO distribution, you'll find them in some Toronto bars, or you can visit their tap room located out by the Queensway. Admittedly, this is the one complaint I have - the tap room is really inconvenient to get to, and also closes early (6pm during weekdays, 8pm Fridays/Saturdays).
If you do make it there, you'll find some cool one off beers you won't be able to get anywhere else, including some delicious barrel aged beers.

There is a tasting menu for $65 which allows you to taste everything on the menu, and this is definitely your best choice. The wine list is well thought out, and reasonable. The cocktails are all priced at $13 and WOW what choices. SO original. I had their version of an Old Fashioned, and it was spectacular. At the end I was curious and fished out the candied mandarin from the glass. The three of us shared it and OMG, it was such a treat. The food was incredible.

Well I had the pleasure of attending a Latin night on Thursdays. This place was so packed, like over capacity. The crowd is definitely over 25+. The drinks, as always, are ridiculously over priced as expected- Take shots, you're better off. But at least the music is good- Salsa, Reggaton, Bachata, Rock en Espanol, you name it- they got it- Latin style :D The only bummer is that their dance floor is TEENY-TINY! How are you supposed to get down Latin style with no room to spin around? No bueno. 

They even have a live band- which is OK- I think they switch up the band every so often because I went once before and the band was awesome, so I guess it just depends. LADIES ARE FREE, and I believe it's $10 for local guys, $20 for other. 

For their specialty drinks, you will spend around $9-$16, for shots I believe around $7-$12... I not a huge martini drinker but I always get the Raspberry Bikini Martini- Its OK :)

After a while, the service was just so bad that my friends and I stopped going and we discovered that more and more sushi AYCE restaurants were opening in the city.

This weekend, I went back there again and although it feels like the decor is still the same, I had noticed that they had changed the chairs and seating.  The place itself is just as spacious as I remember as well (quite a bit of seating available).

The food options were quite abundant and I never get to try EVERYTHING I want to try at an AYCE restaurant because I usually end up being too full!

The service was good up until it got a bit busier.  I think if you go at around 5:30-6pm, it's not as packed and the waiters/waitresses are much nicer because they're not running around the whole restaurant serving food and constantly taking orders.  We had ordered three times including dessert, and the food came to our table fairly quickly.  Again, it's probably because we got there at 5:45pm.  However, they did forget my fried scallop dish, but I'm not that surprised because something always tends to be left out/forgotten when AYCE orders are taken.  It's okay though because I was already stuffed by the time I realized that the scallops hadn't made it to our table!

Overall, I'm glad that I came back to visit this place again.  The only other issue I had was that it was $22.99 for dinner on weekends, which was slightly more than other sushi AYCE restaurants.

I'm not sure I'd visit again soon though because I'm sure that I can find a cheaper AYCE restaurant with food that's just as good. I might visit again after trying a few more different AYCE places.",2010-08-16 00:16:49

irYoxJAAhTxdca6a8gwvIQ,Dh4HFUiw9Ip5wFQM_kEbbw,HkHTdTvzbn-bmeQv_-2u0Q,4,0,0,0,"Bannock's approachable manner certainly makes sense considering it occupies the main floor of the Bay's flagship store on prime real estate on Queen St. at Bay.  This seems super convenient for those long Christmas shopping days where getting home at a decent hour to cook supper means a few shopping-short cuts where your significant other just going to be getting another tie this year. And the demographics in the dining room likely reflects their location, as well.  There's a pretty vast collection of parties throughout the nearly packed room on a Friday night at 8 PM. There are young couples out for date night, suits likely gathering for a bite after work, mixed age families recouping from their shopping spree, and some likely tourists, as well. Totally my dining style, Bannock is casual and inclusive, so dress however you happen to be and no one will bat an eye.
Speaking of casual, back at my last visit to Bannock, I recall how the dining room reminded me of their neighbour's cargo-pant-shopping experience. I remember peering through the dining room wall window into the department store, and being somewhat reminded of the old school Zellers cafeteria my mom used to take us for grilled cheese when we were kids. Thankfully, since then they've apparently rethought that ambiance-killer, and with their windows covered with light blinds, I can appreciate Bannock's rustic Canadiana décor.  The 68 seat dining room features a bright and tidy open kitchen, pine paneled walls, marble tables, sleek wooden chairs, and modern molded-wire light fixtures above the long communal table.  On the other side of the open kitchen, there's a grab and go take out seating area offering pastries, sandwiches, soups, salads, and treats in the daytime, as well as cocktails and lounge nibbles after 4:30 PM.  While we did have the luxury of a corner banquette table, I found the tables in general to be adequately spaced throughout the room. The music and noise level were both at an appropriate level so that I didn't have to struggle to hear my father who was farthest away.  Likewise, the temperature from our back corner booth was tepid and comfortable for us all. Mind you, it might have been a tad cooler near the front of the house, but considering that the revolving door is a good 10 feet from any tables, it's likely that even I would have been fine.
Service was also warm and inviting. The staff played along with my surprise, changing the reservation at the front after we had sat down to a different name and a party for ""two"".  Our server was friendly, young and energetic, yet professional with a casual style. Our cutlery were replenished between courses, water glasses were consistently refilled, and the meal was neither rushed or slow (1  1/2 hours).  She also made sure our birthday girl got a candle in her dessert. I really can't ask for more from a service point of view in a casual dining environment.
Bannock's cocktail menu is comprised of familiar classics treated to a benign transformation with Canadiana ingredients. There's a heck of lot of maple going on, which is A-OK by me- but if you're not a fan, you may want to peruse the wine or beer lists instead.  All with very reasonably prices, Bannock offers 4 different local draught beers in 12 oz ($5.50-6) or 20 oz ($8-8.50) pours, and another 5 or so local and international bottles ($6.5-9).  In continuing with the local theme, Bannock's 21 wine offerings are nearly all Canadian-made, and are each available by the glass ($8-13) or by the bottle ($36-60).  While some of the table went with wine or beer, over the course of the night I sampled both the Maple Sour (Maple Crown Royal, Maple Simple Syrup, Lime, $9) and the Bannock Caesar (Vodka, Canadian Imperial, sherry, Clamato, Salsa, Maple Bacon, $9).  While the bacon on the latter was a delicious little appy, and the pepper rim was completely addictive, I found the drink itself a little watered down. In contrast, the Maple Sour was really my style.  It didn't just taste sweet (though it certainly was a sweeter cocktail by the time I got to the maple sugar candy at the bottom), but rather, it had a deliciously distinct aromatic maple flavour. Definitely a drink I would go for again.
Like the cocktails, on first glance, Bannock's food menu reads of simple, familiar comfort classics, but with a little further interrogation, you see the Canadiana theme portrayed. Poutine pizzas, bannock BLTs, venison chili, dinosaur kale Caesar salad- these items really say it all. Like Canadian cuisine in general, Bannock's menu garners inspiration from a myriad of cultures, presents them in familiar but playful ways, throws in a few distinctively ""Canadian"" ingredients like bacon, game meat, bannock or cheese curds, and yields Toronto-wide appeal....",2013-05-20 16:59:44

They make you buy tokens at designated booths which can then be redeemed for products on the street. Ostensibly this is so that the vendors don't have to handle cash and so that the festival can be certain that it takes its full percentage cut. But this system also has the effect of locking you into your purchases before you realize how poor the selection is.

Located in the Riverdale area, Prohibition looks to be a pretty standard pub style restaurant. I don't usually come to this area so I'm not familiar with what's nearby. Service was good with our server checking up on us regularly and bringing us what we needed. In terms of food, we ordered the fish tacos, duck poutine and truffle mac'n'cheese. The fish tacos were sub-par in my opinion and I wouldn't get them again. The duck poutine was tasty but I've had better (I think Bannock does a better one). 

The highlight was definitely the truffle mac'n'cheese which I found tasty and cooked well. I'd highly recommend trying that dish.

It comes with 3 different sauces and all blend superb with whatever fry you are dipping it with. 

The night we came, there happened to be a live band playing  nearby (I was told a convention just got out nearby) so it wasn't a quiet meal although I think it was just an off day. 

After the fries, they do in fact still give you foccacia bread baked in a mini pan so you have it all to yourself. Yummmm. I opted for the short ribs and my bf went with the prime rib. I know its a steakhouse but we just weren't in the mood for steak. The prime rib was not the best but I wouldn't be too hard to critique based on that because I'm sure they aren't known for their prime ribs. The short ribs were very tender. I ordered a side of jalepeno cream corn which I thought was very good. 

I really wanted a dessert but the dessert choices were quite slim. Nothing sounded to really pop. I ended up choosing a chocolate mouse with red velvet chunks on top. It was good.

I had the double cheese burger (really it was a triple since they had an extra patty for some reason and just gave it to me!) with all the toppings except for tomato and mushrooms and it all came together into one giant greasy mass of goodness. I think the handmade patties are really what make the big difference here. The quality toppings also help of course, but there's just something about how the burgers are assembled that put them miles ahead of many of the other chains like Hero Burger.

The service is very friendly, and despite the fact that it's in a new plaza, it does a fairly good job of making you feel like you're in a classic hamburger shop, but not in that over-the-top way that Lick's used to go for.

For the medium size which allows you to try out two flavors the amount was pretty generous to the point where some of the gelato started to drip over the rim of the cup. That's certainly an upside compared to the experiences I had with the portion sizes at a couple of other supposedly well-regarded gelato places. I had the Mon Cherie (a dark chocolate gelato with bits of preserved cherries and subtle hint of the cherry flavor) and the Soy Espresso which I thought would be a different choice since I've never a soy based frozen dessert before. Both flavors did not disappoint and together with the Cafe Americano which was strong enough allow me to taste the strength of the coffee despite the amount of sugar and cream I added to it.
The staff were also friendly and helpful when I asked which about the number of flavors that came with each serving size and also with the coffee selecting.
Also noticeable is that the display for the gelato at La Paloma is more brightly lit allowing the customer to get a good view of the color of each gelato flavor. I will definitely be back soon.",2015-09-18 20:38:54

While in town, the hubs and I used this as our way to get from one place to another, across town, zig-zagging our way through.  The subway system is very straightforward, with clearly labeled signs; it is similar to London's and the DC's Metro system, where you need to just know the final destination for each of the lines to gauge which direction to go.  There are four distinct colors: Orange (Montmorency to Cote-Vertu), Blue (Saint-Michel to Snowdon), Green (Honore-Beaugrand to Angrignon), and Yellow (Berri-UQAM to Longueuil-Universite-de-Sherbrooke).  Transfers are at Berri-UQAM (for the Green, Orange, and Yellow), at Lionel-Groulx (for the Green and Orange), at Snowdon (for the Blue and Orange), and at Jean-Talon (for the Orange and Blue).  The stops do not guarantee that it will be closest to your destination point, but the buses that run can help you make that trek a little less.  Even with the buses, the signs are clearly labeled once you exit the Metro to know where the stops are located.  Just note, however, that not all bus stops has the pick-up times listed, and all the bus signs do not designated the direction (west-/east-/south-/north-bound; you pretty need to have a good sense of direction or a GPS) and know when to pull the stop bell and exactly which stop to get off at.  There are no maps on the buses, and no digital/announcement of which stops come next.  The bus drivers are, on the most part, very friendly - they greet you and answers all your questions.  Fares range from 1-, 2-, and 10-trips, unlimited evening and weekends, 1-day, 3-days, a weekly pass, a monthly pass, a 4-month pass, and a group pass (for 1 adult and a maximum of 10 children).  The OPUS card is when you purchase the unlimited week and up fares, and it's actually made of plastic with a chip - this is where you can also refill.  There is also a separate Aeroport P-E Trudeau (747) bus pass for $10, but your monthly, weekly regular, 1- and 3-day passes, unlimited weekend, and 4-month is accepted at no additional charge (just as long as you use within your time valid time frame).  Tickets can be purchased at any vending machine at the Metro stop and/or the airport.

The service was super and the food came out at a good pace. Highlight of the night was the super fresh sashimi, large juicy karaage and peach stuffed w/ cream cheese and topped w/ coconut ice cream (seasonal menu). Yum!

The interior has a nice open feel with a high ceiling and over sized chair and tables for some seating. 
The menu is decent for a brunch and it sorta hits all major food groups. The drink list is decent with a good selection beer (kudos for having an off beat selection for draft) 
I ordered a French Toast and my dinning companion had frittata (vegetarian version).
I ordered the drink of champions ;) as the coffee was not good. 
The service was decent I guess as the server was quite busy.
The food arrived shortly and looked visually appealing. 
The sides for frittata were decent with the main course being OK (portion on the smaller side)
The french toast was quite good and I would recommend if you have a sweet tooth but prefer not overly sweet items, nice creamy custard stuffing and nice topping of almonds and maple syrup.
A decent spot to have a brunch in this area. 
3.5 Stars.
I will be back just to try some other beers they have on tap.",2013-09-29 20:47:54

The food court has a good selection. The play place for the little ones is kept clean, well marked with clear rules and security is present.

We got a fabulous deal for here on Priceline ( under 50$ ! ) it's rated 4.5 stars and is well deserving of it.

We had the option of city view or mountain view ( we chose city ) it was nice. It overlooked the pool and even had a rather large balcony.

The suite itself was amazing ! It was a studio suite and had a very comfy bed with duvet, lots of seating room to relax or entertain, 2 TVs in the main area, And featured modern decor. 

Dark hardwood floor, carpeted living area, and marble tile floor in kitchen.

It also had a stainless steel kitchenette, with fridge, mini bar, sink, microwave, mini stove,  and even appliances ( toaster, blender, tea kettle. 

The bathroom was the best ! It was rather large, all marble and glass, with a floor to ceiling mirror, huge jacuzzi tub, separate shower with a rain shower head as well as a separate shower head, cool sink, light up makeup mirror and another TV. 

It would of totally got 5 stars for the suite itself. However one star was taken off for the staff. 

The morning after we checked in, we were told we had to switch rooms as the one we were in was being shown by a realtor. So we spend 1.5 - 2 hours packing up out stuff. When we were done, my husband went to go grab keys only to be told we no longer had to move. The lady was less then friendly to him. 

We asked for our room to be cleaned and it never was. However we did get towels and toiletries upon request.

We decided to go out and eat, and couldn't think of where we wanted to go.  I had seen the sign on the window earlier in the week stating that Manuel's had breakfast on the weekends.  My wife and I love Mexican food for breakfast, and decided to give it a try.

Manuel's on Bell Road has been recommended to us before by our neighbors who frequently eat there.  I also used to go to Manuel's on Cave Creek Road a lot, back in the day (early 1980's) when I lived close to that location.

Due to it being late in the morning, I called the restaurant ahead of time to see if breakfast was still being served.  The young lady that I spoke with told me they serve breakfast all day on the weekend.  When we arrived, the parking lot was very full, and we were worried about getting a seat, but there were plenty of seats available when we walked in.

Then the wait began...

Like many other Yelpers whose reviews I read, service (or lack of) seems to be the biggest issue with this restaurant.  

I'll start with the hostess...I'm not picky; but if you're going to be playing hostess, at least have a smile and try to make the customer feel welcome.  Also, if breakfast is a big thing for your restaurant on the weekends, include a breakfast menu when you seat your patrons. 

After we were seated, we waited almost 10 minutes for the young man serving chips and salsa to bring us some.  At least 2 servers/assistants walked by our table while we were waiting, and just looked at us.  To be honest, we were just getting ready to leave when the chips/salsa showed up.

About 5 minutes later (but probably longer...), our waiter (according to my receipt-Chris B) decided to put in an appearance, and take our drink orders and retrieve a breakfast menu.
I'm still waiting for the lemon I ordered for my drink...

Okay, enough for right now about the sterling service; and on to the food!

The chips and salsa were good.  The chips seemed a little old, but were warm and tasty.  2 salsas were brought out, a chunky mild which was good, and a smooth hot sauce which was very good (reminded me of La Canasta's or Valle Luna's).

My wife and I both had breakfast burritos, they were big and tasty, packed full of food.  My wife had bacon, egg, and potato; I had chorizo, egg, potato, and beans.  The only thing not perfect about my burrito, is that the tortilla seemed a little hard.  My burrito was very large, and I actually left about 2 small bites, it was plenty to fill me up.  Both the chorizo and the refried beans in the burrito were good and very tasty.  Junior is off of his bean burrito kick right now, and had a cheeseburger and fries; the burger looked very good (he said it was), and the fries were good.  

Drink refills were hard to come by, since our server did his best at not being around; except when it was time to drop off the bill.

About the bill, $22.58.  Not bad for 2 big burritos, a kid's cheeseburger and fries, 3 drinks, and a couple of bowls of chips and salsa!

Will we be back?  Not likely anytime in the near future.  The food was good and tasty (3.5 stars); but oh the service (.5 star)...

The poor service will keep us away from what is a nice, clean family owned Mexican restaurant.  Hint to Chris B, if you want to work in the customer service industry, try providing customer service.  Your tip would have been 3 times what you received; since I am usually a generous tipper, and I'm even more so during the holidays.",2015-12-31 14:10:39

Our waitress Chris was pleasant and funny. It took her a few minutes to get to us, but i think that was because the host sat us at a table that was not cleared off yet. There was still money and a coffee pot on the table. But chris took the coffee pot off right away and got our order. 
My husband ordered the chicken fried steak, it was delicious. Of course, I had to take a bite to make sure that it was not poison. Haha I ordered a BLT with avocado. It was delicious as well. They definitely dont skimp on the bacon. Always a plus! I ordered a Bloody Mary and could not choke it down. It was AWFUL. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!! But, hubby said that the coffee was delicious. So that is always good in our book! 
The shoe string fries that came with my sandwich were ah-may-zing! I always like to dip my fries in ranch. Chris forgot the ranch, but brought it a little later. Which was ok because I didn't end up using the ranch. They could most definitely improve on their ranch. It was too tangy with NO seasoning at all. Yuck. (I'm a ranch snob) ;)
My only issue with the server was that at the end I had a yelp check in and we were supposed to get a banana nut muffin. She told us for waiting on her because she had other tables that she was going to give us two. When we got our muffin there was only one. Dont tell your customers that you are going to give them two and not deliver. Small things matter.

Given the mission statement of this restaurant and being a sucker for comfort food, I've been wanting to check out this place since I read about it in the Charlotte Observer. I went for lunch yesterday-at 11:40A when we got there, there were maybe 3 tables occupied-when we left at 12:20P, the place was packed with a waiting list. This is in Charlotte-on a work weekday-what??! I love it and happy this place is here and thriving. There has been some turnover in this location since I've lived in Charlotte and it looks like this one will stay around for awhile.

I've heard fabulous things about all of the food---especially the chicken and flounder. You can choose a meat and choose three sides to go with it -most for under $10 which is a fantastic deal given the amount of food you could get. Our server was sweet, talkative and full of suggestions. She told us the meatloaf sold out each day so if we wanted to order it make sure we get there early. The special yesterday was Chicken Fried Chicken, which the other seven people in my group ordered. I was going to go with that but remembered reading Demetria M's review of the flounder. I decided to be a loner and order that along with collards, slaw and mac n cheese. If I'm eating comfort food, I'm going all out. Noshed on some biscuits before our meal came out (which seemed like it took 5 mins) and I am not a huge cornbread person but the others in my group said it was out of this world. The flounder was light, buttery and flaky and the tartar sauce was phenomenal!!! I think it was the best I've ever had and reminded me of a chunky aioli sauce rather than a traditional tartar. The mac n cheese, slaw and collards? Gone within five minutes. Everyone in my group received a membership to the clean plate club yesterday and I left without feeling the need to put on my fat pants.

Me: ""Picky bastard? Okay I'll quote you on that.""

I went to Honey Pig on a Friday night with that picky bastard along with 10 other friends. Most of us are pretty accustomed to Korean Food but hadn't been to Honey Pig before.  Their grills were really neat because they were cone shaped so all the fat would be separated. We decided to do All You Can Eat for $20 so we can get a little taste of everything. 

And taste EVERYTHING we did. We went down the menu like a checklist. We had the pork belly first and unanimously agreed on how tasty and fresh it was. Each meat they brought out after that tasted just as good or better. You could tell just by looking at the color of the meat that it was fresh. I especially enjoyed how they grill the bean sprouts and kimchee. Most of the banchan (side dishes) were good but I missed others that I had at other Korean BBQs such as steamed egg and soup.

Service was wonderful. Our waiter took the time to answer any questions we had and explain what everything was. Even with a huge group of 12, he cooked everything to perfection and made sure we always had enough banchan and drinks. They serve a rice flavored iced tea for free.

My picky friend pretty much tried and loved everything except for the squid (which he claims to be allergic to) and that in itself speaks volumes. I would gladly go back to Honey Pig again because everything was delicious and at a very good price.",2011-05-09 02:13:57

For some reason whoever served me that day said they didn't do that  and I had to choose one or the other so I chose chow mein and was charged extra for the rice.  I thought maybe their options had changed so I emailed the company and was told that is definitely not the policy and if I wanted half rice, half chow mein it is included in the price and I shouldn't have been charged.

It was a bit overwhelming at first... aisles and aisles of clothes organized by type (tops, jeans, suits, high-end designer wear) then by colour, then by size. They also carry shoes, sunglasses, purses, jewelry. 

We were probably in there for at least 2 hours, a few trips to the fittings rooms, but alas nothing was just right. While searching through the racks, I saw some wonderful items such as a gorgeous Vera Wang dress, Dolce & Gabanna white dress, and a cute pink skirt, a classic Burberry rain coat, and so much more!! The shoes... oh my! Fendi, Prada, Marc Jacobs, Manolo Blahnik, and more! Only thing was there was a pair of hot pink Louboutins that looked a little strange to be ""New"", looked like they may have been re-soled or rip-offs. 

After hours of going through the store, and going through the high-end designer wear rack at least 3 times, I found the piece that had to come home with me... a white Burberry cotton jacket, perfect for the spring!! Yes, it's used, a little worn with a few stray threads and a little bit of pilling, but no rips, stains, and all the buttons and zippers are there. Overall, with their 20% off promotion, I paid less than 25% of the original cost! A very comparable price to regular clothing stores, and a worthwhile investment for a piece I'll probably wear to death. 

This is going to be a new regular place for me to visit. Its one where you'll have to keep an eye out and hopefully get lucky in finding the perfect piece in the right size. (Don't you dare touch any size 10 shoes until I try them on)

I've been meaning to go and was one of my most anticipated restaurants to go to for awhile. This is what we ordered:

Svetlana - Horseradish vodka was what caught my eye but it was mixed to a point where there was little to no sharpness to it. Still an excellent drink that uses intresting ingredients.

Penelope - The drink basically tasted like a melted pomergranate limeade popsicle with the shiso leaf added that sweet plum flavor to it. 

5 pieces of Salmon / 5 pieces of Big Eye Tuna -  very thin and small slices but good quality and uses real ginger and wasabi

Oyster Rockefeller - Very good came with 4 oysters that were mixed with spinach and foie gras butter

Rhode Island Calamari w/ Miso Hollandaise - Calamari was cooked to perfection and that sauce was fire. The pickeled peppers did remind us of the same flavor of the peppers used in orange chicken at Panda Express but just like Orange Chicken...shit is fire.

Prime NY Steak w/ Miso Hallandaise & Waffle Fries - Steak was done the way it should be, medium rare, and the sauce being the same as the calamari was complimented well with the steak. Waffle fries weren't like Chick-Fil-A's at all and was more thinner almost to the point of it being like a chip. If only they had a soy wasabi based steak...

Overall you can taste the quality of everything from the drinks to the condiments and it borderline warrants the price tag of each dish however the non-entree portions and drinks are on the smaller side which makes this place more on the $$$ side then $$.

A small menu of sharing dishes that range from $6 to $25. Don't assume that if it's a $25 dish, it must be an entree, because the sizes are all pretty small, and you will have to order 2-3 dishes per person to feel full, regardless the price of each dish. 

We had the:
- Palak Paneer Nan (truffle oil, jalapeno, peppered honey): The flavourful bursts in your mouth but a bit too sweet
- Baby octopus tampura: a bit more bland than i expected
- Chicken gnocchi: The chicken is fried and really tasty, felt like a fried pork chop, and the gnocchis are tiny, but very flavourful. Also a bit too sweet.
- Twice cooked short ribs: Really good and tender.
- Miso black cod: my favourite dish of the night. The fish was fried perfectly and the potatoes were delicious.

The bill came out to be over $85 without drinks or tips for two people even though the food wasn't filling. We probably could have used two more dishes. 

Overall, I think there were too much fried food and most of the food was a little too sweet. The atmosphere and decor is extremely romantic though, so it's a great place to have an expensive date.

So off to the movies we went. It would not be easy. The UA turned Regal Showcase Theaters has an opposite mindset than the casinos. The hotels lay out their casinos so it is a challenge to find the exit. Showcase Theaters lays out their multiplex so that you cannot find the entrance. Walking along the Strip we stopped at the ticket venue location at Game Works. There was no person, and what seemed to be only a marque. We asked the person at the Half Off Tickets how to get to the movies. He directed us to a parking garage by Ross. Knowing that this would be as smart as walking in the Queens Midtown Tunnel, we asked for additional directions. Finally, short of getting a map, we were directed to walk east on the road that carries traffic on the north border of the MGM Grand. Kind of similar to walking in a dim alley.

  Finally, at the admission booth, we paid fair prices. If I had my Regal card, they would accept it.

  Believe it or not, we did not miss the coming attractions. I headed right to the snack bar. Going to the movies gives me an excuse to indulge in junk food. $12 poorer, I had two additional movie companions: a large coke and nachos and cheese. Drink refills are free on large beverages. However, finishing a large Coke is similar to finishing a Heart Attack Grill Quadriple Bypass Burger. I could only finish half. I did not like that the nachos came in a bag. When I pay $6 for nachos and cheese, I want it fresh and out of the oven.

  Now for the movie theater. In my opinion, if it was off the Strip (actually it is off the MGM service road connected to the strip), it would no longer be here for me to review. Stadium seating is nonexistent. I was not impressed with the surround sound, if they even have it. The seating could of been a slight bit more comfortable.

   We sat through far too many coming attractions. This is a slight bit complaint that I have of the movie theater industry.

  I give Regal Showcase Theaters three stars. The theaters  are outdated yet does the job of entertaining movie goers on the Las Vegas Strip. As far as finding the place, I found it to be more of an adventure than aggravation.",2012-01-21 20:16:06

On the flip side, $17 for two rolls, a salad and a beer is A-Ok in my book. The sushi? Holy wonderful, fresh, yummyness batman! I was surprised by how fresh it was and how much flavor it had packed in the rolls. Some mentioned that the rolls on BOGO nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays) were smaller but I felt they were appropriate sized pieces for what they are charging (I can't remember the names exactly but got the Furious Dragon and Sweet Romeo roll). The downside about BOGO nights is that there isn't any vegetarian options on the BOGO menu and it says no substitutions on the menu. 

The vibe was good-very vibrant with orange walls, moderate volume music and packed. They have a moderate sized bar area complete with the regular stuff you would expect-ESPN, Japanese beers and specials galore.

But there was just two people working  (I'm guessing husband/wife) so it's understandable. Plus I don't really care what the place looks like as long as it has good food and I don't see any critters running around. 
Speaking of food. I got the easy rare pho. The broth was pretty beefy tasting, came with less noodles than I was use to as well. After fixing it up with all the side veggies and some siracha, tastes perfect! 
The lady was very quick to refill out drinks as well. Prices are average and about what you would expect from other pho places.
All in all I thought this place was pretty good. Just be prepared that there is nothing fancy about this place...yet. they did just open so lack of decoration is to be expected.",2017-04-13 19:40:22

uI4JUOlUsJDmzBukpV9Cew,n4P8tLvD1ppd1m5SI242TQ,QARy4UUOQogMjDp9jP-YVg,4,1,0,1,"When I first heard that there was a new restaurant from one of the Top Chef contestants, I was very excited.  I'm a huge fan of the show, and everything that they cook always looks amazing!  So, I bought a Living Social deal and was excited to use it.  Then, I both heard and read mixed reviews, and I became a little less excited.  But, I'm very happy to say that I went last night and it was FANTASTIC!

First I must talk about one dish that was quite possibly the best vegetable dish I've ever put in my mouth:  the mushrooms with burrata and toast small plate.  Words cannot express how much my friend and I enjoyed this dish.  It is a small skillet filled with mushrooms that are cooked in something heavenly, and then you pile the mushrooms, burrata, and arugula on top of this perfectly thick, soft, buttery toast.  My only complaint was that there wasn't more toast!  But even that wasn't so bad because I could have just eaten those mushrooms for days.  This was about as flavorful of a dish as I've ever had.

The other fantastic small dish that we had was the chicken and waffle.  I was hesitant at first because the batter was made with Frank's Red Hot Sauce in it, and I am not a fan of hot sauce.  Much to my joy, the dish tasted nothing like hot sauce but just had a fantastic depth of flavor.  I am from the south, and I am not sorry to admit that this was my first chicken and waffle!  I hope they're all like this!  Also, it did not say on the menu, but I believe the chicken was stuffed with maybe ham or proscuitto and some sort of cheese.  It was delicious.

Our last small plate was the scallop with bacon and caramel.  This was the one that we were most excited about, but it turned out to be somewhat disappointing.  After the other two, we were expecting to be amazed again, and we were not.  It was good, but, I will probably not order it again, whereas I will be returning as soon as I can for the other two dishes.  

To top it all off, they give you these fantastic cheese biscuits when you arrive.  They are vey moist and flavorful and a great way to start the meal.

I only have two things to complain about, one of which was my fault.  I ordered the $12 La Primavera cocktail, and it was awful.  It is made with berry vodka, St. Germain, and Campari.  I love St. Germain and vodka, so I ordered this, not knowing what Campari is.  Well, it's a bitters, and, man, was this drink bitter!  I hate sending things back, but I had to send this back.  I can't imagine that anyone would like that, but, I guess if you're a fan of bitters, you might.  Our server was nice enough to take it off my tab, but that was about his only redeeming quality.  He wasn't a jerk or anything, but he wasn't particularly friendly either.  Also, we hardly ever saw him.  The restaurant was not anywhere near packed on a Wednesday night, but, for whatever reason, we saw everyone else who worked there a whole lot more often than our server.  The table next to him even had to ask another server to hunt him down at one point.  Having said that, though, it certainly wasn't bad enough that I wouldn't return.

Overall, both my friend and I were extremely pleased with our experience.  We left raving about the food and were just full enough but not disgustingly full after 3 small plates and cheese biscuits.  I will be going back soon, and I only hope that their other dishes are as good as these!",2013-09-12 17:18:56

For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.

At 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.

I need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.  As soon as I do, I have no doubt I'll be coming back to this review to change it from a 4-star to a 5-star review.

I sat down with my male technician who went right to work. 
Side note: I'm a nail biter, so my nails were pretty short going in but I need something on them to stop me from biting them.
The gentleman asked if I wanted a nail tip on them. Of course I figured this was an up-sale but he said same price! So I said sure! 

Well, if you've never had this ""SNS powder"" it's actually pretty cool. I'm so used to having to get my nails drilled, get acrylic for length, then gel on top. 
He simply glued a tip to my nail, cut to the length I wanted, and then they dip your nail into the powder (2-3 times like gel) but it sets with just a nail lacquer that they use (no UV light) . It was so much faster and I felt like I got the same thing I normally get for $15 less! 
I also heard the lady on the phone tell another person that they don't charge for nail tips which is awesome. 
He gave me a great quality service and I left with more than I expected.

Sausage gravy was store-bought and tasted like congealed fat mixed with cornstarch.  Ordered the Meat Lover's plate with grits and eggs over-medium.  Eggs came over-easy, grits were salty.  The Portuguese sausage was tasty--but they only gave me 5 1-inch diameter ovals of meat.  The ham measured 3"" x 4"" (if that) and was cold.  Needless to say, I was still hungry and this sparse plate cost around $10.  My wife liked her Eggs Benedict and country potatoes.  We split a Champion Pancake order.  Almost $10 for 2--but I think it was worth it.  Whole wheat cakes loaded with granola and fresh fruit items.

My biscuits were very buttery and the country gravy gave it a nice creamy texture to them. The potatoes were delicious and the sausage was just wateves. Luckily my girlfriend had to puke some more, so while she was gone I got to taste her country omelet. It sucked. cold, gross, and rubbery. Anyways, I asked for the check and to my surprise the meal was over 40 bucks. My girlfriend's OJ was 6 bucks. damn. if you get a screwdriver on the casino floor, that would have been free. I went thru my girlfriends purse and gave the server her credit card. -1 star for lack of security.

A little about my credentials:

I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.",2010-07-27 00:24:04

The mentaiko spaghetti with cream sauce, same thing. considering it was a small portion of carbs, wouldn't pay $13.99 for it again. But not taking price into consideration. good.

Honey toast. Not too big a fan of honey toast. I think it's a bit gimmicky, at the end of the day, it's a few slices of bread, a scoop of ice cream, and 3 chunks of mango for a whopping $17.

Shortly after, my sushi appetizer followed. Just looking at the appetizer I knew that it was good quality. Each bite confirmed this. The appetizer was one piece shrimp, one piece white fish, one piece tuna, and one piece salmon. All were amazing and melted in mouth. Then the Tropicana roll arrived. Wow. I almost didn't want to touch the plate because of the beautiful display that was sitting in front of me. Salmon and mango inside the roll and was served with sweet mayo which was REALLY good. It also comes with siracha but I requested it without. I didn't think that mango in a roll would make a lot of sense but it was amazing. Then my bento came. A little bit of chicken teriyaki in good sauce, various veggies and one shrimp tempura which were all done nicely, There was a nice big bowl of rice, There was also a nice salad, and a California roll.

We put our name down for a table, and waited around the bar for over an hour.  Meanwhile, we saw guests who arrived after us taking large tables in the bar area. We didn't realize that these tables were first come-first served, and the servers did not make us aware of this when we arrived.

We saw a large table sit empty for quite some time.  Myself and others in my party asked if we could at least sit there while we waited, and were told No.  The hostesses couldn't give us a straight answer on when we would be seated.  Finally, they sat us at the empty table, and told us they were trying to catch up on their other tables before seating us.  We told them that was fine, but would have appreciated at least knowing that, and could have sat there for drinks rather than standing around the crowded bar.  We asked to speak with a manager, and one never showed up.

This place is on a small plaza right on Yonge between Steeles and Finch and is a little hard to find, so GPS is your best friend.  Spoke with the server there and she told me this place was opened in June so it's still fairly new. On a Sunday night at 730 I was happy there was absolutely no line up!  First impression when I walked in is I love the little place with LDs (Yes Laser Discs) covers on some walls and drawing from kids on other walls.

Tables are nice, can easily seat 4 people comfortably and the stools (chairs) were so cool!  You can open the lid covering the base of the chair and store your jacket in there so your jacket won't pick up the Korean BBQ smell (A must for all Korean BBQ)!!!

Food wise, they have BBQ and regular items on their menu such as bibimbap, but I highly recommend going for the BBQ since you have a grill infront of you.  BBQ menu consists of either Pork or Beef and we went with the Pork Belly and the Beef ribs and both came super quick.  Took like 5-10 minutes to grill them and they were ready to eat!!  Pork Belly was juicy and tender and the beef tasted very good too!

I know Korean restaurants usually give you side dishes, but I was surprised how many side dishes the meal included!  Kimchi, Jalapeno, Carrots, Veggies (for you to wrap the meat), Bean Spouts Spicy soup and steamed egg!  I want to highlight the steamed Egg was AMAZIN and I almost ate the whole thing myself!

The tofu steak is delicious, hot enough for winter. I like the way they seasoned it with onion and garlic. Great job.
The Casa Loma roll which has eel and cream cheese in it was average. They should reduce the portion of the cream cheese, it made the sushi taste greasy, I even felt sick when I ate the last two. The ginger they offered was really bad. I know not many people eat it, but still they need to select it before hand to the customer. One piece of ginger was really hot. The purpose of the ginger is to ""reset""your tongue, but this one thumb my tongue.
The eel rice was way below average. The portion seemed large, but there were only five pieces of eel. They put a lot of sauce which for me is the spirit of eel rice. But it is not the special sauce made for eel rice, it tasted more like soy sauce. Blend, salty and tasteless. They even put pickle in it. I don't understand and they didn't even taste good.

My hands were super dry due to the harsh Vegas weather and it being the month of change ""October.""  So, I decided last minute to get a mani and called to make a same day appointment from my room (I was staying at Encore).  I easily got an appointment, and apparently I got to enjoy the perk of the spa too being a customer of the salon, however I was pressed for time so unfortunately I didn't get to enjoy this.  The mani I decided to get was called a custom manicure ($60).  In the brochure it listed it as an intensive treatment for dry hands with an exfoliation with dead sea minerals and a hydrating hand mask in addition to the regular manicure procedure.

The salon is so beautiful and my nail tech was so friendly and thorough.  I was offered  a mimosa and refills as well.  She even packed up some of the tools for me to take home, as they just discard it after a single use.  The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 star rating was because though my manicure looked beautiful and my hands were soft when I left, but by the end of the next night they were starting to feel dry.  Still dry, that I got a paraffin hand treatment at a salon near my job a couple days after.  Maybe, I would have been better off getting the regular mani with a paraffin treatment added on instead (would have totaled out to the same $60 price).

The spa & salons at Wynn & Encore are great places to pamper yourself, even if they are a little on the pricey side.  Especially when your on vacation, you deserve to pamper yourself every once in awhile.  I' just wouldn't recommend the custom manicure if you have very dry hands.",2013-11-08 16:57:49

Also, I'm not sure if they solved this problem since we were last there, but their prices on the menu didn't match the prices in their computers that they actually charge.  The prices were higher in the computer by anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar.  I know a lot of these are service no-nos, but my reviews are heavily reliant on the food and the food didn't disappoint.  I'll probably be back one day when I'm having my next heart attack food craving.",2016-04-30 16:07:37

This is a bargain compared to similar shabu shabu places, which sometimes charge more for just an a la carte or one-kind meat AYCE. 

There's lots of types of meat available, which you can select from the huge freezer on display, and then self-serve. I saw pork, pork belly, beef, chicken, lamb, and various weird animal body parts like intestines, if you're into that. Also clams, wontons, and other selections. 

I tried a variety of food, including pork, lamb, and wontons. They also have an extensive menu, which I ordered several orders of chicken wings from (really soft and juicy). Everything seems good here -- I might just go down the list and order 3 or 4 different items each time I come back. The vanilla ice cream was good as well.

And wow this place is going to be a huge success! It's located right by the Aria sports book near the Zarkana entrance.

The Aria signed an exclusive joint venture with the James Beard Award-Winning Chef and Restaurateur Shawn McClain. To have his name behind it, you know this place will receive top notch quality control and ingredients.

This place makes me love the Aria poker room even more now. (I'm going to gain so much weight from these pizzas everyday LOL)

I believe pizza by the slice goes for $5.50, and apparently they set oven temperatures to 550 Fahrenheit, and at 5:50 pm happy hour starts! (Hence the name Five 50) Pretty catchy I say. Oh and thanks for this information Nelson Q. :p

I tried three 16 inch pizzas with friends. All priced around $27-29. They were the:

TRUFFLE: potato, truffle salami, béchamel, fresh thyme, truffles

BLANCO: fresh mozzarella, ricotta, olive oil, chopped garlic, basil, and white cheddar

FARMSTEAD: country ham, crème fraiche, farm egg, olives

I would say the crowd favorite out of those three was the Truffle, definitely a unique pizza! The Blanco was very good as well, and the Farmstead wasn't our favorite. Just the over easy farm eggs on top where the egg yolk starts dripping everywhere wasn't the best texture and consistency to have on a pizza.

This place is a great upscale pizza joint and I would highly recommend a visit here if you absolutely love pizza and stopping by the Aria! The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is honestly because I've had better pizzas elsewhere in my lifetime. :p",2013-07-05 12:57:08

Well, minus the Starbucks across the street, but it's a Starbucks..so it doesn't count. Well..if they think they can lure me into their establishment with some fancy woodwork...they're right. 
Table for two please!

The patio was tempting, but the pollution was enough to drive me inside. I know the name should have been revealing enough, but it didn't occur to me that this was a sports bar. Korean sports bar..now that's just unusual. 
The place was beaming with Asian patrons, I was dying to find out what the buzz was about. 

The décor was lively. The huge collection of colourful bottles at the south end of the restaurant stood conspicuously lit, making the place seem more vibrant. It was like an enormous alcohol rainbow. Mmmm...alcohol rainbowww..
Unfortunately, the drinks on the menu doesn't come close to the selections on the wall. A huge toy sized aeroplane hung above me from the ceiling, not sure how that fits in. 
I see a lot of Women I'd see in the Scarborough area here, but only this environment was friendly. The wait staff spoke English without any difficulty, and the fusion of Eastern cuisine with Western décor meddled with much civility.  

The menu was interesting. I found many selections one would find in a place like St. Louis..only this place added a Korean twist to the food. There are a lot more choices with seafood, mainly comprised of squid and mussels. Instead of fries, you can get the fried rice. The prices were only slightly highly than what you would find at a normal sports bar. 

I ordered the ribs and wings with fries. My friend ordered a half pound of wings. I expected to get messy, but the ribs literally slipped right off the bone with a few pokes of the fork. I didn't get any sauce on my fingers! The chicken wings that came with it wasn't anything special. The fries were honeycomb shaped. 
I was content, good place to chill. The seating in here were half booths, half tables. I felt like I could approach the people in here. But really I can't. Because it's Asian.

All was well, until I decided to wash my hands in the washroom. FILTHY! It was a disaster! At a complete contrast to the front of house. I've been to better kept facilities in Chinatown! It reeked of spunk, toilet paper all over the floor, a cesspool for bacteria and germs.
Suddenly my opinion about the place changed.
What the hell is with the aeroplane above me?
Why do they have all the bottles when they don't serve any of them?
Why are there Scarborough looking people in North York? Dammit!

I fail to see how the wings here were crazy at all.

We went on a Wednesday night, and it turns out 90% of the menu has changed since it opened. They transitioned to a summer menu and for the most part, it's incredible food.

The steamed buns I would pass on. The Peking duck and the pork belly inside were good, but the bun itself is a bit dry. Also, it's very filling and I wish I had saved my stomach to eat our main course.

We ordered the steak Bibimbap and the seafood hotpot, with the special ($30 for 2 entrees, $5 more to get it with 4 specialty cocktails). The steak in the bibimbap had perfectly crispy edges and tender on the inside. The hotpot is to die for. I don't usually care for thick noodles, but these soak up so much flavor. My boyfriend also does not care for catfish-- except what was in this hot pot. Definitely squeeze some lime into it (comes on the side).

Those cocktails-- amazing. I had the Pimm Jong Il and boyfriend got a tasty canned beer from Nebraska. We also had the drink with sriracha-something in it. You've gotta try it, it's light but with an edge. Also made by a well-dressed man.

What I really admired was the co-owner working the kitchen (we sat at the bar, where there's an open kitchen). He knows so much about the food without being a pretentious jerk. Very friendly and very invested in the food. Wait staff was mostly on point and knew the menu in detail as far as taste/what to expect, so if you're not sure, they can probably give you a good recommendation.

I am really into old-school, old-fashioned, traditional Italian restaurants. Chinato is modern in decor, menu selection, and presentation. The menu is very electic and almost bordering on ridiculous in a way. There's a load of tongues, livers, and at least one if not two items in each section that I have never even heard of. Not to say that the adventurous type should not partake. But it's a little too esoteric for an ""everyday"" type of dining experience. I could totally see the cast of Top Chef being asked to cook here and use only the kitchen's ingredients. Putting it simply: they don't have lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, or chicken parm here.

I don't mean to sound like a bumpkin, nor do I wish to complain about Chinato in the least. Everything was very elegant. We were treated very well (however, since they were busy, drink orders took much too long to come out - even just a sparkling water, which I asked for 3 times by 3 different people before finally getting it). We had a large group for a business dinner and they accommodated us nicely (of course, make a reservation, even on a weeknight).

The portions were a bit small, too. The salad was great, but pretty much the size of my palm. The half-orders of pasta were truly half-sized, if not smaller. I was a bit disappointed in the tomato/basil gnocchi because it seemed to be drowning in butter and oil, with just a finely shaved sprinkle of basil and a few teenily-diced tomatoes.  

Ok, maybe I AM complaining (sorry). It's just that if you want your thick, red sauces, your big hunks o' meat, and your bowls overflowing with pasta, this isn't really the place for you.",2010-06-13 15:12:35

It's just a mall for Pete's sake and even a particularly great one. 

Edmonton Mall had their run as the world's largest mall once-upon-a-time, with their roller coaster and water park but they are a two trick town. Is either that, the Calgary Stampede or endless fields of wheat. Your pick. 

We have a bit more history and I would hope more to see than a mall. Since as far as malls go, Eaton's is nothing exceptional. It had the distinction of being the stronghold of the Eaton's empire before it got bought out. Leaving us with next to no Canadian institutions. Seriously, what do we got left? The Bay is long gone, Timmy's is American and we got no mayor beer breweries. Canadian Tire, that's it... and the banks.

Alas, if anything this mall is just long. Sure the glass dome over the two buildings lends itself for copious amounts of natural light and might make for a great photo of two. Specially with the flying Geese... What does everyone have a thing for the geese?

But the stores in there are no different than anything else you would find at Square One or Yorkdale. I guess it just depends on your budget. For example, my store of choice for regular clothing was the Mexx which has dozens of locations all across town.

Sure you can come in a pretty much find almost anything you need, it doesn't mean that you have to come here though. Since they do charge for parking plus, as mentioned before, this place is generally not as busy as it looks since most of the pedestrian traffic is people coming/exiting subway stations.

One word-sake. I never thought of myself as anyone who knew too much about sake, I was just thought it was pretty good and paired well with sushi. I enjoy cold sake and hot sake. I never knew that there was more to Sake then just that. Unfiltered, filter, etc. etc. Luckily, I was with my fiancé's uncle who travels back-and-forth between the US and Japan and who knows a thing or two about Sake. He bought a $100 bottle of cold, unfiltered sake and it was the most amazing thing I've tasted in my life. Not only was the buzz fun, but it tasted delicious.

The concept here is unique...you stand in line as if you were at Chipotle or Subway and choose your ingredients. While the pizza and its ingredients were tasty, the crust was not as thin as I expected hence I wonder if it's true Napolitan pizza as I've had before and that truly had very thin crust.

The pizza is big enough that you can easily share one with someone else for lunch or dinner. I did not see any desserts on the menu and would have liked to try them if they had some.

I asked if he could hold them until Monday and he countered Tuesday.  Sold.  Tuesday was yesterday with a curtain across the door and a handwritten note saying they are closed Monday and Tuesday (no phone call to let me know they're closed outside of their normal hours).  Fine, it's Wednesday - closed again, no phone call and the sign hasn't been updated for their closing.

UPDATE: The following Tuesday they were open (I called) and I got my shoes two weeks after dropping them off (granted: holiday, I get it. but still).  The new heel tips are stronger and look more durable than the orginal pair and no noticable wear on the fabric (from when the heel got squished from me walking on it all day until I could switch to another pair).  The older gentleman who took the shoes was not there, but a woman and younger man who were rearranging everything for a new carpet install.

FULL STORY: It's a gorgeous building, lots of sunlight, and nice exhibits (Van Gogh, etc, but also some quirky sculptures and rotating exhibits).

Two cafe options -- Provenance (more formal, sit-down, with a small bar lounge), or the more casual marketplace style cafe.  Both pretty good.  Wish there were better coffee options. 

They have monthly ""MIX"" events -- basically giant museum happy hours with live music.  

The sour spot here is the gift shop.  On two visits the same older woman working there was really rude and condescending for no apparent reason -- once to me, and once to a friend asking about hours.   On another occasion, we had purchased $40-$50 of gifts, and she refused to provide a bag (""For THAT small purchase?"")  Yikes.  So maybe avoid that trap.

Hearing of this spot for the first time from a top burgers in Toronto list, my friend and I descended on this quaint, old-timey-blacksmith-shop-that-a-hipster-renovated-type-spot with top quality beef in mind.

We dined on a Sunday at 6pm, so the place was essentially empty when we arrived. I often find that when a restaurant isn't busy, the service is slow and the waitstaff non attentive. Not the case here. Our server was delightful, knew the specials like the back of her hand and was always there when we needed her. In fact I tipped her 20%, and that ladies and gents, is not a common thing. You gotta work your buns, and that she did. But I digress. 

The burger: Boy oh boy is the patty sweet, juicy and cooked to perfection. And yes, you can have it cooked to your liking. I found the medium just perfect with a hint of pink. The caramelized Onions and Raclette brought a sweet and crunchy texture to the patty, and the egg brioche bun a light sweetness that really set off the finish of each bite. The burger comes with a side of fries, dusted with black pepper and a side of housemade ketchup that is mixed with paprika. If I could bottle this and take in home in a keg, I would. It adds the perfect punch to the fries, and being homemade, lacks the artificial sweetness of Heinz.

The beer: Not a lot on tap, and the waitress admitted that the availability of what is on offer is often out. They are apparently more of a wine spot. I was disappointed that my favourite bottle (Anchor Steam out of San Fran) was also sold out, but I did try the Beau's Amber which was comparable (and avail. on tap) and a German brew that came in a Octoberfest-style mug, which more than made up for any Anchor Steam woes.

The dessert: Oh. MYGod. The burger and fries is more than enough to satisfy, however I couldn't say no to the house made ice cream - Bourbon Whiskey-Smoked Vanilla Blueberry. For a mere $3, you get a scoop of sweet vanilla with wild blueberry, and a whiskey-smoke aftertaste. Genius. Not sure how often this is available, but if it is, DO IT. Holy smokes (pun intended).

The price: Expensive in burger terms ($18) but definitely worth it. Quality comes first at Bestellen.",2013-08-28 16:19:52

Let's just say the group I was rollin with was a tad bit inebriated when we decided to do a family dinner. I mean what better place than the Gardens? Because when you're there, you're family. At least that's what we kept repeating all night long. 

So they set up our party of 10 or in this little alcove with one long dining table. Great move on their part - keep the drunk asses separated from the rest of the dining room. It took about 30 minutes to get bread and WATER! Let's not even get into how many times we asked for service. Honestly, I felt bad for the chick. They probably thought we weren't gonna tip. But hey, you have auto grat. Don't overlook us. This other guy server came out and was helping and ultimately he became our server. Typically, when I patron these corporate restaurant chains, I expect good service. I know they have corporate training and I know they have really high standards. I mean come on, they want your feedback. They give you those surveys to fill out. This particular occasion, the service was awful in the beginning. They started to make up for it, but it was already too far gone. 

So the food. Here's the thing about the Garden. They get you all kinds of stoked when you're watching their commercials. The food always look so melty and delicious. And then when you get there, FAIL. The food is cold and lackluster. I mean the only thing they have going for them is the endless salad. I can get down on that salad. But even the bread, I don't know why I say it's good. I really don't think it's good. I know it just comes in a bag frozen and they heat 'em up.

A Groupon was available so I purchased the deal and headed back to Kohler with a friend who goes there regularly and we spent the morning getting a facial and a manicure.

The facial - I get facials often at other places and know the general routine. The tech was sweet but she did not explain what she was doing to me, ask me questions, recommend products, etc. There also was really no privacy for taking off/putting on clothes, etc other than a sheer curtain that did not cover my treatment space. She also did not do extractions even after her instructor told her too. However, in the end I still left feeling clean and moisturized. The next day I woke up and I was broken out all over my face AND my chest. I have never broken out on my chest in my entire life. It has taken almost two weeks for my skin to clear. I have no idea what products they used but clearly it was not right for my skin. 

The manicure - Much better this time, but the polish was still way too thick. Three hours later I had three chips and I had done nothing but have a late lunch, do some light shopping, and drive home. The next day the polish looked so bad I had to take it off.

It's next to a few convenient things - post office, harris teeter - so it can definitely get crowded at times. I definitely recommend ordering online beforehand to skip the line.

All the ingredients I've ever selected from a salad here have been great and I can't really recall a bad bite. The only thing I wish they would do is dress the salads a LITTLE bit more. However, I always end up grabbing a dressing on the side to make the salad a little bit better for me, and that always works out.

Lahaina definitely took a step down since the last time I've been here.  I use to think Lahaina had some of the best food with decent prices.  The prices have since changed.  This place use to sport a 50% all day Happy Hour.  Now, it's only 10%.  I had their Yellow Tail Nigiri, Salmon Nigiri, Tempura Shrimp Roll, and Spicy Tuna Hand Roll.  I didn't think the food was that great.  Both nigiris were small and the fish didn't taste as fresh as other sushi joints out here.  The Tempura Shrimp Roll was actually ordered on accident.  I didn't realize that this was a deep fried roll.  I thought it had too much tempura, which took over the taste of the actual roll.  As for their hand roll, this was the only thing that was fairly sized, but the tuna had a paste type texture.  Taste wasn't that great either.  If there was anything good about the food, it's probably just the price.  Even though Lahaina no longer has the 50% Happy Hour, the prices for everything is still pretty cheap. One hand roll, two sushi rolls, and four nigiris cost about $30.  This is not bad at all.

It's the ambiance of the place that takes the biggest plunge.  After 11 PM, this place becomes a 21 and over hang out.  I thought everyone looked and acted even younger to the point that Lahaina reminded me of a teen club.  The music is dialed up so loud that I could barely hear the conversation that I was having with my friend. Because of all this, Lahaina now attracts a bunch of the young cats that were up to no good.  While outside, I was even approached at least three times and asked if I was a cop.  I guess I have that look, but it's more paranoia from this kids if you ask me.  

Overall, I can no longer suggest this place to friends or family.  In the past, this is where I shipped them.  Now with all the other options in Las Vegas, Lahaina sits at the bottom.  The one thing going for Lahaina is their bar and hours.  Other than that, I think I will pass on Lahaina.",2013-03-10 22:22:17

I've been here a couple of times now because of my doctor's office being just down the street, and this is a great place to grab a quick bite that's not fast food. It actually reminds me quite a lot of Sushi Inn which is closer to Bloor-Yonge station.

The service is attentive and polite (but not overly friendly or personable) and is very effective at getting your food quickly. The food is fresh and always hits the spot. Between your sushi, salad and soup, you should be coming away feeling quite filled. They don't have the most flavourful rolls and sushi you'll ever have ( it has that bland rice that's typical of cheaper sushi), but for the price it's really fair.

Judging by the fact they have a discount for takeout and they're attached to an office building, I'm going to guess that a good portion of their business comes from the lunch rush and local delivery. And for that, it's perfect.

Along with breakfast, they have a nice selection of entrees for lunch and dinner. They have your typical Filipino meats and sides you can get along with your meal. Some foods I had during my meal included dinuguan, pork adobo, and chicken skewers. Honestly, everything that I had tasted delicious. There were no flaws in the foods that I tried, and their chicken skewers were so amazing, it was my favorite part of my meal. The staff is really kind to their customers, and I really appreciate the professionalism. I guess the only downside to this place is the seating. There are hardly any spots during the busiest time of the day to sit and eat because of the amount of people who go to eat there. I guess it speaks good things if there is no sitting due to the amount of customers they get right? I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys delicious Filipino food and nicely grilled meats!",2015-11-13 18:31:11

It's like the organizers basically said  ""Let's get's a bunch of people to fill the space under this bridge for three days and see what happens.""

I'm so glad I finally stopped by, because this place is definitely a new favorite of mine. D's is a little divey, but has a charming simplicity being that the menu is centralized around hot dogs and beer, and it doesn't get much better than that!

I started with a Bronx Summer Pale Ale while my boyfriend and I waited on another guest. Their list of beers was decently sized and decently priced. I think my beer was somewhere around $6, which is standard in the city. This place scored major points for having veg friendly options including their veggie dogs, which was what I opted for ""Big Ben"" style. It was a close call between the Big Ben and the Hot Valentine, but the Big Ben won me over with toppings that included a hefty portion of slaw, cheese sauce, fries, and grilled onions that I added. The Hot Valentine will be my choice next time, and that one has sweet potato fries and sriracha slaw as toppings. Every topping was generously portioned on my dog, and it tasted even more wonderful than it looked in that fluffy poppy seed bun.

The daily specials at D's are something to consider, and the one my boyfriend seemed to be most excited about was the $5 burger night on Sundays from 5 to close. I'm not much of a burger eater, but this is a good deal. On another day, Wednesday if I'm not mistaken, they have any style hot dog with fries for $6. Other specials include wings, pizza, kielbasa, brats, hot sausages, etc on different nights of the week. All of them sound like they're worth trying! On the topic of specials, they also feature a monthly special style of hot dog. This month was a Yankee dog with baked beans, potato chips, and I think cheese on top. Baked beans on hot dogs is an amazing creation, and my boyfriend even mentioned coming back monthly to make sure we try their special dog.

Only thing I would make note of is that it can be pricy to build your own 6 pack at around $4 or more per beer, but they have a massive selection of beers in the beer cave. To any friends that are looking for a solid cheat meal or even just a good, tasty treat that won't break the bank, come to D's and they've got you covered! I'm definitely looking forward to coming back.",2018-07-30 15:43:49

I usually skip the #2 bestseller and go for the strip steak sandwich instead. A couple bucks more but a much better steak sandwich. No sides necessary as the sandwich is filling enough - at least for me.

For the tourists out there, I can't imagine most of you will ""love"" these sandwiches. It's sort of in our DNA as a Pittsburgher.

Sano Sushi recently opened late Dec 2011.  

We had no expectations going in.  No yelpers had reviewed it yet. yahh a FTR :p

We decided to go for dinner here last Saturday around 6pm


General comments:

-The food was cooked, prepared and presented well. 
-The portion size per order was about right for 2 diners.
-They have a good variety of Japanese dishes to select from with some unique house offerings in the rolls/appetizers/teppanyaki area. I'd say this Japanese restaurant offers a good balance of  raw and cooked dishes to please most palates.

See menu link below for their offerings:
http://www.sanosushi.com/menu.html


Things we liked:

-Sano Shrimp - very creamy orange colored sauced Shrimp dish, house specialty
-Agedashi Tofu - perfectly prepared and taste
-Garlic Beef - one of my favorites, but can be improved with larger chunks and better quality cut. 
-Salmon Rose - looks nice on the plate, like a Rose :)
-Volcano Roll - awesome, very colorful, crunchy, not typically a menu offering at AYCE places
-Red Tuna - my choice fish, it was offered but the freshness isn't up to Japan/West Coast standards obviously.

Service - courteous, and patient. our server asked how things were. she was also patient- did not rush us to decide on our food selections or rush us to leave.


Things that were bad:

Fried Oyster - not fresh, despite being deep fried!~ :O
Salmon Teriyaki - slimy, salmon not cooked enough, not flaked. sauce thick and globby.

The decor needs a bit of improvement - paintings are not Japanese themed, the spotlights lighting at the booths were too bright, I think my forehead is now tanned. . lol. another note on the booths, they are back to back so if you have some overly active people sitting behind you such as young kids jumping up and down, you'll feel everything in your seat. I'd avoid sitting at the booths next time. The central interior of the restaurant has some tacky draping crystal strands and some multicolor rainbow neon in the ceiling. What the heck is this?!

Overall despite the questionable choices in interior decoration it will be my choice AYCE Japanese restaurant  for Central GTA. (Prince Sushi rules the West and Ten Ichi rules the East).

We experienced very good food quality and service at Sano Sushi. I'm hoping they can keep this up long term.",2012-01-17 05:27:19

pVpQugNGc9pdHFi5KYEhfw,RaNkWBMywhBqCZOQWSN_SQ,Khs3iUmkHce7xpAyOo5kRg,3,2,2,0,"First time ever at Ray's. There's a location near where I work but it always looked a little too seedy. Tonight we were all set to head out for dinner at Outback Steakhouse for my birthday. I figured that the q-tips and their snowbird brethren would all be in bed by the time we got there (7:20pm) but no, the woman there asked me if I had call-ahead seating and when I said ""no, er, how long's the wait?"" she told me it would be 40-50 minutes. I basically walked out of there, pushing past some Minnesotans on the way back to my car. I'm not standing around for freakin' ANYWHERE for that long, not even a Ramsay restaurant. We wound up driving to Ray's on a whim as I just couldn't be stuffed trying to figure out anything else.

Got a giant Sicilian ""monster pie"" (ie a supreme) - they kindly left a single square without any topping but cheese, for my toddler. Took about 15 minutes to cook, but that's fine because we're an uber geek family - we iPhoned, Droided and Leapstered up and next thing you know, the food was on the table. It was possibly the largest pizza I've ever seen and yep, it was square. Took a slice and went at it with knife and fork; I get real messy if I eat with my hands, especially with something this size. The bottom of it was real hard to cut - crunchy. After a couple of slices, my right index finger had a rut in it from pressing down so hard on the end of my knife, and my fork looked like Uri Geller had taken it up the wrong 'un.

The pizza was actually pretty good. Good enough for me to finish about four slices of it. It reminded me of the Chicago 7 (one of my favourite pizzas ever) from Old Chicago over at Bell and 57th. The kid actually ate more than expected, about half of his slice (which is a typical sized meal for a toddler like him, way more than half a grilled cheese sandwich). It was late so I didn't let him finish the rest although he probably would have. The wife finished two slices. We still had about half the pizza, I'm guessing almost 2 pounds of food left to take home. Everything including a free pitcher of soda for $21 including tax. Not bad at all. Considering that on my recent trip back to Australia I paid $120 (US$128) for lunch at an Indian restaurant for three adults and the kid, I'd say that a meal of this magnitude was pretty good value - quantity and a decent amount of quality too. I didn't mind that the pizza was a little crunchy on the bottom, it actually lent it a good texture. Maybe that's standard for Sicilian, maybe they overcooked it, who knows - I'm not an expert. But the wife gave it three out of five stars, which is actually above average for her, and I'll give Ray's that on Yelp as well.

From time to time, they might be out of your favorite flavor, but there are usually plenty more to choose from to make up for it.

At certain times during the day, you can watch the magic happen through the large glass windows, on the frosted conveyor belt of yummy goodness.

The dining area has ample tables and a few lounge chairs, hi tops, and couches to chill at.

The drive-thru is great when you're on the run.

The one thing that always sticks in my mind when I come in here though is that the dining room seems to need a remodel. It's nice, but it's not taken care of. The furniture is worn, the paint is chipping in some areas against the seating walls, and the floor needs another coat of paint.",2015-06-01 18:44:43

Being a cocktail drinker and not so much of a beer person, I was skeptical at the quality of cocktail a man-bar may create.

I knew this was the drink for me after that remark!   And, it arrived in all it's Strawberry Sangria glory and was DELICIOUS!!   The boys with me enjoyed their brews and a great time was had by all.

Located a few minutes off the 515 in perhaps one of the less reputable parts of town, Sunny's serves a lot of the kinds of fried goods that you might expect at this part of town: fried chicken, chicken wings from six (with fries) to 100 per order, chicken fingers, cheesesteaks, fish, fries, and a few sides. On the sides menu, however, are gizzards and livers. Definitely not typical, but definitely the reason that I went.

When I asked for gizzards and livers, Sunny asked me if I wanted them mixed together, aka in one order. I was surprised but very happy, especially when I saw that the half-and-half order still cost $3.29 and still was a huge portion. Both of these organ meats are lightly battered and fried with salt, pepper, and likely some other pieces lending a great crunchy exterior. Inside, the gizzards are delightfully chewy, whereas the livers are squishy and very gamy. Don't order livers on your own if you don't know what you're getting into!

My other order was chicken and waffles. Not sure if $3.99 was the right charge since most say it's $3.59, but I won't quibble over a few dimes. You can have two pieces of any typical fried chicken pieces for this order. I chose dark meat (leg and thigh). I actually thought this chicken had a little less flavor in the batter than in my side orders, but it was piping hot, juicy and made-to-order. Hey, it'd better be fresh after I waited at least 15 minutes (possible explanation later).

The waffle was soft and not crunchy at all even though I dined in. The syrup was standard stuff (get extra, you'll need it), but the hot sauce was way too acidic for my taste. Overall, definitely not my favorite rendition of chicken and waffles, although certainly reasonable for the price.

Speaking of which, prices appear to be mostly if not all identical to photos taken close to when they first opened. They don't offer burgers anymore. I suggest calling ahead (as many others observably did) to minimize wait time.

I would try different entrees before going back to the chicken and waffles, but I've still giving Sunny's a solid 4 stars because of the good value (do the math on some of the portions though) and because the offal is anything but awful.",2015-02-13 00:58:55

Apps. And I'm not talkin' the downloadable kind, although there are some appetizers here that just might be as addictive as Angry Birds. Beckett's made brussel sprouts sexy, which was the first brussel sprout magic trick I saw that night. The second was performed by our massive group; a disappearing act. I'm usually left to demolish what's left on plates but was actually kind of pouty when there were no sprouts left for me to kill. Get 'em. I was less impressed by the mac n' cheese but I'd still get it again. Roasted veggies were solid and little enchiladas were zingy.

I ordered the pork osso buco confit which I think I remember being outstanding. I ate it so fast it's probable that it was absolutely remarkable but I didn't take the time to savor it and its puffy little risotto bed. That's usually a sing that it was incredible.

Topped off with cilantro and onions/cabbage and the side salsa they came with, these tacos were all delicious.

Outside entrance at Langham Place, restaurant is by the corner along the side of Cha Me Cha and Zen Q. Lots of parking available (either outside or underground). 

Restaurant size itself is not too big (maybe fit up to 50 people max) and most tables were setup as a group of 4 - so perfect for a family or small group.

Interior has a homey feeling, with a few drawings advertising their specialty. Service overall was okay - the staff that served us didn't seem to know much English. But there is an English menu with pretty clear instructions, so ordering was not an issue.

Food
Came here for a quick lunch - so I tried their MM Original Rice Noodle served with Lamb.
What's different about this place is they serve everything separately. You get a hot bowl of broth, with noodles, vegetables and meat on the side. Think of it as a hot pot, but just for a few ingredients. It was a very interesting experience as you can make what you want as you go. 

The broth was very hot and rich in flavor (didn't get a big MSG taste to it). Noodles were long and thin, a traditional Chinese-style. The lamb itself was good - it has a gamey flavor to it (which I personally like), so it might not be suitable for everyone. There were also different sauces you can dip for the noodles or add to the broth, and simple sides like corn and mushrooms.


Overall it's a nice place to swing by for a quick bite or warm up your stomach on a cold/windy/sick day. Price is also justifiable ($10-$15). I'll be interested to go back and try their other broths to see what kind of difference would it make.",2017-09-05 17:13:05

You can pay upwards of $7 for a street taco in Scottsdale that will be overly complicated and not as good as these which 1/3 the price. The carne asada, carnitas and marinated pork tacos are both flavorful and tender, I suggest using some of the green and red sauce they provide to add flavor with a squeeze of lemon. If you haven't ever tried Lengua (cow tongue) this is the place to try it but I prefer the others mentioned above. The homemade tortillas are always soft yet don't fall apart.

3) service is great (you order at counter, pay, and the bring your order to you, and check in to see if you need anything)
4) inviting and large patio seating with misters, some tables, more in direct sunlight, have umbrellas

Not so pro: 1) I sat on the patio at a corner table and I saw a desert roach crawl near and past my table - I get that these guys hang outside for most part but, it scared the crap out of me.

Service:
The service was amazing. The servers were very friendly and explained the menu well. 

Food:
Bread and olives- The bread was nice but it wasn't amazing. I will probably not order this again. 

Beef tartare and sunchoke- I love tartare in general so I knew I had to order this. Everything in this tartare went well together. I would recommend this appetizer. 

Cappelletti di zucca- this was a seasonal pasta dish. It was really rich in flavor and it was delicious. However, I expected the pasta dish to be larger since it was listed as an entree. It looked more like a side dish. Other than the size being too small for the price, the pasta was really good. 

Short rib ragu with meatballs, spareribs, and tripe- this was another seasonal dish. This dish was interesting. It was a mix of meats on corn meal. I wasn't a big fan of the combination. The meats were rich in flavor and the corn meal is supposed to balance it. However, I didn't like the texture of the corn meal with the meats.

I always get exactly what I order, and it always tastes exactly like what I want it to taste like. I know that sounds kinda silly, but it's true. Plus, they do a few nice little touches that I appreciate- they separate some things when you order delivery so that noodles/etc don't get soggy. Same with their walnut shrimp- they put the sauce on the side (since it can make the shrimp hella soggy when they slog it on there like some other places do).

This is definitely an Americanized Chinese place, and sometimes that's just the thing to hit the spot. Especially for late-night gaming sessions. So I'll keep on ordering from Tsing Tao, and I hope that they always stay exactly the way that they are now.",2015-02-10 03:35:45

So my advice is either come with a smaller group, or arrive around 11am ish so you can get a table when the first wave finishes their breakfast.

I tried their special of the day, which uses ingredients from local ontario farms (great option for those who supports local produce) It got two eggs, their homemade english muffin (that taste more like pancake), bacon, home fries, some fruits, and rabbit sausage. The rabbit sausage was so good! It's a big plate! So you will definitely good until supper time!

I also ordered a cappuccino, well I'm not a fan of foam, but my server made it extra foamy. 

Service was good, we didn't make any special request, so I guess that wasn't tested ...

So, instead of printing menu books, they use table sheet as their menu...and they do re-use them...so one of the sheets they gave us is dirty and they still recycle that.

(I avoid Mesa the same way I avoid nests of black widows, but that's a separate issue.) I admit that there are a FEW places in Mesa, and I mean a FEW, where I will spend my money. Red White and Brew is one of those few locations. 

Mesa doesn't have many restaurants like this, especially not in north east Mesa. The floor plan is open, airy, well lit and feels roomy to me, even when the place is jam packed. I like the décor, it feels urban and modern. They bring to the table little buttery garlic bread things, which are good but filling. I have to have one and stop. I'm still impressed with their delicious barbeque chicken pizza and it's my default choice if I can't decide on anything else. I have tried a number of other dishes: pasta, steak, fish, salads and have enjoyed every one. The portion sizes are pretty damn enormous and I find it best to share with someone. The dessert menu is always a temptation as well. 

They have a nice wine bar and I like their selection of draft beer. (In the winter, they sometimes carry Pumpkin Porter from Four Peaks. It's a seasonal favorite and if I wasn't so paranoid about calories, I'd drink it all the time.)

I've never had an unpleasant experience with the staff. They have always been friendly, helpful, and professional. 

The last time I checked, they don't take reservations, which makes going with a group a bit difficult. Depending on the time of day and the day of the week, the wait to get in can take a while.

However, the crab cakes could've used a little more crab and a little less bread so I was a little underwhelmed having previously lived in Maryland where there's a very high standard for crab cakes. The meal came with breakfast potatoes, which were good. Overall, this is a great place to come for breakfast.",2015-06-18 18:01:31

The place is very modern in decor; the front portion of the restaurant is definitely themed as a swanky lounge with a large projection TV mounted above a fireplace. Past that the walls are lined with booths, a few offering good seating for large groups. Four top tables fill the inner space, leaving not much space between the lime chairs. 

What totally seemed out of place was the plate ware. It was plastic - think school cafeteria - and is by far the cheapest out of any restaurant in town. It certainly takes the feel of the place down a few rungs. 

We were given a slightly corny, but well intentioned, ""welcome to our house,"" greeting upon arrival - twice. Everyone was friendly. Perhaps too friendly; even staff who had no reason to interact with our table said hello and asked with no point in mind how we were as they passed by. 

Grits were 86ed from the menu, which we were only informed of after ordering them. Rice or any other side was offered instead. I ordered Monique's Love for a very reasonable $10. The fried chicken breast was large. The breading was kept to a light thickness and was seasoned nicely. Monique's comes with a choice of one waffle, potato salad or fries. I chose the waffle. The waffle was on the thin side and was soft. It was a positive though I thought that the waffle did not take away from the chicken, but acted more as a mode for eating it.

For being a new restaurant some of the hesitation and hiccups in service are to be expected. The staff's friendliness was a valiant attempt to make up for the few areas the service lacked.",2016-12-23 21:08:24

Went with the wife and was very satisfied.   We both got the lawry cut and were stuffed by the end of it.  I think it was about $47 (expensive but at least it's very quality food) and it came with a salad, which I was super into.  I didn't even know I liked beets before I had them in my salad and now we are like BFF.   Actually, meat will always be my food BBF, but beets and I are cool now.   

The meal also came with mashed potatoes, which you usually have to order separately when you go to a steakhouse.   Definitely a bonus that it was included.  I asked if they had some sort of magic wand to turn my mashed potatoes into garlic mashed potatoes.  Needless to say they did, and I feel like it was a mega upgrade.  

Also shared a creamed corn with the wife.  Who knew corn could be so satisfying.  They took good care of us and we felt very welcomed and cared for.

Okay, compared to other buffet options, this place isn't the best, or the fanciest, but it's pretty damn good bang for the buck! I went here on a Sunday night, feeling kind of disappointed for letting my out of town friends pick the restaurant for dinner. However, for 24 bucks, we got a pretty decent selection of food. Absolutely no wait, clean, and pretty good service. 

My street creds:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",2013-11-28 01:04:19

I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly we got in & out on opening day AND it was also the 1st day of the Tempe Festival of the (F)Arts, so it was extra crowded on Mill Ave today.

I have to say I'm stoked there's a new lunch option within 2 minutes walk of my office.  Since the dirty Uno's closed on Halloween my walkable lunch options have been reduced to LaBoca (which I prefer/reserve for drinking  1/2 half off drinks), P. F Chang's & Chili's.....with an occasional jaunt to Z-Tejas or the Tavern on Mill (time permitting, natch).  

One of my co-workers is from D.C. and has been wet over 5 guys opening for weeks.  Today we finally got to imbibe & partake of all that is 5 Guys.  The food was excellent. The service was fast & efficient for the crowds they served (so glad they were cognizant & well-prepared for things today -- a true surprise for Mill Ave restaurateurs who typically seem clueless to the community in which the run a business), and frankly I loved the food.  Basic, simple, no BS and plentiful portions.  

I got a cheeseburger with ketchup, mayo, lettuce & tomato & was pleasantly surprised to find it was a delicious double pattty upon my return to work with my heavy sack o'goodness.  The fries are flat out phenomenal & today's beauties came from ""ground apples"" straight outta Shelly, Idaho.  I appreciate the localization of the carb offerings.  They're skin-on, hand-cut beautes fried in peanut oil (as all things there are cooked, apparently), and the fountain cherry Coke capped off my mid-day repas with classic American stylee & finesse.

I went large with lunch (XL coke & XL fries) and my tab was in the $13 dollar range....which is not odd for Mill Ave & I didnt hafta tip, so awesome.  A co-worker went tiny-sized and got a single burger, small fries & a soda for under $10.  I'd definitely return again, but most likely when I'm having a stressful day, require a greazy lunch and should probably take a good walk after lunch.  I will return for fries and want to try the cheese fries and the hot dog selection.

If you want to save yourself some time, just stop reading here and go, already. Unless it's Sunday, in which case they're closed, and you should go on Monday.

Reathrey Sekong is the sole Cambodian restaurant in Phoenix, and you'll quickly see why once you've eaten here: It would be really hard to compete with. The ambiance and decor are gorgeous, inviting, and tranquil, the menu's varied and intriguing, and the dishes come out absolutely delicious. Service can seem slow if you're used to being rushed in and out the door elsewhere, but if you're not in a hurry, you'll appreciate the attentive but laid back service that gives you time to unwind, savor each dish you order, and actually enjoy the company of whomever you're with. 

My partner and I have been here many times and never been disappointed. Do bring your sense of adventure; this isn't some bland Americanized place. There's lots of fermented funk and heat (though also plenty of dishes without), and there's plenty of offal on offer if you're feeling gutsy. 

Reathrey Sekong is great for date night, a family dinner, or even just being too lazy to cook for yourself.

I was disapointed to find out that printers are sold w/out cables to connect to your computer! The cheapest printer was around 60$ no cable.

Their burgers are filled with flavor and the onion rings are done to perfection. From their turkey burger with green sprouts, avocado, and a spicy mayo sauce, I get it when I want to try to feel healthy, but then I order it with loaded fries or the onion rings that are just coated perfectly. 

FlipSide has great beer choices which is a must with any good burger. But if you aren't looking for a burger, they also have flavorful salads with all different types of meats on them. Also, they don't mind you ordering without a bun (I don't do that, that's my mom's doing).

Sure I could just get a bottle of my preferred drinks, but there is just something about having one cold and fresh from a tap.

Have never had a bad experience with the food. Love the XYZ burger - cooked fresh, humongous, and any burger is a winner with fried onion friz. The big zac is just as good, with onion frizzles. It does come with two patties, but they aren't as big as you think. The fried pickle planks are a nice touch and the sauce compliments the burger.

Love the chips and dip. It's a bummer sometimes when the chips seem dry, cold, and a little tough like they just sit out too long. Made to order would be better. French onion veggie dip compliments it very well.

Got a pizza for the first time the other day and was pretty pleased with it. It has what seems to be a neopolitan style crust, thin and crispy. Props to the pizza guy, managed to put 5 toppings on it(mostly veggies) and the pizza was far from soggy with everything on it. Decently priced and worth it no matter what you want on it. At this point ill go so far as to say its a better choice for pizza in the Gordon Square area.

If you live in AZ, or visit AZ, if you do not try this wonderful restaurant, you are missing out on the finest dining experience I have ever had.  To some, that may not seem like a bold statement, however, I travel and dine at a lot of restaurants.  I have experienced some of the finest restaurants and cuisine in the world, and Eddie V's has raised the bar so high, there are only a handful of places that you can compare them to.  

Typically I dine in the V Lounge, and on weekends, this bar is so busy, people are standing three deep drinking and enjoying the music and atmosphere.  The service at the bar has recently exceeded even my expectations.  I am sure finding good bartenders is a tedious task, but currently they have ""nailed it"".  Eddie V's has always had a couple of strong bartenders, but they currently have three really strong, amazing bartenders, and one fantastic bar back.  Together they do not miss a beat.  No matter how busy they get, they are all fun, personable and provide excellent service.  

Eddie V's latest addition to the bar staff, was a shock to me, but has proven himself to be a stellar performer.  When I first met him, I was skeptical, as I am typically accustomed to Steve making my perfect cocktail.  The day I met this new bartender, whose name is Mike, I had a really rough day, and did not feel like training someone to craft my beverage.  Much to my apprehension, Mike crafted a perfect beverage.  I later learned, he was actually a paramedic by profession, and during the particular visit, I had a headache.  Mike asked if he could show me something to relieve it, again skeptical, but intrigued.  Mike came around, held a few pressure points in my poor aching head, and about 2 minutes later, headache was gone.  In addition to perfect cocktails and perfect food, I was given the opportunity to meet someone that I hope will remain with Eddie V's for years to come.  I believe he truly is an asset to this team. 

I have entertained multiple vendors, friends and employees in the V Bar, and Mike makes everyone of them feel like a ""regular"" customer.  Mike is always happy, always smiling, always fun and never seems to get stressed or bothered by anything around him, and I always leave feeling like I am the most important person in the world.  Mike just has an innate ability to transfer his amazing, positive energy to the entire room. 

If you have never had the pleasure of having a bartender that you immediately feel like they are your friend, then please stop and meet Mike. He would love to welcome you!",2013-03-06 21:49:18

Being from San Diego, we have been looking for an izakaya spot that was like Tajima 2. This is closest, thus far.  

They have a great selection of Sake and Soju. They also have beer and wine. If you don't finish it, put your name on it and save it for when you return. Love that.

As I mentioned the chicken karage  is even better than Tajima's and closer to some of the ones in Guam or Japan.  The Yakatori selections are delicious. The grilled New York steak was good but I wish they added a Japanese seasoned butter to it. (Maybe one day)  

The ambiance is unassuming by looking at it from the outside and is very nice. The service was very good.  It is safe to say that we will be frequenting here even though we live in Henderson. So many more things to try like the ramen and more yakatori, hamchi kama and etc...

I went here last night for my birthday dinner and picked this restaurant because I was craving some Shrimp & Grits, and it was listed on the menu.  I ordered them and out came a cast iron skillet of shrimp and sausage in a tomato sauce, with some grits in a bowl on the side...not what I was expecting!  The tomato sauce was really bland and gave no flavor whatsoever to the shrimp.  The grits were nice and creamy, but nothing special enough to save the dish.  I fished out the sausage, which had a nice heat to it, and just ate that.  The cheddar bacon biscuits on the side were quite good, and I was glad I had them.  I also had the Tomato Ricotta salad to start...I don't think the lettuce was washed very well because about half of the bites tasted like dirt, but I enjoyed the fresh ricotta.

My family enjoyed their food more than me, but I was blown away by the staff's service and concern that I had not gotten enough to eat.  They wanted to bring me another dish and when I declined they even offered to package me up a meal to go, A+ for service!  I declined and opted to order dessert...it was my birthday after all...and when the bill came they had removed both my entrée and the dessert!

And then there's this:

*CELIAC ALERT*

Most disconcerting is the fact that the staff believe that their entire menu is gluten free. Shockingly (because they work in the food industry), they think that 'gluten' only refers to Asian mock meat gluten, and have no clue that gluten is in wheat. They actually have wheat noodles on the menu, and many of their dishes contain soy sauce made from fermented soy and wheat. Also, as I'm familiar with the products they use (like the soy drumsticks), I'm fairly certain that all of their soy based mock meat has gluten in it, too. 

The staff at Jean's seem very sweet, but I'm sure they have inadvertently made a lot of very trusting people very sick.

After my last experience at Audi of Charlotte on Independence Blvd., I was determined to begin a working relationship with the new Hendrick Audi of Northlake, so I called them.
  
I will say that my initial telephone conversation didn't leave me feeling like today's experience was going to be any different than what I've come to expect from Audi of Charlotte, but once I arrived and met Gary Burke (the Service Manager) my visit began to take a serious upswing.  

They walk you all around their very nice dealership and show you where the refreshments and restrooms are.  They show you the three separate waiting areas (on three different floors) which are all comfortable, spacious and clean with free wi-fi so getting your work done while waiting at their dealership seems plausible.  I personally liked that there's a separate children's area with a door as I'm not a fan of kids and I don't want to be forced to sit with them while I wait for my services to be completed. 
 
Gary went on to tell me that he'd been in the auto service industry for over 20 years and that they hired 7 ""Master"" mechanics when they filled their mechanic positions; that there aren't any ""newbie"" mechanics even working there, which I appreciate.  My thoughts are to let the ""newbie mechanics"" go learn over at Ford or Chevy  :-)

When they came to tell me the vehicle was finished, they said ""it's being washed right now..."" which delighted me!  I think that all high end dealerships should have an onsite car wash and wash your vehicle every single time it leaves their lot.  It's always such a perk to me to have the mechanics' fingerprints washed off of the vehicle before they hand it back to me :-)  This certainly isn't the experience you have at Audi of Charlotte and for that I am SO Grateful  :-)  I was actually able to leave today feeling confident and like we'd started what I think could be a long term, happy working relationship!

In conclusion:  I really feel like I've made a smart decision in moving my bosses Audi services to Audi of Northlake.  Sure it's further out of my way, but it's so very worth the drive to exit 19A  :-)",2014-04-30 20:31:48

A few days later I came to try it on and he was absolutely right.  He saved me some money and made sure the shirt fit great.  

I've had some people butcher shirts for me in the past and I've always been hesitant to buy a shirt that fit slightly large in some areas and have it altered.  Now that I know Magic Tailor is around I definitely have a bit more confidence in picking something I really like but is slightly off in size.

I like the cakes here especially mango, sans rival, chocolate mousse, choco mocha crunch and crema de fruta. Their desserts aren't extremely sweet which is unusual for Filipino desserts. A lot of Filipinos are diabetics. They use real fruits and the cakes are soft. They have the best mango cake ever. 

Their mamon is super soft and buttery good. If you like mangoes but don't want cake, the mango bars are great. Chewy and sweet bars with mangoes. They also have banana slice, brazo de Mercedes, mocha roll, ensaymada, empanada, siopao (steamed pork buns) which are pretty good.  I'm not a fan of ube...but I heard from reliable sources that their ube cake is delicious. Their palabok (noodles with sauce, pork, fried garlic, sliced hardboiled eggs and green onions) is yummy.  And what Filipino doesn't like pan de sal (warm and soft bread rolls)?

We walked in and went to the hostess stand and were not greeted for 10 minutes. My wife said to leave but part of me wanted to stay to see if service could be this bad. (I guess I like train wrecks) Someone walked by and I assumed she was the hostess, I told her we needed a table for 4 but alas, she was a customer. Finally a woman came out and greeted us and sat us. It turned out that she was a one woman show. And I don't mean that in a positive way.

The waitress seemed like she was hung over really bad. She was pleasant but just didn't have her act together. I think she should have stayed home and not come to work. 

We ordered the food and it came out timely,  When the runner dropped off the food, I asked him for some bread and he said ""how was the bread?"" I told him we never got any, that's why I asked for it. She forgot the bring it, oops

Through all of the trials of dealing with the less than stellar server, the food was delicious. Except for the alfredo  sauce, it was pretty tasteless. They did have gluten free pasta so my wife was happy, but the tasteless sauce made her unhappy

The arancini were delicious and perfectly cooked. The marinara sauce was great too. 
I had the ravioli with Bolognese sauce and it was one of the best I had. That's the only reason I gave it two stars

This space has been 4 or 5 different restaurants over the past 10 years. Its a nice looking restaurant but the location isn't that great.

I am a sucker for hot air balloon glows. So, when I have heard about Glendale Glitters for years, I decided this last night wrap-up celebration was about time I made it happen. My friend is always looking for free or inexpensive things for kids to enjoy, so I invited them to join me. 

I found free street parking easy enough to find with only a little driving around.

First of all, I was shocked how big the event actually was in size. The streets around Glendale town square were filled with people. It was not TOO many people, but definitely more than I expected. There were a half dozen bands playing music scattered around. There were paid rides and the typical festival food vendors. 

A radio station was there with a booth with free spin art for the children, and APS was there with free filtered glasses to create a psychedelic effect to the huge amount of christmas lights lining the downtown streets. I would have liked for a few more booths with free activities for children, like face painting.

The hot air balloon flames scared the one of the girls that came with me. However, I always fine the glowing balloons beautiful in the night.

Especially here, the poutine here is delicious. Iv heard its the closest to the authentic Montreal poutine, in which I haven't tried a real poutine from Montreal as of yet so I can't judge. 

The portions are huge, very huge. They basically give it to you in a small box that you can't eat by yourself. I ended getting the Montreal poutine which consists of Pulled pork, Pickles and Mustard. Which sounds odd to combine but I love all the three toppings so why not add it all together right?

 Wrong, so wrong. The pickle adds an odd taste when you combine with the pulled pork. Leaving the poutine with a sour taste, I couldn't believe how can I mess up my own poutine!!!

Thomas Keller needs no introduction...he is without a doubt the reigning sovereign of American ""haute-cuisine.""  With attention to detail that is unmatched and an approach to cooking (both as an art and as a business) that is beautiful and elegant, expectations are and will always be high entering one of his establishments.  Having consumed ~$100 between two at Bouchon Bakery in NYC back in June, my expectations entering Bouchon Bistro on the 10th floor of the Venetian were high....at least 10 stories high.

Due to their rustic simplicity and historic preparation by poor persons utilizing limited ingredients, I personally believe gnocchi/dumplings (along with Bread Pudding) to be the ultimate foods by which to judge a chef and knowing that my time in Vegas would be limited, I e-mailed ahead approximately 2 weeks early and asked if it would be possible for the chef to prepare the Gnocchi a la Parisienne during the weekday breakfast hours.  While an odd request for sure, my e-mail was almost immediately answered by General Manager Andy St. John who stated the chef would be delighted to prepare the meal during the day at no additional costs, no questions asked.  Gnocchi for breakfast?  Well, kinda...

Arriving at Bouchon around 7:30 I checked in with the host who introduced me to dining manager Robert who took me to my seat, indoors looking out at the pool given the bright sun and my fare skin.  Water was delivered and I was given a few moments to browse the restaurant before my server returned.  The simple bistro layout, the open doors to the pool and garden, the fresh smell of the baking breads....lovely.  When Robert returned specials were discussed, despite already knowing my strange request, and I settled on a starter of the Chocolate Almond Croissant and a cup (make that about 6 cups) of coffee.  See, the croissant was Breakfast...the Gnocchi just followed closely.

The croissant, like all of Keller's pastries, was magical...the best croissant I've ever had in terms of flavor.  Crispy and warm on the outside with chocolate drizzle and copious almonds, plus a flaky interior and a thick layer of chocolate gnache folded into the flaky dough and then loaded with chopped almonds.  If I lived close to a Bouchon this would be a very frequent indulgence to say the least.  The coffee...thick, robust, french pressed...the best priced cup of coffee in Vegas for sure.

A couple more coffee refills and it was time for the main course (consumed with water, not coffee.)  Without further ado, I will just say that this dish redefined gnocchi in all ways.  Unlike Italian gnocchi, the French style utilized butter in the noodles along with the potatoes and the effect literally creates a dumpling that melts on the tongue.  Every single piece appeared hand crafted, perfectly tender on the outside, yet toothsome and textural on the outside.  The dish was complimented with carrots, spinach, mushrooms fricassee and beurre noisette as dressing and the entire effect was simply perfection on a plate.  I honestly cannot think of the last time it took me so long to savor each bite of a dish, but by all accounts I believe I ate each piece individually, slowly.  Such simple ingredients, such flawless execution.  

Certainly I love foie gras, blue lobster, diver scallops, and desserts considered to be delicacies, but I also appreciate when simplicity yields perfection.  While I've not been to French Laundry or Per Se, both will have their time in the sun in the near future...but for now I will simply state that if it is the little things that count, Bouchon is doing ALL the little things right from superior service to setting to food.  After breakfast I made my second of four visits during the trip to Bouchon Bakery for a carry-along snack...two days later I returned to Bouchon for Brunch, my only repeat of the trip....yes, it was that impressive.",2008-09-30 00:31:47

Avenue B has been a favorite of mine, but I just can't get to it as often as I'd like.  While my most recent experience was sub-par, I will be back.

Their restaurant week menu was fantastic!  My choice for appetizer was the amazing cauliflower soup.  SO good, so stinking good.  Honestly, I could have just eaten that.  Entree - I got the hanger steak.  It was good - not as good as the cauliflower soup though.  Honestly, I think it could have used a little more seasoning.  However, I am not complaining!  It was still great!

There were 2 frustrating parts to our meal, both out of our control.

1.  One of the folks that was seated beside us had apparently previously worked at Avenue B, or was friends with our waitress.  She loudly told them that they would accommodate whatever they wanted to the restaurant week menu/price if they'd like.   While I did not see the bill, so I don't know if that was truly the case - you don't say that kind of stuff loudly for other patrons to hear!  It was frustrating how much time staff (other waiters, our waitress, and other staff) lingered at their table.  

2.  Dessert.  There was only 1 option for dessert - which is FINE!  That's not my frustration.  When our entree plates were taken - everything was - bread, silverware, etc.  Again - fine.  Our spoons were brought for the ice cream.  20 minutes later - let me just say that again - 20 minutes later, we still hadn't received our dessert.  However, the buddies of the staff had their plates taken away and dessert (trio dessert) brought out within 5 minutes.  SO we waited.  When the dessert finally arrived (about 30 minutes later) the ice cream was a puddle on our bowl and melted and warm.  Ice Cream. Melted because it'd probably been sitting out.  

While I am sure I will be back to Avenue B, I wont be rushing back.  I won't be getting dessert and probably won't go back for restaurant week.  They still got 4 stars as I have had other good experiences.",2016-01-15 12:51:11

2) Staff: Wonderful. Efficient, friendly, ever-present but not bothersome. 

3) Food: I'll say this - delicious enough that I am already thinking about the kind of burger I am going to get next time.

I use quotes because Senor Taco has no business referring to its menu as fast food.  The dining room is set up similar to a fast food joint, but the cushioned booths are way more comfortable than the hard plastic in most ""Fill-In-The-Blank-Bertos"". And the prices are very reasonable and appropriate for a fast food chain.

But the primary reason I would argue for a change in marketing, is the quality and portions of the food. Seriously, my first impression (years ago) was, ""They aren't charging enough for this!"" A combo with two tacos, rice and beans was way more than I could handle. The rice is solid, but the beans are to die for. You just know when you taste homemade refried beans. They are better than some sit down places I've been.

And the tacos were huge! I loved my Carne Asada taco with the fresh guacamole and pico de gallo! I had to force myself to eat the delicious shrimp taco with its crema sauce. Kudos to the hardcore salsa bar too. Do you like hot peppers?! I'm talking ""jalapeños are for wimps, have a Serrano"" pepper! But you can cool it off with some pickled onions too.

We waited another 40 minutes until we got salad and soup (soup was luke warm).  The group next to us were seated around the time when we got our soups/salads. They got their drinks immediately and their soups/salads before we were done with our soups/salads.  By the time we had our hibachi chef come to the table and cooked our rice and vegetables, the group next to us had their hibachi chef show up. 
My vegetables were burnt slightly and so were the scallops. The other part of our meal was good. We ordered Boba smoothies as a dessert and they were out of Boba.  Disappointed with our waitress and the manager.",2016-02-16 05:59:51

We started out in the gift shop where we perused the pricey merchandise and then bought tickets. Eight minutes later, the tour started. We were led across the street to the house. I enjoyed the tour of the house and seeing the leg lamp, the Red Ryder BB gun, the famous kitchen, and the bar of Lifebouy soap. I noticed the kitchen in the house is different from the kitchen in the movie, so I wondered if a different set was used for the kitchen scenes. I know they had rearranged the kitchen, but the doorways and furnace control did not exist in this kitchen, as they did in the movie.

It was still fun nonetheless. The museum was cool too, with its movie set artifacts. There were some really nice items in there, including the original Red Ryder BB gun, which is probably worth a ton of money.

I was especially interested in how the director tricked some of the actors by giving them different versions of the movie script. After learning about the tongue on pole scene and the Chinese restaurant scene, I watched these scenes again when I returned home. They were extra funny when watched from a different perspective.

My in-laws really liked A Christmas Story House and the movie and now they can take a piece of Cleveland history home with them to Puerto Rico.",2017-01-07 23:00:15

Once seated, we ordered an appetizer....mac-n-cheese bites.  Let me tell you.....these beat out cheese sticks and fried pickles as my go to.  The white cheese bites where super gooey.  The macaroni is just a binding agent to give the cheese shape..  I could barely tell there was any macaroni in it.  Thats a good and a bad thing.  I liked how gooey they were, tasted delicious but I like it better when I know the noodle is a little bit more al dente.

We got the complimentary bread/butter going on.  Just a thought but I wish they offered a balsamic vinegar/oil/spice mixture like other resturants do.  Not everyone eats butter and the bread alone is dry.

When looking at the menu....they have options!  I think its a trend now to offer ""premium sides"" for an upcharge.  If I am paying $27 for a meal....the premium upcharge should never be more than $2.00.  After all, I'm already paring for a side as part of my $27.00.  Not like I get to keep that side that I am already being charged for at the $27.00.  Outback keeps the side I am paying for in my combo AND charges $5 for the new side (premium charge is right!!!)

Sadly, this year, that has all changed.  We purchased two season pool passes which included a special birthday month celebration (a cabana with a bottle of vodka and a bottle of champagne).  We had problem after problem - reservation requests never returned (and plans having to be cancelled) and employees who didn't know anything about the season passes or what they included.  It got to to be so bad that our money was refunded but they honored the passes for the remainder of the year.  For my wife's milestone birthday this year, we decided to celebrate it at a cabana at the Flamingo.  We reserved the cabana back in July for September 9th.  When we got there the reservation was not in the system.  Ok - mistakes get made, we understand that.  But the ""manager"" on duty, Morgan, was rude and unsympathetic.  They stuck us in a cabana behind another cabana with no view of the pool.  The wait staff couldn't easily be found.  We stayed a very short time (and didn't even use the bottles that came with the cabana).  We left the Flamingo pool and went to the Luxor were we taken care of extremely well.  There is a list of other issues at the Flamingo pool but suffice it to say that customers are not treated well.  When we returned from the Luxor pool (around 5 pm), our room had not been attended to - no new towels, beds unmade, etc.  The Flamingo has lost our business forever.  Not only will we no longer promote them as a great place to stay, we will dissuade all family and friends from ever staying there.

The place isn't really known as a sports bar but they had multiple TVs and a projection screen.  For a place like this at 8:30 pm we got great seats in front of the projection screen. 

The servers were dressed much like the Titled Kilt.  Low cut dresses and high mini shirts.  Eye Candy.  

Anyway, the crowd here is under 30. So five guys over 40, it was not a place for our demo. 

But the game was on and they had the TV audio on so we stayed.  

But the service was crappy.  We sat down and no one came to take our order for 10 mins.  While we did not have anything off the menu the selection of beer was decent.  For all you Molsons and Sleemans fans they don't serve either on tap or in the bottle.  

Given that the bar had seating for 10 customers - they did at least have three attentive servers.  I am not sure how the rest of the place was mapped out but we rarely saw our server during the game (about 2 hours).  And even when she took a refill order she'd come back 20 minutes later and apologise that she had forgotten our order. 

One her second reorder, she came back with 1 of two beers and said she had had an issue with the ordering system. Plus she had to cash out a group of people behind us.  I have no idea what that meant but for the four hours we were there we saw her three times before settling the bill.  My friend joked that the people at the bar had no issues.  

Any way at the bottom of the 9th inning the big projection screen kaks out but they got it back for the last three minutes of the game.  

Immediately after the game the music pumps up and drowns out any conversation.  The place becomes a dance bar later and I think the music was a hint for us to leave. 

So we had to wait another 15 minutes just to find our server and ask for the bill. 

The parking lot is a bit tight.  And as we leave there are these kids showing off with their friends.  A few were clearly drunk and they scooted around trying to find a place.  

However, given the fire codes in Brampton the place had maxed out so thankfully many of the inebriated patrons were turned away.  The odd thing is the place has a patio but is was not open.  They used it as a smoking area instead.  Too bad.",2015-08-15 14:55:55

The tacos are pretty good, as well as their various salsas. Explore the salsa sampler and you won't be disappointed. As expected, the chips and tortillas are both excellent.

For atmosphere, Casa Reyna is also a nice place. You can tell that they took their time getting the restaurant ready. The murals, the decor, the vibe...awesome. The only downside? Don't be surprised when you get zero cell service in the restaurant. The plus side? You'll finally be able to focus on your actual restaurant experience since you won't have the outside distraction. Unfortunately, the lack of distractions also means that you'll KNOW when something is off...and that's why this rating is so low.

Service may have only been bad on our last experience, but it was infuriating enough to make me not want to return, despite the other decent experiences. When we order a skinny margarita on our first four visits, it's safe to say we MIGHT know how they taste. We MIGHT have been told how they make them by the previous waitstaff upon asking. As customers, we MIGHT be ""right,"" regardless of whether the bartenders agree or not. The simplest approach is to work with us to make our drinks enjoyable. Make your customer happy...you know...so we stick around and want to return again and again. Not argue with us. Not try to act like we may be stuck paying for a drinks that we barely took sips from. We stopped in to watch the World Cup, get a few drinks during the game, and enjoy some tacos. Instead, the arrogance of the bartenders made us walk out the door, disappointed, and with our money remaining in our pockets.

First, the drinks. The drinks are all fantastic. I have some standbys that I love to get (Hemingway Daiquiri, dirty martini, New Brown Derby) and they are always delicious, but I decided to branch out recently and wasn't disappointed either! The Island Cocktail is fantastic and the Fairmount Caipirinha was rummy, fruity and perfect! 

Next, the food. I've had quesadillas, burgers, and pizzas here. All are tasty and very difficult to choose from. The apple pizza is definitely a unique taste as well as the caramelized onion one, and while the BBQ chicken was fantastic, the pesto scallop combo takes the cake hands down. 

The service is always pretty good when we can get a bar seat. But, sometimes, the whole place packs tight (on a Wednesday night?) and you'll have to wait a significant amount of time for drinks and just to be able to place an order. This is difficult and I can see how a first timer might get impatient, but trust me, it's worth it. If you do sit at the bar, it seems it's a little easier to escape the poor acoustics, but otherwise, it gets really loud in there really fast, so be prepared to just observe for a bit. The staff itself is great and everyone really knows what they're doing as far as I can tell. I've never had any issues and it's great to chat with them on slow nights--drink experimenting is always fun!

Worht mentioning is the patio outside. Once they open it up, they serve from another bar out there as well. They also have heaters outside for chillier nights, which makes it easier to escape the volume inside.

I urged him to consider Agritopia.  I extolled the virtues of the charming neighborhoods, tree lined streets, real front porches, alley accessed garages, the centrally located elementary school for our son, the availability of fresh produce raised within the subdivision, and I went on and on but he wasn't having it.  I think he secretly suspected that I was trying to indoctrinate him into some new fangled 21st century commune or something.  

Now I realize exactly what I did wrong.  I didn't force him to come get a meal at Joe's Farm Grill, which just happens to be within a stone's throw to Agritopia and also uses Agritopia's produce garden.  (Or maybe it's Joe's Farm Grill garden and Agritopia uses it?  I dunno, but I do know the two are somehow linked.)    If I had only dragged him into Joe's Farm Grill I could have sealed the deal, I'm sure of it.

Joe's is a really neat little place, surrounded by towering Tamarack trees that have been there forever.  The structure was originally the late 1950's to early 1960's ranch style family home (and former farm) of the same family that now owns Joe's.  Also the family has two other top-notch restaurants, Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Grill.  The house has since been professionally and radically retrofitted into be a sleek, yet still somehow retro, restaurant, with bathrooms that are so fun and funky that you just have to go there and see for yourself what I mean.  (Trust me.)  The restaurant still retains the old front room of the original house, including the fire place, and it is now a dining room.  It's not hard at all to imagine Joe's family settled around their Christmas tree in their pajamas in the mid-1960's opening presents, completely oblivious to the fact that someday their front room would be a seating area for one of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley.  Yep, I said it: One of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley; that is NO exaggeration.

The food here is amazing.  It's wildly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and deliciously paired with different sides and it's all reasonably priced to boot.  They know what they do here, and they do it perfectly.  My personal favorite here is the seared Ahi Tuna sandwich with a Wasabi dressing.  I can't even describe how good it is.  It's just a flat out flavor bomb.  (Tip: I will reiterate that the tuna is seared, so if you get it and are expecting a fully cooked tuna steak you will be confused and perhaps even disappointed; don't be, just eat it and savor the deliciousness of a perfectly seared tuna steak on a toasted bun with a wonderful Wasabi dressing and a zesty Asian slaw.)  It is my favorite sandwich from anywhere, ever.  I have also tasted their pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, shakes (come topped with a green cherry!) and French fries and all have been outstanding.  I really cannot find a single criticism for this place.

Oh wait, I just thought of one criticism; that there isn't a Joe's Farm Grill closer to my home, since my ex refused to let us buy a house there.   *pout*",2013-01-16 17:35:47

We waited in the order line for close to 20 minutes (max in two years was 10 minutes should also be noted there was no one in front of us to order only in the to pay line). While we waited for someone to come and take our order, we witnessed a customer bring back her incorrect order three times, two customers request a refund because they had been waiting close to a half hour for their food. We witnessed overflowing trash cans in the food prep area, garbage all over the floor, a manager who was snapping at her employees,and not fully listening to her customers who had complaints that needed to be addressed. We watched Employees make each order without wiping down the food area from the previous order, so cross flavoring/ possible contamination was happening.  Employees were on edge, customers were becoming more and more irritated and the line wasn't moving any more quickly. 

If this was my first visit to this location, I would definitely not return. This can all be easily rectified,by retraining employees in prep,and unfortunately putting a manager in charge who exhibits better customer service and organizational skills.

I ordered the grilled Caesar and sauerkraut balls and both exceeded my expectations. My friend got the mild wings. We were both very happy with our choices. The food is still very good and server and service was great. Still continues to be a favorite when I am in the area.",2015-12-13 15:35:31
XWZjxl8pjq61Z0rIEtw-bw,7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,5,14,4,8,"Downtown Las Vegas has another addition with the opening of La Comida, located off of Fremont and Sixth Street.  Mel C. and I were lucky enough to attend the invite-only/soft opening with our amigo Cisco, so I will preface this review by stating that it was definitely not the typical dining experience.  It was a first for me to meet Jenna and Michael Morton, the owners of La Comida, and part of the Morton dynasty - not typical.  I think every employee of La Comida was working last night and the place was bustling with all the excitement and, most likely, nerves that accompany opening a new and much-anticipated hot spot.  There were many Las Vegas celebs and higher-ups there, but I only recognized a few.  What stood out for me was the food and the ambiance.

I had:
La Catrina margarita:  ""Cabrito tequila infused with strawberries, Combier, guava and limes""--so tasty and sweet, but not overly sweet, just the way I like my alcohol when I do drink.  I don't want to taste the alcohol.
Chips and salsa:  The salsa had a little kick, but not too spicy.
Guacamole:  Fresh!
Camaron del Golfo:  ""Gulf shrimp, butternut squash, chorizo, cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, crema de Guajillo""- 3 big grilled shrimp with the other ingredients as a side medley--it was delicious.
Platanos Fritos:  3 fried plantains with vanilla ice cream--a sweet ending to a big meal.

It's exciting to have La Comida in DTLV, making Fremont East an even cooler place to hang out.  Word is that official opening is Thursday, April 25th, so check it out for yourselves--I will definitely be back, too.  

PS - I give the neon monkey sign 5 stars alone--I want one.",2013-04-23 17:38:40

The place is nicely decorated and has separate areas for hibachi, bar, sushi bar and regular seating in the front. Ohjah would be great for groups as well as intimate settings. Now onto the food.

My husband and I can eat a lot of sushi and typically leave places with over $100 meal. We ordered one Ohjah boat with the Snow White roll (garlic ponzu on super white tuna), Sweet Heart roll (spicy tuna with yellow tail on top) and the Golden Gate roll (shrimp tempura). We loved the Sweet Heart and Snow White rolls the best, not that the Golden Gate was bad it just wasn't as great as the other two rolls. It was more of a meh. 

The boat presentation was beautiful. We also tried the strawberry smoothie, some sake and the seaweed salad that came with the Ohjah. With the giant Ohjah Boat which also included 12 pieces of sashimi and 10 pieces of nigiri we were happily stuffed and our entire bill was $75. That is amazing considering how much sushi we can eat. Although Las Vegas is known for all you can eat sushi this was much better quality and the rice was a minimum versus other places that pack on the rice.

Service was quick, efficient and friendly. Get a booth because they're both comfy, private and the wood tables are gorgeous.",2014-03-23 16:57:47

Also Vietnamese desserts and drinks. 

I tried the Hu Tieu My Tho and it was excellent. You can order this wet as a soup or dry as more like a stew, with the more chewy clear sukiyaki type noodles. I ordered it dry, which comes with a side bowl of soup broth to pour over the ingredients after mixing. 

The Hu Tiel My Tho was chock full of ingredients: several large shrimp, a couple of fish cake balls, Chinese style sliced pork, Vietnamese style sliced pork, a couple of boiled Quail eggs, lots of green onions, chives, green leaf lettuce, yellow onions, and ground pork in a pork paste sauce. Delicious and only $6.59.

This place has 3 strobe lights blinking outside to help you find it. Inside, they have the obligatory plasma screens (4 in total!) showing Vietnamese variety show DVDs. They are open from 8:00am to
11:00pm 7 days a week! They say Cash Only, but they accepted my credit card when I asked them.

Just do it. I've had a few pretty amazing cheese and charcuterie boards over the years, but this one is badass. I even tried cheese varieties I normally don't even like and they were effing delicious.

And the truffle fries--I haven't had a french fry in over 2 months, so these were delicious. I think they were because they tasted like heaven, BUT I'm not sure if it's because I've been deprived for so long, either. I thoroughly enjoyed them. 

We also had great service. There was only one little issue with the bread they served us (it was rock hard) and as soon as she knew it wasn't up to snuff, she brought us out some soft and fluffy ones. Beyond that, she was super attentive despite a relatively busy Thursday night.

Nice big parking lot ,lots of room. The place was semi busy for a Thursday night.
 We asked for a booth, which we got in the bar area.
We had enough time to fully read the menu before our server came to the table.
Buckets of Peanuts adorn all the tables and you eat the peanuts and throw the shells on the floor. Which my girlfriend felt bad doing , but that is what everyone does here they tell us.
 So we ordered our drinks, along with water. All came quickly, then ordered our food. A runner brought out the food.  I had gotten the Sirloin ,my girl got the Filet mingon.
Both were cooked perfectly,that is an A t. However the runner said, we are out of Baked Potaoes. What would you like instead?  
How do you run out of Baked Potatoes at 6:45pm when you are a Steak house????
Anyway after that we ordered the Sweet Potaoes, They came out shortly after, and it was all good.
I think it is very high priced for a low end place. Plastic glasses and a very rough look in the place. They may be going for Rustic looking, but all I see is a cheaply made room.
It is an odd vibe here, can't quite put my finger on it.
But, service was slow ,our server seemed as if she had too many tables and was stressed out.  So I do not blame her. 
We won't return, too many good choices out there for the $$.

In the spirit of Kristin C, here are my like and dislikes

Likes
Great wine selections, and most are very cheap
Fresh and diverse deli carrying everything from carne burritos to chicken tikka masala
Excellent meat and produce, although a little on the pricey side (unless you get the clearance items) and there is a lack of consistency in the items they carry
Fantastic discount items - If you're looking to make a meal that night you can buy items that are about to expire (for example a whole seasoned chicken for $3 - wow)
Yummy desserts, their tiramisu is to die for~!
Awesome oils and seasonings

Dislikes
Very small selection, last time I was there I looked for stuffing, triscuits, cantelope and any veggie or morning star veggie products, various cleanings supplies.. they carried none of this. Imagine driving there, only to have to get back in your hot ass car and take a treck to Safeway (annoying)!
A lot of the F&E brand are not high quality (do not even compare to TJ's) macaroni and cheese was gross, bread expired in a day and tasted stale begin with Peanut butter pretzels should lay down and let TJ's peanut butter pretzels walk over them.

Overall it is a good store when you want things as the sign says ""Fresh and Easy"".. Don't try to do major grocery shopping there or stock up your fridge for Thanksgiving, or buy all your hygene products.. But if you just need to run in and grab dinner or a snack it'll do. If it wasn't within 3 miles of my house it would probably only get 2 stars..",2008-07-09 20:49:02

In the overlypriced mecca of Manhattan, TJ's was a diamond in the rough.  Amazing food at amazing prices.  When I left NYC, I had to leave TJ's behind me.

Luckily when I moved to Cleveland over a year later, TJ's and I were able to reconnect.  But what is it about TJ's the makes it so special?  It depends on who you ask.  I think everyone has their own reasons, but I'll give you a few of mine.

-Quality you can trust.  The food is always good and they have a wide variety that will match pretty much anyone's taste. 

-Friendly staff.  Realized you forgot something while you're waiting in line?  One of the employees will go grab it for you.  Want to try a new recipe but not sure what ingredients work best?  Ask one of the employees for help.  Not only do they help because they get paid to, but they genuinely all enjoy doing it.  I have yet to meet a cranky TJ's employee.

-Healthy options are the rule, not the exception.- Hate eating processed foods?  Are you a vegetarian or vegan?  Prefer organics?  TJ's has everything you need to fit your lifestyle.  

-Great prices.- Many grocery stores sell food at exorbitant prices.  Not TJ's.  You get some of the best quality food there is without paying an arm and a leg for it like you do at places like Whole Foods.

Beautiful tables and booths all dressed with candle center pieces, and of course, shakers filled with chili flakes and parmesan cheese. 

My son and I came here for lunch and we were excited. With a name like ""Streets of New York Pizza"" who wouldn't be excited to eat a slice? My son ordered the kids, in house made, ""Mac and Cheese""(refer to pic) which he enjoyed. It came with seasoned fried and a big bowl of mac and cheese.

I ordered a #3 which is ""2 Slices with 1 Topping""(refer to pic) from the lunch menu. The pizza came out, which i then asked for my usual ranch to accompany my pizza. I ask for ranch just in case the pizza is not flavorful enough. Surprisingly, this pizza did in fact, have LITTLE flavor. Which in my head, was absurd! I'm thinking, ""with a name like Streets of New York Pizza there's NO WAY i'm going to need this ranch!"". I was wrong. The crust was perfect. Nice and crispy, just the way i like it. But the pizza, just wasn't singing, like it should have been. A very big let down.

The tastiest food there was definitely the complementary ""Garlic Bread and Warm Marinara""(refer to pic). Woo Wee!! This stuff was awesome! The bread was sooo fluffy and flavorful, and The marinara was DELICIOUS! I would come back just for that.

The one thing i wouldn't come back for would be the service.The service here was just, eh.. I told the waitress that we have never been here before, and she gave us nothing. I asked her what they were famous for, or what was their specialty and again, nothing. I even went as far as to inform her that this location was not on Yelp and i would be adding them today, still nothing.

The seat is a little small and not exactly the most comfortable seat around. But given you can get closer to the performer than any other theater, I will think it is acceptable.

I reluctantly got 3, but they only had 2 in stock so I paid overnight shipping for the 3rd. I didn't get the 3rd until 3 days later & called them everyday to find out if the phone came in. When I asked about a refund for the shipping difference, the asst. manager said they were unable to do refunds & I would get it on my mail-in rebate which he forgot to give us when we signed our contracts and I had to remind him about. When I called Sprint to inquire about that, they said the store should have refunded me & I would NOT see it on my rebate. Since we have had the phones, they black out during calls & you cannot hang up 3-4 times a Faythe only way to get your phone back on is to take the battery out. When I called Sprint about it, they said they are still making the EVO 4G & that there are no none problems with it. I am so disappointed that the asst. manager at this store told lie after lie! Now I have to take all 3 phones in to another store to have them ""troubleshoot"" what could be going on. To top it all off, they were unable to migrate our phonebooks on our old phones for 2 of them. They also would not import over our photos from the old phones and said if we wanted to do that, we would need to drop all the phones off with them & leave them there for a few hours. It's funny because Best Buy can do it in minutes. And lastly, I asked them if they would cancel our account on our old carrier & the asst. manager said no problem. After 4 days of our old phones being still on, I called the store back & the asst. manager told me I would need to call our old carrier & do it & that he got ""confused"". Who would make such a moron an asst. manager is beyond me. Although he was nice, he obviously had no idea what he was doing.

Carl's Jr has a really good burger and that's what I felt like.  (NOTE: the best burger in Phoenix is STILL Lucky Boy, 16th St and Osborn) First It was the ""$6"" burger, now I think the same is called the All American...I ordered it, full meal and I changed the drink to an Oreo Cookie Shake.  All told: $13 plus change.  Now, name me a burger joint that I can't go to for $13!

So, I ordered inside and while I'm standing in the restaurant, waiting, and my burger comes up, put in a bag, and the counterhelp said, ""we're just waiting on the fries"".  Ok.  Now, perhaps she doesn't know the fries and burger are supposed to come up together, that being the difficult part of restauranting, but ok.  Now, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes go by, a woman I hadn't seen before calmly walks behind the line, drops some frozen fries into the fryer and walks away.  Hastily, I say to the counterhelp, ""those AREN'T my fries, right?"" thinking that mine were done...or should have been!

""Oh yeah"" she said.  ""We're just waiting on the fries.""  

""NO!  That won't work.  I want my money back!"" I said.  I mean, whenever the fries would have been done, the burger was already not hot and would have been cold. 

Now, another worker I'd never seen before comes around and refunds my money.  

I called Carl's Jr Corporate the next day and gave them the details.  Now, 30 hours later, no word from local management which indicates to me that management is as ignorant or apathetic as the workers they failed to train or supervise.

What a waste of time!

The decor was very modern and art deco with its black lacquered floors, beautiful black armoir, funky light fixtures, cut log bedside tables and deep red and lime accents. The bed was huge with very comfortable bedding. The bathroom was very large and felt more like one in a cool friend's apartment than a standard hotel-issue one.

The highlight was, of course, the peek-a-boo shower. It was huge with 2 seperate rainfall showerheads and its own blue lighting for extra ambiance. 

All the elements for a very romantic getaway. 

For more practical purposes, the room had a large desk, flat screen tv, free calls to Canada/US, free wi-fi (password provided at reception), dual ipod dock, great hairdryer, water bottles from Liquid Nutrition and products from Bella Pella.

However, they also have some fun purses!

I bought a large clutch which had different coloured buttons stitched to both sides and it was only $20! 

Also, my best friend once bought a unique shirt, which was a tube top with these additional pieces of fabric attached that you wrap around yourself like a one-strap shirt or a halter.

I had the Ohio lamb burger which was cooked exactly the way I wanted and worked well with the unique assortment of toppings such as the sticky cheese fondue and champagne shallot. The bun on the burger was quite mushy  from either the side salad dressing or the greasiness of the burger, which was bit of an unappetizing aspect of an otherwise great meal.

It is small place which also has outside seating. The only complaint I had was the tables were about as big as the plates I usually eat off....I'm a big guy. I get it though...French. Petite furniture....lol. There was also a violinist and a guitar player playing some type of ethnic music. I did not inquire to what type of music they were playing.

The menu has a great selection of crepes and if you do not see anything you like, which I am sure will not happen, you can build your own crepe. There are crepes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and desert. The crepes are named after different regions of the world that best represents the ingredients inside the crepe. I like the fact that they offer whole wheat, buckwheat, vegan, and white crepes.

We ordered the following and they were all equally excellent!! They were served with sides of almond pâté' and chili sauce. The almond pâté' was awesome!

-Mediterranean with a vegan wrap minus the cheese. - Mushrooms, red peppers, tomatoes, spinach, and broccoli.

-Brenton - A crepe wrapped around fresh berries and topped with agave syrup.

-The Florida - A crepe filled with Key Lime and then toped with crushed graham crackers, Key Lime sauce, and fresh whipped cream. ****My Favorite****

5 crepes
2 coffees
1 orange juice
3 bottled water

We also really like the Mary Lou with red chile con carne - it's one big delicious pile of slop. Honestly, all of the food is based upon your wanting some deep fried piggishness but there are times that's just what you crave (at least I do).

Pretty good salsa at this place too but I agree that the weird carafe style bottles they're served in are inconvenient though if you know a habitual double dipper, this is the place to bring them.

I had made a reservation the day of online for 715pm but circumstances changed and we were available to dine at 630 instead.  It wasn't a problem for seating for 630 instead of having to come back 45 minutes later so that was nice.

We were seated upstairs where the big tables are but we had a comfortable booth for 4.  When I say the big tables the upstairs of this place has a large area with large 12-14 seat tables (2) so this area can hold quite the party upstairs.  We were off to the side in a quieter section in a padded seat booth.

We hadn't made up our mind with drinks or the menu so our server said she'd be back and give us some time.  I rather think she gave us a lot of time and eventually returned.  We ordered a few drinks and everything at once since we had a good amount of time to review our options.  Everything we ordered it seemed as if our server was trying to get us to have everything at once (salad, appetizers etc) although she did ask us if that was ok.  I don't know if the kitchen was busy or if everything is brought at once she gets help as opposed to having to wait on us more times?  I wasn't sure but for whatever reason she almost seemed motivated to convince us to take everything at once. 

I had sort of wanted my calamari first and as I did last second order it as she was going away she didn't ask if I had wanted that first or with everything else.  It seems she made the assumption that we'd want that later too.  

A different server brought our drinks to us and I had asked her if I could ask her about the calamari we ordered.  I asked her because our server was not coming back as she seemed busy.  I asked her if that comes out beforehand and her response sort of threw me... she said normally if things on the menu are appetizers they come first and if not then it was put into the system incorrectly as a screwup.  That not the answer I was looking for or at least one that I thought was very professional.  She basically threw her team mate under the bus!

I had asked our server when she finally came around again (she was tending to a lot of patrons) and asked her if it was put in as an app or with the entire meal.  She said it was put in with everything and I had asked her if it could be changed and she said she'd check.  She came back and told me that it was put in with everything basically it couldn't be brought out sooner than the rest of orders and if there was anything she could do for us otherwise.  I said well if it couldn't come out sooner we'd just hang out and such.  I was at least satisfied that she said it was put into the system as such and offered an alternative or other options possibly.  

In total our group of four ordered a calamari app, stuffed meatball app, the social Caesar salad (for sharing), a margherita pizza, a sophia pizza, chicken parm, chicken limone, apple raviloli dessert and drinks.

The calamari is decent but I've had better.  The stuffed meatball is so freaking tasty.  It's salty and rich because of the sauce and cheese but wow is it ever good.  My problem with it is that is seemed really smaller compared to how I originally remember it.  I remember it being a half pound and I don't know if it's still that size or not but it just visually looked significantly much smaller than I remember it.  The salad is amazing.  I could go to Scaddabush for just their Caesar salad but really it's just a salad but one of the best I've had in memory.  It's VERY garlicky and I could see it being too strong for some folk but not me.

My dish was the chicken limone which was grilled chicken breast in lemon sauce served with roasted potatoes and green beans.  It was good but just not kick ass.  I had some of my wife's pizza (sophia) which has chicken and goat cheese (white pizza) and it was just ok.  

The apple ravioli are sort of neat.  They are like apple pie pockets and are served with a tiny scoop of ice cream.  You receive 2 raviolis to an order and they're about 4 inches in diameter.

There are some things good about Scaddubush but overall it's just an OK experience.  I can't say that we received as much attention as I would have liked in that we were waiting for our server for a while, our drinks and overall I just felt neglected.  I get it that there was a big party upstairs yesterday and perhaps they soaked much of the attention of our servers I don't know but I don't want to feel like we're not as important or necessarily feel pressured to take all our food at once (apps not coming out first).  I mean it was a Tuesday evening and yes it was dinner time and yes I came earlier than I said I would but still...

My friend and I met for lunch here last week. The service was great and our food came out relatively quickly.

I had a chicken and a steak fajita taco. Delicious. I loved the use of feta (which Im not a fan of on its own) instead of shredded cheddar. It was much more melty. I wasnt so much a fan of their salsa, but then again I like Pace (gimme a break, Im not from here! ;) ).

I respect their BOGO sales because they don't mark up the prices just to mark them down and call it a cell. The digital coupons system you can utilize that coupon as many times per day but you can use it as many times as you like until the expiration date. That completely blew me away.

Churned's funky little shop in Tremont makes for a great late-night wander after your meal at Lolita on a summer night; they patiently let you try any and every one of their ice creams, which are always imaginative and can border on heavenly when they hit their mark (not all do, but creativity involves risk ). 

The Carrot Cake ice cream, my new favorite ice cream of all time, will win a duel with any ""real"" carrot cake.  You won't believe how much the two different color swirls - orange and white - capture and perfect the magic combination of moist, spiced cakiness and rich cream cheese frosting that makes carrot cake such an enticing dessert despite being named after a vegetable.  

The Pad Thai ice cream, on the other hand, may turn a few heads as an exotic entry into the artisan ice cream world, but won't win any awards - you get a little peanut, a little cayenne out of it, maybe a faint hint of tamarind, but not much else (thinking about what else is in pad thai - lime, bean sprouts, shrimp, cabbage etc- that may be a good thing).

Even with an occasional oddball flavor, Churned is a no-brainer and should be at the status of local legend by now.  More proof that Cleveland can hang with the best food cities, even if on a much smaller scale.   Side note: I noticed that they now carry Churned in the soon-to-be-closed West Point Market in Akron, and I dare say that I enjoy the pints even more than the shop ice cream, since I can bring them home and freeze them to my desired consistency    With any luck, the Whole Foods that is going into this location will continue to carry the product.",2015-06-04 14:10:31

Patio seats are plenty! And... more importantly it is NOT located in an architectural monstrosity we call a strip mall -- but in some strip that resembles a refurbished ""old"" barn town. Charming feel.

The calamari passed what I call the rubber band test, it was soft and extremely tender. The rib-eye steak was cooked to the correct temperature and was tastily combined with their own horseradish sauce (although without the dark charred crust you'd see in them fancy steakhouses which I feel is the best way to have steak).

In any case, in addition to creating your own, they do have a few featured specialty pizzas, and on my visit last night, I opted to simply make alterations to their Greek Chicken Sausage pizza- Spicy Diavola, mozzarella and Feta cheese, chicken fennel sausage, sweet onions, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives and rosemary olive oil.
I tried the spicy diavola (SPICY is not an understatement!) and asked to mix it with the crushed tomatoes to tone it down a bit, then switched out the olives for gorgonzola cheese, and added a few pepperoni on top.  I also added on a Caprese salad with fresh mozzarella as a healthy ""side"" though it's an entrée size.

When I saw how ""pricey"" the menu was outside the entrance, we were about to leave when a hostess came up to us and showed us the brunch menu. I saw a few things I wouldn't mind trying so we ended up eating here. 

I can't believe I almost passed this place up! My sister got the Caesar salad and I decided on the all-you-can-eat brunch menu - opting for the ""Continental, Hot Dishes and Specialties $16.99"" which includes whatever and however much you want from the brunch menu. I'll be honest, I let my sister sneak bites of my food!

Here's what I had, in order:
- Steak and Eggs - New York Strip and Two Eggs. I chose my steak rare and my eggs over easy. Absolutely divine. It took a bit for this to come out of the kitchen, but, oh man, this steak was good - and I don't even like steak! The juices were OH SO HEAVENLY. Yum!

-Republic Surf and Turf Benedict - Sliced Filet, Maine Lobster Meat and Hollandaise. This is served atop of a slice of English muffin, so it's not a huge portion (obviously, or else there would be no point in all-you-can-eat.) The sliced filet is just a sliver of beef and a sushi-sized piece of lobster. I didn't eat the English muffin, just the stuff atop it, because I didn't want to fill up on empty carbs. I was in the mood for PROTEIN!

- Mixed Berries and Cream - Orgasmic. Period. The freshest strawberries and blueberries I've had in a long time. 

- Wild Smoked Salmon - Toasted Bagel, Cream Cheese, Chives, Capers, Chopped Shallots. This came with four types of cream cheese, my favorites being the lemon, and the chive cream cheese. They included a TON of lox. I didn't eat the bagel. I was in heaven. I wish I had ordered this all day.

- Chicken and Waffles - Crispy Chicken and Fluffy Waffle. I asked them to hold the waffle, because I just wanted to try the chicken. It was 3 pieces of heavily breaded, scalding hot chicken fingers and was just ""ok.""

- Mixed Berries and Cream. Yep. I ordered this twice.

I wanted to try their Monte Cristo, because I've never tried it before but I wanted to be able to walk the two miles back home without feeling sick. This place was a smashing good deal with the amount of protein I chowed down on. If I came back, I would just order the NY Strip dish and the Lox dish over and over, holding the bagel (to save room of course!)

I liked that we got our own decanter of water, so we didn't have to wait for a waitress. It was either the hostess or a waitress who was snippy to another waitress refilling our actual glasses instead of just dropping off another decanter of water, which I thought was rude.

Pros:
 * Asada Nachos are still killer!
 * well-kept Sauce stand... It seems like their green sauce was a bit spicier than what I remembered at Roberto's... Score!
 * I don't know if the standards at Don Tortaco are higher than Roberto's, but this location seemed to be really clean.  
 * I liked the selection of drinks.. self serve soda with Horchata and Jamaica too!
 * Lengua and Cabeza on the menu... oh yeah!!!!

Cons:
 * I stated No sour cream (even on my receipt), but low and behold, when my order came out, Escrema was present!
* No Agua De Fresca 

Verdict:
  This place is good for late night eats.  We ordered the Asada Nachos with No sour cream, but they failed and piled sour cream on it anyhow.  Nonetheless, I gave this place a 4 star because it didn't fail to satisfy my late night cravings for cheap Mexican food.  I also had to get some Lengua tacos.  2 tacos and Asada Nachos was more than enough to share amongst 2 other people. 

Tips:
 * I know Lengua doesn't sound too appetizing, but seriously you can't knock it until you try it.  It's amazing!",2011-09-12 18:34:33

I'm not great in large crowds and each time they were the perfect hosts. They managed to get everyone processed and paid in an orderly fashion. All of the guests were thrilled with the money they made on their gold. Thrilled! Me too!

Some of the guests had stones that needed to be removed from settings. Often times it can't be done on site so Tim & Ben take the items, remove the stones and send them back to the clients. Never a single hitch. Everyone got their stones back in a timely manner, safe and sound. 

These guys work their butts off, they're on time - come prepared and are so down to earth. 
The first time they came out I was half expecting some smarmy ""WE BUY GOLD!"" guys. Not so..very cool and personable. 
A few of my clients have even gone directly to their offices for private appointments. Everyone I've sent has been more than satisfied.

Bonus- They did a party for Christina P. who attended my last party. Because she was a guest of my party, they sent me a check - - totally unexpected. I didn't even know they did that.

I mean whenever you tag the word burger with the word gourmet it seems that means over priced and poorly executed as was my experience with the burger bar which is both overpriced and poorly executed with inattentive wait staff, small portions and unwieldy dining area. But I digress, this is a review of Bottles and Burgers, one of the more delightful food choices in Las Vegas.  

To begin, the atmosphere is like that of an upscale 50's diner.  One bar for the adults and a milkshake bar for the kids.  Yes, you can bring your kids and seat them at the bar!.  You also won't miss the big game as they had several flat screens scattered around the bar area.  I had checked out the menu on line but the prices aren't available so I expected this to be another 20 dollar burger place.  Boy was I wrong.  The burgers are reasonably priced between $8.00 and $15.00 with the $15.00 burger stuffed with ribs.  You can also make your own burger starting at $7.00 with a $1.00 per topping charge.  The meat is all Angus.  We tried the Sweet Bacon Blue and the Bootlegger after an appetizer of arancini (fried Risotto balls with truffle oil)  We also got the Baltimore Fries (gravy and cheese).  The Risotto balls were perfect, even my 7 1/2 year old loved them.  The Sweet Bacon Blue is a must have, cooked perfectly.  The Bootlegger was a little blander than I could have hoped but still quite tasty.   We wanted to try the Double Helix (burger stuffed with ribs) but we can only eat so much in one visit.  They also have interesting salads (try pearfection) and sliders to try our next visit.

The service was excellent.  Our waiter Eric was the best, not just because he has a great name or that he looks like Wilmer Valderrama but because he was honest, attentive and informative.  He even brought us an extra scoop of icecream for my birthday desert because we couldn't decide between vanilla or white chocolate caramel.

Bottles and Burgers just misses the 5 star category for one reason.  The portions seem a little small. To me they were just right because I am dieting and also always seem to have leftovers at the larger burger places like Islands or Fuddruckers, but it was the one complaint I observed and I can't argue with it.  Still, with wine we got out of there with a party of three for about $50.00 which isn't bad for the great meal we had.  Definitely worth a return visit for that Double Helix.",2012-03-26 14:15:06

Being a sucker for good Mex, I had to make the trip to La Plaza.  The store isn't nice by any means but here comes the good part:  Robert.  Robert is the ""front man"" of the freshly prepared foods.  He gregariously introduced himself to me, plated up some yummy mole and pork chile and invited me to try the food.  Well, it was delicious.  I wanted one of everything.  He said they go to Chicago on Thursdays so the best days to visit La Plaza are Friday, Saturday, and Sundays.  They even sell El Milagro tortillas.  When I lived in Chicago I religiously bought these--they are the best.  When you stop in, meet Robert.  Super great guy and he'll give you a behind-the-ropes experience at La Plaza.  One word:  TACOS!  The taco cart outside is a MUST DO.  Double-layered, warm corn tortillas, fresh cilantro, fresh onion, and any meat from chicken, barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and some veggie mix.  Downright delicious.  Any only $2 per taco.

Since earlier I was thinking of stopping into Barnes & Nobles to check out some new books, I thought, why not give this place a shot.  Walking in, I felt like I was in a psychic shop filled with books.  Everything seemed so fragile and carefully organized.  Sections were labeled at the top of the shelf by categories. There was a section of extremely old books which I felt compelled to look at but didn't pick any up.  I saw a section of vintage National Geographic magazines, which I have become a collector of, but I didn't catch the prices they were selling them for --but I'll have to definitely come back to check them out.

Overall, this place is a great place to find old books of wisdom, literature or anything of that matter.  They also have an area where they teach Spanish lessons (located in the back) and areas to sit if you want to skim through some books.

b. Ahhhhh, yes.
c. OMG,  OMG
d. What Diet?
e. Yes!  I will have one of each!
f.  Freakilicious.
g. Died and gone to heaven


Now that we got this out of the way, here are reasons you need to visit this place:

a. A small local business.
b. Operated mainly by two sisters using they mother's recipes.
c. Most of the delicacies are named after family members. How cool is that.
d. Awesome tastes. 
e. Types of choices are amazing. I cannot even describe all the chocolates, the toffees, the pretzels, the candy coated whachamacallits and what nots.

Nice, quaint, cool, tasty and heck, it is way past Jan 1 so stop dieting and check this place out. If you gave up on candy or chocolates for lent, well, my suggestion is to put this on your list to come back to. Because you are not gonna just dip in here a take a wee bit of taste. You will honker down and power through the stuff they have.  I went in with my daughter just to check out the place and buy a couple of things and I ended up with a whole box of everything I wanted to try!

GK says - SWEET.  Check this place out and don't bring your guilt laden blah blahs with you.  This is a place to enjoy the finer aspects of sugar, sugar and sugar!  And.... chocolate too.",2014-03-11 04:02:49

Punctual drink top ups, appropriate plate clearing, no rush billing, and best of all the server alerted me to just in time the fact that my car was about to get ticketed by the CPS.

We went for happy hour, when several pizzas are only $5 (only slightly downgraded versions of the normally $15+ pies).  Quasi-neopolitan style, there were a half dozen choices. While all where good, the mushroom pizza with white sauce was a real standout.  I'd say one pizza per person is more than sufficient. Wine is also $5 a glass, and beer $4. A great deal all around.  We also grabbed a Nutella style calzone for dessert.  That was just alright...somehow it needed to be either more moist, or more chocolatey to compel me to order it again.  The quality of the pizza and the good service mean I'm sure we'll be back to try their other wares.

The raw structure and cool decor has lots of brick and reclaimed wood, which makes for a fairly reverberating acoustic environment.  This makes for a pretty lively ambience.

I just agreed and went back home to finish up some house work. 

12pm came around and still no call. I decided to go see what the hell was going on. I get there around 12:30 and peek in to not see my dog on any of the groomer tables. Maybe she was ready?

It took her only 30 minutes to groom my dog but my dog has been here for 3 hours?? What sense does this make? 

It's the same issue with a doctor, dentist or therapist. You book for a certain time and then what, you wait in the waiting room for 3 hours? What point was it to book an appointment then? 

Where do I have to pay? Oh at the cashier, in the front. They don't have their own cashier system in the grooming area.. so expect to waste even more time waiting with the rest of the store with the only cashier working. 3 cashier lines and only one working... 

My dog has been sad ever since I left this place so I have no idea if she has been sitting in a crate for 3 hours or what the hell goes on back there. $60 for this?

I went for a run here a couple years ago thinking that it would be a literal walk in the park. Without proper trail running shoes or conditioning, it kicked my ass and left me dry heaving after mile 9. I was reduced to a cramped semi-zombie walk, but the enormous gratification of being apart from the grind and escaping my tedious milieu was worth it. 

I'm not much of a ""nature"" person nor a geologist, so I couldn't tell you how old these rocks were or what forces combined to create such beauty. All I know is the sheer ""shock and awwww!"" factor of this natural tribute to persistence and power left me breathless...or maybe it was my half-pack a day habit at the time. Either way, like previous reviewer Alex F. describes, there are many little ""sanctuaries"" one can go to get temporarily lost in, to get away from the tour groups and other visitors. I spent the whole day here and it's one of my mental DMZs when things get hairy.  

I've only been able to return once, and this time in the fall. Proper preparation is vital, especially in the summer months. Try not to go after 2pm if you're not used to the brutal and at times unpredictable, Vegas heat, and make sure to bring plenty of fluids and pace yourself.

We have not brought our dogs here in a while as grass was barren and dog turds were abound.  Not this time.  Looks like it has been recently seeded and allowed to get established so I'm guessing it was closed for a while.  

So this park has plenty of running room for the dogs, a nice aggregate walking path for owners, water source for dogs and generally many other dogs to chum up with yours.  There are several permanent benches for seating and a covered shade structure.  Plenty of trash cans to pick up after your dog with poo bags available or scooping tools.  I just wish more people picked up after their dog or assume they did and pick up a pile you see to make up for missing your own dogs.  As the poo situation was way better than past visits, I still walked continuously for 10 minutes scooping pile after pile.  

Bathroom facilities are located within a couple hundred feet from dog park in between the sports fields.

The chicken vegetable stir fry was delicious and tasty. We had to add a bit more dried red pepper to both dishes as we found neither spicy enough.

We both had the filet. For $59 you would expect it to be perfectly cooked and look like a great cut of meat. Well that was not the case. My filet looked like a hacked up piece of meat on a plate. For a steak house you expect it to look edible. I was a little weary too because I ordered medium and it came out more rare to medium rare. That being said the flavor was good.

Sides were great. I'd skip the fried sweet potatoes. While they are shoe string they had almost a powdery taste but the spicy fried rice, mushrooms and Mac and cheese were all excellent sides the four of us at them all minus the sweet potatoes.

1 - I love that they have a private parking lot and the entire building is just The Lamar Everyday Spa facility (not a strip mall or huge hotel like most spas are in this state).

2 - Front desk staff was all smiles and they were professional also.  Casey was working when I walked in and could not have been sweeter or more efficient when giving me a tour.  (Make sure to arrive at least 10 minutes early so you are not rushed when you go).

3 - Amenities!  Not only did the relaxation area have plenty of magazines, water, tea, fruit, cookies, etc... but the bathroom had razors, toothpaste, shower caps, and more.  (I realize that most spas do have these things, but I just didn't expect it for some reason).  They also have a pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and steam.  

4 - I've had several facials in my life and never really enjoyed them too much; I usually prefer massages no question.  However, this facial was awesome!  My estetician was Ellen - she was fantastic!  I loved that the facial included a hand massage as well as face massage - she even got my chest, neck, and shoulders too.  Plus, the bed was really comfortable - just the right temperature!  It was extremely relaxing and I feel like my skin was glowing when I left!

There are plenty of details that I'm sure I'm forgetting, but you get the point - this was a really great spa!  

***One thing to note:  the locker-room area, waiting room, pool, etc... actually everything is CO-ED!  Make sure you bring a bathing suit and keep your robe on :)  Come to think of it, if you can get your guy to accompany you, I bet this could be a fun couple activity too!

****I am told that the first Wednesday of every month is 2 for 1 night.  I believe it's from 6-9 and if you bring a friend, you get both treatments for the price of one.  They may even have appetizers and music as well.  (Ellen told me about this during my facial, so I could've been dreaming but I'm pretty sure this is what she told me... call for details!).

They have a basic selection of middle eastern food like the sherwarma and the kabobs, which are all very tasty and well prepared and much cheaper than the Persian Room (I'm not the biggest fan of the Persian Room bc its just not worth the drive and money unless you are on a date and trying to impress someone). They also have a great selection of baklava like almond, pistachio, cashew, walnut, and the princess which is think is a combination of all the nuts. Regardless of what you get, you will be happy (both mouth and wallet). 

The downside is that since it is in a grocery store, its a bit crowded and sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but I don't really mind the wait bc I know everything is fresh and prepared when ordered.",2011-08-17 21:20:20
u6_OpO-HXiIw0P4AUR2N3g,Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,f8IMQgRwo-8GP372MElDGQ,4,3,1,2,"1st let me say that I am not really a fan of the downtown hotel/casino scene.  I love the clubs on East Fremont and the vibrancy of the downtown area itself but I have found with small exceptions, the hotels leave a lot to be desired.  

A recent convention held at the Plaza changed that. 

The downs 1st since there are so few:  1) The bathrooms. they are updated but tiny.  If you are more than a size 3, good luck closing the door on the toilet/shower combo. 2) The elevators: please repair them.  3) the casino it self still looks ""tired"" and still smells that stale smell of downtown. 4) hire people who are happy to work not just there to fill space, especially in your front desk & club card area. 5) 15/20/25 per day, depending on who you speak with, for a small fridge in the room. Other hotels charge 15/20/25 for the entire stay.  

The ups:  1)The room renovations are outstanding. The beds are comfortable. The amenities are great and currently NO resort fee but I understand that is changing.  2)The convention area where we spent most of our daylight and midnight hours is clean, spacious and well appointed.  3) the staff: housekeeping, bell, valet, & convention center all were extremely helpful and nice. They should train the front desk staff.  4) the lobby is fabulous. I mean really for meeting people, for casual conversations, for people watching I don't think there is a better place.  5) dining choices.  I cannot say enough about this.  There was something for everyone's budget.  From the Pop-Up Pizza (see another review) to Oscar's Beef Booze & Broads (see another review) it was fantastic.  Even though we were 400 in attendance, we never had to wait for a table at either Hash House, Island Grill or Oscars. The 24/7 McDonald's was nice and their overnight staff was very nice considering the drunken group of people who were staying there. 

We were on the 15th floor all the way at the end of the hall (so typical of my hotel Karma) but with an unobstructed view of the strip.  

We had 3 late night pool parties 1am-4am and while the pool might not be the most fabulous in Vegas, it suited our needs.  You haven't swum (LOL) until you've swum at the Plaza pool at 2am with all of Fremont stretch out before you with a balmy breeze kissing your skin on a warm Vegas summer night.  Perfection. 

As this is a new event in an off season, we are planning on repeating it annually and my hope is we return to the Plaza but even if not, I will still send my clients who want the downtown experience.  Good Job on the renovations. 

Side note:  While the rates are good, parents..do not bring your children to downtown.  there is NOTHING for them to do.  And leaving them unattended in the lobby is not good parenting.",2012-07-24 17:21:41

The pizza is not quite what I would call a thin crust, but the dough is not too thick either. I may just be trying to convince myself that pizza is good for you here, but does thinner crust = less carbs? I think so, and thats what I'm going with at least. 

All their pizza's come topped with their home made mozzerella, and I finished mine off with meatballs, which seemed like a good idea at the time. 

I was right! The meatball pizza is nothing less than super. They seem to have different daily specials. Swing by on a Tuesday for buy one get one free pizzas and bring home some 'za for tha family.",2012-06-09 16:54:35

We booked an area here, as it was near our hotel  for us to watch the Big Game.  Buford's used to be called the Blue Line Grille, and the outside still has the old sign.  From what we heard, they literally transformed their menu a few weeks ago from a Southern style food to burgers and comfort food.

Ducks Radio guy Steve Carroll stopped by to chat with the fans, and we each got 2 tickets for almost any drink we wanted, from beer to cocktails to Pepsi items.  In addition, the fans got to pick 2 squares in the Road Crew SB Pool, to win autographed pucks and other Duck prizes.

The Road Crew ordered plenty of food: pizza, chicken strips, pasta, beef sliders. and we had a ton of food.  I wouldn't say it was the best food we've had from a bar, but Buford's Kitchen did a great job. Also, considering we had one person taking care of our group, our server was ok too.  Occasionally, he would forget an order, or bring the wrong drink, but overall, decent service, and decent bar food.

Since this is near the TJ Maxx in the Sahara Pavillion Shopping Center on Decatur and Sahara (not too usual when there are two discount stores in the same shopping center, but I do know of a few), was anticipating it's opening. For weeks, the sign said ""Coming Soon."" BTW, we went to two new Ross stores on a weekend a few weeks ago (just wrote up the review). I gave the other store a four star review (night and day). 

The atmosphere is chaotic with lots of loud screaming children. It's noisy! I hate shopping when there is too much noise. I don't last long, I usually leave. Maybe this is typical for a saturday afternoon- maybe I should visit on a weekday. I noticed that the signs were in two different languages. I noticed that there was one security guard. Bathroom is located in the dressing room area- the attendant will need to buzz you in for entry.

We didn't stay for very long. This one's pretty small. All in all, my husband didn't like it too much, either. But then again, he doesn't really like Ross stores in general, anyway.

When I say they are legendary, I really mean it! They have regular ones filled with  pepperoni and cheese, but they also have ""atomic"" ones if you like things on the spicier side.

I'm not sure who is a bigger fan of Sunseri's between my mom and I, but she doesn't live in the city and frequently sends me on trips to get her pepperoni rolls. I've braved some pretty harsh weather conditions to get them for her, and if they weren't as good as they are I might think twice about making the journey. They are 2/$10 for the regular or $6 each, and 2/$15 for the atomic or $8 each. Carrying more than 2 pepperoni rolls is comparable to carrying a small child with as big as they are, so you seriously get a bang for your buck here.

During my last visit I was a bit under the weather and decided to try some of their famous wedding soup. You can get frozen quarts of the soup for around $5, and combined with a pepperoni roll you have a tasty and filling meal for less than $15! Usually I'm wary about trying new wedding soups out of fear of being disappointed, but Sunseri's had chopped chicken and little meatballs with one of the best broths I've tasted (aside from homemade, that is). 

You can't go wrong with whatever you choose here, and I'd love to try other items including their sausage and other Italian classics.

Took over 30 minutes for anything to come out, we even order the appetizers which were just seaweed. Chinese food doesn't take 30 minutes for anything. You can take the out the fridge and put it on a plate. Ma asked the waiter two times when the foods coming out and ignored us both times. Ma over heard another table shouting the the lady behind the counter, why were they only serving the big table. In other words, they were serving out dishes after dishes to the large table. 

You can tell the lady who worked behind the counter was probably the owner and the guy who took our order was the husband. Lady super rude and when the food came she argued with my mother telling her that was what she ordered. Clearly we order something chicken in a pot but we received it on a plate.

The place itself is really cute. Tables and bench seating and a huge window to watch the guys make your noodles and dumplings--a la Eat N Park bakery style.  Biggest take away:  it smells weird in here. Couldn't figure out what exactly.

I had the cold sesame thin noodles and +1 got the vegetable dumplings.  My noodles were out instantly with a heavy peanut-y sauce, pulled chicken, and tons of cucumber.  The noodles themselves were incredible, but I thought it was taken over by how intense the peanut was.  Now I did love the sauce; sweet and creamy with a tiny spice, but way too much. +1 thought this was a selling point, but I'm gonna stick with Ramen across the street for this dish still.

The dumplings were incredible though.  I'm hearing that's why people go here.  The soup dumplings are supposedly infamously delicious but they don't have any Erin diet friendly ones so I can only speak for the streamed veggie.  The flavor was much richer than I expected or am used to, mushroom heavy and soft without the mushy veg-paste you sometimes get.  I'm pretty into these little guys.  I also had a mango milk bubble tea which I was seriously unimpressed with (and passed on to the lactose intolerant +1).

In general, I'm a fan.  There are few places like this around. I love the quality and the authenticity but wasn't all about it.

Cuban food holds a special place in my heart and when the embargo is finally lifted, I will be the first person on a plane to Havana!  I always try to get a different dish when I go there, but I always make sure that I get a mojito, a Cuban coffee, and the  bread pudding.

Meal: If you are new to Cuban, stick with the staple rice and chicken.  You can't go wrong.  And anything with rum.  But whatever you do, end the meal with a Cuban coffee and bread pudding.  The bread pudding here is the best in Arizona.

Taste:  So this isn't the best Cuban food that I have ever had.  It doesn't really push the envelope when it comes to seasoning or unique ingredients.  But that's ok!  It does the simple things very well.  I have never had a bad meal at this place and on occasion, I have had that type of meal where you think about it on the way home! 9 out of 10.

Value:  I spend way too much here.  I rarely get booze and dessert in the same meal at other restaurants, but its a given that I will get both when I go here.  My bill is always pretty big so its hard for me to really comment about value.  But what I do know is that I never walk away hungry and I never felt let down after I get the bill.  4 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  Service is always great.  The servers are always warm, friendly, and attentive.  They aren't presumptuous. Very helpful and their recommendations are always spot on. 9 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  Decor is cheesy and the lawn chairs aren't comfortable.  But that is what kind of adds to the charm of the place.  They have live music every once in a while and during the spring, you can sit out on the patio and look at the stars while drinking mojitos.  To me, it doesn't get much better than that when dining in Phoenix. 5 out of 5.

LriyrMhVSVLMyza_QZgBxA,hgw7i8neWKMaLQDrcf4N9Q,z9lOfnUorcbWR_xS0DSeHw,3,6,1,1,"Fugu used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant in Madison, not anymore.  

When it started business in 2009, Fugu was red hot. Its authentic Sichuan Chinese food has drawn so many people to its wonderful central location at State and Gilman. I at least have dined more than 10 times during 2009-2010 and have been constantly happy with its food. Back then, only Wah Kee Noodle was the other ""Authentic"" Chinese place on my radar. 

But you know, restaurants are precarious business. 

Since 2009, there has been a revolution in the Chinese food scene in Madison. I can count almost 10 new authentic Chinese restaurants joining the competition. Ichiban, Oriental House, Double 10, Dumpling Haus, Hong Kong Station, to name a few. Fugu was no longer unique, and I have settled with Ichiban for Sichuan food in the past couple of years. 

Earlier this week, I went back to Fugu and was totally disappointed. The dining space was under-staffed with only two people handling 50 people. Through the whole time of our dinner, servers never had time to clean up dirty dishes left by previous customers. When we left, the restaurant was full of empty tables with dirty dishes. A group of people came but was unable to be seated. So they left. It was ugly. Plus, there were flies accompanying our dinner. 

We had 5 dishes, but they slowly came during a 30-mins period. The fast and accurate service was gone. 

Food was good but inconsistent. Water-boiled beef and Tofu Fish were really good, but somehow our stirred fried pea shoot, the easiest and overpriced dish of all, was messed up. Too much salt. 

My experience sounds really bad, but I tend to think it was an anomaly rather than the standard. Therefore I gave it a 3 star instead of 2. But for while, I don't think I am going back. There are much better choices if you are not limited to the State st area.",2014-07-23 04:13:49

We're not there every week, or even every month, but it is somewhere that we are always comfortable taking out of town visitors. Frankly, I am surprised I haven't ever written a review of this place.

I am not much into sitting art a bar and watching sports, but it has always looked to me like people who enjoy that sort of thing really like this place. For me, it is mostly about the food, but also about the service and atmosphere.

Expect large portions -- usually enough to share. For your first time, or if you are with younger kids, you might try one of the pizzas or pizza rolls. I really like both of those options, although my wife says they are just OK. My kids order the pizza slices off of the kids menu 99% of the time, so they're with me on this one. In my opinion, the hamburgers, sandwiches and desserts are fine, but the entrees really are the stars of the show.

Keeping that in mind, you can order off the regular menu, but I highly recommend at least taking a look at the daily specials. There is usually something for everyone on that list, and each one is a combination of high quality ingredients with an interesting preparation and/or sauce. I can't remember ever being disappointed with a selection from this menu.

Of particular note are the Halibut Cheeks. If you have never had these, you really should give them a try. The cheeks are a little like lobster from a firmness perspective (at least, that's how they were described to me) and do not have a mild taste. How can you go wrong when a dish is served with drawn butter?? With an order, you get a baked potato and a side (salad, soup, veggie, or fries). Unless you're REALLY hungry, get an order and split it. This is a seasonal thing and usually the supply is limited, so you have to hit it on the right night if you want to order them. I think they're flown in fresh from Boston. My wife watches the RWB website for these to show up on the menu and they usually trigger an immediate ""RWB night.""

From a service perspective, our servers have always been very attentive and the front desk staff have been friendly and welcoming: they say hello when you show up and usually hold the door and thank you for coming in when you leave. Be aware that the place gets VERY crowded during peak times, so you may have to wait a long time or come back another night.

Just do it!",2014-10-22 15:17:28

The sangria is red ( white also available ) all margaritas and sangrias are made to order and made with various selections of fresh fruit and juices and each is really a delight to the palette and strong !! All for 5 bucks!! Next the food , we were served complimentary chips and salsas a red and green and both pack the perfect amount of heat ! 
All the appetizers are half off and there are no bad choices !
The queso fundido is served hot and bubbly and quite frankly the tastiest I've ever eaten 
The chicken flautas were crispy and filled with a delicate and flavorful mix of chicken and cheese 
The ceviche from what I hear is very tasty and a great mix of complimentary seafood 
The tamales each more flavorful than the last 
The SOPE sampler , I could not believe for as small as they were each packed a lot of flavor and my friend agrees that even tho the carnitas and beef Barbacoa were great the veggie one was a surprise and the veggie mix did not leave you wanting !! 
Also while it lasts don't forget to check it for your free guacamole , although small it's packed with flavor and beautiful presentation and FREE with check in !! 
Also I e tried the churro dessert but it was passable a little to doughy or undercooked I could not figure out which
 also the street corn as a side is a wonderful accompaniment , it's creamy and cheesey and bursting with fresh off the Cobb flavor

Briefly, there was a buzz about this American retailer arriving in Canada. Target was the name that was to replace Zellers, and swoon the Canucks into equal if not even more America's addiction to bargain inertia. Unfortunately, for Target, they underestimated the 1-2% overall education the Canadians hold over the Yankees when it comes to resistance to meaningless marketing, and that became the detriment to it's projected success. 

I forced myself to come here just to suppress any curiosity that festered in me, not knowing what on Earth I could possibly purchase from a place like this. My expectations were met, there is absolutely nothing here to buy!
The new store looked like an out-of-stock Sears, with primarily children's clothes, and electronics nobody could ever become excited about. There is zero effort in visual merchandising, as the cables from the electronics fell from the sides of the shelves, and the hangers hung empty on their racks. It reminded me of a scene from The Dawn of the Dead. 

There a Starbucks at the entrance that would offend even the most beanie-wearing of hipsters, and I can't imagine anyone actually having a coffee here even if they were paying someone to use their WIFI. Not that I am certain whether WIFI is available. But let's be honest, who actually goes to Starbucks for the coffee?

I walked around utterly perplexed, I did not imagine such a prominent American name would have made such little effort in trying to seduce this new market. Did they just simply go with the motto: ""If you build it, they will come?"" 
If so, then Target's arrival in Canada has missed the mark.",2013-12-03 15:11:01

The reviews for this place are heavily inflated because this is Las Vegas and there are very poor options for Korean food in this city. This is a 3-star establishment at best and tries hard to copy Kang Hodong Baekjeong in Los Angeles.

Meat: Decent quality but the marinated short rib was extremely sweet and the brisket was tough. The ribeye is the star of the show and I highly recommend selecting this option if you get the beef combo. The ice cream sandwich at the end of the meal was excellent.

Service: Attentive, but awkward and borderline annoying. The server is constantly at the grill turning the meat which makes it weird trying to have a conversation with your party. I put one piece of meat on the grill and the server made a comment about doing that which annoyed me because if I'm paying for the meal then I can cook it how I want. 

Banchan: This is where it goes south, the banchan is disappointing and borderline gross. The salad had some weird ranch dressing that doesn't belong in KBBQ ever, the dipping sauces were off (bland), no kimchi pancake, and the side dishes were all low quality.

I'm from Los Angeles and travel extensively for work so this place sits in the middle of the pack for KBBQ. For travelers from other states who don't have access to good Korean food, this will be super amazing to you. To the rest of us from LA-- it's just slightly above average.",2016-08-03 07:01:15

We made reservations through the Yelp app about a week prior and there were only 2 options left, 5 or 8. We chose 5pm and seemed to open the place for dinner. It was a great time to be there because it was not overly crowded. The tables and bar did fill up but we never felt like we had people on top of us! 

The food was just awesome! We had the chopped salad and papas bravas (potatoes) for starters. It was the perfect portions for two of us to split, and we ended up even bringing some potatoes home. The salas was incredible! There were roasted chickpeas, walnuts, bacon, feta on romaine lettuce. The flavors were amazing! The potatoes were so crispy and yet soft in the middle, not greasy at all, just so much flavor! Definitely get it!! 
I had a meal from the specials of the day, the BBQ quesadilla. It was such a huge portion! The pork just melted in my mouth! And the tortilla was so good, not just your average tortilla. It all tasted so authentic! My mom had the pollo taco. She loved it! It was slightly spicy but the sauce balanced it all out. 

The decor was so cool! Very dark, which made it hard for my mom to see the menu, but after ordering it it was not a problem! My mom said it felt like we were inside the Moulin Rouge, ha!

Unfortunately for Yummy Sushi, I love sushi and have eaten at the best, the worst and the in between. Yummy is somewhere at the bottom of the in-between unfortunately. 

Not set up like a traditional Sushi bar, Yummy has a host that is taking orders while cooks prepare all food behind a semi closed kitchen island. The host and cashier did not smile, however, they had little to do with the rating. We ordered 4 rolls to go; fried Philly, spicy shrimp tempura and Japanese lasagna. Fried Philly had almost no batter and showed the seaweed paper, shrimp tempura was soggy and barely spicy and the Japanese lasagna was predominantly rice. Unfortunately, the lasagna was the worst I have had out of any sushi place and I order it everywhere since it is the one roll that has converted my girlfriend to becoming a sushi or at least a sushi roll enthusiast. 

I hate to be so critical of this place, however, the surrounding restaurants and just about every other sushi place out there make it hard not to be. Also, despite the medium prices, there is no all you can eat. No all you can eat + 2 stars = what is the point?.....

All you can eat with great options and pricing in Henderson; Sin City sushi on Serene and Eastern is a great start followed by Sushi Mon on Maryland and Silverado Parkway.

I'd already eaten so I can't comment on the food but the menu looked absolutely amazing!  

What I can comment on is the atmosphere, the people and the sheer surprise of this place!  I thought Johnny's Downtown was the only Johnny's only to find out that Johnny's Bar started in 1920 as the first bar after Prohibition to get a liquor license.  Downtown and Little Bar were later editions as was the menu which turned ""high end"" in the 90's.  

We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender who was very nice, chatty and helped us pick between some of the high end Whiskey's available behind the counter.  The owner (nephew to the original Johnny) was also there and you could tell that everyone took great care in making their customers happy.

On a cold Saturday night, we visited the restaurant.  Hidden behind in the alleyway, a glass door invites you to go downstairs.  I loved the high ceilings, and the seemingly busy atmosphere.

The menu had so much variety. Although a little hard to read, unless you're familiar with Italian phrasing, and in addition to the dim lights, the appetizers are on the right, and the cured meats (in house) and cheeses to the left. It seems like the menu changes on a a regular basis, so i'm excited to try this place in the future.

2 room in the restaurant, one with a very high ceiling, with exposed bricks, give a really rustic feel. A smaller room at the back for more intimate dining, I guess.

They cure their own meats in a back room near the smaller dining room. you can choose 3 or 5 different types $15/25. It includes pork, lamb, and other delicacies.

We spent forever deciding. The Waiters were patient and VERY knowledgeable about the food.

From the appetizers we ordered the ""garlic balls"", or more officially, the Bread Knots or Nodini.
Crisp on the outside, tender on the side, infused with garlic, butter and sea salt. 

We also ordered the Crispy Artichokes. I'm not a fan of Artichokes, but it was yummy. But just an Artichoke tempura.

We shared 4 mains among 4 girls.  The portions weren't huge, but too small to share! I wanted my own!!!

The Cervello Lamb sweet bread was SO flavourful and tender. Not sure what it was covered by, I believe a cured meat. Dip was a type of salsa.

For the mains, we decided to share because we wanted to try it all. I couldn't resist my favourite Spaghetti Alla Corbonara, with some pigs belly, mounds of cheese, black pepper and fresh hen's egg. They mixed it at the table. It was amazing, a bit salty, but the al dente pasta and all the flavours, was the best I've tasted.

The Gnocchi was the best. I should have listened. The best Gnocchi I think I've tasted. With Gorgonzola cheese sauce, with walnuts, the Gnocchi, was pillowy and incredibly soft. The crunchy walnuts was a perfect compliment. 
The duck egg tagliatelle with duck ragù was okay. Salty a bit, but very full of flavour.

For dessert we shared a Calonni (not Canneloni). YUM... filled with a chocolate custard, and on top of Earl Grey infused sauce it was incredible.",2010-06-15 01:59:15

I loved the amenities. I even loved my massage with my massage therapist. But you know how the saying goes, the receptionist is the business's first impression and their last impression. And the day I was there, the receptionist working just wasn't that warm and friendly. In fact, she made me feel like I was imposing on HER time when I checked in and out. I think I interrupted her from filing her nails. Yup, I kid you not. Then when I took my time enjoying the amenities, she madero feel like I was overstaying my welcome. Like it was HER spa. All very weird. 
Even now as I  writing the review I can recall the feeling of unwelcome she made me feel the day I was there.

I've had my fill of standing in hour long lines at Central Phoenix's other late night taco stand just a few miles away on camelback, which sent me in search of something just as good, but not such a burden on your patience. I've visited Tacos Huicho for lunch, I've been here for dinner and yep, also late night. While not quite as late night as the spot open until 2am, they're happy to serve until midnight on the weekends, which is plenty late enough for me the few times I've been craving a taco past 10pm.

They've got tacos at 1.50 per, and in my opinion, well worth the price. They're not a full service restaurant, so don't come in expecting table service. During their day time business hours, you can find them cooking inside behind the counter, but visit in the evenings on the weekends and you'll find them cooking outside on their cooktop grill. Maybe its easier on the ventilation, maybe it's easier than having the 10 minute long line of people waiting inside, maybe it's because their outdoor grill can cook more food than their indoor grill. Whatever the reason, they're doing something right.

A little known secret to their success, I think, is their uber delicious hot salsa. Every order of food from their grill comes with a serving of it and it burns so good. Not in a ""I can't even taste the salsa this is so hot"", but in a ""I tasted this awesome sauce, and a few moments later, I can really feel the burn"" kind of way. Get some, you won't be sorry you did, unless you don't like spicy food, then I would suggest you avoid it.

I'll be back for sure, the only real question is just how long can I go without making a stop back in?

Flew to Vegas on Monday and burned through over half of my funds in the first 24 hours of my 48 hour visit.  Not acceptable.  Need a break.  I couldn't find any bank ATMs, so I took the Deuce from downtown to the nearest Wells Fargo branch (between Fremont and the Strat - kind of a crappy area).

After walking through the drive-through ATM, I was standing by the Deuce stop and sweating profusely.  Crap.  It's hot.  The passersby are staring at me.  I resolved to get on the next Deuce, no matter which way it was going.

A bus arrived heading towards the Strip.  I hopped in for the ride.  I remembered that a friend had recommended Slots A Fun and their (in)famous 99 cent hot dog.  He said they were nasty.  What the hell, my day couldn't get much worse.

I sauntered in about 1:00 P.M.  and grabbed a $2 Heineken.  Stood in line for the snouts.  Made the tactical error of adding chili to my hot dog (see picture).  Just nasty.  Tasted like Hormel chili and bologna mixed together.  Ugh.

Why three stars?

The margarita was delicious, I wouldn't mind going back for more however I'll pass on the food. My three street tacos were inconsistent, typically street tacos come with two tortillas however one of my orders only had one tortilla which was nicely heated but the other two were not. The only good thing about the taco was that it was a decent amount of meat it's just a tortillas sucked and the service.

It was perfect timing as we beat the crowd and had our choice of sitting inside or outside on the small patio. We went with outside since the weather is so nice. We started with edamame which was a nice fresh start, little strange that they bring you a pile of salt on the plate versus salting it before it arrives but it was good none-the-less. Next, I went with one of their basic rolls that had mango and a spicy thai chili sauce on top, it was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. The other roll I had was the Salmon Fresh Roll with mango and mint, wasn't sure what to expect, but it came as almost egg roll types and there were two. It was also yummy although I would've liked to taste the salmon a little more. Overall good food, nice to beat the rush and consistent service. I'm sure I'll be back again!",2016-04-17 18:01:28

   Nice atmosphere & interior welcomed our fairly large party, far different from the obnoxious overbearingly loud rowdiness & tacky sport team coloring typically found in similar places. Of course it was lunch & not much in the way of games was happening @ the time but hey, I'll take it whenever I have 2 accompany my sport~luving eating companions.

   Our w8tress was very friendly, professional, efficiently accomod8ing ~ I especially liked how she interacted w/ my friend's kids who were in tow. She was either a mom herself or just knew how 2 make kids feel as important as the adults. 

   I started w/ the Spinach Queso Dip & a side of sweet potato fries which were both amazing in their flavors, texture & consistency. Fries were Perfect: outer crispness soft inside ~ not greasy, limp or overly~fried. Spinach Queso Dip was 'almost' up there w/ my fave = Elephant Bar's (which is saying A Lot)!  

   4 my entree I ordered the Strawberry Field's Salad (sans the chicken of course) & it was SUPERB. It comes w/ a bed of mixed greens (grilled chicken), strawberry wedges, candied pecans, feta cheese and strawberry vinaigrette which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ~ I was so blown away by it's Goodness I placed another order of it 2~go & tried seeing if I could buy some of that AMAZING strawberry dressing 4 personal use @ home but 2 no avail, wasn't available that way (or they're keepin' it a secret)!

   I noticed there r quite a few different options available 4 Veg~heads here & of course dishes can b customized minus items such as what I did w/ the salad which was my Fave of all the 1derful things I'd partaken of while here. So YES I look 4ward 2 returning UN~reluctantly 2 try other things from their surprisingly extensive menu & might even brave Superbowl in full swing 2 do so (which is the personal BIGGEST COMPLIMENT they can get from me)!!

I had two trips to Humble bar - one with two of my girlfriends, where we had just drinks and dessert, and second with my husband. Being impressed by my first visit ( drinks and dessert were delicious), I came back to dive into the refreshingly different goodness of the place. In simpler words, we ordered artichoke appetizer and Margherita pizza both highly recommended by the waitress. While artichoke dish ( 2 artichokes stuffed with goat cheese and baked in the oven), was an interesting prelude to the meal, pizza ended up being a complete disaster. When I ordered Margherita pizza, I imagined the pizza described by Elizabeth Gilbert in ""Eat. Love. Pray"". Remember her eating this thin-crust delicious pizza in Rome? How she admits it was so sinful, but so good. 
Instead we got ourselves a very dry, over-cooked, rubbery, blend far cry from the pizza. With the first bite, I got very confused: I was watching how they make pizza (you can see the entire process from the bar), I couldn't believe all that magic of pizza-making produced such garbage. I almost dislocated the jaw and take out the crown while eating it. And you would think, that something like this will never happen to you in a vey heart of Lakewood where gourmet pizza is sold at almost every corner. 
But it sure did. I still give place three stars for the atmosphere, service and quality booze ( the wine and apple cider we ordered were really good).

No referral or prescription needed, this establishment will be able to relieve all symptoms of disappointing foods and at a generic level price!

Having severe withdrawals from my trip to Tokyo I wanted to experience the quality of Japanese kushiyaki that I had there. Fresh meats, marinated over Binchotan Charcoal and not cooked using a conventional gas grill. I've have had this place bookmarked ever since it first took over the previous sushi restaurant and with some friends in town, we decided to go check it out.

Setting: In the middle of the busy jones/spring mountain plaza, there are tons of places to eat and do. Q karaoke, billiards, cafe moda, hookah etc.... This area to me is the new focal point of go to eats in the chinatown area. 

Interior: Dark and sophisticated, the area has a light smoky smell from the grill but well ventilated. Sushi bar area with seats and booths surrounding it, usually there isn't a challenge to get seated which surprises me because of how good it is.

Food: Sushi, Karage, other japanese apps but the kushiyaki, THIS is why you come here. Ever since my trip to the Philippines, eating with my hands has changed my life and grabbing food with my hands feels so right. So grabbing these meat skewers and sliding it off with my mouth has an usual satisfaction for me. They have chicken, beef, seafood based skewers but my favorite in order are 
1. Wagyu beef tongue
2. Tsukune (you don't need the $1 raw egg, it slides off the meat)
3. Pork cheeks
4. Chicken thigh
5. Intestine
*i prefer the salt over the sauce for the thigh, cheeks, and intestine
**make sure you get a bowl of rice to accompany your skewers

Service: Everyone here is nice and approachable to ask any questions about the food and menu. They welcome you with a big irotshimasen and arigato gojieemasu after you're done, it's like I haven't left Japan.

Overall: I crave this place and if I lived closer i'd be here every other day (we actually came here 2 days in a row).",2016-05-15 00:14:58

I very much like the place, and it has maintained its general character even as the head chefs have changed over the years.  Casbah is very good about continually updating its menu in an effort to stay current and relevant.  Over the years I have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce, and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  I have ever encountered (although I no longer eat mammals, so they are likely to be the best pork chops I will ever eat).  

This is not an inexpensive place, it can be quite pricey for dinner.  One plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on Sundays.  Their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  My one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. I always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.  This cuts through the fat from the pancetta and makes the salad even more tasty.

Others may disagree, but even though this is a fairly fancy place, it is suitable for children.  Casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  My wife and I have often dined here with our kids.  This semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.

We ordered delivery from Kj's last night because it was too cold to go out and the food sounded interesting. Based on other reviews, we decided to stick to the Sri Lankan food on the menu. We ordered the potato chicken curry, the chicken masala, and an order of the chicken satay appetizer (with choice of rice or salad, we chose salad). Our total (with delivery tip) was $35. That is a lot of money for 2 dishes and an appetizer!

The man told us the order would take 15-20 minutes to get to us from the time I called. An hour later, he showed up with our food. I have no problem with food taking an hour to prepare and deliver, but I do appreciate being told it will take that long.

The food is the reason I have so much trouble with the review. There was not much of it, and the curries were $11 and $13. The satay was $5 for 3 satay sticks, and it came atop a ""salad"" consisting of a tiny bit of cabbage and 4 pieces of broccoli. The food was tasty and well spiced but VERY salty. We had trouble eating it (even with copious amounts of rice to temper the salt) and decided to dilute the curries with water/coconut milk to help with the salt. I don't think I've ever eaten food so salty in my life. Even my boyfriend, who normally likes his food saltier than I do, thought it was way too salty to eat. Had the food been less salty it would have been delicious.

I think this place needs to reduce the prices of their food or increase portion sizes to make the cost worth it. If they did that and seriously cut back on the amount of salt they used, I would come back. At this point, unfortunately, I don't think I would recommend ordering from here.",2014-01-07 19:51:06

I've been to momocho several times before and will keep going back because the food is so yummy.  However, what prevented us from having an amazing experience on Saturday was the service.  
We got there around 8:30 with no reservation and was told it was about a 45 minute wait.  No problem we knew what we were getting into.  We found seats at the bar and ordered drinks and the gaucamole sampler.  I love the crab chipotle guac and the smoked trout one but the blue cheese one was a little too strong for me.  
After about 20 minutes the awesome hostess came and told us a reservation didn't show up.  We were then sat and our real wait time began. 
Our server wasn't exactly friendly or efficient but after about fifteen minutes she stopped by and took our food and drink orders.  Then we sat.

No reports as to what was happening with our food in the now nearly empty restaurant.  I finally looked at my watch.  10:45!  Finally my dish arrived.  I apologized to my tablemates and started eating.  I ordered the lamb which was cooked perfectly and served with a light and creamy mustard sauce.  The uncooked spinach wilted perfectly underneath the hot lamb mixing with a tangy vinegarette and pinenuts.  I loved it.  I also finished about 3/4 of it before everyone else got their food.   The food was still delicous.  The carnitas tender and the spiced chicken skewers

My husband, son and I came here for Sunday brunch to celebrate buying a new house, my son completing his first week at his new school, and our upcoming 3rd wedding anniversary.

Making an online reservation was simple and I appreciate the email and text reminders. We arrived somewhat early so we sat in the driveway with a good view to the airport and watched planes take off and land for about 10 minutes.

It's a very lovely and clean restaurant. We were greeted by our hostess and made small conversation while she seated us. Our waiter was responsive to our needs, made my son laugh throughout the meal and was overall enthusiastic and accommodating.

There was way to much food there! lol but the smoke salmon, iced coffee, crepes, omelettes, eggs benedict, and crab legs were a hit for my family. I also hate brussel sprouts but with our waiter's encouragement, I tried theirs and it was very good!  It's all you can eat and the food was plentiful and beautifully presented.  The workers were all working hard but remained friendly and courteous.

I knocked off one star because my husband and I were not aware that they do not serve alcohol until 11am (we arrived at 9:30am).  We were really looking forward to Bloody Marys and Mimosas but we made due.  Also, one worker kept talking about another worker being loud but honestly he was just being enthusiastic and friendly.  She was working the prime rib station which is right next to the salmon.  She kept commenting on what I was choosing over at the salmon station and it just got kind of annoying.  There was another worker working the crepe station who came across as high-strung. Although she was working hard and seemed to want things just right - she kept complaining and shared her personal problems but....the crepe she prepared for me was amazing!

Brunch is pricey but worth it for all the fresh, well prepared large selection of food and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. Definitely top-notch and my family will definitely be back!",2018-09-18 13:18:29

On a cold and rainy winter night, 2 hungry suburbanites were wandering the streets of Korea town desperately looking for something to eat that wasn't sushi or bibimbap.  All of a sudden after what seemed like hours... probably only 20 minutes or so a light emitted through the bleakness of winter.  White Brick Kitchen illuminated the dark street and provided us with an oasis of decadent comfort food. We were saved!

My boyfriend ate the mac and cheese and I hoovered down the turkey and biscuits.  I use the ever so ladylike term ""hoovered"" because that's what one does when they get a hot and tasty meal after walking in the rain.  The biscuits were so buttery and soft.  I savoured every bite.  The turkey bowl had huge chunks of turkey in a creamy stew.  The perfect remedy after coming in from the cold.  With delicious food, kind staff and a cute, intimate atmosphere, I'll be sure to come by again.

This time round the slow service and cold food at least made enough of an impression that i remembered to never go here again. On the upside, at least the sangria was decent.

The dining room was less than a third full but our sever seemed to have trouble looking after three tables. He was nice enough and enthusiastic but that doesn't mean much when the kitchen forgets to cook your order. Our appetizers showed up cold after an hour and a bit but a mixture of fear that I would never see them again and gnawing hunger kept me from sending them back. An hour after that our meals made the scene and were at least warm this time. Our waiter somehow thought that bringing us two waters that we didn't ask for would  make things better and salvage a tip. No dice.

My food was ok. It tasted like cooked lamb and the veggies were very fresh. As in, ""just taken out of the fridge and cooked five minutes ago"" fresh. Our appetizer would have been fine if it were warm when it showed up.

Now I know what you're thinking, ""Why didn't you speak up sooner, complain to the manager or just get up and leave?"" and I would have been within my rights to do all of the above. The truth is, I didn't notice how much time was passing because I was having a nice drink and good conversation. Does that mean this place should get a better rating? My lord no. I just know I won't be making the mistake of eating here again and hopefully I can steer some other people away too.

Disgraceland offers all the hallmarks of a bonafide hipster dive bar/pub complete with ubiquitous tattooed sleeves, puerile bearded lads, and of course Pabst Blue Ribbon on tap.

My whole reason for coming was for the extensive Vegan menu items as I'm on a quest for  yummy vegan fare, not to mention the menu is hilariously sorted by titles like ""Appyland""  ""Fryland"" and ""Doggy-Style"" which definitely piqued hubby's interest :D  

 The Shroomy Doom Dooms (tempura'd shrooms)  are excellent, and the tempura batter was crisper here than any decent Japanese resto could fry up.  My unturkey club with surprisingly savoury ""facon"" tempeh and vegan macaroni salad hit the spot on a cold night and hubby demolished his Pulled Pork with JD BBQ sauce Sandwich+ Coleslaw with gusto much to our servers delight.

Although previous reviews complained of lackluster service I think it's just REALLY laid back at Disgraceland, but not slow or anything like that as our food came pretty quick, it's just informal.  As far as I could tell servers were super nice and friendly and I swear hubby was crushing a bit on them and mistaking their amiable service for flirtation (stupid middle aged men!)

All-in-all I liked Disgraceland and wouldn't mind popping by again for some casual vegan eats.  It's an excellent choice where both vegans and carnivores can (hopefully) peacefully dine together.  Also, thumbs-up for playing 90's Brit-pop...yay Pulp!  3.75",2012-03-19 04:38:36

They have one menu so no changes at night. I had read some prior reviews so I was wondering what I was walking in to but was pleasantly surprised.

Atmosphere - Good natural light during the day, the tables aren't crowded so it was comfortable. They had good music in the background but it was at the right level. They have a semi-open kitchen so you see the chef working hard to put out some really good food.

Service - It wasn't real busy and we had very attentive service. No issues.

Beer - They haven't started brewing there yet but have a good variety of 7 taps with some great local breweries like Huss Brewing.

Food - Everything, from both meals, was outstanding. Of the four dishes we had three different burgers and they were the best I've had in the area. The  1/2 lb patties have a good sear/char but cooked perfectly to my requested temperature (medium rare). All high quality ingredients from the meat, bun, bacon, etc. We had the Twisted Cactus burger with fresh poblanos roasted, the Cowboy Up which has a ton of flavor and the Bacon Blue which had awesome bacon. The French fries are handmade and awesome. I'll repeat, best burgers in the area, period.

Nothing available- they use a mix. I ordered eggs, bacon and sausage and specifically asked for cracked eggs bc of a food allergy. The sausage was ok....but had a weird flavor. Husband agreed. Bacon was inedible- it had obviously been cooked ahead and was a floppy, greasy cold mess. Eggs were from a carton, not cracked. My entire meal was wrong and bad. I ordered a latte.

We ordered a ton of sashimi and a few basic rolls. Check out my photo from the sashimi/nigiri platter. Gorgeous presentation. Fresh, flavorful and service was very fast and direct from the chef over the counter. 

My biggest dislikes are the prices and the TVs. Prices do seen a little steep, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was well worth it. Can't say the same if it weren't for the buy one, get one half off deal. Probably wouldn't go back if it weren't around. And the TVs. Just yuck.

This show was amazing from start to finish. I'm not really a big Baz Luhrmann fan and I only casually follow his stuff. I do - however - like musicals and Vegas shows .. plus I heard really good things about this. 

When I first got to the show we had pretty good seats near the front, but the usher asked if I wanted to sit on the stage instead and I was like, ""OMG YES .. I mean.. sure."" You can't order drinks on the stage but the experience is SO worth it (you can take a drink with you if you already have one). You are RIGHT there with the actors and it adds a whole new dimension to the experience. The actors will occasionally interact with you (we never got pulled on stage though so don't worry). You can also get a few peeks backstage. Plus, you can look onto the audience and live out your dream of being a show performer which - if you're like me - will never happen another way. If you've seen a ton of shows like I have and want a new perspective, I recommend stage seating. 

As for the show? It was fantastic. A friend described is a ""sensory overload"" and I feel like that's a good description. Constant music and entertainment. I was worried I wouldn't be a fan because it's been so long since I've seen all the movies but I think the show is enjoyable on its own - although it's even MORE enjoyable if you are familiar with the songs/works. Although I came to the conclusion while watching it that all Baz movies are kinda sad .. so uh, just keep that in mind near the end of the show. Still, it's a wild ride and it's worth it. I totally wanna see the show again, maybe this time from the ""common people"" perspective so I can get a more traditional angle. Highly recommended all around.

1806 E. Elliot Road
Tempe, 85284

I have eaten Thai food in many different places both in and outside of Arizona, but this place is either at the top or almost at the top of Thai places to eat.

I was joined by two companions for dinner. I started out with the Thai rolls ($4.95). Beautifully crispy spring rolls served with a nice sweet chili sauce. Companions both agreed that these were really good.

Companion #1 ordered Pad Prik Khing, which was chicken sautéed in house curry paste with string beans, bell peppers and lime leaves. Companion was concerned about how spicy the food might be, but the cook made it to companions order and it was pronounced perfect. Companion completely finished the plate.

Companion #2 ordered Scallop Gra Prow, which was sautéed scallops with onion, bell pepper, Thai basil and Thai chili pepper. Companion liked the food on the spicy side, and the chef was happy to comply. Companion completely finished the plate.

I ordered Ped Khing Sod - crispy roast duck with ginger, mushroom, onion, celery, bell pepper, ground pork and bean sauce. The duck was fresh and cooked to perfection. I loved the sauce, and the veggies were properly crisp and cut into nice, mouth sized portions.

Both companion #1 and I ordered Thai tea, which is almost a necessity for removing the heat if it gets to be too much. I ordered my duck at medium heat, and next time I will order it at the hot level because I didn't find it to be nearly hot enough for me, but then again, it's a matter of individual taste.

About the only thing I didn't really care for was the rice that was served with the dinner. It seemed to be overcooked and not at all like a good rice should be in texture.

We all decided to have dessert. Companion #1 had a concoction of  grapefruit with a coconut macaroon, which was pronounced quite good.
Companion #2 had flaming fried ice cream, which was a whole world of difference from what is usually served as fried ice cream in other places. The batter was a totally different but excellent texture, and the waitress lit a cruet of rum on fire at the table and them properly poured it over the fried ice cream. Not only was the presentation nice, but the taste and texture were pronounced excellent.
For my dessert I ordered Crème Brulèe, which is not usually on the menu but is a special for this month. I've eaten this dessert across the states, and it is usually good, but in this case, it was outstanding. The crème was silky smooth and wonderfully thick with a not too thick layer of burnt sugar on top. It was like a trip to heaven. 

The place is nicely clean and the restrooms could be a model for a lot of other places - clean, fresh, and nicely appointed.

This is easily the best Thai restaurant in the valley, and matches or bests other places I've eaten at across the states.

5 stars for quality of food, cleanliness, service and ambiance.",2012-05-12 03:31:40

If you're lucky enough to find parking around S. Roadway & Euclid, give this place a try. But be forewarned, it's a vegan restaurant, and you have to buy in to this concept to appreciate the food (i.e. accept that there really is no substitute for a chicken egg), which when mimicking meat can run a bit bland, but in the form of interesting veggie and fruit dishes, can be quite delectable.  

I'd recommend the sunshine salad and the lemonade. I also had a side of carrot & raisin salad, which really surprised and delighted my tastebuds.  Meanwhile, the pizza burger was filling, but nothing special.

There is a parking lot outside, but it was full so we parked across the street. We had waited a few minutes to be seated but that was fine (we had reservations but they didn't seem to be necessary). After we were seated, we again, waited a few minutes. We had been to all-you-can-eat Brazilian steakhouses before, but this one was new to us. The concept is you have a marker indicating whether you would like to continue to be served (""green side"") or you would like to be left alone to eat or you're finished (green side). We were told there were nine items on the grill. 

We began perusing the salad bar, which, while interesting and necessary next to the meats. It was a little lacking in options though for the picky eater. Again, I must compare it to the other Brazilian places similar to this I've been to before, and those offered a wider variety of items. Among offerings there were several different types of salads offered, from fresh greens to seafood salad. In addition, there were items such as soup of the day, rice, cheesy potatoes, and stews. The cheese selection, while small (3 types of cheeses), was pretty tasty. 

Overall, the service itself was extremely slow. Maybe it was because it was a weekday night, but we found ourselves waiting about 5 minutes or more between each meat we saw. Overall, the meats were alright, the top sirloin being our favorite. Other items include: chicken legs, cinnamon-apple lamb, linguica (pork sausage), bacon wrapped turkey, flank steak, a tenderloin, grilled cinnamon pineapple, and a few other items I can't recall. The top sirloin itself was delicious, but several of the others fell flat, including some very dry/overcooked pieces of meat. The bacon wrapped turkey was also good, though not the type of food I would come to a place like this for. 

In addition, when we were almost finished with our meal, we finally received cheesy bread rolls. Although they were decent, they just fell a little flat and were just a little disappointing. The grilled pineapple was juicy and a good finish though (you have to catch the servers walking around with that, so time it right!). 

In the end, we were disappointed with the overall meal and were full just from waiting so long in between. We ended up not getting a dessert, as it was just time to leave. It wasn't a special place to go for a four year anniversary, but maybe it was an off night. If you haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, this might be worth the experience, but for the price and for our occasion, I wasn't a fan.",2016-12-14 15:37:18

Also, the lunch buffet is fantastic for a quick lunch...some people get squeemish when they think of raw fish on a buffet line, but honestly, this place stays so busy at lunch the buffet turns amazingly fast...they are putting out new plates every 10 minutes...and if you are lucky, you will time your trip to the buffet just perfectly when they are putting out a fresh tray of nigiri or sashimi, because those go fast! (NOTE: they don't do sashimi on the buffet everyday, and the pieces are thinner than they cut when you order off the menu when they do...but come on, its a buffet!  Take three slices, stick 'em together, and you got you a REAL piece of sashimi!)

Service can get slow here during peak times, but it is worth the wait.  Enjoy some sake and chill out.  The menu is truely an amazing sight.  They literally have everything...if you've dreamed about it, chances are it's on the menu.

For those that think this is the ""Americanized"" version of sushi; that is only because you don't order the traditional stuff off the menu.  They have plenty of stuff for the purist as well!  Their handrolls are authentic, and their sushi rice is prepared in the traditional way (i.e. high rice vinegar content, very sticky, etc.).  If you want traditional, stick with the nigiri, sashimi, etc.... all you have to do is ask!  

FYI, authentic sushi means you are eating slices of fish, sashimi-style, over a bowl of rice.  No type of roll, other than handroll, is authentic, traditional sushi.  I can't be the first person to pose this question to the haters out there complaining that this isn't ""authentic"" sushi.  Why did you order the deep fried roll smothered in mayo and expect it to be ""authentic""?  What part of the ""Muy Buena"" roll that you just Yelped about did you expect to be authenticly Japanese, I wonder? 

FYI: Don't order the deep fried, mayo covered roll (it clearly states what each roll is/consists of on the menu), then complain that it was deep fried and covered in mayo.  I can promise you a non-authentic experience if you do these things.",2011-05-16 17:45:43

If you live in the area and need fresh produce for a decent price, you're better off going to the many Rabba's that are in the area (I think there are three or four).  Also, fruits and veggies aren't super fresh and I kind of expect that from Longo's.  Combine that with their expensive prices, the grocery section is more a 2/5.  

However, if you are looking for an upscale, custom made salad, skip Camros and come here.  It's a bit expensive (2.99/100 g), but the selection is amazing.  It's surprising that the salad bar can be so fresh, yet their produce section isn't.  They have all the regular greens, but also have tofu, string beans (love 'em!), boiled eggs, fruits, steak served cold, shrimp, really good salmon, etc.  So for quality of the salad bar, definitely 5/5, but it loses a star for price.  4/5

I don't know if they always have the kennels closed now or if in the particular day they're doing something like cleaning or whatever, but on this day they told us to pick dogs from the picture and they bring them out for us to see them. The only thing you can see is they have a rabbit and rodent room upfront. I don't like this route for several reasons. Mainly, I think when supporting something I feel like the living conditions should be transparent. This is why I don't give money to rescue groups blindly fundraising at say Petsmart because I've actually known some to be covers for BYB/hoarders. Not accusing this place of wrongdoing at all, but I am just a person who likes to see with my own eyes what happens behind the curtain. 

 Also, sometimes you think you like how a certain dog looks, but they are totally not it. You may walk by one you might've not considered through pictures, but has a temperament you are looking for and you connected when face to face.  This has happened to us before - it's how we ended up with our cat and how we ended up with a senior pug. I do know people can be jerks and having a free for all probably stresses out dogs if people are being disrespectful, but maybe they can achieve something in between with controlled numbers in the kennels.

Really, we were here to see one particular dog I saw on their blog so it doesn't apply to us. Apparently the people sitting there were here to see him too....and then after us a family was here to see him. He had some long term medical issues and they were totally gonna let us take him, but seeing as how he was totally trying to be friends with the dog of the other family interested, I told the BF we should give them a chance. If they weren't going to take him,then we were coming home with a bulldog since I'm not working that much and can dedicated to getting a sick dog better. A plus is they have a large lobby with seats that air conditioned, but a side patio where you can bring your dog off leash to meet potential new dogs. 

The lady helping us though was nice. She was pretty upfront about his allergy condition and what meds he's on and such which is good. The one plus is if you have dogs and cats like we do, they are willing to go do a cat test for you which they did for us so we can consider it heavily. I suggest bringing your dog with you as they want you to do a meet first before adopting. 

While he has a home with that family now, and I really hope he has a great life, I'm sure my bulldog is out there. I'll probably be back if a bulldog, frenchie or pug pop up here.",2013-08-24 06:59:37

For some reason there were zero employees behind the counter aside from the repairs counter for a good 10 minutes. There's also no notification that you would get service if you ask an employee by any of the cashier booths...like, come on.

The second time I had a completely different experience. I was treated by a female employee who quickly asked me if I needed assistance, and I said yes as I was looking for an external hard drive. She took 3-4 minutes to explain the different hard drives, sizes, brands, etc...until I finally interrupted her and told her I only wanted a specific size with a certain price range.

The fetticune carbonera sauce was rich and had hunks of sausage. The pork in La Boco was tender with no fat. Their size, each the size of my fist, were slightly disappointing. Everyone else in my party was very satisfied with their food, although the server did bring out an incorrect order for one of them nor did our server apologize for it [in retrospect, it sounds pretty, but any place can be courteous]. 

Their service with our wine orders was disappointing. Shortly after arriving, we ordered a bottle of wine. Several minutes later, our server arrived to tell us they were out of our selection and had a different bottle in hand, in similar price and style and we ordered it. As we were served our entrees, we ordered another bottle of the replacement wine. A while later, our server came back and apologized they had ran out of that replacement bottle as well. By the time that they had come back to tell this and offer us a 3rd option, we were nearly done with our entrees. Granted, I have not worked in the restaurant industry, but I've learned that if a party of 6 is sharing a bottle of wine, it's expected the server should ensure there are at least 2 additional bottles for the party before serving the first bottle and have the bottles readily accessible. Another member of my party is a server at one of Mr. Bruell's other restaurants and was also disappointed in the service. 

I'm unsure whether to give 2 or 3 stars since this was my first time at a very contemporary Italian restaurant such as this. However, I've experienced much better service my other times at Zach's restaurants, so I've seen better.",2010-09-23 23:58:47

Winning at Toronto Underground Market aka TUM is garnering the longest line amongst the patrons. At the time, they only served their Rock Lobster ROll and Lobster Cappuccino (which can be found on their current menu). Having been won over at TUM, I vowed to support their establishment once they opened.

Must Try's: Crispy Maple Pork Belly & Rock Lobster Roll. They're so good, one might even fancy ordering it twice (I know I'm guilty of that). 

Crispy Maple Pork Belly is exactly as it's named and ten times as delicious sounds. The pork belly is perfectly crisp and mixed brilliant with their secret maple sauce. The creamed spinach served with it is fantastic. 

Rock Lobster Roll is, I'm scared to say, one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. I've tried and tasted many other creations in Toronto, but none compare to Rock Lobster. The bread bun is toasted with a garlic spread, and the lobster filling is generous to say the least. 

To top it off the $1/oz Cabernet Franc is a great deal, and a perfect accompaniment to the entire meal.

Other notable mentions include: Lobster Mac & Cheese and Lobster Poutine. Both delicious in their own rights, but come in a close second to the dishes noted above.

Sidenote: Although not personally ordered, table neighbours ordered seafood towers ""Crows Nest"" and ""The Boss"" and the shrimp, oyster, crab and lobster looked fresh to death.",2013-07-09 02:56:42

Ordered the seafood pasta dish and my friend got shrimp spaghetti. To be honest it did not taste as good as it looked. I was excited for the mussels in my dish because it's one of my favourite seafoods but overall the red sauce was a little bland. The parmesan made the dish taste a little more flavourful.

My friend originally wanted spaghetti and stuffed meatballs but when ordered we were told that they were out of that dish. The spaghetti and shrimp came with a white sauce and I thought it was better tasting than the seafood pasta I got.

Sausages and duck fat fries. All you need to know. DELICIOUS. There is a HUGE selection of sausages, which is nice. Food-wise things are great.  

However, the concept and the space was just a huge letdown for me. First, you line up to order food. When we were there we waited what seemed like forever just to get to the front of the line to order and then for the food to arrive. Also, you order your drinks in one place and your food in another (two long line ups, which I really could have skipped). 

The atmosphere in the bar (it was a Saturday night for a friend's birthday) was out of control. It is unbelievably loud - like being in a night club and extremely crammed (large communal tables and benches). You couldn't talk to anyone while seated since it was SO loud and I felt like I spent most of our time in line waiting, rather than socializing. 

Maybe you're into the loud crazy frat house atmosphere but i'd skip it. Wvrst, if you had a food truck I'd love to eat that but your beer hall is out of control loud.",2014-04-29 20:48:49

In terms of food, as you would expect, not the nicest cuts of meat. The fish tends to get burnt, and it's definitely one of the hardest ones to cook. It was a fairly competitive price for a kbbq though (around $10), although not the best food/atmosphere.

It's a mom & pop version of franchise Gyu-kaku. It's a mix between Japanese and Korean barbeque. We got a combo and a pork katsu with curry and it was extremely filling. Oh and we got a 4 Sapporos on draft. After taxes and tip, it came out to $30 per person. 

The quality of the meat was not the finest but it was good and reasonable for the price. The downside of the combo is that it does not come with any side dishes and those items need to be ordered separately (it's very un-Korean, most Korean restaurants give sides for free). The pork katsu was standard and it was just good as well. The best part of our meal was the 27.7 degree Sapporos. Super chilled with a film of ice on the top. It was so refreshing in the hot summer Las Vegas night.

I definitely recommend this place if you want a low-key Japanese/Korean food. The items will not disappoint and will fill you up. The minus 0.5 stars is for the side dishes that need to be purchased.",2013-08-22 12:09:53

They were at capacity and one of the hostesses told the group ahead of us that they were not taking any more people. Did we just get rejected at the Buffet? LOL. Truth be told, I was a bit relieved since I didn't want to eat at a buffet that night. Since we were already at Caesar's Palace and we had plans to go to XS that night, we ended up at Mesa Grill. We got seated immediately by the nice, smiling hostess. I'm surprised they let me in because I looked like a bum that day with my jean shorts and bright tank top.

We started off with an assortment of bread-jalapeno, jalapeno corn muffin, a nutty bread, and sourdough? I didn't taste all the bread so my bread descriptions suck. Of course, I need an adult beverage so I ordered Duvel, a golden ale. I love my Belgian beers! It was Restaurant Week at the time so my friend and her sis ordered something from the RW menu. Nothing really caught my eye on the RW menu so I decided to get the Ancho-Chile honey-glazed salmon (cooked medium). We shared the tuna nachos with mango, habanero hot sauce, & avocado crema for an appetizer. Wow, get the tuna nachos!

My friend and her sister ordered the chopped salad, grilled Berkshire pork porterhouse chop, Sixteen Spiced chicken, Tres Leches cake, and the salted caramel chocolate pudding. My salmon was cooked perfectly with the slight crispiness and flakiness on the outside and slightly under cooked and tender in the middle. It's exactly the way I prefer my salmon. The bold Southwestern flavor combination had a slight kick and all the flavors of black beans, tomatillos, and roasted jalapeno crema blended well together. Not only did it taste amazing, the bold, vibrant colors were so pretty to look at. I had a bite of everything. Every single thing was delicious! To end the meal, the salted caramel chocolate pudding put a smile on my face. it was so decadent and not overly sweet. I wanted to lick the bowl but that wouldn't look right in public so I didn't. 

Our server Joel was professional, friendly, courteous, and even noticed my friend spilled some sticky sugar water on her purse and wiped if off for her. We all didn't notice. I didn't pay too much attention to the decor. It just looks like any fancy restaurant on the Strip. I did notice most people were dressed so I felt slightly uncomfortable there with my casual attire. If I had known I was coming here, I would have dressed up!

Since it was lunch, the prime rib cooking aparatus came around to our table and was cut directly in front of us. It was very good but I thought it was over-hyped and over-priced.

Pros:
Inexpensive compared to other clubs on the strip

More space to move around (exluding the dance floor)

Good service from waiters (At a table for bottle service)

Cons:
Small Dance floor gets packed

Up-tight security/staff.  They were more concerned about one of our guests taking her shoes off while sitting in our VIP section than anything else in the club.

Sub-par mix of top 40's music blasted at obnoxiously loud levels. 

I wouldn't rush back here, and beyond the fact that it doesn't get as packed as many other clubs on the strip, there isn't a whole lot of redeeming qualities here.  Also, the club doesn't feel like a gay club.  This could be a concern for customers specifically seeking a gay club.

Dwayne performed a 'cat test' in front of us to also see how the dog woyld react to a cat. There is also an outdoor area to take the dog to get to know it more.

The ahi tuna was prepared very well and the chip added just enough crunch to enhance the soft tuna. The seared burger dish was fantastic, because everything I like was on that plate, two sides (fries and coleslaw, my favourites), big piece of tuna seared perfectly in between sesame buns with a very generous amount of avocado spread! Not having to choose between fries and coleslaw made me very happy plus the amount of avocado spread was truly delightful. The big thick piece of tuna was as good as it gets, hence the five stars.

The place is great for big groups. The Service in the place it's okay, not anything to be amazed about. it is focused more on efficiently getting you the food, rather then intimate service. 

Onto the food the most important parts, for the most part i find that the cooked food is better then the sushi. I've been to this place multiple times, and i have to say their sushi quality has decreased greatly. It is not just the fish that is not as good in quality anymore, but also the rice. You can tell when a restaurant is going for the money, if they make a Salmon rose where the rice is so big it pops right our of the sushi and has plenty of space with no salmon. Also the rice quality has decreased, as the rice used for the sushi is very mushy and wet. and not the smooth texture that sushi should be. 

aside from the sushi which is not up to par even when compared with other AYCE places around them. the cooked food was actually the better part, most of their cooked food was done fairly well, as with everything in my pictures has shown, the only exception would be the chicken skewers which is dry. other then that the veggies are good, the short ribs are good, and overall they are competent when it comes to the cooked food portion. 

This restaurant i would've given it a 4 star in the past, however because the sushi quality has dropped so dramatically, i can't help but give it 3 stars at best. it may be an off day, and i might still try it one more time just to see if its true.

Habitat seems to be a little less meat market-ey than a lot of other clubs in Calgary. I think, anyway. As a guy, I don't really get to experience the full brunt of skeezey guys as head on as women do, but most people appeared to be content dancing away without making awkward grinding advances on the booty of unsuspecting strangers.

It's a small room that makes for a nice intimate DJ experience. 
As for drinks, it's hard to tell what they carry - just yell out a simple highball or shot order into the bartenders ear that you Think they'll be able to understand over the  nn-tss-nn-tss.

My recent visit was the most spectacular, and I sat inside in the dining room, rather than outside this time. I also have to say that this place is the most stunningly beautiful restaurant ever. The tables are lavish, the seats are deep purple and velvet, the art is stunning, but the most special part of the restaurant is the chandelier. They hang it in the middle of the room for obvious reasons ;). It's literally breathtaking. 

Aside from the mind-blowingly gorgeous décor, the food is superb as well. We did the 16 course tasting menu and I loved every bit of it, especially the caviar course. As great as the tasting menu is, the two most special parts of the evening are the bread cart and the mignardises cart. I have never seen a restaurant pay so much attention to detail like JR. You can choose from 40 different breads that are heated up for you personally, and you can choose as many sweets off the cart as you like! Heavenly. We also had a great wine pairing as well. 

Our servers were outstanding, the décor is as gorgeous as I remembered, and the food was superb. There is no competition to JR and it will continue to be my favorite restaurant. I wish I could come back more often, and I really want to take the gold limo next time I go!",2014-03-23 05:00:42

The other places have the flavours mixed into the shaved ice where as this location only had 1 neutral shaved ice as a base and they add toppings/sauces to make it the flavour you want. I found the restaurant bone chilling freezing with the AC on full blast, it wasn't that cold outside but at least our shaved ice never melted. We ordered a mango shaved ice and a tofu dessert (I thought it would be inside a cup however it was in a bowl). Our friends ordered the red bean shaved ice. The service was good, didn't take too long to get our desserts. Ordering was easy as you just go to the counter. The tofu dessert wasn't bad, it was the taro flavour- however didn't really have much taro, just 1 scoop of the puree. Some mochi chunks, and some tapioca. Our shaved ice had a lot of mango syrup to mix into the white shaved ice, tapioca, grass jelly, and fruit loops (lmao). Random but a good crunch?

Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash: This dish had a good kick to it and the sauce was savoury but the sweet potatoes seemed undercooked and a little hard. There was hardly any chicken in the dish. Overall a disappointment

Green Chile Cheeseburger: The patty tasted good but its a burger that I could have eaten anywhere and wasn't anything special.

Honey Glazed Salmon: Decent but nothing special

Today it has fallen so far its former glory that I actually walked outside and checked to make sure we were at BMK.  What it lacks in hygiene it makes up for in indifference.  

The food was never inspired, but it was a really nice classic Cantonese menu - mostly street food, but definitely fresh and tasty.  Now? Blech!  Little better than foodcourt Chinese.

My friend ordered wings, chili fries and the unbelievably delicious deviled eggs which she had to take home due to, again, the large serving sizes. The eggs were breaded and baked, I've never seen that done before.

I think it was soft opening, so perhaps they can work out some of the issues we encountered on this first visit. 

It was Sunday Brunch and when we walked in, we were quickly acknowledged (great!). We were at first directed to sit anywhere, but then another server told us she'd take us to a table. There was some clear confusion between the two. We chose to sit at a booth. Unfortunately once we were seated at a booth, we realized how uncomfortable they are. There was about two inches between us and the table, which couldn't move because of the size of the table base. 

We ordered the French toast with bacon and an avocado bacon sandwich with hash browns. The sandwich, which besides the avocado and bacon, had tomato and flavored cream cheese, was very good aside from a little too much cream cheese. The French toast looked nice and was topped with strawberries and whipped cream. Sadly the entire inside was undercooked and fell apart after putting the fork into it. 

The service overall was very lackluster. Our server was very hard to find and seemed to have a chip on her shoulder that AM. We had to flag down a different waitress, who was much more obliging, to let them know about the soggy toast. 

They removed the item from the bill, and the manager was very nice about it. Our waitress only came back by after the manager stopped over and crassly said something about the toast that indicated she didn't know about our issue, even though she should have since she was our server. She also snapped when I asked for more coffee that she was getting it, even though it took a while to come back by with the pot. 

On our way out, we were nicely thanked by two servers sitting at the front, but one was eating a yogurt. Another pet peeve was that the ketchup asked for with the hash browns was served in a plastic to-go container, rather than a bottle or ramekin. 

Don't think we'd run back here anytime soon, even though it's within walking distance and they did a nice job remodeling from when it was Kennedy's.",2017-12-10 22:48:34

1. The fish:  A few good sized cuts of what appeared to be pretty fresh cod (i think). Three stars.
2. The Batter:  Not so good.  It was doughy and soggy and had no element of crispiness. It also kind of fell off the fish a little too readily. It was well seasoned though.  1.5 Stars.
3. The Chips:  Ok so these are their seasoned fries.  These are always really good, but in this case I feel like the chips definitely out shined the fish, which is a deduction. Three stars.
4. Accompaniments: The tarter sauce was cold and creamy but lacked a bit of that tartness that you want and so seemed a little bland.  There was no malt vinegar, had to ask. I did appreciate that there were 2 lemon wedges. 2.5 stars.
5. X factors:  Pretty solid beer selection and a Glenlivet neat.! 4 stars.

Averaged up that's a mere 2.8 stars.  I will round that to the nearest star for the rating above. Considering that the x-factors pretty well saved the score here I would definitely go with another menu item in the future.",2013-03-06 03:46:10

It is clear Soul Gastrolounge only cares about one thing, and that is the money, and not customer service. Needless to say, an hour and a half wait and $200+ tab is not worth it to be treated so unwelcoming.

With that having been said, they serve these really great hot roasted pistachios and pain epi w/ butter to start, very delicious.  I ordered the endive, radicchio, fuji apple, roquefort and walnut salad, it was very refreshing, I ate up all of it.  Then I had some brussel sprouts and mac n cheese as my entree since there weren't many options for vegetarians, that was quite good as well.  I skipped dessert.

There wasn't really anything I had which I would die to have again, but the food was very good nonetheless.

Shrimp congee ($6.75) - good and bad. Lots of big yummy shrimp for the cost. The congee itself was watery and toppings (soya, sesame seed) could not salvage it. It was like a soup you prepare for someone sick. Hopefully just caught them on an off-day. 2/5

My friends and I arrived a little after 8:00 PM on a Friday night and the entire restaurant was full of people. After waiting near the hostess stand for no longer than ten minutes some seats opened up at the bar, we were in! From that point forward it was a 5-star dining experience. We were greeted by such friendly bartenders who offered us samples of the beer and wine we were interested in. The hostess even came over to let us know she was keeping her eye out for an opening table.
 
Food:
Everything was so fresh, delicious, flavorful, and unlike any placed we've dined in Pittsburgh in quite some time. Caribbean cuisine at its finest. For starters we ordered the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip with House-made Chips & the Lobster Tacos. The dip came out sizzling hot, a blend of beans, cheese and spices baked to perfection served with their house-made chips that really pack a punch! Quite spicy. We could have eaten the dip by the spoonful we were practically drooling over it. The Lobster tacos are served on three mini hard shells with cabbage and some other fixings. Very substantial amount of Lobster so you're getting your money's worth. My friend loved them-high quality lobster. For entrees we ordered the Jerked chicken thighs and the Caribbean Rainbow Salad. Jerk chicken was seasoned to perfection, very large portion served with two sides. The salad was enormous and comes served like a chopped salad with all the ingredients separated for you to toss on your own. So fresh and flavorful, close to 20 different ingredients in total. Overall dinner was fabulous, not a single complainant, and we will certainly be back again. It's very unlike us to not even look at the dessert menu--I guess it's safe to say we were completely satisfied and didn't need to consume one more thing. One additional bonus is the menu is seasonal which keeps it interesting and us coming back for more.
 
Ambiance:
Very unique Caribbean décor inside. Lots of wooden figurines and statues around the restaurant. Darker, romantic lighting. Caribbean music. Restaurant is on the smaller side but they pack in a lot of tables inside, outside and there's a long bar inside that seats about 20 people. Very cozy. The upstairs bathroom even has a beautiful mural painted along the walls.

After spending an exchange in Barcelona and parts of southern Spain, I was desperately missing Espana. So, when Patria opened (touting itself as a proper tapas place, with the appropriate amount of chi-chi ness naturally) I had to go!

I prepared myself by reading all the reviews of this place on Yelp (I know...nerd!). 

Location: I knew it would be hard to find. Thanks to all Yelpers who brought me to Patria on the first try! If you are walking West on King Street, you will pass by Weslodge. Immediately turn right into a darkish alleyway (it's safe, but be careful as cars exit that alleyway as well) and you will see a restaurant that has all glass that is Patria. If you have walked by Patagonia on King Street, you know you have gone too far.

Service. There were some mixed reviews on Yelp. And so, I was going to prepare to receive mixed service as well. If you lower your benchmark, than anything great is always a pleasant surprise. When you first walk in, two ladies stand behind this tiny, tiny desk that acts as the reception. I walked in and stood for a minute while the hostess ignored me. She finally looked up and said a grumpy hi. I wasn't perturbed as I knew this would happen!

However, I am glad to say that the service for the rest of the night was excellent. Our waiter Natasha couldn't have been better! She immediately offered me water and a glass of wine while I was waiting for my girlfriend. She also gave great suggestions for wine pairings. The rest of the evening went so great. I really love Patria, which I didn't think I would. Las comidas, at the end of the day, were excellent. For those of you who know my love of Patatas Bravas, Patria serves it with un huevos frito (fried egg) which is delectable. One waiter offered to break the yolk of the fried egg, and mix it. I got the HOTS just watching the glorious yolk ooze through the potatos. 

My friend and I also had a selection of Iberico cuts, Figs with cheese (YUM!), Olives, a second order of the Patatas Bravas (because I practically ate the first dish myself:D), and the fideo pasta that was oh so yummy. Everything was just delicioso!

I had such a great time at Patria. The service was great. One man in a suit (Daniel), not sure if he was the manager, came over to our table to ask if we had a great time and if everything was okay. Our plates were continually refreshed and empty ones quickly taken away. Natasha ensured that our water cups were always filled! 

I will be back the next time! 

FYI. There is a ""patio"" of sorts right outside the restaurant. There is absolutely no sun. I am thinking it is much nicer to sit inside, but for those who love any patio, Patria has one!

Bathrooms are upstairs. That level also has a long table for a private party, so anyone planning to host una fiesta can have the entire second floor to themselves.

The wow factors here include a villa-esque interior. I was not expecting the huge wooden booths, tiled floors and twinkling light trees. Nicely done. Despite the fancy digs, the spot is completely casual. You order at the counter and take your number.

Other notables: The pita bread is prepared fresh to order, and there is a complimentary lentil stew and tea cauldron for everyone to enjoy. Considering these bonus treats, the price is terribly cheap. All of the plates are around $8, and when the plate hits the table your eyes will pop at the generous helping. I personally didn't enjoy the flavor of the lentil stew (It wasn't a typical lentil soup), but I still appreciated it being free.

Now for the falafel. They are served on a plate with a big heap of crispy fries and all of the salad fixin's. My first bite of falafel was great; the flavor is right. But, the texture is dense, so after eating one and a half, I wasn't as happy about finishing up my serving. My favorite falafels kind of pop open when you cut them, but these required a knife to really slice through. Not necessarily a bad thing, just not my preference.

So, I probably wouldn't go back for the falafel, but I think the atmosphere and the price point would warrant a repeat visit to try a kebab or maybe just snag a delicious, fresh salad on the run.",2012-02-19 01:11:06

Yes, Ikea is the same all over the world. Quality of the products used to be much more better years ago and furniture much more functional. Unfortunately the Swedish standard and simplicity has given up to consumerism, and mass prodiction. Regardless I still go to ikea when I need a modular furniture that allows for some flexibility and gives you the options to apply your own design. Besides that Ikea is cheap. The food store has some wonderful goodies, lingonberry preserve, dry bread, I recently bought grounded organic coffee and it turned out to be pretty good. The cinnamon buns are major attraction, not bad, but believe me far away from the real ones baked in Sweden. So, I just came back from Ikea today after few days exhausting research about specific furniture and lights.

I don't know how some of these places make it but this newly opened sushi spot has created their own niche for sushi dining in sin city. If you are in the mood for a low key sushi spot where you can chat with the chefs or have an audible conversation at your table, then you better keep walking. Here you will find tons of entertainment. This Located in the Park, it is set in a perfect location outside of the new T-Mobile arena. We walked in about 10pm on Saturday night, closing time was posted at 10:30pm but I was told that they will stay open until the last person leaves. 

At first, I wasn't 100% sold on it. It was extremely loud inside and they sat me right next to a large post that takes up a lot of space. It was like I was in trouble or something or they were trying to hide me from the place because of my looks. HAHA! Seriously, I would recommend they do something about that spot for patrons. It is not the most conducive place for eating or enjoying the overall experience of the restaurant. I guess I could have said something but I sucked it up and rolled with it. The service was a bit slow at first and it took a few minutes for our server to acknowledge us but it was probably because I was sitting behind a large post and they couldn't see my big head. I probably would have made this a 5-star spot but the post thing wasn't cool. After that the service was wonderful. The beer and cocktails kept coming. 

We weren't too hungry but went with a few appetizers, agadashi tofu, shishito peppers, seaweed salad (delicious), mixed tempura (way overpriced for $18), and miso soup for the wifey. They do not have a lot of options for sushi/sashimi and be forewarned that the pieces are priced for 1 piece of sushi. One piece of uni is $8, etc. Not a big deal because it's Vegas where things are way overpriced and they know stupid people like me will pay for it. I had the sashimi platter (chef's choice, so not the best pieces but they were okay) for $40. It was decent. I would probably order again but I should have tried something different rather than the sushi since they have so many offerings. Overall, the food was good. 

The entertainment is the main attraction here. The MC for the night goes around messing with people. Be careful because if you look shy you will most likely get called out. He will persuade you to dance and make a fool of yourself. Hey, it's Vegas so whatever happens there will stay there, so just let the inner fool out, you know it's hiding in there and has been dying to come out. There happened to be a Lakers/Warriors preseason game that just let out and the Laker girls came in to dine. Yeah! I'm a huge fan but my wife told me to leave them alone. The MC got them in on the action and a few of them danced on stage. It was cool. 

Servers were nice and attentive (after they realized we were there). Food was good and drinks were great. We didn't order a huge meal or that many drinks and the bill was a little much, with tip it came out to $230. So if you are budget minded this is not your place.

WE ordered, the wife had a stack of pancakes and me, steak and eggs, the food arrived quickly, steak cooked to perfection and the pancakes were stacked high, pretty enough to take a picture and delicious, coffee was good and hot and we never worried about refills, DeAun made sure our cups were full.

Ordered the honey soy glazed salmon tacos which were well cooked and on point. I could do without the sauce they put on it some sort of creama it just makes the flavors too complex and not in a good way. The avocado pasta salad was good, but definitely could have used more salt.

We primarily go to Sura for meat binges but decided to try this place based on...hunger mainly. 

The selection didnt impress me very much, two things that i missed from Sura was the kimchi stew and the beef tongue. The beef tips werent very impressive and were sliced a bit too thin so when we cooked them to the point we liked the inside was too dry.

I do believe the grills at Sura are better as well. At Wooche you get a rectangular grill where the hottest part is the center and the coolest are to the sides. This makes it difficult to cook large amounts of food at one time because the hot spots are too small and the cool parts arent hot enough.

When I left the office, I was asked if I was in need of assistance for restaurant reco's and I said I already had a place in mind.

Entering Readheads, the layout is like a cafe.  And as it was after the lunch rush, only a few tables were occupied and it looked like everyone was enjoying a Katsu lunch.  I, too, opted for the Katsu, with an egg.  Delicious!  The curry was very rich and flavourful, and the pork was not greasy at all!  The egg was nicely poached, and placed on the side, to allow me to mix with the meal however I wished.  While eating, another customer sat near me, and I saw the sushi she ordered was a generous size and looked really good, but I was certainly too full to try sushi during this visit!

But although I was full, I had also ordered a matcha ""donut"" when I ordered my lunch, so of course I had to indulge.  Upon tasting, it was really the texture of a madeleine.  Good, but lacked the matcha flavour somewhat, but good enough to pick up a couple (another Matcha and Nectarine) for a colleague to try.

On my return to the office, I was asked where I went.  I was told I made the perfect choice (thanks Yelp) and in fact, the office often used this cafe as their caterer!  Clearly, I made a great choice for my lunch!",2016-09-04 16:05:18

We went for the baked rice. and i would have to say that although it is not as good as it used to be in terms of the sauce, as the sauce Portuguese sauce is slightly more diluted then it was not enough curry powder to mix with it. 

The other dish we had was the baked tomato pork chop with rice, now this dish the pork chop is tender and done right, the only problem is unlike their previously done sauce, they need more sugar in the sauce. 

Overall this place it is fast and no frill although not as good as it used to be in  terms of baked rice, it is still very much one of the better hong kong cafes in the area for all your necessary needs for lunch and dinner.

No problem -- you can still flaunt your goodies and ogle bikini-clad strangers any time you want at El Santo, a newly opened cantina and lounge near Scottsdale Quarter that features a Mexican food menu and a public pool adjacent to a massive outdoor bar, along with another bar inside and a full restaurant.

There's no cover to swim it up at El Santo, a joint conceived by the same people who brought the Valley fellow hot spots Stingray Sushi, Geisha A Go Go and Spanish Fly. I like the concept, since in the hot Valley weather, it's nice to cool down by water whenever you can, even when you don't live near a pool yourself. But the pool is probably the only reason I'd come back here -- when I had a preview lunch at El Santo, the food left me underwhelmed and wishing the patio outside had already been opened.

I started with an Avocado Carpaccio salad ($7), which appeared to be one single small avocado sliced thinly and drizzled with a little bit of vinegar and topped with a couple onion and jalapeno slices. It was such a simple, safe dish, and I couldn't believe it cost $7-I could have made it myself at home for maybe $1.25.

My companion got the El Santo Lobster Flautas ($15), which resembled egg rolls and which he said tasted like mediocre taquitos. They were another really expensive dish that didn't seem worth the price.

I ordered cheese enchiladas ($12), which were off the menu since the only enchiladas they offer had meat in them. There weren't many vegetarian menu items available at all, save for some veggie tacos, and I was disappointed that although the enchiladas came out on a skillet, they were lukewarm and chewy -- they reminded me of ones I'd had at Sand Bar, but only more expensive and without sides of rice and beans for the $12 price tag. I did like the chips and salsa, but they weren't spectacular enough to save my meal.

My pal got the Slow-roasted Carnitas Burrito ($11), which he said was alright tasting but was also not piping hot. I know it was a preview lunch, but the food temperature at El Santo was a red flag for me.

Dining in the restaurant area itself was a little odd, since there were some bar stool table set-ups in corners that faced walls, as well as seating surrounding giant columns that allowed you to see the people directly next to you and not much else. Below, find some pics from inside the restaurant.

The patio bar and pool area, as well as the adjacent indoor bar connecting the pool to the restaurant, are places I'd rather hang out at, and I can see them filling up on nights and weekends. Just stick to the cocktails if you go.",2012-07-07 20:51:56

I think they also do a night called Fancy Pants? I've been there once..not too sure it's a regular thing.

The drinks and food are great here. I can't speak for Burgers Across America (since I don't eat meat), but I've had plenty of things here..the cheese curds (omg delicious), veggie wrap and grilled cheese. Yum!

The Arts Factory has been the hub of First Friday - the city sponsored art event held, imaginatively enough, on the first Friday of every month - for the past threeish (fourish?, it all blends) years.  Housing something like 16 galleries, with performance space and areas outside to set up MORE art, there's more mixed media here than you can shake a pretentious art school student at.  Local and national artists display and sell their wares, and with a selection as vast as this you're bound to find SOMETHING you like.

Tinoco's Bistro is also housed in the factory, serving up some delicious Italian meals (be sure to make reservations in First Friday) and a band is almost always playing on their patio.

It took MONTHS longer to open than expected and I can tell that they are still working out the kinks - bar service was slow the first time I went, the entire tap system was out the second time, but by my third and fourth visits things seem to be going more smoothly. Yes, I've visited 4 times in the couple of weeks they've been open - the grub is worth it!

Happy hour is a great deal - half off margaritas and whiskey, dollar off drafts,  dollar off tacos. You have to be sitting in the bar area so just ask for a table there. Their margaritas are great, but the long whiskey menu really surprised me and whetted my happy hour appetite.

If you aren't familiar with Barrio, you build your own tacos with a checklist separated out into shell type, filling, topping, salsa, sauces.  They also have a list of premade favorites. I'm not a vegetarian but for some reason prefer meat free tacos so I almost always get the marinated mushroom filling with the jicama slaw and raw onions for crunch, the salsa verde for heat (one of my favorite things in life and theirs is fresh and delicious) and the pesto to add a little garlic zing. I could easily eat 4 tacos but try to limit myself to two with the free chips and salsa to fill me up. If I'm feeling indulgent I love the stoner queso - their regular queso with rice in it - I thought it'd be weird the first time I tried it, but it makes for a thicker texture that is really nice.

I've also been for the Saturday brunch. The Bloody Maria was absolutely the highlight. (A Bloody Mary made with tequila). Perfectly spiced with a thick salt and pepper rim, garnished with a thick slice of bacon, cheese, and olive. Our waitress warned us that the bacon was addicting - after one thick-cut, crisp, peppery bite, I knew she was right! For brunch I had the shrimp and grits, which were cooked nicely but could've used a little more spice. I also had one of my usual tacos because I like what I like. My dining companions tried the brunch tacos and found them satisfying.

My server seemed to pretty casual and laid back.  He asked if it was my first time there and I said yes, so he ran over the menu with me.  He also mentioned that they had a bloody mary bar, but I'm not much of a tomato juice fan so I skipped that.  He went back to check on the specials of the day, while I looked over the menu.

While waiting for food a couple of other groups came in.  My food came out after a reasonable wait, even before the two top that had been seated before me.  I ordered a beer to go with my sandwich at that time.  The sandwich was pretty good sized and the amount of fries was ridiculous.  The bread was a nice crusty french bread and it was stuffed so that I could hardly get a bite of it, but I managed.  It was very tasty and very messy.  The fries were a deep dark brown color and almost looked like they were burnt, but they were not.  They were close to being perfect.  The insides were light and fluffy, but the outsides just weren't crisp enough for me, so I was a little disappointed there.  But overall the food was pretty good and reasonably priced, $9.50 for the sandwich plus $1 for the side of fries.  For $10.50 there was enough food there for two meals.  The beer I got was a little pricey, $6.95 for a pint, but it was also pretty good.  If I come back I'll probably skip the beer and just get a sandwich.

I had taken my partner to the hospital due to stomach pains and after a series of tests, they wrote a prescription for some pretty strong pain killers. We were told that the onsite pharmacy at the hospital was closed and that the prescription could be filled by any pharmacist.

As this store is at the top of our street, we stopped in to have the prescription filled on the way back to the hospital for a CAT scan.

When we approached the counter to drop off the medication, the pharmacist was less than welcoming. He said that we'd have to wait a moment as he had just gotten in and needed to ""do a few things"" before assisting us. We waited a few moments and then he came back to the counter.

He read the prescription and said that the medication was a narcotic and that he had to speak to the doctor who wrote the prescription. We explained that it was from a Dr. who worked at William Osler Hospital in Brampton, so he had to contact the Dr. there. He told us to wait a few moments while he called. Well..I don't know what happened but he came back and said that he couldn't reach the doctor and that he would not fill the prescription without speaking to the doctor. My partner was is great pain (which was clearly visible), but the pharmacist said we weren't regulars at the pharmacy and that he could not authenticate the prescription. In other words...we were accused of not having a valid prescription. I was flabbergasted at his approach.  

We asked for the prescription back...went to a Shoopers Drugmart and had no issues filling the prescription. When we told the person at Shoppers what happened at Walmat, she laughed and said ""I wouldn't call that a pharmacy"".

I will NEVER go to this store again for a prescription.",2013-12-02 20:27:47

A wonderful spot for great tasting food on a no-frills budget.

We came to Island Style looking for Jajangmyun (Wheat noodles in a black bean sauce) and Seafood Jjamppong (Wheat noodles with spicy broth)...we found really good versions of both of these dishes as well as some other pleasantries.

The Jajangmyun was made with love. I tasted exactly how I imagine my Korean grandma would make it...if of course, I had a Korean grandmother... Needless-to-say it was great! Jajangmyun is a highly pleasing dish. The black bean provides great flavor, but also makes for a nice thick sauce--coating the noodles as well as your tongue...and who doesn't enjoy the occasional tongue coating? I enjoyed this dish more than the Seafood Jjamppong, but the Jjamppong was pleasing too with all kinds of seafood swimming in a delightfully spicy broth.

The service this night was on point--attentive of our needs and even fulfilling some of them before we realized there was a need...recommendations, drinks, utensils, side dishes, condiments, to-go boxes...everything taken care of. The banchan (side dishes) were a little more hit and miss then I am used to, but these rotate, and the overall experience more than made up for this area.

This certainly not a place that would draw me in on its own. The façade is simple and cheap looking. The interior is modest as well.

Why am I so excited about the bun? Because it was incredible. It was fresh, it was tasty and it was toasted. That combination is lethally good. I ALMOST want to say it made the whole thing, but I think the toppings combined with the bun did it in for me. 

The funny thing is I used to not even really like dogs. I've always had them served to me very blandly. The only way I'd eat them later on in life is if they were straight off the grill. But now that there's all these gourmet offerings, I've tried my fair share of dogs around tahn. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this has probably taken over as my favorite. 

There's over 20 different choices of dogs, which is hard to believe. I kinda wanted to try them all, but ended up choosing the Illinois and the special of the day, the Arkansas dog. The Illinois (tomato, banana peppers, celery salt) had a bountiful amount of banana peppers and not too much bacon (which surprisingly, I liked).

In addition to the 40 minute prep-time, my wife waited an additional 15 minutes in the restaurant, so they threw in a salad and a couple more crepes, which is probably why I received 6 of them.  The husband and wife both apologized for the long wait, but also asked my wife to sit at a table where they served her tea.

We especially enjoy this location here in East Mesa as the staff (Jennifer is the head Manager, Tara our hostess and Deb, our server) is great and we've become friends with them.  We drop in for an early breakfast in order to beat the crowd and enjoy fast, friendly service several times each month.  Enjoying an early breakfast has allowed us to make friends with the some of the staff.  

Tara always makes us feel welcome each and every time.  We're amazed with Deb's memory for details!  She never fails to bring us items that she knows we prefer.  We've observed her doing this for her regular customers as well which we find impressive!  Additionally, we appreciate how Jennifer (Jen) takes the time to briefly drop by our table to ensure we're satisfied with our visit as well as catching up with us.  She's hired a good group of people to make her location one of our favorite places to have breakfast.

Finally, we enjoy how the food (Chicken Fried Steak breakfast or the VIB are among our favorite choices) is consistently good tasting each time we visit.  Jen, great job hiring good line cooks!

I usually have to restrain myself. Here, nothing is all that enticing. The cheese balls that are my favorite thing ever at these types of places are often cold or run out.

The meat is fine but also not as good as at other similar restaurants. My favorite is definitely the prime rib.

Samgyupsal, also known as Korean bacon or three layer fat, is the protein of choice over there. I, on the other hand, was known to cut it off, and pissed off quite a few friends. 

I had eaten at DJK and Mother's on numerous occasions. Back then, I accepted that you got your BBQ, a bowl of rice, your banchan, and that was it. Looking back, I feel cheated, because the traditional Korean way is so much healthier. If a restaurant offers you all of the above with lettuce and sesame leaves to wrap your meat with, you have struck gold. I have yet to find one. The ultimate way to eat this cuisine is to take a preferred leaf, a piece of garlic, pepper, pickled daikon, meat, kimchi, some ssamjang (a mixture of red pepper paste, soy bean paste, and garlic) close it and shove it in your mouth.

What a cool divey bar/restaurant. I along with my coworkers all ordered burgers and they didn't disappoint. While not the best burger I've ever had it was moist and delicious. Apparently the burgers are saturated in Burgundy while on the grill which gives them their flavor.
Fries do not come with, which is always annoying, but we ordered a mix basket with onion rings and fries and it was quite tasty. 

Only down note; halfway through the meal my coworker claimed he found a long hair in his burger that he swore up and down wasn't his. Being a self-proclaimed ""goat"", he ate the burger anyway. I know this would warrant an immediate look of disgust and a one star rating by some....but shit happens. Hair gets in burgers. I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt. 

But if you are repulsed by such things, I would encourage you to come here anyway if only to have a drink, the place is pretty cool.

The calamari was overcooked, too heavily breaded, and salty.  We actually sent that one back.  If you read my reviews you would know I almost never do that.  Maybe once a year.   

Lastly we got the rigatoni.  It was spicy and pretty good.  We added meatballs.  They were OK.  Not fabulous, but OK.  Reasonably large, too (though not large like Buca).

Hobak Korean BBQ is a fairly new restaurant on Spring Mountain (between Lindell and Jones) that's actually located in an otherwise commercial building/plaza. Its facade only directly displays its name in Korean symbols, but you can see the English name on the big plaza sign at the side of the road.

I was forewarned to come early to avoid the dinner rush, and I lucked into an invite to a group of 5 at 5 pm. Those who end up having to wait will find complimentary beverages (water bottles in a cart outside the restaurant, sweet slushes in dispensers inside), both of which are welcome in the Vegas summer.

Meat is clearly the core of the experience, and we made the centerpiece of our meal the $89.99 large size Hobak Beef Combo ($54.99 for small). I'm not sure whether it's the unlikely phenomenon that ""black angus"" is finally no longer a buzzword or that they have fresh-not-frozen meat, but every piece of meat was well-marbled and (probably as a result) incredibly delicious. I'm sure that the charcoal cubes in the base of the grill also helped lend that extra smoky touch to everything.

The first meat was beef brisket, and I've never had any of it before with that much flavor. The sushi rice w/ wasabi actually made it even better. It went well with the onion sauce too. Next came the boneless short ribs, which my friend said should be paired with the sesame oil. It was great. I think we actually got both marinated skirt steak and aged short ribs (the latter two with sufficient flavor on their own), and those were also fantastic. Even the cartilage off the short ribs was a wonderfully fatty (albeit very chew-resistant) mouth experience. Start to finish, this was beef heaven.

Some of us wanted to try their pork belly a la carte ($21.99), so we added it to the tail end of the meal. It was pretty great, but it had been dwarfed by the excellent beef. I'm told that the pork options in general don't measure up, so I'll be more than happy to stick to the Hobak Beef Combo next time.

Speaking of which, I didn't even finish describing the several other items that are included in the combo. The bean paste stew was unfamiliar to me, but it was tasty. The steamed egg was my favorite yet, and it didn't have conspicuously burnt edges (where it contacts the stone bowl). The veggies seemed like an afterthought in portion (shareable for 4? nah), but they were good. The melted cheese merely needed some tortilla chips for the full nacho effect, and it just felt out of place. The rice pop ice cream is actually some of the better ice cream sandwiches that I've had, with a light crispy shell glued by red bean puree to vanilla (w/ strawberry syrup) and green tea (w/ chocolate syrup).

The various side dishes (banchan) were also good. Kimchi, a couple salads, and various pickled items worked on their own and sometimes in combination with the meats. [EDIT: Incomplete sentence/thought, what the heck? Well, I'll add that they'll gladly refill the banchan for you, so feel free to ask!]

Finally, we also shared some other dishes. The bi-bim bab (aka rice box, $7.99) was a great mix that included spam and eggs, although I'm told it also doesn't measure up to the best that LA's KBBQ scene has to offer. The spicy buckwheat noodles with vegetables ($9.99) impressed me more than the faint memory that I have of the soba from a long-ago visit to a formerly trendy Japanese spot nearby (spoiler alert: it was I-Naba).

I can't let it go unmentioned that service is great. Did I mention that they cook the meats for you? Well, they cook the meats for you. It's about as close to being spoon-fed as a baby that you can get to sitting back and enjoying. Each table actually has a four-button device for requesting different types of service (order, check, service, cancel), but we never even had to use it. Decor was nice too, with elements reminiscent of other popular local Korean restaurants, although I was mostly focused on the food. I will say that the metal chopsticks and water cups felt nice to hold; they had real heft to them unlike at some places.

My next visit to Hobak Korean BBQ can't come soon enough. It really is a beefivore's paradise, and all but the most ravenous should be able to escape with an excellent, reasonably portioned dinner in the $30-40 ballpark. Especially if you take advantage of free corkage.",2016-06-09 04:36:17

With the BF residing in North Phoenix, there are not that many options when it comes to finding a good breakfast spot in the area.  So, when we were craving a hearty meal last Sunday morning, we went on a mission (to Cave Creek) to find somewhere new to add to our existing rotation of Kashman's, The Good Egg, The General Store, and Einstein's Bagels.  We found it at Oak's!  Unfortunately, we aren't the only ones that found it...

The place was packed when we walked in, but it was the kind of packed where it's a good sign!  It was warm and cozy with a positive energy in the air.  We put our name on the list and the hostess brought us both coffee.  Jared, being the aggressive guy he is, found us two seats at what Oak's considers their bar (I think), so we ended sitting there instead of waiting for a table.  Ice waters arrived immediately and the menu had all kinds of eggs, pancakes, waffles, French toast, and more.  I ordered the harvest (wheat) pancakes along with an egg white omelet - yes, they have egg whites too!  Jared went with the French toast and ate my hash browns.  Everything was served with melt in your mouth butter and syrup.  We cleaned our plates, it was that good!

Needless to say, we've agreed to add Oak's to the breakfast rotation.  If you don't mind the trek to Cave Creek, go check it out for yourself.  With a huge menu of items to choose from, there is something for everyone... kid friendly too!",2008-02-09 21:35:18

The restaurant was small and the decor was very plain and bare-bones. The service was excellent and attentive. Now onto the food - I felt that $65 for a tasting menu was a great deal, however I do agree with other Yelpers that it would have been nice to have fewer sharing plates and more individual plates. The plates were all very beautifully presented and I appreciated that the chef came out to talk to us a the end of the night. Some of the dishes were OUTSTANDING - these included the little Korean pancake amuse bouche, duck two ways, grilled octopus salad, and sticky pork ribs. The duck was really moist and flavourful, and the ribs were sooo delicious. Other dishes were a bit of a miss for me - I didn't love the eggplant, fish, or mille-feuile dessert. The rolled ice cream dessert was very cool, unique, and refreshing with interesting albeit slightly muted flavours (i.e. 9 grain).

Launched in Santa Barbara California in 1969 by two brothers, and since having spread to more than ten States with four locations dotting Las Vegas beginning in 2016, The Habit Burger Grill had been a source of some curiosity ever since opening down the street and some calling it the best burger under $5 in the city, Consumer Reports also awarding them the title of ""Best Tasting Burger in America"" back in 2014.

Slightly different from the hundreds of locations up and down California, the local Habits all franchise operations while those in California are considered 'corporate' entities, it was mid-day on Friday that a stop was made at the Blue Diamond location where the line was just two persons long, a man easily identifiable as the General Manager teaching employees how to work one of the register functions immediately greeting all guests with a big smile, the menu pretty self-explanatory with Burgers, Sandwiches, Salads, Shakes and Sides.

Using a vibrating pager system to summon diners, a similar situation to that at Shake Shack given the fact that each item is made to order, it was in passing on the Tri-Tip that is offered 'medium, medium-well, or well' that an order of two Sandwiches plus a side and Shake took place, the Charburger with Cheese complimentary and taken without Mayo as a result of signing up for their free online ""Char-club.""

Featuring a clean design and condiment station with all the expected, plus several styles of Peppers, a quick look at Beverages also shows Habit to offer their own housemade Lemonade alongside Coca-Cola products, a quick Buzz from the little square summoning diners back to the counter where a weighty tray contained everything presented nicely, a bit of paper left on the Straw and each Sandwich half-wrapped and Insta-gram worthy.

Starting with the Onion Rings, a relatively simple item for even a fast-food kitchen to execute well, The Habit improves on most by cutting their Rings uniform before dredging  them in Buttermilk and frying each one crisp, a total lack of oil making each one crunchy and flavorful, much like the well-seasoned Chicken Breast that is spiced, seasoned and breaded on site before being placed on a grilled bun with California-fresh Produce and a couple Pickle Rounds, the recommended Red Pepper Sauce a worthy addition to a Sandwich that not only outsizes and tastes better than that at Chick-Fil-a, but also makes the version at Shake Shack seem somewhat boring.

Moving on to the Charburger, only the second ""fast-food"" or ""quick-casual"" option tasted in almost a decade, those expecting a Restaurant quality Burger are likely to be a little disappointed by the thin patty that none-the-less contains a lot of flavor and good grind for just $3.25 and an extra sixty cents for a slice of Cheddar, the Caramelized Onions definitely adding a lot of 'oomph' without making the Sandwich too messy while the Milkshake served next to it unfortunately did little to be impressive, the 'Coffee' flavor substantially muted by that of Chocolate though the base was homogenous and quite creamy.

THREE AND A HALF STARS:  Good for what it is, and far better than most of what Panera or Chipotle is serving at a price that is far less, The Habit Burger Grill certainly takes a major step in upgrading the sort of stuff served at Burger King, McDonalds or Wendy's though the relatively small menu may leave those looking for more variety or bargain-basement dining unimpressed.",2017-04-16 15:06:05

My sister, nephew, and I went to Applebee's on Tuesday night for a quick bite to eat. We arrived around 6:45 pm and were told that it would be a few minute wait to be seated. Within a few minutes the hostess came by to seat us.

Our server greeted us promptly and told us she would be back in a few minutes to take our drink orders. Since we were short on time we had our entrée's selections ready when our server returned. We all ordered Pepsi to drink. My sister and I ordered the sirloin with a loaded mashed potatos and rice. My nephew had the classic burger with fries, and we shared honey  BBQ wings for an appetizer.

About 10 minutes passed, before our server brought our drinks to the table. The Pepsi tasted flat so we asked our server for a different drink selection, Sierra Mist. Another 10 minutes passed before  our server brought our soft drinks to the table, however the Sierra Mist was also flat. So we opted for water.

Another 12 or 15 minutes pass before our appetizer was brought to the table. The honey bbq wings were drenched in bbq sauce, soggy, and just didn't taste good.  We wait  some more, and finally our entrée's arrive.  I notice that the loaded mashed potato were not hot, but only a bit warm and the rice is crunchy and over cooked. The steak that I ordered medium rare is more like well done, dry, and lacked any seasoning. My sisters entree was as bad as mine and my nephews burger was absolutely dry and lacked and type of flavor.

Our server does not come back for quite some time. Again we are in a hurry.  I try to eat my meal, and I actually finished about 1/3 of my entree when I decided to just pay my bill and leave.

How rare is it in Vegas anymore to truly find a DEAL?!? This place was full of them!  So many wares, so little time! 

We stayed for three hours and would've stayed longer but it started to rain. Thats ok, we still had fun. 

There were tons of toy stands for our kids to keep them interested, plus a moonbounce and a mini buccaneer ride (pirate ship). $3 each and the moonbounce was a generous 15 minutes. 

There were a ton of food vendors. We chose a spot across from the bandstand, where lively music was playing. The kids each got a burger or hotdog for $1.50. They got chips and a drink. Then me and my friend split the bbq combo plate, which was 10.50, included ribs and bbq chicken AND 2 sides and was more than enough for both of us. 
$40 for 5 kids and 2 adults. A little under $6 each. Not too shabby!

More than anything I just really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was so much fun to find what was so similar to the flea markets of back east. I was grinning from ear to eat all day. 

And I didnt break the bank. The kids were free to get in, me & my friend were $1.50 each to get in, i gave my kids $5 each to spend, and they each got a few things and didnt even spend all their money. If it hadn't been raining and i didnt have kids with me i would've been able to hunt more, but i did get a video for $1, my friend got some CUTE clothes for $1 each, and i felt like it was a morning well spent.

Definately a good portion for $10 a plate, and even though I was told it wasnt spicy, seeing as Im a spice wipm, I didnt find it a bit hot...nonetheless, both dishes were fresh and the meat tender. Id like to go back and try the noodle dishes that seem popular. 
The best part of the Kingsland Market is the philosophy is that in order to sell it you had to have ""Make It, Bake It or Grow It"" which means there arent any middle men selling you product like the other markets. Im hoping this place will eventually expand to offer even more local product!",2012-02-13 17:10:57

They primarily offer western Chinese style barbecue cuisine. The seasonings for the lamb and animal organs are flavorful and I will say one of the best in Mississauga. However, the taste for the starters are not consistent. We had a dish of tried bean curd with celery for a few times. The taste were never the same. It was either too plain or too salty for the 2nd and 3rd time. If the cook can make sure that the taste is more closer for every visit, I will definitely recommend everyone to out this place more often. 

Another issue for this restaurant is the amount of waitresses. I think they are always short on staff. The owner is always busy at making the skewers, so left the only waitress to run back and forth to serve multiple tables a time. It is caused longer time to serve each table. Hopefully, they will be able to add another staff member to share the workload.

The O is one of those Pittsburgh things, one part mythical and one part mandatory.  It is one of those places that any and all Pittsburgher should try at least once before moving on.  Believe it or not, this is only my second time trying this place and I've lived and worked in the Burgh for over ten years now.  People are always complaining about how this place has a negative appeal, I just don't see it.  You may have some bad things happen here, but that can happen at any business in any part of the city.

The hot dogs them self are amazing.  So many different ways to have them topped.  And, they are cooked fresh right in front of you.  They are first cooked on the griddle and then right before they toss them in the bun to be topped to your liking, they put them on a grill to give them that char mark and a little bit of crispiness.  Biting into one of these masterpieces is close to heaven.  Once you bite through that casing, it's like full flavor in your mouth.  My latest visit I just opted for the boring (yet tasty) ketchup, mustard and onion on my dog.  I'm happy I opted for it this way.  The flavor combination above did not over power the dog.

I also got some of their fresh cut fries, a small, not that colossal fry that I knew I'd be eating for three days and they were just as good.  A note to people, they ask if you want salt on them instead of just putting it on there.  So for all those health conscious, low sodium eaters out there, that solves it for you.

A few other notes on this place.  They accept credit cards instead of being a cash only establishment.  There is extra seating on other floors.  There is a walk up window for the warmer months.  Limited bar experience here as well.  Six packs to go.

Enjoy your dog here, or take it to go.  It is truly a one of a kind Pittsburgh experience.",2014-01-29 00:50:19

Olive & Gourmando appeared to be a great option in the heart of where I wanted to putter around so I pointed my cab driver in this direction and away we went. When we pulled up in my cab I saw the long line of folks waiting outside and I grew immediately concerned. I just wanted something tasty but quick so I could get to wandering. Sure enough, the wait was about 30 minutes. But, lucky for me, since I was solo diner I was able to be seated right away at the window bar in the back of the restaurant.

It was super tight back there and not a lot of room to move, but it was quite alright because I wasn't there to linger anyway. I ordered a sandwich (The Pomme) and an iced tea and settled into my map to figure out where to go first. After a few minutes, my sandwich came out, smelling amazing and looking delicious. The Pomme is a panini of sorts filled with double smoked bacon, housemade walnut butter, sliced apples, garlic vinaigrette, and cheddar. So so good. It's also HUGE. I could only get through 2/3rds before calling it quits. FYI-- the bread gets super crispy from the toasting/press, and I totally cut up the roof of my mouth trying to wolf that thing down. No regrets, though! 

After I finished I cashed out and ordered a latte and a sweet treat at the coffee bar inside for the road. The pastries looked amazing and I almost bought a few to take with me but I didn't want to be bogged down with bags while sightseeing so I just got a chocolate turtle bar in the end. This was maybe my highlight of the trip here. I have a real sweet tooth and this did the trick. It had a layer of thick, dark ganache, followed by a layer of pecans mixed into a gooey rich caramel, followed by a buttery shorbread base holding it all together. Damn good. I wish I had gotten another one for later. Latte was also really well done.

We also fired the belgian waffle which was average, and fell right in line with the theme of this place.  

Unrelated rant:
This isn't a complaint about Cafe South in particular, but why are belgian waffles so damn expensive??? $4-6 for some batter that costs the place somewhere in the neighborhood of about $0.05 - $0.10 to make.  And God forbid you put some whipped cream on top, with strawberry syrup, or potentially a sprinkling of chocolate chips.....BACK UP THE F'n BRINK'S TRUCK at that point, bc this mixture of flour and water is going to run you about $12!  Stop laughing, Pancakes....bc this applies to you, too, you consistently overpriced syrup delivery system! It's time we knocked waffles/pancakes down a peg.  Far more creativity goes into making a cinnamon raisin bagel, then throwing some batter on a hot surface and spraying it with whipped cream, but we don't bow down to it and pay $5 for the chance to eat it.

The salads are hearty, though not huge. They make their soups fresh and the ones I've had have been very good. My fiance likes the BBQ pork ribs, and I mix it up. The lobstah roll and fish sammich are yummy. If you go here and neglect to order the church potatoes as a side....just don't. 

Service is as expected--a motley crew of young--ish hipster types who don't mind chatting but will leave you alone if you're not into it.

The food was delicious and all of us ordered something different to all sample as one. I had Steak and Shrimp along with the Spicy Hibachi Chicken. My mom had colossal shrimp and my sister had the seaside trio. 

It can get pricey if you just order what looks good w/o looking at its price, however sometimes you have to spend a little to EAT GOOD! lol.

The fried rice and our chefs vegetables also hit the spot ! Overall really impressive place to eat for a birthday or special occasion.

I did the shrimp again bc it was good last time. No flavor and the heads. Omg. Last time there were no heads. I couldn't eat them. I felt so sick. Wish our server offered the option, wish she actually paid attention, no water refills. I remember gloves last time. Sad bc I liked this place and was excited but will NOT be back. This was my reply:
I'm so very sorry that you had a disappointing experience on the 4th. I'd like to ask a couple of questions to see how we can fix this for future visits. First, do you remember the name of your server? Did you ask to speak to a manager during your visit? Do you remember what we were out of that night?

I would also like to state a couple of items about our service so we are all on the same page. Our shrimp boil is head-on. We don't routinely offer head-off, but we do have it available upon request for an additional $2 per pound. Gloves are also not automatic, but are offered if our Pacific Rim sauce is ordered, or if you as a guest specifically ask for them.

Regarding the lack of attention at your table, that is inexcusable, and we will address it immediately when you provide the name or a description of your server. I have copied the General Manager of the Ahwatukee location as well as one of the owners on this email.

Thank you for your candor. We can't get better if we don't know where we are weak. I appreciate your honest feedback.

My friends and I had been dying to try this place.  We met last night, and started with a drink at the bar.  They had cocktails, and I had a glass of white sangria -- it was pretty good, not fantastic.  The bartender was really nice, and pretty darn cute too (this wasn't the Scottish guy -- which I was sort of hoping to see -- I'm a total sucker for the accent).

We ordered the guacamole, which is truly divine.  Chunky, with a good amount of cilantro.  It comes on a bed of cabbage and some a radishes.  My friends thought that was kind of weird, but I thought it was good!  The chips were good, and they came with these weird sort of pinwheel-y things.  I didn't care for them, but my friends liked them.

We decided to get a few things for dinner and just share them.  We moved from the bar to our table and ordered the seafood tacos.  They were spectacular!  The fish and shrimp were tender and delicious.  We all raved!

Next, we got the carnitas.  The pork was so delicious.  It had a lot of carmelized bits, which are of course my favorite part.  There was a bit of fat on it, which I had to pull off....  Blech.....  But it was so good, I didn't mind the fat removal.  They were served with black beans and rice or veggies and corn tortillas.  I would absolutely recommend this to anybody.  

It was around this time that the service REALLY got annoying.  The server and bussers kept coming by to see what they could clear from the table.  Literally they came by THREE times in ten minutes.  And it's not as if there was a huge queue at the hostess stand, and there were a few open tables.  So why the pushiness?  Did they NOT want us to stay and order more drinks?  Apparently not.  

My friend really wanted to try the green chile tamales.  So she ordered those, and they were good, but I was in no way WOWED.  After bringing those out, they came by again another two times to clear.  Finally we just gave in and told them to clear the table!  Fine ya bastards, take our plates!

Another point to make -- the food came out incredibly quickly -- which was nice at FIRST, but after the pushiness of the server and bussers, it just made us feel like they were trying to turn the tables and just get us out of there.

I will definitely come back because the food was delicious.  My friends and I all commented about how interesting their menu was -- there were many different things we all hoped to try in the future.  Maybe last night's pushiness was a fluke.

After the first of the year I decided I was going to eat six protein packed meals a day. In Scottsdale for a recent work gathering I packed some fruit in my bag to help me get the day started off on the right note. A day in to my stay and HI, I downed a banana, and rather than put the slippery peel in the garbage can so housekeeping would have to wipe out the can, I placed it on a dirty napkin and next to some dirty silverware I used the day prior. I returned to the hotel at about 5:15 and much to my surprise the banana peel was still there. Odd. Right? I went down to the desk, asked whether or not the rooms get ""cleaned"" or if housekeeping just changes the sheets...towels...etc...and she said that it was weird that somebody wouldn't remove the peel, napkin, and silverware. On my way out to dinner she said she'd alert housekeeping and I was on my merry way. Back from dinner and drinks it's certain to be gone, right? Nope. Still there. Slept through night, asked again in the morning, and I was told housekeeping leaves at a certain time so it was likely they left for the day. To which I thought, send someone else! Not pleased.

In addition, my room  was really loud, had a stale almost mildewy sort of odor and wasn't too impressive compared to other places I've stayed in Scottsdale.

A recent gathering of friends brought me to the 'original location' in beautiful Little Italy. I was excited to find out if this location offered the same quality of food or if there was a notable difference in any way.

The first thing I noticed was that this location is probably half the size of the Laval location. The decor is about the same and it promotes a warm and intimate environment, ideal for a date or special occasion with a significant other.

I went with their polpetta (meatball drenched in tomato sauce and Italian herbs), a marinara pizza as a main and for dessert their Nutella pizza!

The polpetta is so underappreciated I can't help to recommend it to everyone I eat here with. Sure, the price-tag of $4 per meatball is off-putting but trust me... try it. It's perfect and it will leave you wanting for more. In some ways it was so good it sometimes overshadows the main course for me. Thinking about it right now makes me drool...

I'd go here and order 5 of them and just leave a happy man.

I went with their marinara pizza and while it was good I will freely admit I was somewhat disappointed but it. I expect my pizza to maximize.the space in my plate with a perfect crust ratio and for some reason my pizza was somewhat deformed. It wasn't round but more so leaf shaped? Furthermore, the crust was too thick which left me less tomato/igredient goodness in the middle to enjoy. I enjoy the crust but I'd recommend better preparation.

For dessert we shared the Nutella pizza and it was sublime. Thankfully it was properly prepared being perfectly round with little crust to deal with. 

Price-tag is a little high but it's worth it.

Overall I enjoyed it but I much prefer the Laval location for a variety of reasons.

This is take-out only; there is no place to sit!  Not a problem, just be aware.  There is plenty of parking, so it's easy to swing by and carry out.

The pulled-pork is just right.  It has a slightly sweet, smokey flavor, and is very moist.  They mix the pork well, so you'll get some stringy inside bits and some slightly charred ""bark"" outer bits, too, which I like.

Their sides are excellent as well:  The baked beans have a mix of bean types, and a bit of hot ""bite"" in the mix.  The beans are not over cooked to mush like some BBQ places do.

The corn-bread is very good, too.  It is NOT sweet corn-bread (some BBQ places do sweet corn-bread that's more like a corn muffin).  It is dense and heavy, but just tastes great.

My most recent meal was butternut squash ravioli in a walnut cream sauce.  Yum.  The pastries are always calling to me - especially that flower-shaped chocolate chip scone.  My fiance doesn't know what a scone is, but that chocolate chip one has him wanting to find out.  The breakfast menu looks scrumptious and I will definitely come in the morning to check it out once I can finally remember (other than when I am there for lunch or dinner and see the breakfast menu and then remind my fiance, again, that we need to go there for b-fast.).  It's a vicious cycle.  My only complaint is that it can get super busy and with one area for drinks, it can get a little chaotic, especially if there are some slow folks or parents with bratty kids.  I have found the later you go, the less chance of bratty kids, which is always a plus in my book.  Hopefully earlier will prove to be the same.  Lunch hour can be a beast when it comes to finding a table, but well worth it once you find one.  The sandwiches are generously portioned and all of the prices are reasonable.  Two people can definitely eat dinner for around $15-$20.",2008-02-25 21:38:02

My mom and I came here because of the stellar reviews and we were super excited to come here. I'll start with the positives, it's very clean, the service was great, and the atmosphere of the place seemed good even if it's located in a not-so great area of Mesa. 

However, the menu is not that special. And to be honest with you, I don't understand why people would come here for overpriced dim sum items that taste the exact same thing as going to Mekong or Phoenix Palace. As a matter of fact, they only have a limited option of dim sum items that literally is double the price of those previously mentioned restaurants. 

We ordered around four dishes, mostly cause they seemed super expensive. We ordered the shu mai, the chicken feet, the bbq pork buns (char siew bao) and soup dumplings! 

Then chicken feet were so normal, kinda smaller than other places. The bbq pork buns were tiny and dried out. The soup dumplings broke right when we tried to grab one, the flavor was good but the skin seemed dried out. The shu mai actually tasted pretty good. Nice and hot, and better than other places that I've been to. 

Overall, yeah I feel bad for giving this place 3 stars but it's not what the reviews say. It's overpriced for generic to lower quality dim sum items that you can get on the weekend. I wouldn't recommend coming here again. Just go to Mekong or Phoenix palace for dim sum. Go to Chiou's kitchen for soup dumplings.",2018-03-01 00:53:06

This RR location is conveniently located right across from the Peoria Sports Complex, making it a great spot to grab some food and drinks before seeing my San Diego Padres show off their skills during Spring Training.  

While RR is known for their burgers (and they looked really good!), I chose the Chicken Caesar Wrap.  Maybe this wasn't the best idea.  The first half was very tasty, with a nice balance of chicken, parmesan and caesar dressing all wrapped in a spinach tortilla.  However, the second half was lacking a key ingredient - the chicken!  It was bite after bite of lettuce.  Lettuce, lettuce, lettuce.  I should have ordered a burger.  I consoled myself by continuing to consume fries.  Glorious fries.

The staff is friendly and attentive - our waitress Jazmin took great care of us - fry basket and beer glasses were never empty.  I would have mentioned the lack of chicken in my wrap, but after all those fries, it really didn't matter.  I am sure she would have corrected the issue though, with a smile.

It has all of the elements necessary for a ""go to"" spot:

Good drinks: My favorites are the Black and White Frost, Mint Mocha Frost, and Deadly Soda. 

Good Customer Service: The baristas are always cheerful, very quick, and sometimes a bit quirky

Nice enough indoor seating: It isn't plush, at all. But, there always seems to be enough seating, and the groupings of tables and chairs are varied enough that there is generally space to comfortably seat groups of any size (from tables of 2 for my hubby and I to a banquette table that we could squish 8 people into if needed)

Free Internet Access with the purchase of a drink: When you buy your drink, you can ask for a code to log onto the internet. It is good for 3 hours. I can't imagine complaining about 3 hours of free internet - if you've sat in the restaurant for 3 hours, its time to buy another drink anyway. Their process is painless and the connection is always decent, unlike other ""free internet"" places where you are subject to a limited amount of bandwidth that can be taken up by squatters who aren't buying anything and are streaming videos, music, etc for hours on end. 

Loyalty Card: You know the drill - you get a card, they stamp it, you get a free drink eventually. Its nice to have and is an incentive for me to return to Coffee Rush locations instead of hitting up a competitor.

There are a few things that are just okay - namely, the pastry selection and the patio.

The pastry selection is pretty disappointing. I got a muffin once and it was just sort of crumbly and average. The things in the case don't really ever look very good and aren't your typical coffee shop fare - think storebought cheesecake and baklava instead of muffins, breakfast breads, croissants, etc.

The patio is actually quite nice - spacious, shaded, has misters, plenty of seating, lots of plug ins for laptops, etc. However, they allow smoking out there and so, being a non-smoking asthmatic, I unfortunately can't comfortably spend time out there. My wish is that they would either a) disallow smoking, which I realize isn't likely or b) have two separate patios - a smoking patio and a non-smoking patio, preferably on opposite sides of the building. For the moment, I just stay inside, which is generally just fine since its 100 degrees or more outside anyway.

I can definitely recommend Coffee Rush! Check it out :)

DISCLAIMER: I am not a coffee snob. I barely drink coffee at all, but I DO drink coffee at Coffee Rush, so take that as you will.",2012-07-09 05:55:41

Good value

Cons:
Not too much variety

Came by here for a Saturday afternoon lunch.  Pepper Wok is your standard HK style cafe. It's not the best, but it's not the worst.  You will get good value for your money though.  

Pepper Wok is a pretty small place.  They manage to fit 8-10 tables in there but if it's busy, expect to wait a little bit. Looking at the menu, they have a lot of categories, but not many items per category.  It's a pretty bis menu page wise, but in the end, there's not too many items to choose from.  There are daily specials to choose from and those are the only ones that will come with a drink.  Anything else, and you'll have to pay full price for the drink.

I ordered the baked chicken on rice with mushroom sauce and my GF ordered the baked fish on spaghetti with cream sauce.  An egg sandwich was also ordered for my little one.  The food comes out pretty quick after you order.  The dishes were all pretty well done and had good portions for the price.  It was an enjoyable meal throughout.  I'm used to HK style cafes now offering a drink with any entree purchase so I missed having a drink with my entree.  It's not a deal breaker, but something noteworthy.

The service here was pretty standard, nothing of note to mention.  Basically, my visit here seemed to follow that theme here.  It's not too noteworthy, nothing special, nothing horrible. 

If I'm in the area and feel like HK style cafe food, I would definitely consider Pepper Wok a good option.  As I said, you can probably find better, but you also can't go wrong here too.",2016-05-13 11:51:07

The gag gifts, magic tricks and fake poo. The black lights and psychedelic posters. Certainly all of that played a part.

There are a lot of those things in here and shame on my parents for letting me come in here!

These days it's all the same. Lots of holiday-specific items. Gifts and tchotchkes that you never knew you needed. Fandom t-shirts, mugs, shot glasses, wallets, stickers, lanyards, posters and on and on. For anime and popular shows. There are piercings for about any place one can go on your body. In the back, as ever, there's lots of lingerie, toys and raunchier gag gifts. (Furry handcuffs anybody?) In the end it just amazes me that this store keeps kicking.

So much food to the point where the waiter had to give us an extra table and we had to ask them to slow down the orders. 

They gave us the option to sit either outside at the patio or inside towards the back where they sit on a bench and you have to take off your shoes. The patio would have been nice but unfortunately it was a little cold at night so we opted for I door seating. 

First thing I noticed was that it was EXTREMELY loud and I would have to yell even if I was trying to speak to the person in front of me. The servers and waiters would yell things I did not understand when people walked in or out and there were many birthday celebrations. 

The food was delicious but some portions I found a tad small for the price that we paid for. I would however, come back once every so often.

I tried a few flavours including the smoked eggplant and tahini, turkish delight with rose, coconut and clementine, but my favourite thus far is peanut butter croissant.  You can taste croissant bits, which I know may sound odd, but is really really good!

I don't work in Cabbagetown so getting there was a journey in itself. I'm glad that Murgatroid offers an online ordering system and it does a good job of predicting when the food would be ready by. The only downfall is that dine-in options offer more of a variety whereas the take-out menu is limited. Someone called me after my order to alert me that taxes will have to be paid out in cash and luckily I had some change on me even though I was already on my way. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the staff and he clarified the orders with me because they didn't get a confirmation email on their end. Just a minor issue. The restaurant offers a homey feeling and is stocked with some board games on the side (hopefully guests can play those too). I'll talk about the food later but I hope they can do delivery in the future!

I find it interesting that Murgatroid's specialty is in making everything from scratch; it is not that common in Toronto. You can take a look at their website and read how they primarily use local produce and other things. Unless I'm clueless, I would love to know other restaurants that do what Murgatroid does as well. I have to say that my favourite thing out of the take-out order is the squash soap. Simple yet tasty. The cookies and cinnamon rolls were okay for their prices but I've had better. The Murgatroid sandwich was a little cold by the time I got back to my office but it still tasted pretty fresh. The crispy chicken skin was a pleasant surprise and I would never have guessed what it was until my friends read the site's description.

I'm looking forward to trying this place again for brunch and hopefully I can give a better critique about the rest of their food.",2015-04-11 03:09:51
vljS8vcTlZhUG9DX9PZzDg,RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,3,19,12,13,"They (countless Internet people with sexy six-pack abs I follow on Twitter & Instagram) say that the secret to having a six-pack abs is not the workout sessions at the gym, but mostly (let's say 75%) because of what you eat.  With that said, all the gym rats and fitness minded folks with goals of obtaining or maintaining their six-packs, you do not have to avoid the SLS Buffet... on your cheat day.

The rest of the people that are normal (even extra normal) and more well rounded (pun intended) in the waistline department, come as often as you like (Note: You can earn 2 complimentary SLS Buffet passes with 500 slot points).  Having a few meals here will definitely help you maintain your corpulent rotundness, making you just that much more beloved by Jenny Craig. 

So I know I been watching what I eat recently. So if it wasn't for the SLS grand opening and the ""obsession?"" to check out new places and leave a trail blazer report for the rest of the Yelp Pals, my better judgement would have grounded me and kept me on my granola with dried blueberries diet.  But I suck at being rational when it comes to food and women. So here I am at home now, writing my review.

First of all, SLS being the latest casino property to open to the general public in LV (as of Aug 23, 2014), with nice modern facelift to update what used to be the Sahara, of course has a modern looking buffet.  It is not huge or fancy like Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it is still way better than the one at the Palms.  On opening weekend, the dinner is $40.  So it is not cheap. But still in the same ballpark as the rest of the also ran buffet contenders.

The dining area and also the serving stations look pretty good.  The decorations seems (okay, not gonna sugar coat it), is half complete for the serving stations.  The shelves above is only decorated on about 60% of the buffet (Asian dim sum section to just past the mid point (carving station). Not sure if it was a budget thing, or not getting in all the decorations elements (enameled cast iron cookware), but the bulk of the decoration is noticeably lopsided. Not a big thing, and will not affect the quality of the food served, but it is just one of those attention to details thing.  The seats and tables in the dining area is comfortable and spaced well, so you do not feel cramped or boxed in (Good job!).

The buffet has the usual snow crab legs, some fresh clams, cooked shrimp, prime rib carving station (prime rib was good), dessert station (it is a large island of baked goods, not too much variety though, with some special highlights I will discuss later), a large Asian & dim sum section.  But overall I was not really impressed.  No serious WOW factor. But it is not terrible either.  Pretty A-Okay,with definite room for easy & significant improvements.

Let me cover what I do like about this buffet.

* Layout of the savory stations is straight forward. No lines per say to wait, just go in for the prize, wherever you see what caught your gleaming eyes.
* Plenty of large plates on the bottom shelf for you to pick up and pile on your build your own feast.
* Small portions available for self service, which is refreshed with newer back ups. So you get fairly fresh dishes throughout your meal.
* The line was very short. Hardly any wait, but you do have to look for the buffet or wonder successfully to this part of the SLS property.

* Fresh fried doughnuts tossed in cinnamon sugar. [Highlight of the meal]

* Dried Blueberries [Not sure what you would eat this with, but I was happy to just snack on these plain]
* Sushi was fresh.
* Pastas are all good.
* Gelato was tasty & serving was generous (compared to all the buffets I tried further south of SLS).

Could be better:

* Crepe maker's skill is really at the novice of novice level.  I think he is dreading it, and it shows in the final odd shaped product. The batter is spread thin and overcooked in sections, while thick and under-cooked in others.
* Crepe station ingredients are not stored properly for service or needs to be reformulated. (Chocolate and Nutella are so thick you can't portion it let alone make designs with them. Mixing it with 10% oil or holding it at higher temperature (melting point) would make more sense.
* Dim Sum section has great variety but sometimes you just like a lot of shumai (just an example). So should I leave with 3 bamboo steaming baskets or just consolidate right there.
* Dim sum portions for some items seems too big (chicken feet, the steam buns), I know I opted out, since I don't want to waste food.
* Steamed Basmati rice was dried and crusty. Maybe smaller portions is better or have a cover for it.
* Dessert selections is fairly limited. It looks full, but the same desserts are scattered on almost all sides of the large dessert island.

For $40 (weekend dinner) I thought it was okay, and worth checking out for the sake of checking it out (even some SLS employees agreed).  $30 is a no brainer. $35 is a toss up. 3 stars!",2014-08-24 05:44:14

Hey, why you laughing? I'm not laughing. This isn't funny.

Alright, alright, alright. Enough already! Damn! Sue me, okay? I'll admit, Skillets has grown on me. The joint's become one of my go-to breakfast spots, which has come as a massive surprise for me.

I gotta give it up for their pancakes. Big, thick, generously slathered with whatever toppings you choose - I always opt for the blueberries. Pancakes always go well with bacon, and their thick-cut bacon is yummy. Recently I had their french toasts. Equally as delicious, and I'm not a big fan of the french toast. But, what the hey...

Their service is still a touch slow, owing to their popularity. I suppose the secret's out about Skillets; it was even busy on Labor Day!

The potato itself was delicious and the salmon as well. I loved that they didn't serve the brown salmon parts which I dislike because of the strong fishy taste. 
The mains and sides are ordered separately hence the price quickly adds up!  I ordered the seafood stew with mussels and squid in a tomato broth. It was hearty and pleasing!

I didn't use them, but hey it's the thought that counts.   

An outdoor swap meet, this one is a mix between vendors and your garage sale type sellers.  From the outside this place looks average sized, but once you're in it can be a beast to get through every aisle.  You will find your mix of different merchandise ranging from household products to tools, electronics to toys, and a bunch of clothing.  This swap meet also has a bunch of eats.  There's a small admision here, ranging from $.50 to $2.  Not sure what the exact admission really is.  My last 3 visits, I paid for myself and whoever is behind me (stranger or not).    

One issue here is parking.  Don't get me wrong.  There's tons of parking, just a lot more people.  My advice, get here around 8 AM or after 2 PM.  Come here around noon and you'll spend the next 30 minutes driving around looking for that empty spot.

What time we arrived/Wait time?
We arrived at 7pm on a Friday. We made reservations for summerlicious in advance. There wasn't a huge line anyways when we got there but it was still quite busy.

Atmosphere?
The atmosphere was just like a regular pub. We loved the open windows and feel of the place! Very hip with large tv screens playing music videos. It was a fun environment. The bar is right smack in the middle of the place and the servers are all running around.

Service/Staff?
The servers were great! Very polite and knowledgable about the food and drinks. The food came quickly and always asked for refills and took away plates quickly as well.

Food/Menu?
We started with the karaage chicken and salmon sashimi. The karaage chicken was well seasoned and tasted so cool! The flavours were a mix of asian and western flavours. The salmon sashimi was good but nothing to die for. The toppings of the seasoning didn't play together well. Next for our entrees we got the truffle mac and cheese and ""the rib"". The truffle mac and cheese was heavy on the truffle. The rib was good but a lot of fatty pieces. Overall, all the plates were pretty small and miniature.

Located on the west side, Lahaina Grill caters to the locals of Summerlin and the surrounding area.  The 24 hour sushi is no longer available but they do still serve it up until 4am.

Lots of special rolls to choose from on their menu...one of my favorites, the Lahaina Special (of course.)  They also have a happy hour sushi menu that is quite an excellent value.  

The interior is unique (in a good way) with a tropical setting and the restaurant is clean.  There is a full bar with video poker machines built in, a sushi bar (no machines) and plenty of table seating throughout.  There's also a private room that can be reserved for meetings and parties that is sealed off with big windows and doors so you can be as loud and rowdy as you want without disturbing other patrons.  I miss my old company's monthly meetings in there.  I really enjoyed being able to order sushi at 9am on a weekday during a business meeting or rolling in at 3am after a night of partying craving sushi.

The tamales are on another level in my opinion, and it's all about the sauce. The corn filling is also a little sweet and it balances nicely with the spiciness of the dish. Pork tenderloin was well executed but it didn't blow my mind like the tamales. They also do a mean brunch tostada.

I wish I was wanting to write to rave because I have liked it so much in the past. 

Tonight's was lackluster for me.  Sigh.  Ordered an entrée of 2 tacos -- one pork with some pineapple thrown in and one beef. Sounds good to me!  I always and I mean always like marinated shredded pork in Mexican restaurants.  Until now, that is.  It wasn't shredded.  It was little pork cubettes -- hard cubettes and without a marinated flavor I was expecting and ittsy bitsy pineapple pieces.  Not impressed.  And the beef?  meh..  And they were over-filled by a lot, meaning they weren't conducive to picking up and eating without having them make a mess.  I know I have liked the tacos in the past but think I ordered the mini tacos then.

Oh, well, the company was good as we met an out-of-town guest and enjoyed ourselves being in the Strip district, nonetheless.  The margaritas were good and my past visits were more memorable, thus 3 and not 2 stars this go-round.

As a side note, I've ordered from Reyna's outdoors setup on the street.  Those tacos and I believe the mini tacos at Casa Reyna were far better and a total delight.  Now I'm remembering why.  They were not overstuffed with ingredients and had cilantro.  Yes!!! Cilantro is what made them some of my all time favs.  But, tonight?  The overstuffed tacos were not a delight and were not in any way shape or design reminiscent of those and I can't recall any hint of cilantro.  What gives?",2016-11-04 20:02:11

I want to like this place- it has a great aesthetic, I love the garage door style windows that can open up and really ventilate the place and allow you to enjoy the outside even though they don't have a patio, and the bank vault downstairs is fun. 
I've been here for drinks a few times, and the drinks are awesome. They change up their cocktail menu fairly frequently, and I haven't had a bad one yet. The tap list is usually interesting and they have a few decent wines.
I don't think I'll be coming back for food though. I ate at Lucille this summer and everything save my one cocktail was disappointing. And, I actually ordered a second cocktail, but it never came to the table, although they did try to charge me for it at the end of the meal.
We had two appetizers to start. The cheese curds were decent. The Artichoke dip app was sad; the dip itself tasted fine even though it wasn't quite hot, but the tortilla chips served with it were downright inedible. They had seemingly been cooked in cold oil, absorbing the poor quality (maybe old) oil making them soft in some places, greasy all over and tasting very stale. 
We had a Detroit style pizza that was very lack luster. I mean, it's pizza, so it was edible, but it's not something I would choose to eat again. The crust was kinda chewy, but not in a good way. The cheese was very bland, they would be better off using Wisconsin brick cheese- higher fat content and more flavor than mozzarella. Sauce was unremarkable. The toppings were fresh and good though.
Service over all was poor. I try to give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt, I don't know everything that's happening in the restaurant while I'm there, but I barely saw her unless she was walking quickly past my table without even glancing our way.

So I came here on a Thursday night which is ladies night (50 cent drinks) before 11. And there was a DJ, people were dancing lively and the dance floor had enough room to two step but wasn't a ghost town - just the right balance. The dance floor is very large by the way, great plus. 

The music was a nice mix of hip hop and country in case you can't two step (although you're in a country bar). I like the mix, I think I would get tired of hearing country all day (like at Whiskey Row in Old Town). 

Unfortunately I didn't come here for the food, so I have no idea what it's like, just came to dance with some friends. Maybe I'll come back to try it. 

The bartenders are attentive which is another plus. The crowd is interesting, definitely a mix of young and old. Since it was ladies night Thursday night, there were a lot of ladies for the night. Sort of unusual for a late scene at a bar, but I guess that's why ladies night is implemented to bring us on in, and it works. :P  

The bathrooms were great, many many stalls - no lines, no wait! And they were very clean. :)

The patio was sort of packed, but there's a lot of free seating inside and out so that's a plus unlike at nightclubs where it's 100% VIP only.

The room was crowded, and the tables were too close together; this created a hectic atmosphere which was not very pleasant for dinner. Most people were wearing fairly fancy clothing up to and including full suits.

The waiter tried to push drinks on us fairly heavily and then proceeded to go over the ridiculously long list of ""daily specials."" I've never heard a specials list as long as the one here - it must have taken the waiter at least a half an hour to memorize it. Note that I don't view this as a positive aspect - while it's great to have specials, having this many is a sign that something is amiss. We decided to just go for the menu.

The bread they provided as an appetizer was excellent, although strangely the butter was served in little packets rather than just in a butter dish. The appetizer salads which came as part of the entrées were basically inedible because they drenched them with so much salad dressing. I got the mixed seafood in green sauce, and while it was decent, I felt that the sauce was too salty and overpowering. My dinner partner's dish was similarly salty and not too exciting. The mixed vegetables which came out were also overdone, and too drenched in some sort of sauce.

Overall, the best part of the meal was the bread which is kind of sad. The other food wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't very good. My overall impression of the place was that they were trying just a little too hard, but not quite making it. Certainly for the price, I don't think it's worth it.",2012-01-17 03:22:40

Orient House has gone through a few ownership changes and remodels over the last decade.  We haven't visited for awhile since their traditional and American-Chinese menu items seemed to have fallen off.  But a strong lunch yesterday encouraged me to come back tonight for dinner.  So glad we did. 

Dinner for three of us was:

1.  Chicken and Corn Soup--think egg drop soup with pieces of minced chicken and corn.  Nice.  Menu says it serves two but there was plenty for the three of us.  Do it.

2.  Pan Fried Scallion Pancake--Scallions encased in a light fried pancake (approx. 10"").  It is has a delicate flavor, is crunchy, dense and yet still somewhat light.  Pretty good.   Do it.

3.  Shredded Pork In Sweet Barbecue Sauce-- slices of braised pork in a lightly sweet sauce on a bed of fresh julienned scallions.  Fresh and tasty.  Little too sweet for my tastes.  For fans of sweet and sour sauces, do it.

4.  Stir Fried Eggplant With Garlic and Ground Pork--Perfectly sautéed eggplant and minced pork in a garlicky spicy, sweet and tangy sauce.  Definitely do it!

5.  Tofu with Chili and Spicy Salt--the highlight for me.  Cubes of fresh tofu and pieces of onion and bell pepper flash fried and then sprinkled with some kind of spicy salt.  The tofu has a light outside crunch with a tender pillowy inside.  The  different textures of the fried tofu coupled with the spicy salt and a light trace of the frying oil makes this a sublime treat. Complex in its simplicity, it evidences just how unique, diverse and special Chinese cuisine can be if we would only order it!.  Although I love me some American-Chinese as much as the next guy--General Tso's chicken anyone!--those dishes can sometimes too easily distract us from going outside our comfort zones and trying more traditional-styled dishes.  This one is a good place to start.  Double do it!

Orient House has a good variety of American and traditional dishes which should satisfy everyone.  There is also a good selection of noodle dishes, appetizers and dim sum, too!  Also--and I appreciate the particular attention to this detail--our pot of hot tea was served FULL and HOT (love it)...not half-full and tepid (hate it).

We had plenty of food for leftovers.  Including rice and tea (always fun fortune cookies, too)  and before tax and tip, our feast for three was just south of $50.  

Pro tip:  Lunch seems a particular value.  They have a nice lunch menu for $7.95!  Yesterday, I had the shredded pork with preserved Szechuan picked vegetables off of the traditional lunch portion of their menu.  It was great!  Dining pal had a good old fashioned massive plate of chicken broccoli, fried rice, crab rangoons and an egg roll.  Both entrees, yup, $7.95.  See, something for everyone.  Fun for the whole family!

The space is clean, well-lit, and inviting. There is a single step to enter so those in a wheelchair may need some assistance up.  But once in, there is good room to move about for our mobility challenged friends. The space is pretty good sized and can accommodate larger groups.  They have at least three large round tables with lazy susans for traditional family style dining.  We saw a couple groups of 8 - 10 at these tables having a great time!

There is on-street parking and on the side of the building.

When there tonight--6:30 on Friday--it was pretty busy with diners and take out orders being filled.  Still, we were noticed, seated and given menus promptly.  Water and tea were slow to arrive and we had to ask a few times.  But this was understandable given the crowd and that there were only two servers.  But the servers were working hard and moving non-stop between large and small groups and always doing so politely and with a smile.  All said, pretty admirable!  So no worries.

Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.  I am so glad to have revisited Orient House and so happy to have them again amongst my fave Chinese places in Mad-Town.  Looking forward to returning.

Finally a place outside the strip that blends perfectly atmosphere, food and service in Las Vegas! Gotta love it!

Atmosphere 4/5: Comfy chairs, they even have a sofa. The place is nice and looks new. It's not French touch but it's modern and different from other places! Quiet with some good music in background and you have the perfect mix for a good atmosphere. 
Food 5/5: I tried the Quiche Lorraine and the Bleu Brie Sandwich and it was awesome! I loved it! The Bleu Brie sandwich matched perfectly the taste of sweet (with the slices of apple) and sour ( with Bleu cheese)! Yes PERFECT!
Service 5/5: Service is excellent. The lady made sure to ask me that everything was alright even it's not a waiter service kind of place! Making sure that your customer is happy is their principal goal and you can feel it!

Although, once again Yelp is doing us all a disservice by not offering half ratings.  

Let me put it into perspective. On it's own. As a stand alone casino, I'd tend to go lower and rate a three. Its very bright and very basic, but then you stop and look around and you notice that the entire casino wasn't built to compete with 'new' Vegas. It was built for the families. Along with cowboys and cowgirls who are a bit more traditional and are looking for more of a place to 'enjoy' with family and friends rather than 'blow it out' in the club. It's with this achievement in mind that the fourth star is justified. A variety of family friendly restaurants, bowling, movie theatre and arcade offer the proper dose of family 'quality-time' 

My only real complaints are that the spa is $30, if a $20 doesn't do it, I would think from the moment I walked in, someone would be rubbing my feet.

We had the Dungeness crab, a pound of shrimp, and a pound of mussels with the Urban Mix sauce. That is a lot of food for the price and should be enough to feed 4 people. When they brought it out, they had it in a bag which most Creole seafood restaurants do but then they pour it in a pan. I thought it was easier to pick out your food that way than digging into a plastic bag. Everything was so fresh and flavorful! We also had their fried oysters which were bigger than a chicken nugget. Twice bigger in size than what we get from Boiling crab.  Just so plump and juicy! It was only $8.99 and comes with fries. 

The server that we had was so friendly and efficient. She kept checking up on us and refilling our drinks and and making sure we had enough limes for our dipping sauce. I have to have my lime, salt, and pepper   She also gave us free ice cream for dessert.

I do my best to avoid them because you always get the same service and food....and sometimes that's NOT a good thing. 

Case in point...The Red Robin.

We went to Red Robin at Arrowhead this week and it was blah at best. We live near the Red Robin on Bell road just west of Litchfield Rd which is crap at best, but we happened to be near the mall and went here instead. 

We went with a group of 6 of us. Our server was standard and did the bare minimum. Most of us ordered burgers, except my son who always orders the chicken fingers. It's a kid thing. I prefer not to eat red meat unless I'm going to a high end steak restaurant so I ordered a Guacamole Bacon Burger with a turkey patty. I don't know why I do this to myself because 99% of the time, it's a frozen turkey patty that is so overly salted it's practically inedible and that's pretty much how this one was too.  Normally I get the Red Robin Gourmet burger with a turkey patty and I'm fortunate enough that all the toppings mask the flavor of the patty. Not so much with the Guacamole burger. Now, you would expect that on a guacamole burger, there would be a good amount of guac on the burger since you probably aren't putting ketchup, mustard, etc on the burger. Not so. It was a chinzy amount of guac with 2 fatty slices of bacon on top of an over salted turkey patty. All this for under $10...lucky me.

Now, I don't know what's going on at Red Robin lately, but they used to give you a substantial amount of steak fries in the plastic basket of fun. The last couple times I've been, I get like 5 fries and then I have to ask for more which takes way too long and I'm ready for the check by the time they come out. I'm glad the fries are unlimited, but give me enough to work with if you aren't going to wow me with your lack of stellar service.

Now the one thing I really do enjoy about RR is the freckled lemonade. It's tasty, cold, and most of the time it comes out in neat twisted glasses. I say most of the time because they don't ever have enough twisted glasses clean to keep the glass consistent with the beverage. By the time I'm ready for my 3rd glass, I'm getting the basic soda cup. Gee. thanks.

So, I'll keep going back to RR because my son enjoys it and because I'm clearly a glutton for punishment. But that doesn't mean I gotta like it.",2009-01-25 04:50:48

I tried their yakisoba and as far as cheap Asian-y takeout-y noodles go, I can't believe I'm saying this, Chopstix does it better. It's edible though so whatever. Lol.

Their sushi rolls were a huge disappointment :c. I got the Palatine Roll. First thing I noticed: they don't know how to roll their rolls. Everything was loose and falling apart. The rice wasn't packed well and it just looked like some amateur rolled it in the dark. With no hands.

Second, the pieces of fish were miserly thin. I've only had thinner pieces at My Thai, which is the worst restaurant that I've ever been to in my life (Not just sushi restaurants. I'm talking out of ALL restaurants). 

Most of the roll was rice or veggies (not even the avocado kind of veggie). Sushi Ichiban engages in the practice of using rice as one of their fillings for an inside-out roll. That means that the rolls are double-stuffed with rice, which I hate because they're cheaping out on you and trying to make it seem like it's all cool. It left me feeling played like they didn't even try. I've been to plenty of cheap ass sushi places that do not double stuff.

Imagine my surprise when I recently visited and was wowed by the entire renovation!

Every single auditorium has been renovated and now they feature roomy and super comfy recliner seats! This also means reserved seating, which I hate, but it's still nice if you are planning to buy advance tickets or attend a popular movie's premiere. The word's starting to get out about the theater's new look, because it keeps getting more and more crowded with people. 

More people mean longer lines to purchase tickets. The theater has put in two self-service ticketing machines, but they are very slow and -- here's the worst part -- you can't use your Cinemark Rewards card at the machines. At Regal, it's easy to swipe your rewards card but you can't do that here, which means I'm missing out on freebies and rewards. Major bummer. 

While the recliners are very nice, they don't recline back all the way (they go about half of the way back as the ones at Downtown Summerlin and Sunset Station do). They also have extremely awkward cup holders, which guarantee a spilled soda at some point during your movie. I love the tiered seating arrangement, though: there are little ""dividers"" that give each row a bit more privacy. Nice!

The snacks at the snack bar are still delicious (Century / Cinemark theaters have the BEST popcorn), and they've installed a self-serve butter topping machine so you can drown your popcorn in delicious grease if you're so inclined. Concession prices are quite expensive, so prepare your wallet. 

Surprisingly, the ticket prices are still among some of the cheapest in town (even the evening Senior tickets barely crack the $7 range).

However, the service was a bit slow to get a table and get a drink, the check, etc. This place is not very big, so I believe it gets crowded during peak hours, especially on the weekends.

Struggled over what to score this little spot. Stopped by and tried the large beef teriyaki and it was good. Was it the best, no, but better than I was expecting. Only real issue was the staff appeared brand new and did not know the menu at all. The young man was very nice but clearly a new employee. The issue does not fall on him but the management who is not properly training the young fella and throwing him to the wolves. In looking at previous reviews, management seems to be a regular issue.

Co81GvN5tC3FcS5WO3E1tA,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,3,4,3,3,"""Clean"" is really the best singular word to describe what's going on with the flavor and spice here when it comes to their take on the signature seafood-in-a-bag thing à la Hot-N-Juicy Crawfish style swamp dinner. (""Swamp dinner"" you say? I am coining that as my own right now as I just made that up.)

Is ""clean"" what you want when it comes to this very unique cuisine? Probably not. I ordered my requisite 1lb clams and 1lb head-on shrimp with built-in corn cobs and potatoes and totally missed the oodles of garlic I assumed would be a part of the sauce. There was barely *any* sauce, and there were barely any garlic chunks to be found in the sauce. And the Smokin' Crawfish sauce was light, almost watery, and decidedly *not* buttery and not as savory as the HNJ sauce. A disappointment, both obviously and subconsciously, as I found myself instinctively wanting more umami, more swampy mystery substance. It just isn't here. You can pretend and conjure all you want, but there really is no x-factor in the sauce here. More disappointment: the proteins here are at least one-level *smaller* compared to those at the competing seafood-in-a-bag joints. The clams are 25% smaller, and the shrimp are 21/25 count, not the 16/20 (or sometimes even 11/15) count you find at the other places. 

Don't get me wrong, if you've *never* had the Hot-N-Juicy ""Special"" or Boiling Crab ""Whole Shebang"" sauce experience, you'd probably think, ""Wow, this shit is good!"" and order more. But I cut my losses and decided to order another $2 Miller Lite (happy hour special) and call it a check. I need garlic chunks in my swamp dinner sauce. It's a dealbreaker! Yeah, the sauce at HNJ is so murky and mystical it can even give you hives if you consume too much of a funky batch, but it's worth the risk - it's SO good!

Bonus points: on the ""clean"" tip, all of the shrimp I received at Smokin' Crawfish were poop-less. Not deveined, but poop-less. Not sure if this is on purpose, but I thought it was worth noting, if you care about this sorta thing.

Nevertheless fun to support a ""new"" local spot trying to grab some of the swamp dinner market share - and it's a very big market! I totally understand why Smokin' Crawfish decided to open up shop.",2016-01-12 22:37:40

This time, however, an unforeseen turn of events warranted a hotel stay at The Plaza. I was pretty nervous about what the rooms would be like, but I was rather pleasantly surprised. The room wasn't very dated, it was clean (at least to the naked eye at 3am), the shower had plenty of hot water with good pressure. True, the bathroom was tiny, and the hotel soap is what I imagine they give inmates in prison, but all in all I had few complaints. The bed was comfortable and the linens were even pretty nice.

Parking is easy enough to come by since it's right next to a Harris Teeter. We went shortly after it opened so there was a pretty substantial line curling from the register up to and out the door. That's always a good sign and the line was moving pretty fast anyway!

There were too many things I wanted on the menu so it was a difficult decision. Luckily I had scouted the menu beforehand and decided to go with the Pork Rambler with tots. The pork ramber came with a fried pork tenderloin, blackberry butter, and onion straws.

Number one, the whole biscuit pork combination of flavor was delicious. Each component of the biscuit was tasty - INCLUDING the biscuit. I've had these types of sandwiches in the past where the meat and accoutrements are great, but the biscuit or bread is garbage. This was not the case. Biscuit was fantastic.

The tots were O.K. Needed a little bit of salt or a little kick of something. I was able to taste the grits and they were pretty good as well. 

Don't sleep on: The pepper jelly. They serve it on the Kickback chicken sandwich but I bought a jar of it anyway because I knew it would be gold.

Happy hour here is awesome. It's $5 margaritas, $2 tecate, half off taquitos, and probably a few other things that I forgot. The margaritas a big and they pack a punch! The fun thing is they have a few different types of salt you can put on the rim. We tried the chili lime salt (tastes like a seasoning you would put on tortilla chips) and Hawaiian black lava salt with freeze dried ants (yes, ants like the bug! They're ground up so you don't see legs or anything). Both were okay, people probably liked the ants more than the chili lime. 

The taquitos are like mini make it yourself tacos. A small plate of meat comes with two different kinds of sauces and 5 mini soft tortillas. You can ask for more tortillas if you run out.

I was weary not only because of that but also because I had heard they were much more expensive than other stores, however, today I did a price compare and while the selection is smaller at Rollins, the prices are better than a chain store and they had everything I needed. They also recently made some upgrades to the entry of the store making it look cleaner. Some of the frozen food and packaged stuff is pricier but not by a ton. Their fresh made salsa is awesome (the tomatillo is my favorite) and the Mexican sweet breads are great. One thing that might be holding this place back is, it doesn't really appear to be a grocery store upon entry. Looks more like you can buy stuff for your house there and all groceries are towards the back. Some reorganization might help and a few additional small renovations (like how they re did the front) would make this place 5 stars. 



Original review:
An old lady on a Rascal scooter hit a man at full speed inside Rollins, missing me by less than an inch. He got stuck on the front of it and was flailing around in confusion. Thankfully the front door of the store was open, otherwise the guy would have gotten smashed. According to the cashier, this happens on the regular. The guy walked away in shock..

Entrance fee was only a dollar and we started by walking around the swap meet. They showed me various booths/vendors they liked. I wound up buying a steering wheel cover, some nail polish, makeup, and even household goods FOR CHEAP! Like 2 detergents for $10 cheap!

Best thing about the swap meet was the food. We drank tons of lemonade, which was perfect on these hot Vegas summers. Elote was ahhhh-maaaze. Like, seriously! I had elote on the cob but, my friend had it in a cup. So she had tons of mayo and cheese in her cup. I was so happy eating my elote...I abso-fricken-lutely love elote!!!!!!!!
Churros were bomb, too. Kinda really hot because they're so fresh but, really yum. Sadly, I didn't get their rotisserie chicken bcuz they were closed (IDK WHY) and that'll just be something to look forward to for next time.

It is opened to the outside completely which is perfect during the fall (when I went) and therefore makes it so comfortable instead of being in a stuffy room. The outdoor patio has a pool which I assume they use in the summer time, and a lounge area that surrounds the pool for the smokers or the laid back people. I used that area to take breaks from dancing and my smoker friends also found it useful. The outdoor area is surrounded by a giant wall so you don't feel like you're in the middle of Scottsdale, it almost feels like someone else's villa which makes it more comfortable than a usual club. There's also an outdoor bar. 

The inside area has a bar as well as lots of places to lounge, and of course, a dance floor. I wish the dance floor was a little larger but it was fine since some places have even smaller dance floors (so I shouldn't complain). There were hot dancers/acrobats on rings like at Cirque du Soleil which is a great addition to the atmosphere, it keeps the energy high. They had strobe lights on from time to time, but not all the time. Don't know about you, but I like them strobe lights - yet not everyone does so I guess their conservative choice is safe for the crowd in general. There are also platforms people can dance on which is great if you're an attention getter. Honestly, I used every square inch of this place (yes, even the platforms woo hoo) and everything about it was great if you're comparing it to a regular club.

Does anyone remember the days of Pizza Sola and how huge their slices were but also how sort of lacking in awesomeness of flavor they were? And also the creepiness factor of them always having pizza sitting out for who knows how long and they'd just warm it up in the oven for you? 

Well, this place has none of that nastiness! It's right in the swing of things on the Southside and was surprisingly chill for being 9ish on a Saturday night. My friend raved about this place for the past week, but I was skeptical due to other slice based places in the area that were big in quantity but lacking in quality. 

The slices, as you can see in my photos, are in fact huge. Two plates worth huge. The best part? THE FLAVOR! THE FREAKING THIN BUT CHEWY IN A GOOD WAY CRUST! THE FACT THAT EVERY GINORMOUS PIE IS MADE TO OTHER AND IT DOESN'T SIT UNDER A HOT LAMP WAITING TO BE SNEEZED ON. 

My slice was still bubbling and steaming when it came out of the oven. Do you think I waited for it to come down to acceptable temperatures before tasting it? Pffffft, you must not be familiar with my posts then. This pizza was delish in every possible way, and is appropriately priced at $4 for plain and $5 for a one topping slice seeing as to how you're easily getting three normal slices in one. 

It also happened to be the Southside art crawl, so there were a few bands playing and free beer offered. I had Rivertowne Grateful White and it was great! The not so great was the first band that played...the music was entirely too loud for the small space of the restaurant, and you had to yell at the person next to you to hear them at a whisper like level. Seriously dudes, next time you let a band play there tell them to turn the flipping amp down. The second band was lovely and had a smoother chill wave jazz vibe which I liked, mainly because of the 100% acceptable noise level they were giving off. 

I'll be back to see if this night was just an exceptional fluke or if this is really one of the best slices I've had.",2016-06-20 04:34:34

This was my first time here, and I'm not all that anxious to return.  My hubby and I were headed to the galleries and decided to have lunch at Cowboy Ciao-my idea since the reviews were largely positive.

We both ordered a boring 7-up before seeing all the specialty sodas available.  The one time it would have been helpful had our server been a slacker.  I ordered the tenderloin sandwich with roasted red peppers and blue cheese.  The tenderloin was tender and flavorful.  The roll that it was served on was toasted, yet still rubbery in texture.  Not chewy like good crusty bread, but rubbery  like they had microwaved it!   My husband had the ahi sandwich.  I didn't try it, but I could tell it was a little skimpy on the ahi.  His came with a side of potato salad which I did try.  I liked it, but felt it needed salt-a lot of it.  Too bad there was none on the table.

I thought Cowboy Ciao has a nice menu, and I might be inclined to give it another shot sometime, but I was definitely not blown away.  Just okay for me.",2008-10-12 03:31:07

Of the three dishes we ordered, one was good: the tea tree mushrooms. I've never seen this on a menu before, and the dish was deliciously flavored.  It did contain thinly sliced fatty pork, which was also good. The  fish in chili broth was passable, though for the price, I'm used to getting more (in the states).  The spicy szechuan chicken dish was nothing that I recognize. Normally, the chicken  is coated, deep fried and cooked with dried chili's. The dish served looked like some  americanized  (canadianized) stir fried Chinese dish in brown sauce. Chicken was mush. Don't know how that was managed. 

The restaurant needs to hire at least one more person. There was one poor girl responsible for the waiting and bussing of all 6 tables.  My baby started crying as we were finishing up so I told my husband I'd wait outside. It ended up being a cold 15min before he came out. 

The final straw was paying $4 for rice. You're a Chinese restaurant. Rice is cheap and should never be charged.  I would not recommend wasting a meal at this overpriced inauthentic restaurant.",2018-05-18 01:26:22

Their Siam Duck, Teriyaki Beef, Green papaya salad, beef salad, and fried banana are all my favorites just to name a few.

While we were waiting to get our menu, the other two groups already got their drinks and placed their orders. We asked if we can be helped to place our order, we were neglected and ignored. I am not sure if it's language barrier problem, but it feels like she was yelling at us when we were wondering why we haven't been helped. We end up walking out there empty stomached.

If you ever drive on the 401 pass Yonge, you'll see the vast amount of foresty area on the North Side. I thought that was a full on forest, but it's actual a park area.  

Not only is it a park, but it's also a ski centre.  I'm not sure how good it is, I ran down the one and only ski hill and it didn't seem all that steep to me. I'd like to try tobogganing down that sucka one of these days.   Not only is there a lot of green space and places to picnic and bbq, but there's a peaceful walking area through the forest.  I don't know how big it is, as we ventured away from the path, and ended up at Earl Bales Park.  

This place is a really good place to toboggan in the winter. Not down the large ski hill, but they have other smaller hills that are a pretty nice to go down.  Love this park, it's a keeper!",2008-10-14 13:16:59

Was a little skeptical because the menu for me was a little overwhelming didn't understand how things worked, considering I'm so used to Chipotle. And FYI if your expecting this place to be similar to chipotle you'll be surprised lol. 

So I ordered the Quesadilla and they were making the tortillas right in front of me!! 1-0 cafe rio vs chipotle. Clearly cafe rio is winning right now. So back to the tortilla making, this lady was rolling the fresh tortillas out then putting them on the huge spinning griddle. Where they cooked for a little bit then we're taken off and placed on a flat top! All were made per order! 

They were extremely friendly Sherman asked if we were new and course we said yes so guess what.... They started SINGING it was just an awesome experience!  We got to the condiment bar and there was nothing but different flavor syrups to spice up your beverage. Super cool.

Now on to the food... It was delicious you can totally taste the difference of a fresh made tortilla and prepackaged one..so good, rice was a smidge salty but guacamole was spicy and good.. 
So I leave you with this.. 2-0 Cafe rio, Chipotle who?!",2016-05-14 15:52:04

Anyway, I was really looking forward to the 'amazing' carne asada. We ordered at the counter, I got the carne asada burrito, the BF got barbacoa tacos and we got a side of guac. The guac came out with three other salsas and some seemingly home made chips. The chips were good, as was the guac. The red and green salsas were too watery and not very flavorful. The chunky salsa with onion and peppers was very tasty, so I was excited for the meal. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. I thought both the barbacoa and the carne was bland and too chewy. Both meals were in desperate need of salsa to make them taste like something. Pretty disappointing. The beans and rice were alright, but not enough to go back.

First impressions were great just riding by. Patio seating looked inviting and artwork hanging inside made me want to stop in, but not just yet, we had a bike ride to finish. 

Luckily enough, my bro suggested we stop here after the ride for some drinks. Great idea. They had plenty of local brews on tap so I got my fav Four Peaks Kiltlifter and for a small snack we ordered the trail mix. 

As predicted, patio seating was great! The lights on top of the building were set up to give the right about of lighting at night and our server did a great job of keeping us happy. The trail mix ($2.00) was awesome too, it came in a brown paper bag and did the job of holding us over till we ate later that evening. 

Although this place makes a great bar, it looks like it would make an even better music venue. That will have to be for another night, but a band was setting up, and forewarned, you have to pay extra to sit in the room the band plays, but I'm sure that's part of how the band gets paid so I can't hate on that.

I found that Haru Sushi has a great rating on both Google and Zomato review. In this way, my boyfriend decided to take me here for dinner.

We arrived the restaurant around 7:30 pm, which was right at the dinner time. The restaurant was full and busy. Luckily, we still found a table.

The prices of food are a little bit expensive.  We had CALAMARI, TERIYAKI BEEF, and Two special sushi rolls to share. The food came out fast and fresh. The Calamari was very fresh and soft different from what we thought. But, the taste of it was so salty. Beef Teriyaki was grill beef and mixed vegetable which is different from what we ate before too, but the taste was great. Two special rolls were tasted decent.

Well known spots like McCormick and Schmick's would feature these entrees at much more than these guys charge.  They also offer a discount for LVAC members.  

We started with the ""New England Clam Chowder"" which was served in a bread bowl with plenty of oyster crackers for some elegant carb on carb action.  The soup was delicious and the clams were plentiful.  This was a steal for $4.50.

I got the ""Seared Ahi Tuna"" plate which came with a side and cole slaw.  You can see from all the pictures that you get A LOT of tuna for $15.  The tuna was seasoned in Cajun spice and it was terrific.   I paid $1 extra to get another side and opted for the quinoa and kale salad.  The kale salad was great and the mix of strawberries, almonds, carrots, jicama, cranberries and more made me feel like a walking antioxidant afterwards.  I will most likely just order the tuna and kale salad combo next time which is a couple of bucks less but you get the same size tuna and more salad.  

My wife got the salmon with garlic butter sauce.  That sauce was so good that we asked for an extra side of it.  It had the consistency of tartar sauce and was a welcome change.  The salmon was grilled well although the pieces were not as big as the tuna.  

It's definitely a casual atmosphere since you're ordering from the cash register. I imagine they get a lot of take out orders for lunch.

It was SUCH a pain-free shopping experience, let me tell you. First off, this store is pretty huge with lots of stuff (think candles, homegoods, crafting shit/supplies, that sorta stuff). I instinctively head to the back of the store for the custom frame area. My gut was right and they were located in the back along with many rows of matting, various frames, posterboard, art, etc. I selected the matting I liked, but needed a custom one cut for a unique size. Plus, the matting is to be signed with Sharpies by employees, so I needed ample room too. The male employee was very helpful and answered all of my ignorant questions patiently. It took him *maybe* 3-4 minutes total to cut my dimensions request and reassure me the extra-fine point Sharpies shouldn't bleed on this material.

I love the little cute town of Boulder City with all its antique shops and old fashion eateries, so I literally don't need an excuse to come here.

But on this occasion Art in the park was in full bloom.  This event has so much to offer in the form of art culture and good family/friend time. For the entire weekend you can make your way down every tent and booth which are showcasing some amazing talent.

From unique jewelry to acrylics, pop art, photographed destinations or even bronze statues. 

Make it past the art and you are now in the food court with about 15 food vendors offering barbeque, roasted corn, gyros, Italian food, burgers, kettle corn, and so much more. 
On this trip we tried a booth making kettle chips or curly fries cut by some sort of mechanical contraption powered by a hand held drill.  The portion of kettle chips was humongous! Even sharing this was not going to promise finishing them, and sure enough we tapped out with quite a few chips left.  The price was $8 but the portion definitely merited the cost.

Next we refilled at Texas Twister.  We brought back our plastic drinking boot we purchase from them last year as they offer $5 refills.  It is a refreshing fresh squeezed lime and orange drink filled with sweet water and topped with a cherry and they also offer the sugar free version. 

Now as if on a sugar binge or something, we walked across to the funnel cake booth.  I can't even tell you how long it has been since I last had one and it was delicious.  We enjoyed the banana Nutella funnel cake which was surprisingly not overly sweet, topped with fresh bananas and a fair amount of Nutella. It defiantly did not look like their display one, but non the less very tasty. 

Hop right over and you are now in the homemade food booths.  Here you will find roasted nuts with cinnamon and sugar, or the man selling his pastas made of basil and lemon offering tastings. Then there is the soup and dip mixes with plenty to sample from, or the couple selling their balsamic vinegar, olive oils, and salsas, just to name a few.

You could taste the steak instead of just tasting the teriyaki sauce at other places.  I was craving noodles and all they had were sauteed udon noodles. So I ordered it with steak as well... And it was delicious. So good in fact that I was craving it days later. Lol

Then the second time I got there lunch special and it was decent. Good amount of food for your buck... But nothing really stood out from the lunch special. But overall decent flavors.

Then the last time I went...I wanted the sauteed udon noodles... Yup...I was craving it again. Lol and like the first time... The meat was tender and the noodles were flavorful. 

They also have fried rice ONLY as a side dish so you can't order it as an entree. The flavor and texture is good but Everytime I've gotten it... It's been a tad bit bland... But sprinkle on some soy sauce and it was perfect. I wish they would make a entree size fried rice. 

Flavor (4/5)... For the most part.. Delicious. :)

Overall, Everytime I've been the ambiance has been clean and welcoming. Ambiance (5/5) The servers mostly have been good... The first time the server I had.... Had a tendency to shuffle her feet... Which after a while was annoying... But that's a little petty. Lol 

Other then that I have no complaints. I'll be back for sure. :)",2017-01-26 07:36:55

But it's small, so if you want to avoid the crowd, get there early. I was introduced to it by a friend/former boss. I've been to others (Sushi Fever- overpriced) but this place is the best!  If you're visiting LV,  and you want to try a sushi place, come here. I raved about this place to my husband, and when he finally had it, he agreed. At first, he didn't like the time limit, but he fould out that it's not so bad after all. There is a punch card (buy 10 get one free) available. You can order half rolls (except Spider Roll). 

There is sushi bar seating (where we sit) and tables lining up the walls, but again, this is a small place. It's got a good reputation, so I imagine that there are regulars. (Note: there is a funny smell near the bathroom, so I am mentioning this if you are particularly sensitive to smell, do not sit in that area.)  Anyway, once seated at the bar, the waitress takes your order for the side orders/appetizers like seaweed salad, edamame, soup, etc. (Note: the list is huge so pace yourself.)  
The sushi chef asks you for your sushi order soon after. Try the specialty rolls like Mexican, Caterpillar, Hawaiian- seriously the sushi roll menu is two pages long (front & back). Once I tried the Spicy roll and it was al little much for me. The chef kept looking at me to see if I would finish it and I did! It may feel overwhelming at first, but remember, you can order half- rolls. The fish is so fresh. It's so good. The service is excellent. Note: if you're ordering something that take more prep time than usual, order that first, rather than last. For dessert,  I like green tea ice cream. There were a couple times that I had so much sushi that I didn't have ice cream (And I love love love ice cream!). Lunch AYCE is $23.95 and Dinner AYCE is $28.95.

I've been here for lunch several times. I ordered a lunch special which was pretty good and very reasonable ($9.95 or less). My friend ordered the chirashi bowl ($12.95) which she always has for lunch.",2010-06-19 17:58:38

The hudson location is much better than the cleveland one. And, it's probably a good thing I don't live closer, or I'd be about 50 lbs heavier!! I've been to this location multiple times in the past few months and I have to say, it's one of my favorite mex restaurants in NEO. Love their chips and salsa. Their queso is wonderful too!! 

If you're in the mood for margs, I'd definitely recommend getting the margarita flight. You get a sampler of three margaritas of the bartender's choice - and by sampler I mean a glass of each. Get a few amongst your friends and t's a great way to try margs and an even greater way to get tipsy fast.

I love sitting out on the patio in the summer, but inside is just as good in the winter. The waiters/waitresses are all super friendly and on slow days when they have time, fun to talk to. I've never had a trip there with poor service and like I said, I've been about 6 times between July and last week. 

I fell in love with their cheese and potato enchiladas, so basically never steer away from it when I go. It's so different from other mexican restaurants and I was a bit hesitant to try it the first time around, but the waitress highly recommended it and I haven't looked back since! It's basically a pureed blend of potato, spinach, etc (the two things I can actually see) which is mixed with cheese. I got the mole sauce once but didn't like the sweet flavor so have gotten the enchiladas with the red sauce ever since.... LOVE....

I also love the area that Luchita's is in. SUPER cute - First and Main. Parking can suck if it's a weekend or weeknight, but you'll eventually find a spot- Just keep swimming... food is worth it :)",2013-12-20 02:38:24

They also have Anna Sui Cosmetics, and had the beauty tray I was looking for in stock (this was a pleasant surprise), b/c it seems like this line is in transition.  They also have Smashbox, so just about everything I love is covered.

Rosemary Cross: I didn't have a major, but my thesis was on Latin American economic policy.

Max Fischer: Oh, that's interesting. Did you hear that they're not going to teach Latin anymore?

Rosemary Cross: This was more like Central America. 

Ha.  Okay.  That exchange doesn't have anything to do with my review of Havana Cafe, only that it dances with the South-of-the-Equator theme.  Which, in actuality, is the same concept of Havana Cafe.  That is, its a Cuban restaurant with heavy Latin American themes. 

First, and I must emphasize, FOREMOST, their alcohol selection is nothing short of brilliant.  They import an enormous amount of South American and European-cum-Latin influenced wines and serve it both by the ounce and the liter.  Fascinatingly, they have Portuguese reds, which i have been exhaustively looking for, either in-store or dine-in around the valley.  Praise be, I've finally found the place!  They also offer Argentine reds and whites, Chileans Sav Blancs, and Spanish Tempranillos.  Perfect selection, and VERY reasonable for their exclusivity.  Their Douro was a serf-encouraging $8.  That's not very many Escudos, no not at all.

For beer, they had several unique selections, most notably the inclusion of Argentina's Quilmes.  Honestly, i cannot remember what other selections they had, though i remember being roused by the list, only to be seduced by the Porteno brew of choice.

Their selection of rums, and the accompanying list of rum cocktails was also impressive, though sadly sans Havana Club Rum due to America's archaic embargo vs the snarky nation of Cuba.  Blast.

When the food came out, I was impressed by the presentation.  To start, my gf found it in her gullet to order the hearts of palm/carrot/various rabbit food appetizer, which was heavily drowned in vinegar.  i liked it, but she didn't care for it all too much.  My app was the serving of 3 croquetas filled with ham with a side of mildly spicy aioli.  Not bad, but slightly mushy.  Fry them up a couple more minutes and I would have gladly accosted my taste buds with volcanic pork pieces even further.

My entree was the poached chicken with shrimp and rice, which tasted well and good on the first try, but went up to 11 on the re-heat the next day.  Fucking glorious.  My gf had the stuffed squash with a Jamaican curry cream sauce.  She was thrilled with it because she likes vegetables and shit, and this was the motherload of veggie heaven -- veggies filling veggies like some plant orgy.

Okay, so why the empty star?  

Its pricey.  What was meant to be a casz dinner ended up surpassing the century mark.  Not a problem really, since we got 2 rounds of the good stuff, plus basically dinner/lunch out of it, but it COULD turn some people off.  All in all, i felt it was slightly over-valued. 

Still, this will NOT keep me from coming back.  There is just too much fucking potential here and so many unfurled selections. I've gotta take down their wine list.  I wonder if they offer an around-the-world-wine-club card like some cheesedick chain like The Yard House.  I will be here for as many happy hours and apps as is necessary to finance the country of Cuba and bypass any restrictions put onto me by the governments.

A few nights ago, I found myself at Capriotti's waiting over twenty minutes for my sandwich to be made right.  You can read that review, but it made me think about all the different Cheese Steaks sandwiches in the area.  

There are no Geno's or Pat's nearby that could take their crown; but I've always found Jersey Mike's and Corleone's on Northsight have done a better job then most.  And, I really don't mean that as a back handed complement.

This afternoon, I stopped by and ordered a 8"" Big Kahuna Cheese Steak to see if my memory and/or my stomach was playing tricks on me.  And, for the most part, I would say that Jersey Mike's does a great job.  I paid $7.25 for the sandwich, and another $2.19 for chips and a drink.  The total came to $10.32, which is a full dollar cheaper then Capriotti's; and there I didn't get chips for my $11.53.  

Now, granted their sub was 12"" to Jersey Mike's 8"", but Mike's was just as good!  Though admittedly I have a weakness for Capriotti's bread with their corn meal bottoms.

Not being from Philly and not wanting to tread on somebody else turf (and Cheese Whiz aside), but I'm going to give Jersey Mike's Four Stars to Capriotti's Three and half Stars.

Super Chicken Fingers has the biggest, crispiest, white meat grubbin', butter lovin' fangers and sauce. You will lick your fingers and yes they will still taste good cold. The Super Ranch is loaded with Dill and the co-star is Garlic. Usually garlic is the leading lady, but not in this show. Only sometimes does the Dill seem to be showcased which is one of the reason I can't give Super Chicken Fingers 5 Stars. 

The pizza? Ain't all that super. It was decent and they seem to use quality ingredients, but the amount of cheese they loaded on to my pie was overwhelming and made it hard for me to enjoy the pie. I might as well put it directly on to my gut and thighs and rub it in real good using gentle strokes while listening to Frank Ocean by candlelight. A mozzarella cheese sensual massage.

The prices seem to be the same as every other pizza place. When it comes to pizza I just see red and don't care about prices or world peace or tomorrow. I definitely recommend giving them a chance. Especially after they read this review.

Although it's great that this Second Cup is open until 1am on Saturday, it would help if there was actually staff manning the counter. Melissa D. and I wanted to end our night with a hot drink, so we waited... and waited... and waited. We even looked for a bell to ring, and came up empty handed. 

Finally, I went back to the washroom area to investigate, and an employee was emptying the trash. I politely asked if we were able to order something, and she barked back (as if I were REALLY inconveniencing her), 'ya, I'm just in the middle of doing something'. So, sufficed to say, still not impressed.

Even after the rude treatment, we still waited for her to finish so we could get our hot drink. But guess what, she never showed, so we left... hot drink-less, and treat-less. We also had our eyes on the cookies.

I liked it here, but not as much as the other two places.  First off, I LOVE the decor.  It's very cool and contemporary, but it has a warm Spanish flair that really suits the place.  The bar area is really cool, like the place where all the cool kids would hang out.  You would never expect any of this just by looking at the outside of the building.

For food, I ordered the Latin Passion salad which was a tasty mix of field greens and baby spinach topped with pinto beans, jack cheese, corn, tortilla strips, and mixed with a sweet and spicy tropical dressing.  You also get tomatoes and cilantro, but I opted out, yuck!  The salad was really big, and I only ordered the half size!  I definitely couldn't finish it.  The greens were all very fresh and all the toppings added lots of great textures and subtle flavors.  The dressing was really great.  I usually don't like spicy stuff, but I really enjoyed this dressing.  It was really light but the spice gave it a full flavor.

I also tasted some of the french fries and passion slaw that my Mom In Law had.  The slaw was really yummy and very different from the slaw you would expect.  The fries were okay, not really my favorite.  We also had a trio of salsas served to us before our meal and I tried two of them.  Again, I don't like tomatoes, so this is a bit uncommon.  One of the salsas was a pineapple salsa and it was delicious.  The sweet tangy flavor of the pineapple was perfect with the super salty tortilla chips.  I also tried the very spicy salsa that didn't have chunks of anything in it and it was also very good... in very small doses.

Overall, I liked Ticoz, but it isn't really my favorite kind of food.  I'm just too picky.  I will probably be back and hopefully I can expand my culinary horizons just a bit.",2009-09-21 17:56:38

I liked that they were torched right when I ordered them and they came in cute little containers with lids. (Some things from food trucks are difficult to take home.)  

I was supposed to share them when I got home, but I maaaaaaay have eaten more like 2/3 of each one. They were AMAZING. Perfect creaminess & custardy texture. I have had creme brulee in the past that was too runny or too chunky. This was perfect. The flavor was awesome...the vanilla was as expected, but the salt in the caramel really made it interesting...in a good way.

I saw in previous reviews that they were too burnt...not so for me. Maybe they do less bruleeing (that could be a word). They were perfect...light golden crunchy top that tasted just torched enough and cracked with a spoon in a magical way. :)

As I mentioned on their Facebook page, I am actually glad this is a food truck and not a brick & mortar business because if I could go get one every single day I would. Then I'd go more and more. Then I'd be too fat to leave the house and hopefully they'd have delivery by then.

The Morrison Y has gone from one building with a water park and exercise room to 3 buildings with a huge exercise room, 4 basketball courts (maybe 5), an indoor track, a new group fitness room, among many other improvements. They did quite the job.

The workout room (or floor if you want to put it that way) is very nice. It's fitted with Life Fitness and Precor cardio machines, which all are equipped with TVs. The Precor TVs are like little entertainment systems--you can plug your iPhone in, watch TV, select a workout, and view your progress on that workout. The TV doesn't look great, though. There are a plethora of weights and free weights as well. There's also a ""core fitness"" room where one can take a mat and work on push ups, take a jump rope and jump rope--really a lot of options. The staff is decent, I really never interact with them so I'm going to refrain from commenting there. The gym can get really full on pre-work mornings and Saturdays, so watch out!

The other feature I use most is the water park. It consists of one main pool, a kiddie pool, 2 ""big kid"" waterslides, 3 ""little kid"" waterslides, and 3 more ""baby"" waterslides. It's a great place, although it can get very, very, very crowded when half of Ballantyne is there on a 90 degree day in July. Still a nice place to cool off.

Global cusine with a nod ot Asia. (possibly owing to it's Chinatown location).  Dishes are bold and rich offset with herbs, sprouts, flowers, and greens.   Beautiful plates of playful food that won't tire your palate.

The perfect expression of this, the outstanding sweetbreads.  Crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside, nice offal flavors.  Along side, bacon wrapped baby romaine lettuce, an interesting foil, that makes no sense until you combine it with the sweet peas and vegetal, raw pea tendrils and herbs; a great way to add brightness to the dish.  Bacon fat plays a role in the sauce bringing the dish together.

Artichoke, a take on the roasted artichokes of the Jewish quarter of Rome, excellent.  Bitter, crisp, creamy all at the same time.  It's flavor elevated by the white bean hummus, charred tomatillos, peppery wilted arugula, and pine nuts and a dousing of olive oil.  

The beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling showcases tender beef cheeks enriched by melting bone marrow.  The wrap, relatively thick and cooked al dente, bordering on being too chewy but holds everything in.  The peppery beef perfectly matches the green onion emulsion but the use of foam; sorry I always think of cat spit, not appealing.  It's just me.

THE showstopper, albeit it inconsistent, the ""campfire duck"".  Holy $hit!  Beautifully rendered fat (almost no white under the skin), perfect mid rare, topped with a melting, pan seared thick slice of foie sprinkled with a few crystals of rock salt that adds burst of texture and flavor.  The whole thing sits on earthy, wood ear mushroom slivers and briny Japanese cucumber pickles (what you'd find in a bento). An Asian inspired, sweet sour plum and duck jus ties it together.  Sublime.  Sadly the fat of a duck breast from a second order (placed later in the meal) was so poorly rendered, disappointing. 

The head on Argentinean red shrimp (creamy head fat with lime butter; just saying) and culatello both delish.  If that's not enough, get the hearth baked bread.  A true European style bread with great texture, perfect for mopping up any savory juices that remain on any dish.

Creative craft cocktails.  Well chosen wine list with very reasonable, off Strip pricing.

Check out their FB for promotions and specials.  HH from 5:30 - 6:30.

Addendum:  Be sure to check out Burger Night (Thursday - Saturday 11PM - close).  Great blend of cuts, cooked to temp, topped with burata and arugula plus a COEDO black lager for $20; steal!

It was hard to pick what to eat. A lot of yelpers posted great pictures but they change the menu every few months so a lot of the pictures weren't being served. However they have a small menu so it's focused and makes your choice easier. 

We had the duck curry. It was pretty spicy but it's a nice thickened curry with big udon noodles. As I figured with most dishes here, it didn't have a lot of meat. You can probably see that in various dishes in the photos posted. The roasted potatoes in there were great. 

We had the tea-a-misu which I didn't care for. The texture was off. I wanted to try the steamed bun sandwiches but I couldn't justify the price for just one.

I can confirm that the doughnuts do indeed look as amazing in person as they do in pictures, but they were sorely lacking in taste. While the texture and moisture levels were pretty on point, they honestly just tasted bland and my boyfriend and I quickly got tired of eating them. The rocky road cookie however, was amazing; it was soft and chewy with just the right amount of marshmallows and (perfectly toasted) almonds.

Verdict: 2/5 for doughnuts and 4/5 for cookies; would definitely recommend going for the cookies instead of the doughnuts.",2016-02-18 18:20:15

We were seated right away in a half booth high top, aside the bar. It was like they sat us in an igloo. So cold! The bucket of peanuts in the table had a mixture of peanuts, shells, crayons and other junk. I was scared to eat them...didn't seem super sanitary. The two stars were foe our server. She was very kind, and got us everything we needed. 

The bar. There were several televisions, but of course, I couldn't see the one with the Red Sox game...it was over my head. Oh well. There were children sitting at the bar. Not ok. The bartender never said anything, nor did a manager. The kid was pretty much sleeping on the bar to boot. 

We both ordered a filet mignon, I with a grilled mushroom skewer and broccoli; J with the mushroom skewer and a sweet potato. I ordered my filet medium, while he likes it mooing. I also had the prickly pear spiked lemonade, while he enjoyed a Blue Moon. The drinks were great. Two had my head a little loopy....

The meals came. The server informs me that my mushrooms will be right out. But J has his skewer. Weird. My broccoli is tepid and mushy. My steak was AWFUL. Now, I'm not a big meat eater, which is why I went for the filet. Contrary to what it ahould be, it was fatty and rubber-tough. I passed half of it to J, who loves the fat. He promptly passed it from mouth to napkin. Steak sauce couldn't make it any better.  I am of the mindset that if you have to use sauce, you didn't cook it right. Yep. Half was rare, half was overcooked. This steak was a mess. J said his was ok, but very chewy.

I got a burrito bowl with carnitas. Like Chipotle, they let you choose what you want in your bowl. I was a little worried t first because the carnitas looked like they might be spicy (they were in a red sauce). But actually they were not hot, just very flavorful. The meat was really tasty, the other ingredients tasted fresh and the bowl came with a small side of chips which were perfect for scooping up my bowl ingredients. I can see why their nachos are so popular. Something about their chips make them great with toppings.

I appreciate the little things and that wasn't something I expected.

Overall, we loved our breakfast! I'm quite picky with my eggs, especially with omelets and I was very impressed with the omelet they made. It was a good ratio of egg, protein and spinach and all the flavors went together very well.

Good tacos!

Quick Review™
+   Open late; 2$ chicken and chorizo tacos; 2.50$ carnitas and al pastor tacos; and, a superbly convenient location along US-95. 

-   Flan is alright. Just alright.  

------------------------------------------

You've got your tacos, and then you have everything else. I come here for tacos, and although I appreciate that they have Jericalla (flancito) (unlike their original downtown truck), it is a tad steeply priced at 3.50$ a serving when Los Antojos [http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-antojos-las-vegas?hrid=TF0KCJK2ujGG_uZdF8tWQw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)] gives you a plate the size of your goddamn head for that price (and their flan is actually good). Of course that is across town, so ... 'drive or quit complaining, Edwin P.!'  

Although ... there is a cute employee here. I am honest enough to admit that this fact probably accounts for more than half of my patronage. (Check check-ins.) You see: I am an honest creep. The last honest creep.

Tacos de pollo: 2$ más impuestos.
Postres: 3.50$ más impuestos.

My whole life I have been paying impuestos. Waiting for the day when I can pay less impuestos and they hit up the dirty Romneys instead for all the years they have cheated society. I digress. 

Pro Tip:
You have to pay with cash if it's less than 10$. Not unheard of when it comes to taco stands; however, this is restaurant with storefront. Bit weird. 

Superfluous Note:
Maximum room capacity 59.

Pro Tip:
They make some good stuff, you know. Skip the flan.

The location is somewhat hard to miss because they don't have large (or any, really) signage besides one small vinyl that cannot be the largest size that the County Commission permitted. Don't know. Use your GPS (or ask a Mexican).

Ff2U6IavSwqocFYfZLI-0w,HFFiM63x9asevqVOZG5GBQ,I6Xa5eF9Jv9VM6ms_dkY8A,3,4,0,1,"Luckily for us, Mediterranean restaurants are suddenly plentiful in Charlotte and quite frankly most of them are good to very good, which is also the case with Ilios Noche. This location is by far the more comfortable and visually appealing of its two locations. The dining room is quite stunning and is as beautiful as found any anywhere in the city. The service was courteous and attentive on both the Saturday evenings that we dined there. We unfortunately had issues with the food on both occasions.

We started things off with the Mesclun Salad with baby greens, Gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts, white balsamic vinaigrette. At $8 it is a little pricey; however, it did deliver portion size-wise and was generous with the walnuts and Gorgonzola. The vinaigrette was very tasty but applied too heavily; my mistake however, as I should have ordered it on the side. 

I can't go to a Greek restaurant without ordering falafel and that was the case here also. At the very reasonable price of $5, five pieces are served alongside their beautiful tzatziki sauce. As my photo shows, it was artfully displayed however it was a little bland for my taste and was overwhelmed by garlic. This could be chalked up to personal preference but of the eleven area Greek/Mediterranean restaurants that my wife and I have dined over the past year, this falafel was our least favorite.

What cannot be attributed to personal preference however is the two burnt skewers of grossly overcooked tiny lamb kabobs that was served with my Lamb Souvlaki platter. As any Greek chef knows, lamb should be cooked medium rare to medium, yet mine was cooked well done (see photo). I would have normally sent it back but we were running late for church and just didn't have time. The accompanying country Greek salad and Greek fries were excellent. In fact the fries were the best I've had anywhere but such a major mistake on the lamb preparation is hard to overlook and weighs heavily in my overall score. The Pita bread was unspectacular to say the least. (What qualifies Pita bread as spectacular you might ask... see my review for Kabob Je Rotisserie in Matthews, NC for that answer - theirs is out of this world and worth the 10 minute drive.)

On the plus side, the the Wild Mushroom Ravioli at $11 was expertly prepared and very savory. Serving size was small but this was reflected in the price. Loved it so much I was tempted to lick the plate

Overall everything was just okay at best, which is disappointing because, based on prior reviews, our expectations were quite high. Due to the better alternatives I mentioned at the beginning of this review, we probably won't return, but it's still worth a try I think if you haven't been before.

You're greeted by a warm and modern interior and the menu is seriously impressive with their breadth and scope of items. There were so many different kind of special rolls, and there's just about everything here from ramen to salads to bentos.

To start off I'd absolutely recommend getting their spicy salmon salad. It's probably the best thing there. There's a ton of greens, and a ton of salmon sashimi here and by that I mean, a huge chunk of it. It wasn't overly mixed with breadcrumbs and it was actually spicy in a totally good way. I could have only gotten that and would have been happy with it. 

The other two dishes were a bit of a hit and miss. The sashimi quality is generally fair but the temperature was warmer than we would have liked. Some of the fish were colder than others but overall they're generally on the warm side. The spicy salmon dragon roll was better; there's plenty of spicy salmon on top and the inside of the rolls were plentiful but I couldn't help but to notice that the shrimp tempura was a tad stale and was completely overpowering.",2018-01-31 02:30:52

It was a toss up between this place, pizza, Mexican or Thai.  I would have been happy with either selection.

We popped in, were greeted by the lovely hostess and got a booth inside the crowded place.  Our lovely server was friendly and competent.  The food was okay, but nothing memorable.  He had wings and a rib eye.  I had a house salad and cajun blackened salmon.

Before you think I'm more indecisive than I sometimes know I can be, hear me out. My first couple of trips to Tomo were pleasant. I didn't know about Yelp yet, but if I had, each time (maybe 5) would have been solid 3-star reviews. However, along came the one and only time I went there when they were busy. I had a bad waitress, which led to a bad experience overall. 

I had said I wouldn't be back after that occasion, but my boyfriend (having agreed with me not to go back) went a couple of times for lunch with his best friend. He insisted the food is still good and the service has improved. I'm still not much of a sushi fan, but I humored him and took him up on his offer to go there during their Happy Hour specials (3-6pm)--hey, he was paying, so who am I to argue? ; ) 

I ordered their chicken bowl ($5.95) off the lunch menu (it ends at 4pm, but we got there at 3:30). Each time before this I'd been there as a vegetarian. However, I've since welcomed chicken back into my life and I'm glad this was one of the few times I've had it since. The chicken was grilled and chopped in nice size pieces. There were plenty of veggies around in the bowl and they gave a good sized portion of rice. The sauce though.. I looove sauces and this did it for me. It brought everything together. 

Not realizing that their appetizers weren't just  going to be something small, say.. 3 or 4 pieces of sesame chicken ($4, I think), my boyfriend ordered one along with his sushi. Everything came out on time and we were offered free miso soup. I don't think we realized just how much food they were going to bring and we each had leftovers to bring home (me with half of my giant chicken bowl and him with sushi and several pieces of sesame chicken). 

Now, the service. They greet you when you walk in. And not just one person, anyone working there who sees you loudly mumbles a Japanese greeting, hard to explain a ""loud mumble"", but that's what they do. I didn't see the rude waitress from last time anywhere and we were taken care of by a very friendly waitress and waiter who refilled our glasses after only a few sips. Huge improvement, service-wise. In fact, everything was perfect enough that we came back a few days later and recieved practically the same 5-star treatment. I normally don't like to go to the same place so close in time, but it really is worth it. 

My ONLY complaint, and this is completely not their fault is that I have a feeling they may not be around long because it always seems like we are maybe one couple out of 2-4 couples dining at any given time (the exception being the night we received crappy service). 

In total, our bill (on both visits) was under $20 before tip and I can't say enough good things about their food (even a couple of their sushi rolls I caved and tried--bbq chicken roll is my, along with our waitress' favorite!)",2010-02-12 15:50:06

But I'm not really sure why it took me this long to find this place! My mom suggested it and we went on a random Thursday. The place had two tables taken when we walked in but the later the night went, the more people came. I can't lie, though, I was a little put off by the inside appearance at first but do not judge a book by its cover (or in this case, it's inside??). 

Thai Spoon has all of the staples of a Thai restaurant- pad Thai, Thai basil, Tom yum/kha, drunken noodles, summer rolls, etc. I am also set on finding the best Tom Kha in the city and up until today I thought I had but nope, Thai Spoon hit it on the nose for me! It's my absolute favorite soup. So of course I ordered a cup and my mom ordered the summer rolls. Summer rolls were fresh and delicious. My soup was for sure the best I've had. Creamy and a bit sour, and lots of big mushrooms, chicken and cilantro. I'm NOT a mushroom lover - I'm a mushroom hater, but I will eat them in this soup because I love it that much, especially when they're in bigger cuts like this and not small and slimey. Also my soup was spice 2 because I don't like it too hot. Perfect spice level. 

For our entrees my mom ordered the Thai basil chicken at a 7 and I ordered spicy fried rice at a 5. I could've went higher but wasn't sure how spicy they did their food. My mom's 7 wasn't bad at all, we even used their spice rack. If you love spicy food, you could definitely do their 10. The flavors of both dishes were spot on. Although they both could've done with a little more Thai basil, they were steaming hot and delicious. We both ate ALL of our food and had none for leftovers because it was honestly that good. 

Lastly, the service was great. The people who work there are very kind and quick. Our drinks were always full and our table was always cleared when need be.

Although it can be difficult to navigate your way though this place things are at a better value price than other grocery stores. Although the selection is limited, most of the prices are pretty good especially when it's on sale. 

They have so many things in a one stop shop, from TV's to bananas, from paper shredders to tooth paste, they seem to have a bit of everything in portions that seem impossible to use up before the expiry date. 

Then you've collected everything you need in your cart, time to wait in line to pay, but the line ups don't end there, you also need to line up to exit the store where there draw a line on your receipt. I assume they are checking what's in your cart too, but no one has taken more than a quick glance at my cart before drawing a line on my receipt.

Best of all - it tastes great and is some of the best sushi I've eaten. At the end of our meal, they gave us a free sample of the frozen yogurt as well to try out.

Great food, great ambiance, and great service (thanks to our amazing server and his server assistants)!  

Started off with a spider roll to share. Not bad. Not out of this world but it was good. 

I went with the Korean Bulgogi that came with jasmine rice and kimchi. Thought it tasted pretty great. Better than your average Bulgogi, nice consistency. 

My dad went with the Angus Burger which we both assumed wasn't a popular selection at an Asian restaurant. But to our surprise, it was so tasty (probably even better than my order). It came with a side salad and a side of fries so you didn't have to debate whether to take the healthy or the unhealthy route. The meat was well-prepared and the overall presentation was great!

The food was good, but I can't help but to write a review on a chain restaurant (which I rarely do) because... isn't Outback known for their service? Maybe I am imagining things, but at one point Outback was like the ""Disney"" of the chain restaurant world.  Well, our waiter would have made Mr. Disney (of Outback) very upset last night. 

First, they tried to sit 9 grown people in a table so small we were on top of each other (and that's after we've been waiting at the bar). After we asked and someone upfront told one of us they would add another table, no one did anything until we pretty much did it ourselves. Then we had food coming out so far apart that those who didn't have food felt bad for those who had and told them to stop waiting because their food would be cold. Yet somehow when my prime rib came out, it was luke warm. Furthermore some of us did not have side items by the time it finally came out (ran out of mashed tater at 8ish pm on a Wednesday night?). My water cup was mostly not filled. And I had to ask the hostess upfront to get me a to-go box for my mushrooms since asking my waiter twice didn't produce any sort of a box.

So Josh decided that this was the place to be randomly on a Wednesday at 9:30. He made the right choice. 

He ordered the Angry Tiki, and the Big Ben. Their special on Wednesday nights is any dog and fries for $6. (In all honesty, josh can't get away anywhere without two meals.) I was lucky enough for him to let me try both. They were great. The tiki was weird, at first, but everything came together in the end. The Big Ben was perfectly strange. Whom ever came up with putting cole slaw on everything in Pittsburgh is a genius. He also had a side of sweet potato fries. They were okay, the one that I had was kind of underdone, but they were still good. 

I played it safe with the bacon cheese dog. It was great! Two slice of bacon; and a big blob of cheesy goodness. My fries were crispy, and their ranch tasted as close to eat n parks as you could get! I want more already.

So about the food...

- Burgers -- good but not remarkable.  
- Small chopped wedge salad --  pretty good actually.  
- Zucchini fries -- Ok.  That being said, you really can't turn zucchini into ""fries.""  What you actually end up with is strips of zucchini coated in breadcrumbs (or whatever it was) that cooks up somewhat crisp with zucchini inside that ends up being somewhat flaccid.
- Soda -- soda is soda.

For whatever reason the restrooms are located outside the restaurant...kind of like a gas station.  Not sure why or how that design choice was made, but it almost seems like they built the building and realized they forgot to put in a bathroom.  Not smart.

The seating in the restaurant is odd at best, horrible at worst.  The have some bar height tables with chairs that have low backs...not the most comfortable.  The rest of the interior has tables with long bench seats and what looks to be metal chairs.  I don't like long bench seats and I've yet to find a metal chair that is comfortable.  The outside seating area is similar.

The wait staff seemed pretty switched on.  However, we were asked if we wanted our salad and zucchini fries first followed by the burgers.  The salad and fries did show up first...immediately followed by the burgers.

Not sure I'll be back as I just didn't see the value in going.  That being said I'm sure they'll be wildly successful given their old town Gilbert location.

Situated inside of a plaza, My Cup of Tea Dessert is a wonderful place to go for some tea and catch up with friends. I recommend making reservations as many people reserve tables for their afternoon tea and the place is also very small. 

The overall service was okay. We were given a tray to choose our tea which were inside small jars. The writing on the jars was hard to read because it was written in chalk. We finally decided between 2 -- A red tea (Sunrise Something) and Organic Kyoto Cherry Rose (green tea). Both were very good! 

Let's get to the food! The display for the small afternoon bites was very cute! Each table had a different bird cage housing their scones, sandwiches and desserts. We were quite impressed with the serving & tableware. I like how fluffy and light the scones were. We had 2 different flavours -- earl gray and a regular scone. I preferred the earl gray especially with the jams since it was a little more special. Next, the sandwiches were delicious but nothing overly special. One was a grilled cheese, then there was a cheese and mushroom type mini sandwich bowl and then a tuna. I quite enjoyed the sandwich bowl and the tuna. The grilled cheese for me was delicious but normal. Finally, for the dessert, I was quite impressed with the jasmine jelly and the other tea mousse in the chocolate cup. Both is these were surprisingly well created and I found myself scraping every last bite. However, the biggest let down for the entire meal was the matcha mousse which was very sour and off balanced. No one at our table took more than 3 bites which is disappointing since it was well decorated.

There was one big table ( looks like owner's friends) and one other table. ( they came later than my table but they got food faster than us) 
After that, I was about to ask a check to owner but she didn't answer at all so I decided to walk to her to get a check. 
Ridiculous part is she smiled to other table and handed to them and tell thank,plz come back again.
But she just threw the check to my table without saying anything

I was meh'd...

They have been on my bookmarks ""to try"" ever since the DDD episode. I wish I hadn't tried them...it was a disappointment. 

They are a fast food joint with high end prices. It was odd. FFFD (Fast Food Fine Dining)

The staff was extremely nice and inviting, personal and fun. I looked over the menu before entering and 3 employees offered assistance. I walked in and was directed to the counter, ordering as if I was placing an order to go. I told the guy 3 times I was going to eat here. I sat down at the table and he said ""oh you want it for here?""

I sat at the table covered in white paper, like to draw on...(fast food) yet there was a battery operated candle thing. (Fine dining) There was Parmesan but no salt or pepper. OH... and a fake flower. 

He brought some bread, which was cold, some butter packets, which were cold and a plastic (throw-away) cup of water. I had finished my cold bread and my plate of pasta with meat sauce arrived. 

The pasta was good, the sauce had zero flavor. It was meaty but did not have a flavor at all. I tried a bit of Parmesan, nope. I asked for salt and pepper, didn't help. I was bumming. 

My meal, by myself, was $18.00 for a plate of noodles and boring meat sauce, and cold bread from Safeway. 

I will not be going back....",2014-12-12 21:29:12

Last Samuri Roll: spicy tuna, cuke, cilantro and topped with shrimp and spicy mayo. Very tasty, would order again.

Orion Roll: spicy tuna, cuke topped with cajun albacore and garlic sauce. Again, very good.

Oh! Philly: salmon, cream cheese, cuke deep fried. It wasn't a favorite I'd likely pass on it next time.

9-1-1: Very spicy tuna, only a slight heat at first, but then the burn follows. Very good, but do have a drink onhand. 

Baked Green Mussel was recommended by the waiter. Flavor was good, but it was overcooked and a tad chewy.

Cinco de Mayo: Like jalapeno popper on steriods... fried pepper, cream cheese, spicy tuna and topped with spicy mayo. Yum! Yum! Yum!

Finished with green tea ice cream, creamy and delicious.

Sushi came quick. We surprised them when we asked for our check. We ate quick and not nearly as much as most diners, apparently. We were stuffed, in any case. If I had the appetite I'd return for AYCE. The Cinco de Mayo alone might lure me back.",2010-10-26 22:40:42

I'm savvy on the peanut butter flavor and blood orange whenever they have it. Amazing flavor to capture in yogurt. Not easily done and scarcely done well. Pinkberry definitely has strengths and weaknesses when it comes to toppings. The dark chocolate crisps are something from heaven. Incredible little morsels of crispy chocolate joy. We actually had them at our wedding with our froyo bar. The only downside is the fruit. A little large cut for my liking. Not a deal breaker, just don't typically order any fruit on my yogurt due to the larger sizes. Small dice is the way to go.

If you want an intimate setting to dine with your main squeeze or a large group of people, this place has little nooks for every party size. 
And the décor is spot-on - take a look at the pics!
We had a group of 10 people, and from our little booth you couldn't even see another soul. 
The best part was the meu - attention Gluten-intolerant people! You have access to 2/3 of their menu, as most of their Moroccan cuisine is gluten free!  We even had a celiac at our table and she had no problems ordering at all. They even had a coconut based dessert that she could have, and apparently it was delicious!
I had a tajine, as I've never had Moroccan food and asked for help from our super friendly waiter. (seriously, he was amazing!). I selected a sweet stew, and it was very sweet, though it grew on me as I continued eating.  Everyone else selected more savory dishes, and everyone cleaned their plates, so I'm guessing it was good!

First Impression:
The website is user-friendly and designed very well (after seeing many poor business websites, I can really appreciate this). There are videos on the introduction (what one can expect) as well as a brief two-minute safety video for anyone wishing to visit. The tabs at the top of the site, are as follows: attractions, parties, pricing, hours/location, gallery, safety, tickets, waiver (**TIP**: do this online, to save time). Families can choose to have a membership (*extras not included*), which seems like the best option, versus one-time use tickets. Inside the trampoline park, there is an advanced section and a ""Kids 6 and under"" section, and of course, in between those two levels.

Opens daily at 10 am. Located in the area of Decatur and Sahara, kitty corner from Savers (formerly an office supply store), which seems to be blossoming again with new businesses opening recently (the shopping center on Sahara, across the way, included). Lots of parking available. Spacious inside.  

Large green *Happy Hour* sign is posted on the front window/ door. When you walk in, to your left is the counter to pay and get your tickets. Everyone gets wristbands (even non-participating parents). (Outside socks are not allowed. For a charge, you will use socks with grip nubs on the bottoms.) To the right of that space, along the wall, are posted signs and the place to sign your waivers (if you didn't do this already online). Opposite this space is the long cubby space area (very spacious), there is a tall one and a short one- this is where you store your socks, shoes, purses, backpacks, and outside drinks (**TIP** to the Ladies: bring your wristlet for your valuables with you, if you are not participating in the activities). Water is allowed into the area. 

The rest of the floor level:
No outside food is allowed. There is a snack bar (some examples: k-cups Starbucks Americano, cup-a-noodle soup)---the attendant was smiling as we went past, a good sign. The three party bays are in this area (good size, clean areas, & picnic tables). (Pricing for parties look pretty reasonable.) TIP: Do not lean up on the walls decorated with chalk, especially, if you're wearing white! The opposite wall has two water fountains, bathrooms, and stairs leading up the VIP party bay space. Also, there is an exit from the field area for those needing bathroom breaks.

The field space:
A loudspeaker announcement is made for the color wristbands able to enter the play space (and that's how you know when your play time is up). Before entering, you must listen to the general rules, **landing on two feet** (*posted signs everywhere are a reminder*). Left side: There is a designated area for little ones 6 and under. The square foam balls are pretty firm and safe for the little jumpers. But sometimes, they might need help getting out. In the middle is the mini rock-climbing wall (only one person can jump in when it is empty) combo area, combined with another section for foam balls and trampolines. The last area is the advanced section of two squared off areas. Back wall: Ninja obstacle course- monkey bars, single level ladder steps, more foam balls, disc type, a large climbing net on the end. Right side, back: Dodgeball court (balls to use are inside). Right side, along the wall: Levels 1-5- advanced level only (coach approval required). Middle of the field, was a long series of trampolines, three lanes deep---compared to the rest, only used sporadically by the kids. I didn't see any debris in this area.         

We went last night. The high energy music was loud but we could still hold conversations. Gym wear is what I observed, would be best to wear. (Wrestling shoes are allowed in the advance sections.) Our son used all the spaces, except the advanced ones. Our nephews had different favorites: the oldest liked the rock climbing wall, the middle one liked the obstacle course, and the youngest one liked it all. Our two-year-old niece liked the foam balls, but she was going back and forth between that area and the trampolines---I think she just liked jumping a lot. Our nephews were pretty sweaty and had red faces from all the activity. The black feet can be remedied with baby wipes before the kids out on their socks and shoes (*another **TIP** for mommies). 

All in all, the kids had fun, and so I can firmly attest that this place is a great family attraction. The vibe is fun, once you follow the rules, safety first.",2017-07-14 18:16:37

It was even exciting enough that we were able to snag a table for four at the always busy (for good reason) restaurant on a Saturday. The ambience is casual and jovial. You get 5 star service with a 3 star outfit.

The food is anything but casual. It has put on it's best outfit and come from the kitchen to greet your five senses.

The staff and service are just top notch. They always find the right timing to come by and ask if everything is to your liking or clear the table away for the next course. They were very knowledgeable in helping us choose a nice red wine to enjoy during the meal.

There were some very memorable dishes that night:

Uni on toast: ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom. This dish was such a hit and I loved it so much. The uni was so fresh and had that deep taste of the seas umami. It looked almost too good eat. Almost being the key word. Incredibly awesome.


Iceberg wedge: a greater starter with that crunchy lettuce, wild rice, nuts, chives, and dressing. Really balanced out the richness of the uni on toast.


Lamb sirloin: lamb was cooked perfectly and had that great gamey flavour. Well executed.


Aloette burger and fries: leveling up the burger with some premium chuck in the patty. Never had beaufort cheese before but it seemed to compliment the patty and then some finely chopped slaw.


Seriously, even the bread with the house butter was above and beyond.

I stopped by this store and had them run a battery check. Despite having a charge, it read as a bad battery. Just to make sure, the technician ran an alternator check as well which passed.
However, one of the other technicians thought it was weird that my battery could fail and they were even able to do an alternator check. Apparently the only way to get to the alternator check on the computer system is to have the battery pass.
Before I was rung up, they did a second check just to make sure it was the battery. This time it definitely was as I had a rapidly dropping charge.
It only took a few extra minutes to conduct the second check but they wanted to make sure they were selling me the right parts.
I am perfectly capable of changing a battery but because I was in my work clothes, they offered to change the battery out for my at no extra charge and since they had the tools already handy, I let them.

Earlier in the year, we purchased an investment property and needed someone to fix up several small things in the house. One of which included fixing up the kitchen cabinets. Several contractors we received bids from gave us so much grief regarding the cabinets (said we needed to replace them) and also fixing the spa tub. They wanted to charge us an arm and a leg, too. 

I found Mike through an ad on Craigslist and called him in a last-ditch effort. My husband immediately liked him but the most important part was that Mike wasn't afraid to take on the things we wanted. He didn't hesitate to say that fixing the kitchen cabinets wouldn't be a problem. Being a handyman, his prices were extremely reasonable. Mike demonstrated excellent communication with my husband and we appreciated being informed every step of the way. He also had a great sense of humor and we enjoyed interacting with him. 

Mike was also perfectly fine going to Home Depot with my husband so that we could purchase supplies on our Home Depot card. Incredibly, he even struck up a few deals with the salesperson to save us more money!  A few times while we were at the property doing yardwork, he was quick to lend us any of his tools to help us out. 

All in all, we were very pleased with his work on the house (fixing and rebuilding the kitchen cabinets, removing and installing a new tub, repairing and installing landscape lighting controls that were stolen, installing and repairing lighting, plumbing, and repairing various components on the exterior of the house).

We opted to have dinner at Noodles Ranch and dine in.  The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night, but we were seated quickly.  

That was the only thing quick about the experience.  Actually, our orders were also taken quickly, but service went downhill from there.  Our spring rolls arrived, and I had to ask for napkins as there were no utensils on the table.  The food runner almost looked confused and brought over a few pathetic scraps of paper usually found in a dispenser.  So I was off on a rant over that...especially when I looked down and saw a full-sized sucker on the floor.  I guess we weren't worthy.  Food took forever, but when it finally arrived we realized again we had no utensils.  My husband spotted some chopsticks and took matters into his own hands to retrieve them.  No one ever came by to check if we needed anything, and my husband who by now should have put an apron on, found soy sauce for me.  The check arrived slowly and without an offer of dessert.  

Why four stars you ask?  Because I really did enjoy the food.  The spring rolls were okay, but our entrees were great.  My husband ordered a special of noodles and yellow curry with chicken.  The curry was spicy and flavorful.  I was sort of jealous.  I had the Yakisoba with seafood. They skimped on the shrimp, but there was plenty of chicken and pork (the pork was my favorite anyway) and lots of veggies.

_SO8zgxTG17eitnPKoQyTw,xVV86BToDOQGxE1gt9MMvg,1hpF63f2NFRMS4xdw42RMQ,3,1,0,0,"We came here for teppanyaki. The menu selection is pretty good. They have a decent selection of seafood ranging from mussels, salmon, to scallops. For meat, they have chicken, steak, beef rolls, mushroom beef rolls, and short ribs. You can also order sushi. Their sushi selection was decent. I like how they have octopus and squid. My favourites! Noodles, rolls, and various kitchen stuff round out the menu.

Since I consider this a teppanyaki restaurant, I don't put much weighting on sushi menu. But it's passable if it was just a regular sushi AYCE place. All the items on their sushi menu can be found almost anywhere. We didn't order much from the sushi menu. But it certainly didn't hurt the score I'm giving it. It's a nice option.

The teppanyaki experience was passable. If you're considering going, you should ask yourself why you want teppanyaki. If you want a show where the chef does tricks, Maki Sushi is NOT the place to go. Maki Sushi's teppanyaki is decent value for delicious food. If you want a show, you need to go to more upscale places. The food will probably taste the same though as Maki uses pretty high quality ingredients. The chef does exactly one trick, and that is to set the table on fire. Looks cool. 

Maki loses points on being lame on ordering. If you arrive early, you have to wait maybe 20 minutes for everyone to place their order and also for the kitchen to prep the stuff. The wait didn't bother me as much as how they keep screwing up our portions. Don't bother asking for multiple portions. If feels like they will give you the same portion no matter what. So it's not as ""AYCE"" as they advertise. They only do 2 rounds of cooking. They actually forgot to give me vegetables. I know scallops can be a little expensive but being stingy somewhat ruined my experience. And how do you forget to give me vegetables? Maybe it's because we had a Groupon? Or maybe I was the only one who wanted vegetables so it was not worth the effort of prepping it in the kitchen? 

In between waiting, you'll probably end up ordering some sushi. Which is what happened. On the bright side, everything we ordered was delicious. 

As usual, I don't mind bad service too much. I generally only care about the food. The experience is what I make of it with whoever I'm with. So I can overlook this ordering fiasco because the prices are not bad at all. Teppanyaki is about $29 pre tax. It's a bit more expensive than your regular sushi buffet but I think it's worth it for the seafood stuff. And there's something about watching food cooked in front of you that's satisfying. There are several teppanyaki places in GTA but most are not AYCE, and many of them are significantly more expensive. Maki Sushi is the place to go if you want AYCE teppanyaki at a reasonable price.",2013-09-17 20:21:48

We found some covered pavillions outside that came equiped with benches for eating.  There are also bbq stations free for anyone to use.  

We did not venture inside to ask about hiking trails but I have been here once on  my own and did some fantastic trails.

I got there around 1:30pm and I must have just missed the lunch crowd. There was only one other diner and another couple paying their bill. Most of the tables were still being cleared and I actually had to wait a couple of minutes for a table to be reset.

Their lunch buffet is offered only on Thursdays and Fridays and has a very limited selection. The steam table had only eight items, including butter chicken, tandoori chicken, fried fish, curry goat, and chickpeas. Another warmer had basmati rice and an assortment of samosas and pakora.

Unfortunately, the food items were not labeled and the serving spoons were dangerously hot to the touch. Ouch!

The food tasted good, maybe even very good. The butter chicken was a little on the sweet side but the sauce was nice and creamy. The goat was tender and well seasoned. The other dishes were also well cooked. Fresh naan was brought to my table, hot and crispy, at least the first piece was. The other two pieces were a little thicker and reminded me of pizza crust but not in a bad way.

Overall, I enjoyed the food. Other than the hot utensils, the service was much better than my last visit. My server mentioned there was a change of ownership since then. That's a good thing.",2016-09-01 20:10:18

First off the name of this franchise in chinese translates to 'Fat Cow Noodles' with a picture of a fat cow. However the english name that is displayed is ""Pho Vietnamese Delight"". Always a big pet peeve of mine when it comes to chinese vs english names for businesses.

This place is no where near authentic viet but the food is still good. The portion sizes are massive and you do get your bank for your buck. A small pho is almost like a medium-large. Can you imagine what their large is like? I'm a big eater but I can barely finish a small on its own. The broth is flavorful and not fatty like other places such as XeLua and Pho88. However the broth also is a bit different then genuine pho. There's something about it that makes you want more. You WILL be thirsty afterwards as they over power your meal with MSG.  The other dishes such as rice or vermicelli dishes are as well very good. Portion sizes are big for those too.

Service wise, they are crap. Like all their franchise locations, they follow the stereotypical chinese/mainland service with rudeness, dirtyness and greedy for cash. Like for example, i do not appreciate having my table wiped clean with the same cloth used to wipe the food/soup that was spilled on the floor. I do not like to be moved to another table midway through my meal to accommodate a larger group. I also do not like the bill served to me when i'm still eating to hint that i need to go to accommodate others. I also do not like to be told that the amount on the bill is before tax and tip although i'm still taking out cash from a different pocket to accommodate the tax and tip. Oh and the greatest one yet, having their server speak to you in mandarin but realize you do not understand them so they make some snarly remark. I questioned ""pardon me""?... he gives me the ""argh"" and shoves me back. 

All of the above has happen in multiple occasions but why do I come back? Well it is because it's the closest pho place near my work and the broth is good. Otherwise I would never come back.

The location is a little on the shady side.  It's in an office building upstairs where I was stopped twice and asked for money by homeless people.  I went to fix my brother's phone screen for Christmas.  I checked in and got an offer of a free screen protector (score!).  They took the phone, quoted me a price, and said it would be ready in a hour.  No problems.

When we came to pick the phone up, I had to remind them of the promotion several times before the finally and reluctantly gave me the screen protector. Then, when we got the phone home, the charger wouldn't fit.  We tried several different charges- nothing.

When we took it back, it was suddenly our fault.  We must have done something.  There was a little back and forth- they took the phone to the back and came back to tell us it was lint.  He wanted to charge us and gave us a really hard time about the whole situation.    
Here's the thing.  It fit on the charger before we took it in to this place.  After doing business here, the charger did not fit.  Do you see my problem?

For the wedding:

We arrived at 5PM and it took about three hours for all of us to get manicures and pedicures. Given, there were 5 of us, but I still felt like it took a really long time given that we all had our own technicians. We made an appointment in advance so it was no surprise that they'd be getting full with us there. My pedicure was very good, lasted almost a month (shellac) and my manicure lasted a very long time too (shellac) but I wasn't happy with the color (my fault, not theirs). I do feel like you get less of a pedicure experience here, they don't do a very good massage or spend a lot of time besides on the prep of your feet and nails. For 5 of us, with a few shellac manicures and pedicures and a few with tips, it was about $480 altogether, not too bad.

For New Years Eve:

We received similar service to that when I was there for my wedding. The pedicure leaves something to be desired, although my toes do look great and she did a good job. I wasn't happy at all with my shellac manicure. The polish I chose was sheer, which is fine, but she did 3 coats and when I got into natural light, I could see that it was streaky as hell. She didnt want to put a fourth coat on but she should have. It's been not quite a week and a half and its already starting to peel off, which is annoying for how much you pay when you choose shellac. 

I was very disappointed this last time and won't return as I live in Whitby and its just too far to go for a sub par mani/pedi experience. For a $67 manicure, it wasn't up to snuff.",2017-01-09 19:51:53

One of the better rewards I was lucky enough to snag in the couple minutes that it sold out in was the 2-for-1 Chef's Tasting Dinner for 200,000 LPs. This covered $150 of the bill (price for one person). 

I have never been part of such a fancy dinner in my life!

The first thing the chef did was check in with us to see if we had any dietary restrictions. Then, as customary, he took our drink orders. We were surprised to learn a glass of wine only averaged about $10 with our dinner. My mom mistakenly ordered a red wine when she meant white, so we switched. The chef then offered to get us a new one, which was super nice of course; but we were fine.

He also asked if we had any time restrictions. We did, as we had the shark reef at 7 pm and a then a show in another hotel. (Our reservation at Lupo was at 5 pm). He was able to make sure we left on time.

I don't know the names of all the dishes, they were too fancy for my vocabulary. I know the first dish was some kind of raw meat, I think a beef carpaccio dish? After that, I don't know the order, only that we had some fish, some delicious pea ravioli, shrimp and vegetables, a pistachio soufflé with raspberry gelato, and a chocolate layered ice cream-like dessert.

Everything was heavenly. The sauces and spices that made the flavoring of all the dishes were the best and most unique I have EVER had. It is no wonder this restaurant is so highly renown and this dinner so pricey! And oh my god, how did he know I love pistachio flavored anything, and soufflés are of course my favorite dessert! He combined them and I was stunned by my tingling tastebuds. It was like they were singing in joy.

Our total came to $183 including the 2 glasses of wine. We tipped $50 taking in account for the $150 we didn't have to pay for... but now rethinking this amount while not drinking, I think we should have tipped more.... like $15 more? Well, next time...

The one star is for the poor customer service, the food is nothing exceptional. The first thing you notice when you walk in us that is smells like bad breath! Eeeew! Should have been our first red flag!

We were a party of four on a Thursday afternoon and the place is small and crowded. Waited for a hostess to seat us and was told 10 minutes to wait for a table when they clearly had a clean table for four ready in the back corner. It was very awkward standing in the doorway as people came in and others left. A waitress gave us menus to look at while we stood in the entry way. About the same time a single man (who came in after us) was seated at the table for four that I mentioned earlier. WTF. Really?!?! 

We waited and were finally seated. The menu was greasy and had lots of misprints and old prices scribbled out with new prices written in. Not very professional or appetizing. 

The waitress was rude, slow and acted like our request for a side dish and chop sticks was a big inconvenience. The food was basic and boring. No real flavor. Who the hell serves mayonnaise on potstickers??? The Pad Thai was a small portion and half of my plate was just a huge handful of bean sprouts. The dish does not come with rice here, like it does in every other Thai restaurant in the world. Skimpy.

Disclosure: we were on the VIP list because my girlfriend works for the chef's brother, however, we paid for our entrees and I saw the other tables get the same level of service that we did, so the only difference between the VIP treatment and the unwashed masses is a plate of pastries, a yogurt parfait, and a charcuterie plate.

But that pastry sampler is an excellent place to start.  The cream cheese danish was something that I'd happily roll around naked in.  The pastry was light, airy, and flaky.  The cream cheese was light, and more like a sugary custard than the filling that you might get elsewhere.  The GF loved the sticky bun.  You could make a meal out of the pastries alone.

The yogurt parfait was kind of lost on me.  It was sweetened with fresh strawberries, which I'm sure would make most people happy, but since I don't eat that fruit, it didn't move me.

On the suggestion of the waiter, I ordered the Chicken with Waffles.  This is a dish that I would normally pass on (what does chicken have to do with waffles anyway) but the waiter's description intrigued me and I'm glad I took the advice.  It's a good balance of savory and sweet, with chives mixed into the sourdough waffles and a half chicken.  Tip:  let the maple syrup mix with the sauce that you pour over the chicken.  It's awesome.

Service was top-notch.  Granted, we were on the VIP list, so they were sucking up to us and we had a team of people swarming over our table from time to time, but looking around, they did that for everyone.  And for the price you pay at Bouchon, you deserve that kind of treatment.

Went a few weeks back with my wife for a early dinner. I got the impression from friends that it gets crazy busy at times so it was nice to come when it was slower. Very cool building - they did a great job converting an old space into something interesting. We were upstair which has a cool vibe and a casual and comfy feeling. Started with the Fried Cedar Grove Cheese Curds - these were good but ours were a touch overdone and it came with a ton of paprika-lime mayo (only really needed about a 1/3 of what they gave us). The main menu is basically two types of pizzas - Steel Pan and Wood fired. We decided to try one of each. Needless to say we don't mind leftovers (especially when its pizza!). I got a Wood-Fired pizza on special that night - a Jambalaya pizza with andouille sausage. It had great taste but needed a touch more cheese. It was kind of Jambalaya on pizza crust instead of Jambalaya flavored pizza. Still not a disappointment at all and the slightly burnt wood-fired taste was very good. My wife got a build your own steel pan. Pepperoni and mushroom I believe. She loved it - crunchy burnt cheese around the crust and great flavor. We had a debate over which style was best. I think I liked the burnt flavor of mine but the taste of hers. Guess we'll have to come back again and try some more! Service was great and we had a great time - I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars - it was a bit expensive and I wasn't blown away... I rarely give 5 stars (reserve those for outstanding places) but this was definitely like a 3.75. I'll try to come back again soon and see if the next visit seals the deal. Nice place though.

After a hike around the arboretum my fella and I decided we could splurge. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers (standard order comes with lettuce, tomato, american cheese, and pickles), cheese curds, and a vanilla malt. (Total of $19) Cheese curds were great - standard issue, normal serving, but who is going to argue against fried cheese!! The burgers were classic - served medium. I would sub the cheese for Swiss and ask for the bun to be toasted - but that's just me. The ""malt"" however was a low point...it lacked malt flavor, had lots of ice chunks, and was very thin...sorry but at $4.50 they can do better! - The server did give us two plastic cups and spoons - so splitting is not extra.-

We enjoyed their beer selection and immediately ordered one for the lady and I.  We ordered the brisket banh mi and a burger for the lady with fries. The brisket was $11 with an extra $3 for a side salad. The burger was around the same. The burger came out and was good but small and overpowered by the lettuce on top. The brisket sandwich lacked any brisket. A $11 brisket sandwich should have more than one layer of brisket. It also didn't complement the bread (which was good). The bread was large and at least three times the height of the brisket which further made the lack of brisket even more significant. The sandwich had good flavors but ultimately would have been happier eating at subway.  Hopefully they're able to add some more meat to that sad sad brisket sandwich.

For a Japanese cuisine, the food here tastes too Chinese. The noodles are very bouncy and chewy, and the portion sizes are small. The supposedly ""runny eggs"" were overcooked and the yolks had already solidified (if you follow my reviews, you'll know that this component is really important to me). I ordered the ""Pork Cartilage Ramen"" and I expected the cartilage to be in individual pieces like the picture on the menu but it came as one big chunky piece. I found this difficult and awkward to eat. The one sliver of narutomaki was so thinly sliced that I could barely even chew it and the soup base was very disappointingly bland.
I'm not a fan of spice but my partner ordered the Spicy Ramen at Level 2 and found it uncomfortably spicy. He also ordered extra ramen which came as a side order in a bowl without soup (it's mentioned on the menu as well), which I found weird.

I had the Huevos Rancheros. Anytime I see this offered in a menu, I get it, so I'm kind of an expert. I wasn't overly impressed, but it was all right. There were way too many tortilla strips, which made the dish hard to manage. It was more like a ""build your own"" since all the ingredients were separated on the plate. Good flavor though.

Forced with the choice to either reinvent themselves or fade into oblivion like other dinosaurs, see Blockbuster video for an example, the Best Buy executives figured this one out. 

I came in here over the weekend needing a new universal remote control for my home theater system. I wanted to take a look and feel different ones of my hand for comfortability. I finally settled on one, had no intention of buying though since Amazon offered it for much less. I asked the sales clerk, when will you guys start matching Amazon.com for prices. His answer was, we do now!

After showing him the price on Amazon's website he gladly matched the price and I left giving Best Buy my money and not having to wait for it to be shipped from Amazon. Bravo Best Buy, you are back in business with me!",2013-04-29 20:05:09

I recalled they had a good happy hour. Decision made, we sauntered in. I asked the hostess if they were still having happy hour and she said it went until 7pm and was only in the bar. We spotted a lonely bar table and sat there. Our waitress was quick to arrive and take our drink order. During Monday's happy hour, it's Margarita Monday, so the larger sized margaritas are $5. (Smaller sized ones are $3.) Margaritas can be any number of flavors - mango, strawberry, etc. I asked if they had coconut but unfortunately not. I decided to go with a house margarita on the rocks. My husband went with blended. Our drinks arrived quickly and in a large glass. (The glasses reminded me of the heavy margarita glasses that Chili's uses.) For a house margarita, the drink was really good and really strong on the tequila. Wowza, these were some strong drinks. (Even the blended drink. I was totally thinking premade slushie machine but I seriously think they made the drink then threw it in a blender.) 

During happy hour, the appetizers and tacos are half price. The appetizers include flatbread, nachos, ceviche, etc. We decided on the shrimp flatbread and chicken tacos. The flatbread came out on a long rectangular board and three tacos to a plate. The flatbread was good but really it was on square crackers - kind of like matzo. I kept joking it should be called shrimp crackers (totally the tequila talking). The chicken tacos were good too with a huge slice of avocado on them. When the tacos ran out, my husband decided to order fish tacos (mahi mahi). These came out quickly and were delicious as well. When the flatbread and tacos were gone, our waitress asked if we had room for dessert. My husband inquired which of the desserts were really good - he couldn't decide between the flan, brownie, or apple pie. Our waitress said the apple pie was surprisingly delicious and one of their most popular desserts. How could we resist? The dessert comes out with several dishes. There's a huge cast iron plate that is scorching hot and this is where the brandy butter sauce is poured upon. As this sizzles and cooks up, the apple pie is placed in the butter, and then ice cream is dropped on top. As a non-apple pie lover, this was pretty good. I enjoyed the brandy butter sauce and ice cream the most, they tasted great together. Unfortunately, our eyes were much larger than our stomachs and we couldn't finish this dessert.

He said Fried Zucchini. Man, he was speaking my language. After a short wait; everything was steaming in front of us. Emma's cheese sticks were just that, but still melty and delicious. Those zucchini planks though. WOW. Tim said they hand bread them to order, and slice them fresh everyday. You could tell. And their ranch was amazing too. 

Then came the sandwiches. I got the Roast Beef Au Jus. HOLY CATS this sandwich is large. Emma decided on a steak hoagie with lettuce, ranch, and tomato. She loved it. The bread was toasted just right on both sandwiches. Mine was apparently the last roast beef to be served that day, and I'm so glad I got it before they ran out. That sandwich was good.

The Udons and the mini Miso Garlic pork belly bowl were satisfying. The onigiri, inari, and Pork bao were average. The bao needed Keupie mayo and cilantro to complement the entire sandwich. This place is evolving to customers requests which will keep them in the game as a Go To place for Udon, nice work.",2018-02-09 00:13:58

Really neat restaurant that is located at a farm that also has orange groves, a vegetable stand and a coffee shop. Great menu that has burgers, chicken sandwich's, ribs, dogs, salads, and much more. All of the food is fresh and made daily. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and my wife had the regular grilled chicken sandwich. I also order grilled squash with mine and the wife had fries. There is also an all you can drink beverage bar. Items such as milkshakes and bottled drinks are available too.
The food was great! The meals were fresh off the grill and are filling. 
Seating is available inside and outside. There are picnic benches located around the restaurant outside. We sat at one located under a huge Pondarosa pine. 
There is also a coffee shop on the grounds and it smelled wonderful inside! The fruit stand has an honor system to pay for fresh vegetables and fruit.
Great experience and would go back. Oh, and the manager came by and wanted to make sure we were happy with our meals.",2016-03-15 01:19:06
GryAAePs8rRenpk20NdmHg,Tc3GAQdAfOW542ROdyCZPg,Q3UkgxNNInsPcUFhsQFcrg,4,1,1,1,"This place has been around since ... well forever.. My parents have been coming here since we first moved to the area - way way back in 1987/88 - Plus it pretty much a family owned place, the daughters took over the business when the father passed on - but the quality is still there.

This place is only pretty much for take-out only - there is literally only seating along a counter against the window and that's it.

The prime time to hit this place up for your dinner meats is pretty much between 3- 5 pm any later and you might not get the selection you want, eg. their Roasted Pork - as they only roast two pigs a day, so once they sell out - they sell out. 

The service can be a bit slow, but its really on the two sisters manning the counter and there is almost always a line - so expect to wait anywhere between 0 - 30 min to getting service - but to me and my family that wait is worth while.

One of my siblings adore their rice boxes - which is a large take out container and you choose your meat, so in his case - his favourites are the BBQ Pork and Roasted Pork and it's a cheap meal that rings in under $10.

My mom's favourite is the (directly translated - old water) duck wings as one of her favourite things that this place has to offer. 

For me - I think my favourite is their curry squid, which sooo good, spicy, but not too spicy, and you get tender squid too.

I think my biggest gripe is that their stuff is good enough that they only make enough for each day and that's it, so once it's sold out - it's pretty much sold out.

Kum Hong has and will always be CASH ONLY - so bring cash with you.",2012-03-18 18:08:28

For starters, this restaurant is tiny! By tiny I mean it probably can't fit more than 20 people. But that is also why it makes this place feels cozy.

For appetizers I remember their butternut squash soup. That was very delicious! I am not a fan of butternut squash but the soup they made was great! I don't remember the entree I ordered but I do remember it being really good! I  pretty sure this is one of the few places that manages to keep their chicken dish juicy and tender instead of dry and tough! And lastly, omg dessert heaven! Doesn't matter what you get, they are amazing!!! From presentation to the taste, everything is awesome. I would totally come here just for the dessert.

Unfortunately our waitress wasn't the friendliest and seemed very uninterested in her job and the place she worked. The waitress knew I didn't eat meat , but still let me order the s'more dessert that was covered in bacon. Needless to say, I didn't eat it. To clarify; I do not eat mammal meat, but I do eat fish!

Aside from that, I loved the patio where we sat--but I think I had the weather to thank for that. My salmon was tasty, but not the best I have had. I loved that they paired edamame with it--very unique and I will take that trick home with me. I should have ordered the Grilled Veggie plate because my girlfriend ordered it and I ended up eating some of it, but I wanted to get some protein.

My salad was ok; not amazing. I did love that they included shaved radishes on the salad. That is also something I don't see often.

They definitely need to work on their service - it's slow and having all the staff linger around the bar, chit chat and eat there seemed a little weird/unprofessional? But whatever, place seems cool - I'd come back here with friends! The ambiance is beautiful and I was already envisioning spending many warm afternoons and evening on their patio enjoying a margarita or two. I came back a week later with some friends and this time we walked out just after a round of drinks and apps because the food was unimpressive and some aspects of the service were pretty bad too. My first time there we tried all the tacos and while the two chicken ones (fried & grilled) were really good, the others were mediocre. My second visit there we had the chips and guac, wings and calamari. The calamari was good, the guac was ok, but the wings were very gamey. What really drove us out though were the drinks. Aside from taking forever to get to us, they weren't even good. We also had a live bartending lesson going on behind our table at the bar, because of which they turned off the music. Really? 
we had to request it be turned back on (which they did eventually) because the place was really quiet and we could hear the step by step instructions on how our drinks were being prepared.

We are lucky to have a wildlife center like Liberty Wildlife for all they do for wildlife as small as a 1 inch newly hatched quail to large California Condors with wingspans as big as I am.  When I was a kid we probably took a stray orphan bird or two here, dropping them off and hoping for the best.  It wasn't until I graduated from undergrad that I heard about Liberty Wildlife again.  From education, to medical services, to outreach, and release back into the wild, almost every aspect of wildlife rehabilitation is covered at Liberty Wildlife.  

At the core of the foundation is an extensive network of volunteers and dedicated staff.  As a non-profit, they rely on the help of said volunteers and donations from the public.  In general, it's truly amazing to rescue a bird that has been on the brink of death and rehabilitate it so that it can be released back into the wild.  It is also truly amazing to see a non-releasable bird be taken ""under the wing"" at the center to be trained/tamed as an education bird.  Such examples are Frodo the burrowing owl (simply adorable!) and Liberty the bald eagle.  I am truly lucky to be a part of this wonderful organization.",2011-06-19 21:59:34

The minute you pour the sea salt, it shouldn't be mixing with the tea right away. But THIS happens because their sea salt is very RUNNY and WATERY. For $7, which is on the higher price end, I wanna be able to sip and enjoy the cap! The boba is still a no-no. IT HAS TO BE CHEWY, NOT SOFT. I don't think this place is gonna last a long time. I'd give it some 1-2 years. 

Original: I visited this place for 2 reasons: 1. I was so excited about their name because ""CLOUD TEA"" for me just screams overflowing SEA SALT CAP/LATTE. 

However, I was so disappointed. I ordered a Black Tea with Cloud Cap and the amount of cloud cap that you see in the pictures is not the same as what they actually give you. The cloud was so watery and runny like the consistency of a milk. Being a fan of sea salt caps, I already know how it should be. It should be thick with a consistency of a heavy cream. The quickest way you would know if it's a good sea salt cap is if it DOESNT MIX right with your tea. They should maintain a separation, as long as you don't mix it. But with theirs, you could see the cap mixing right away with the tea just when they pour the cap on top. They should take notes from Taste Tea or ITEA on how to make the right sea salt cap. 

The boba was also a disappointment. It was soggy and you could feel the starch of the boba melting in your mouth. Yuck! Boba should be chewy, with a little crunch and resistance when you bite it. It's either old or that's the way they really make it. 

I still wanted to give them a chance. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that I had a ""bad"" sea salt and boba that d If they truly have 5 Stars, I don't know how they got it though.",2018-09-21 05:03:08

The pear panini was satisfying and but the IKEA tables outside make me nostalgic for my own yard and my own cooking, thus reinforcing my tagline ""Vegetarian with a touch of snobbery""

I don't rate restaurants on their administrative prowess, but if I did I wouldn't give any to the TBC.  The waitstaff and management made it nearly impossible to process a reimbursement through the University of Illinois.  You would think, given their proximity to campus, that they would train people adequately with respect to how to handle the idiosyncrasies of receipt processing through the University.  Instead, I am wasting my work and personal time chasing down the original receipt for a charge entered incorrectly by a waitress.  And the day manager can't help me?  Um... I just recommend not going here at all if there is a chance you will need to then make your lifework sleuthing receipts.  Oh how fulfilling.

We were given an extra scrambled egg sandwich and we told the waitress that we already got all our sandwiches but they let us keep it and we were not charged extra for it. More food for me :)

The serving size is generous and the price-tag is very reasonable.

The staff is a couple and are very welcoming and eager to please. The gentleman left a very positive impression on me. The place is small yet has that nice homely feel to it, they're a relatively new business and I hope word gets out, this place should be filled with patrons.

How can you charge a $200 fine for smoking in a room, when no one from the staff has been in the room since you've been there? 
And what staff member, knocks on the door and then opens it at midnight?!? MIDNIGHT! 
While in the middle of a deep dream, I was jolted awake by a maid who wanted to know if I needed 'service'? Let me tell you...
The only service I want in the middle of the night, unfortunately is Not the kind of service the high-end casinos offer. Or maybe do, but that certainly wasn't the case in this situation. 

But I forgot to mention that South Point has some of the best cocktail waitress uniforms in the game. They're a little 'throwback' but the magic of them is that they make any body, look good and any great body, look amazing. Oh and did I mention the entire staff is very friendly. Welcoming. The kind of servers that make you feel relaxed that you're chugging free booze. 

As for the television. My room had cable only part of the time. I must have turned on the television twenty times and it read No Signal. Shouldn't happen, especially when you charge $18 for a one-time run in room movie. It's not necessarily even the price. Cause I get it. Two people go to a new movie, $20..but since I can get the same thing on Apple tv for half the price, how about letting me watch it as many as I can handle within the 24hr window?

The rampant stench of mediocrity is at every international airport, and I mean EVERY international airport (list: http://bit.ly/2c4CL6X), but for some reason, Phoenix Sky Harbor has some good eateries should your Uber get you there earlier than you expected or maybe you wanted. With an hour to kill, I decided to enter this expansive restaurant in Terminal 4. I was lured in by the $14 Shredded Kale & Quinoa Salad, which turned out to be a deliciously healthy choice with sunflower seeds, grapes, chopped tomato, and shaved Parmesan, all of it drizzled with lemon juice (photo: http://bit.ly/2npmbl0).

Remembered that we had received some gift cards from the in laws for the Cheesecake Factory.  Problem solved!  I had not yet been to this Cheesecake Factory since moving out to AZ.  We would go to the one in Mission Valley occasionally and the food/service was usually pretty good.  We came down here to this one today for a late lunch.

We arrived at around 3:00 and there weren't too many people there.  We got a seat immediately at a table and the waitress brought over the high chair.  We placed our order for drinks (waters, and my wife got an iced tea), got some bread delivered (sourdough and a honey oat type brown bread) and placed our order.  I had been scoping out the Yelp reviews and pictures online prior to arrival, and I saw a few pictures of fish tacos.  I had yet to have fish tacos since I moved to AZ, and they looked legit, and sounded legit, so I went with those.  My wife got a lunch sized portion of the pasta carbonara with chicken.  About 15 minutes later, our food was arrived.  Here is how it was..................

Fish Tacos-  These things looked great!  They hook you up with 4 nice sized tacos!  They came with double wrapped corn tortillas, a nice piece of tempura fried white fish which was both crunchy outside and moist inside,  some pickled onions and a little dollop of guacamole.  They usually come with a chipotle sauce, but I skipped that.  The tacos were mighty fine as they were.  Everything worked well!  They were legit fish tacos.  Maybe not as good as TJ Oyster Bar in SD, but they were damn good and better than a lot of fish tacos I have had.  I really liked the pickled onions!  They gave a nice little sweetness to the taco and they were buried under the actual fish.  These tacos were well constructed and just the right size to fill me up but not overstuff me.  The tacos also came with some black beans, and a side of ""green tint"" rice.  I sampled the beans, they were alright.  The rice had a unique seasoning to it.  Almost tasted a bit like pesto sauce, but then I caught a taste of something else.  Definitely unique, but I didn't finish all of it, mostly because I'm not the hugest fan of rice and/or beans.

Pasta Carbonara-  My wife thought it was a bit too ""oily"" so she couldn't finish it all.  I took her bowl of pasta from her and proceeded to have some.  I thought it was fine!  It had a nice sauce, lots of bacon, a little bit of chicken and a ton of peas in it.  I am anti pea, so I ate around all of those.  The noodles, bacon, sauce and chicken were very good.  I couldn't see myself eating a whole bowl of this (reason my wife couldn't finish it either) because it was pretty heavy, but a half portion or if you split this with someone, it was pretty tasty.

Service was fine.  Not great, not poor.  A-OK!  Total for everything was $0.00 thanks to the gift cards!  We skipped dessert and were on our way.  I would definitely come back and probably order the same thing.  Those fish tacos were no joke!  They were delicious as could be!",2016-01-29 00:39:19

   I've been working out at this gym for about 2 years now. I am a gym regular. I have invested in about $5,000 worth of training sessions and I purchase from $300 to $500 worth of supplements and gear on a monthly basis. 
   Yesterday, while doing ball bounces, a new trainer rudly interrupted me in the middle of my workout, she raised her voice and advised me that she was 'the trainer' there, and instructed me not to do ball slams because I wold damage the ball; these are cross-fit combat medicine balls with impact weight displacement meant for high intensity workouts, *meant for slamming hard*. ( I used to sell this stuff...I know).
   I've been doing ball bounces for about 2 years at this gym and I've never damaged a ball. All the other trainers have seen me train this way. But the staff has changed and unfortunately the customer service at this gym is gone. I don't feel that the trainer's approach was professional which is a big disappointment, since I used to like this gym very much. I go to the gym to positively improve my quality of life, the last thing I want to experience is someone yelling at me and disrespecting me in the middle of my workout. 
   As I am aware that I am just another customer there...customers come and go without relevance...I will look for a another gym that supports high intensity workouts.

I find the menu limited BUT enough for all tasting. The lunch menu is cheaper $8 for pasta, salad and soup of the day or $9 for udon/sandwich. They also have poutine available during lunch hour. However, lunch portion is much smaller (like maybe a bit less then 1/2 of dinner's portion). It may not be enough for someone particularly male who eats a large portion on a daily basis. I find the lunch portion was just right for me. (Very similar to portions that was serve in most restaurants in Japan for lunch menu)

Dinner is full portion, which I often need to pack 1/2 to go and save it for the next day. It is of course double the price or $5+ of lunch prices. 

Reasonable pricing and excellent food quality. 

I love the pasta, chewy and flavorful with the sauce. I like all of their sauces; from cream sauce to tomato to wafu sauce. I enjoy the garlic bread that comes on the side with the pasta. The bread was from Bakery Nakamura I assume. The dough was chewy, after toast was crispy. The flour has a hint of sweetness to it. 

Poutine was surprisingly good. I am not a fries person, and I don't mind ordering again. I had their nori fries which is wafu dressing with nori (seaweed). Simple yet yummy. Fries were crispy on the outside and soft potato texture inside. Every bite was hot and fresh. Not greasy at all. 

Dessert is good too, especially when you end your satisfying meal with a piece of cake or crème brulee with a cup of coffee. Typical Japanese café style. :)",2017-09-17 02:33:50

We arrived and were one of only a few tables occupied. We scoured the menu, there around 90 options if not more so making a decision was pretty tough to narrow down. Nothing is labeled as vegan, only vegetarian but it seems they can accommodate dietary restrictions for the most part. 

We ordered two entrees, naan and two garden salads. The salads and Naan were to start and to be followed by the entrees and rice that it comes with. As everyone else around us was served their fragrant food, we drank water and stared at our empty plates.

40 minutes passed, and they notified us that some employees had called off, which was understandable. Unfortunately as soon as I heard someone who just walked in order the same dish we did, and they rushed in out in less than 5 minutes I grew frustrated.

When our food finally arrived, it was simple and one note. It tasted exactly like dishes I've eaten many times before. The salad does not come with dressing, only a lemon to squeeze on top. The naan was thin and dry, likely because they had to omit the butter (no vegetable based butter available to my surprise).

First, the office was brand new, clean, inviting and the front office help were great.  As Jayce is going to live in Australia in about 6 months, there is lots of testing, vaccines and paperwork that must be perfect in order to proceed.  As I had previously spoke with Dr. Barbier on the phone, she had already did some checking up on requirements, and in fact, there were a few changes since we first spoke in July 2017 she told us about.  Front office help, Tiffany, was provided all records I had for the dog, and they copied everything.  Then it was time to meet the doctor.  She is a lovely gal and I love her approach to traditional and alternative practices.  She was very through and she examined Jayce and he had an ear infection we were unaware of.  She also gave him a vaccine, but he was so excited about treats, when she stuck him in his hind quarter area, he didn't even realize he had a shot.  We also wanted him to get the works grooming done, but unfortunately our schedules did not work out with the groomers hours, so next visit, in about 4 weeks he will stay for his beauty works.

He had to get a customer out of his seat to translate for me.  These are signs of truly authentic Mexican food.

Eating buddy told me about this place, said she read about it in New Times.  Kinda hard to find your way when coming from the eastside, being that the fwy and ""wall"" is in the way, and the entrance to 16th Street from McDowelll says ""no right turn"", cos it is one-way for a few feet there.

I picked pastor (pork) meat, Cabeza  (head meat), and lengua  (tongue) for my first round, all with onions, and cilantro on them.  The tacos all tasted pretty much the same when you put the salsas on, but they were GOOD!   One think I do not like at all, is that the salsa in the salsa bar  is SOOOO COLD, the salsa in there was bordering forming ice crystals.  It is like putting ice in your tacos, the meat was hot, but I want to keep the meat that way, when I eat it.  

I liked my tacos so much, that after my square dance ended, I knew Tacos Huicho was open till 11 and I came back to have three more tacos.  Tripa, Longaniza (chorizo), and carne asada.  I could not tell the tripa was tripa, but they assured me it was.  Out of the six meats, I decided Longaniza was my favorite and most flavorful.  Another Yelper was right tho, it was very greasy, and the orange grease puddled several times in my plate as I bit into the little thing.  Next time I go, I will order Longaniza in a burrito.  Oh boy, lotsa grease.

I give the food 5 stars, but the dirty and torn up seats, dirty tables, and food particles and Coke spills on the floor 1 star.  Seemed like more than 50% of the chairs, which had black pads, had major corners missing, showing white stuffing, and MANY had big canyons opened up in them that the stuffing had been excavated by butts sitting in them, over time.   Made me think, wow, do they make so little money that they can't at least buy cushions to cover the canyons, or replace with white resin yard chairs?  

There were food particles all over the tables and floor, and before I sat down there were spills of Coke right at my feet, large spills, so I put napkins over them.  Don't wanna walk out with sticky soles.  

But since the food is good and cheap enough to come back, again and again, despite 1 star for ""dirty and pathetically ripped chairs and food particles and spills throughout"", I will be generous and give my review 4 stars, one star for being open till 11, too, so I could go eat there AFTER square dancing ends at 9:30 pm.",2017-12-09 17:07:02

Last year I had pretty bad teriyaki chicken from here (yes, I know it's Japanese but coworkers erroneously said it was good), but chalked that up to ordering the wrong thing.  

I noticed that they use the ""cheap"" packaged soy sauce, as opposed to REAL brewed soy sauce.  I did not care for the taste when drizzled on the rice.

The sweet and sour chicken was almost inedibly salty.  Definitely on the extremely high level of sodium content.  Texture was squishy and not crunchy/fluffy/chewy enough.  Decent sized portion, and the sauce was on the side.  At least it want bland?

The orders of crab rangoon and fried won ton were both good.  Very little meat in the won ton, but at least the crab rangoon order wasn't chock full of onion.

The rice wasn't sticky and fresh.  It seemed a little old and dry.

I wouldn't recommend this place unless you really want at-or-slightly-below Panda Express level American Chinese food delivered.  Sadly, I've yet to find a higher than three star Chinese restaurant in Phoenix, and east valley restaurants won't deliver this far!

I placed an order for 20 loaves of cinnamon swirl bread last week and set up a day and time to pick them up.  When I arrived, I was pressed for time for another appointment and found they were still placing the bread in bags.  Luckily it worked out okay, so I placed an order for 50 more loaves for this week for gifts for friends and co-workers, and paid in advance.  When I arrived yesterday, none of the bread was bagged, and, because the loaves were still cooling, they were unable to completely twist-tie the bags closed because condensation would form.  This made me nervous because, thanks to my labrador, the back compartment of my car always has a little dog hair floating around, and who wants food with someone else's dog hair in it? They had run out of their store labels, so none of the loaves had this information, which I would have preferred so people knew where the yummy bread came from. They also grabbed a few loaves off the store shelves to complete my order. When I arrived home, many of the warm loaves were smashed because they were still so soft.  (The loaves they grabbed off the store shelves were fine because they'd already cooled and firmed up a little.)

Check-in was easy, and the room was decent.  The towels are lacking, as other reviews have noted, but the bathroom products are nice and the water pressure's respectable.  The room seemed pretty clean.  I got a latte at the downstairs Starbucks once, and while service was slow, my coffee was good.  I wish I would have caught the bartender's name, because he was the best part, and had great recommendations for things to do in town.

Parking was plentiful, and the location is convenient to a few restaurants and the freeway, if not the trendiest neighborhood-- it took me half an hour or so to get to spots like the West Side Market, Fremont and the zoo.  The group drunkenly playing yard games outside the side door was a little off-putting, but they weren't disruptive, and overall the hotel was pretty quiet.  WiFi isn't free unless you have a special business reservation or status with the Marriott chain.

gusaAUUOSRRwHYN1AZMa7Q,RBZ_kMjowV0t6_nv2UKaDQ,C0C7IxBSC1df0FwXODZCvw,4,8,4,7,"Well, I finally have a better idea of the goal behind Scottsdale Quarter. During construction of the Quarter, they opened up a restaurant here and retail store there, but they never gave much indication on what was going to be placed in the middle. Now I know: a lot of restaurants, shopping and entertainment! I like. 

Scottsdale Quarter really has it all. Shopping - both high end and low end, restaurants - both fine dining and average, snacks, coffee shops, home furniture, electronics, nightlife and yes, even a brand new state of the art theater! I could spend my entire Friday night here and have dinner, drinks, a movie and post-movie snack without moving my car. 

Architecture-wise, they did a pretty decent job. The courtyard area in the middle of the Quarter really opened up the center and I like the water works surrounded by benches, chairs and even lounge chairs! At times, it feels a little cramped, but it's not unbearable and it also makes me feel like I'm in a very urban environment. Parking can be a bit of a pain, but I've learned to just accept defeat and park underground. I wish that they offered some ""30 minute"" parking options, especially since they have some ""in and out"" style shops - like fro yo and coffee. They have one or two loading zone parking spots but they are always taken so hopefully they add some more! I wouldn't choose Scottsdale Quarter for a quick trip because it would take twice as long to find parking alone, but if they change that I definitely will. 

Between Scottsdale Quarter and Kierland across the street, this could be shopping and dining paradise. I hope that one day they create some sort of above ground walkway to go between the two shopping centers so that we can easily go back and forth without having to cross the busy intersection. 

All-in-all, I'm very excited that Scottsdale Quarter has come to town. They've brought in some wonderful local businesses and popular chains and it is a great option for those in North Scottsdale.",2011-04-01 01:09:45

Yelp brought this one to my attention and everything in the reviews looked good. They looked like they had a fantastic menu and a little bit of that comfort food style that always hits home. 

We made reservations on their website, though we likely did not need them for a Thursday. We arrived a bit early and they had no trouble seating us. I think the outdoor seating in an early evening would be great, but we were seated in the back. No problem, it was still early spring. David and his assistant were helping us with our orders and giving us great recommendations. It felt very cozy and the service was excellent from the get go!

The restaurant had a modern yet rustic feel with exposed wood and beautiful details. The bar table as you walk in was gorgeous! Everything in this place looked elegant and yet homey. Great look.

We ordered the Mac and Cheese (because it is almost impossible to pass up), Short ribs and the Osso Buco (which I had been unsure about). Talk about hitting it all spot on. Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. The Osso buco turned out to be the best dish. It was so tender and moist. I would order this again in a second. I was a little less impressed with the short ribs, but they were still good. The mac and cheese was very yummy.

Overall our experience was a total 5. Maybe even higher if allowed. The service felt so personalized and our wait staff really took excellent care of us.

To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  

For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.

Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.

Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!

The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.

We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud.

Left my pup for 5 days and she has to take a pill every day (not even an injection) and they charge daily to give an oral pill. I haven't gone to other dog boardings, so I'm not sure if that's the norm, but I think that's a bit much.
Aside from that, the two things that won't have me return is how they ""bathe"" the dog when you pick your pup up and the condition you get your pup back in.

You can tell they actually don't wash your dog, instead they generously baby powder your pup and call it a day :) 
When I picked my dog up after her stay, she just seemed really down and not herself.

A chocolate pot de creme (custard) with chipotle crema and a chocolate chipotle cookie.  Spicy, rich, decadent, all good things.

I came hoping for the coconut flavor, but alas - it is seasonal (sure to return in a couple of weeks, I was told).  Instead, I set my sights on the special flavor of the day - Maple with caramelized bacon on top.  Ahhhh.  I LOVE bacon!

So I went into the store and asked if I could pay at the store for something that was only sold online - and use the coupons - and I got my wish.  Thank you.  It's nice when you get your way.

...............................

I'm a bit torn reviewing them because they strike me as the Walmart of electronics.  They may often have good prices - but you feel like you are getting into bed with the devil.

The location is nice and selection is good, and priced are usually pretty good - but be darned careful that you compare prices elsewhere on all the accessories you need.  For example, if you buy cables here - be prepared to be anally raped with the price.  (You can get them for 1/4 the price at a computer store.)

For example, I had my computer blown up several times by terrible power in my apartment, so I spent $229 plus tax on the best Monster power power bar they had - and then when I tried to sell it on Craig's List - I discovered that LOTS of other places sold this thing for like half of what I paid at so called Best Buy.   Color me butt hurt.

And as someone else noted - good luck getting them to answer their phones.  And good luck trying to find an employee who knows as much about the products in the store as you do.

And one last thing to peeve me off - they are owned by the same head company as Future Shop.  Isn't this just the fake illusion of ""competition""?

But I have to say I like their 30 day return policy - just be careful that the product you take home is not something that someone else has returned.  (The filtered reviews for this store list several people who opened their box at home to find a non-working product and when they returned it to the store they were told the serial number didn't match the receipt and the company said stick this crap you know where - ie, you're stuck with it and we're not taking it back.)

The location is a bit funny, it is on the second floor of a shopping plaza - we have rarely seen any other stores open in the building, but there still seems to be some people around. There is also the grocery store right on the first floor that we always stop at before to pick up some goodies.

The food - amazing. We have our favorite go-tos but always try something new. By far our favorite is the C4 chicken with sweet and spicy sauce, it is just phenomenal and has the perfect amount of crispiness and spice. We get this every time. We also always get their bibibop which is also cooked to perfection. I cant name everything else we've gotten, because like I said, we always try a new dish when we are there and it is always amazing - but we've tried their short ribs, octopus, etc, all great. We also have done their Miega BBQ, which is very yummy and the staff is so helpful, however their prepared dishes are so great that we usually go with those. 

Another amazing thing here is there special spicy gochuchang sauce that they have bottled at every table. We literally put it on everything and whatever it is, it is just SO GOOD. 

The other amazing news is the ~7 authentic side dishes come with everything. They change it up based on what is available, in season, and it is great to taste the new concoctions they come up with. We always love each and every one of them. 

The other great thing I love about this restaurant is the staff and authenticity. It is family owned and all the recipes come from the grandmother who splits her time from this restaurant to her other one in Korea (can't remember which town). They also are so so sweet and accommodating. Everything she makes is so authentic and delicious, i cant say enough about it. JUST GO and be so please :)",2017-05-11 14:59:01

I went here last night with the BF and some friends and it was just the nicest little place, especially after spending the night before on mill... ugh. The decor reminds me of what your super hip friend's basement might look like. It has funky furniture and this light display that you can see when you are coming up the stairs that changes colors from the middle out (I stared at that thing extensively after a few drinks, and it was mighty entertaining). The place has strange movies and shorts being shown on the tvs. We watched a short about a kid cutting open a rabbit and an idol came out that demanded to eat jam.... pretty cool stuff. The place has comfortable couches and I liked that it wasn't too loud to have a conversation nor was it too busy for me to get a drink fairly quickly and without being bumped around. 

Anyway, the bartender really knows what she is doing and the fact that so many of their ingredients for cocktails are made in house and fresh is a huge selling point for me. I tried four different specialty cocktails. First I had the pama mojito. This was by far the best drink of the night. The bartender uses fresh mint and fresh limes, beats them to a pulp, then adds in house made simple syrup and in house made sweet and sour and some pama liquor and it is wonderful. So easy to drink and refreshing. I don't even usually like mojitos that much, but this was great and I'm glad I gave it a try. I also tried my friend's drink which was the blueberry and jameson drink, with (of course) fresh blueberries. Also good, but I'm not a whiskey drinker generally. So then I had a sidebar collins, which is good and simple. Finally I had the butterscotch martini.... it is as good as it sounds. I will most definitely be back at this bar in the future, it is by far the best bar I have experienced in Arizona. 

PS after a few drinks, check out the bathrooms... they have crazy iridescent tiles that looks super cool and there is a neat looking sink too.",2011-08-14 20:19:18

I can confidently say that it achieved the opposite in our case. The unspecified coupon, for one, turned out to only give us either Bud Light or Budweiser, and they were out of one, so we only had the one choice. Okay, it was free, but still somewhat disappointing to people who really don't like Bud Light. My personal opinion is - if you're a new place and want to convince customers to come back, don't be skimpy and draw people in with what seems like a generous offer and turns out to be the least tasty option on the beer menu. 

The food took very long to come out despite an empty restaurant, and it was very unremarkable. That also goes for the place in general - everything is shiny new and pretty nice, but the only way this place can be at all interesting is if you come with very good and entertaining company that will provide fun no matter where.

I rarely waited in a line more than two people deep, which can maybe be attributed to people (rightfully) thinking that standing in the sun and eating lots of food would be pretty uncomfy.

I knew it'd be tough as a vegetarian here, and it was just as I expected. Spinach dips galore (2 tents), a roasted red pepper sammich (aaarrgh), and gazpacho (3 tents!) were the options, as well as various stuffs from good ol' Woodlands and Namaste. The standout for me was the Spinach dip from Village Tavern - cheddar, jalapenos, multicolor corn chips, it was good enough to maybe drag me to the brick and mortar. We'll see.

I kept feeling overwhelmed by corporate presence. Every time I turned around, I felt the eerie stare of Dunkin Donuts, or Jamba Juice, or freekin' Land o Lakes (just thinking about cream on this hottest of days was enough to make me sweat), just booth after booth of two story mobile ""Flavor Factories"" and other creepy, rhymie stations. Weird, and not what I expected.

Those neat fans with the misting component were pretty sweet, and the beer stations were frequent and comfy. But if your only experience with local eats in CLT was from this 5 block corpo-business party, you'd be underwhelmed, to say it nicely. Where was a Vietnamese outpost?

I don't often give out a full 5 stars but Brewsters knocked it out of the park for me in terms of great atmosphere, delicious food, and amazing beer. 

The menu consists of what you would normally find at a bar like nachos, wings, rips, sliders, fish and chips, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, etc but they also have other unique items and twists on the classics that you won't normally find at other restaurants. Their food is fresh and the prices are decent considering the quality of it. My bf has only gotten their Bavarian Beef Dip ($15) with beef, caramelized onions, white cheddar, horseradish aioli and Hammerhead beer mustard. I can see why because this sandwich is like a bundle of rich, fatty, orgasmic goodness! It's not your typical beef dip; the addition of cheese, aioli and beer mustard takes the sandwich to the next level of flavour city. It's still a pretty good sandwich without the au jus but the juices adds that extra touch of 'melt in your mouth' goodness. The sandwich comes with a side fries or salad and every time my bf gets it he is stuffed.

I tried their Pad Thai Stirfy ($15) with chicken, shrimp, veggies, peanuts, and cilantro which was filling and really good. My only complaint was that it was a little greasy and the sauce was too sweet. A squeeze of lime(s) which I had to ask for helped balance out the sweetness. I also tried their Green Chili Bison burger ($15) with green chili aioli, roasted jalapeños, jalapeño havarti, lettuce, tomato and peppercorn onion rings. This is one of the best burgers I've had in awhile. Yes.. it's probably uber fattening but it was worth it. The patty was nice and moist and the onion rings added that extra oomf of texture. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. Although it was a good burger, I found that after the first couple of bites it got a little bland. I felt that it needed an extra 'something', maybe a relish to add a bit of sweetness to the creaminess of the burger. I also didn't like how the top of the bun was too big (had too much bread) which I don't usually like in my burgers.

Another one of our stops on our AZ trip in October and boy am I glad we made this stop!  Its a great lounge.  A straight up lounge.  We didn't have a table arranged beforehand but when we got there my husband spoke with the manager who set us up nicely at a little table for two in a great location.  I was blown away by the DJ who was there that night...every mix was inventive and different....classic rock and hip/hop?  My two favorite types of music!  (We don't get that in Boston)  I'm one of those people who loves to check out cool bathrooms and the bathrooms here are just that.  They have the frost over the glass thing going on like Tao in Vegas.  The best thing about Six was that it was soooo inexpensive!  We laughed for a good 5 minutes when the bill came.   $60 for 4 Red Bulls and Vodka, 2 glasses of champagne and 2 beers?  Are you kidding me??!!  Awesome.  Totally awesome.  That easily would be over $100 in Boston.   This is an excellent lounge!

Update:
I have visited Six a few times since we moved out here and every time I have a lot of fun.  I also laugh hysterically at the inexpensive bill that comes at the end of the night.  Most recently my husband and I went on a night they were having a VIP Guest Appreciation Night; we were treated to a night out that cost a mere $60 and included many glasses of champagne as well as hand passed hor's dourves that were quite delicious.

The atmosphere is ok- feels more like a casual deli, though they try with the decor (painted wall scenes depicting the Mediterranean), and it is pretty small. Sometimes we would order and then eat lunch at her house (she lives in the area).

So much that the grease from the cheese puddled into one corner of the omelette.  I had to scrape most of the cheese off. I could barely taste the meat flavors and was hoping for a crunchy bacon filling with the sausage and ham. The side potatoes were a bit overcooked and over seasoned and the English muffin was drenched in butter. Maybe my stomach wasn't in the mood for lots of oily fats, because I just wasn't impressed by the meal or flavors.

The tuna tacos are to die for and I find myself craving them! The pizza is excellent as are their burgers. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their bread pudding. The salads have always been good, but occasionally over dressed. I have never had a bad dish here. 

The atmosphere is casual comfortable with trendy decor and nice clean bathrooms. The patio is private and beautiful in the summer with a bar outside as well. The bands on the weekends sometimes are a bit loud. People do go to dance and that area can be a bit congested. There is a dining room side for quieter ambiance.

My friends who ordered the same got more tuna with theirs, so inconsistent. That and two glasses of wine for $30 is just too high. My girlfriend got a gluten free pizza, uncharged and smaller than a 10"" dinner plate, and one glass of wine for $22.

It was their first time and all 3 were very impressed. We love 5th and Wine and I knew they would love SMPP just as much since it's owned and operated by the same fantastic people! We had a Groupon which was taken with a smile as well. 

Our server was friendly, fun, and took our GNO behavior like a pro. :) He nearly became part of our family by the time we left. 

The food, in a word, was just spectacular. We had the Crab Wontons and the Vegetable Spring Rolls to start. Both had interesting and appropriate dipping sauces We always eat Family Style so we shared the Mongolian Beef, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Soft Noodle/Fried Egg and the Kung Pao Shrimp. I wasn't sure about the Soft Noodle/Fried Egg because it just seemed strange, but it was absolutely heavenly. Everything was perfectly made. The shrimp seemed to snap when you bite into them. The Kung Pao was spicy without being overpowering.  The Shrimp in Lobster Sauce was decadent. The Mongolian Beef was tender and perfectly seasoned. Everything just tasted FRESH. Clearly the ingredients hadn't been sitting around and nothing had been premade or had sat under a heat lamp. Everything was nicely seasoned with a nice mixture of flavors without being overpowering.

We topped off the meal with the Tempura Fried Ice Cream and the Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse. We loved both equally and they were perfect endings to a really great meal. 

Can't wait to go back again and bring more friends to this jewel. Thank you for a fun, fabulous experience!",2011-01-30 14:33:21

Carefully read through TripAdvisor and settled on this place, which was slightly more expensive than nearby hotels.  I called about a week ahead of time and asked about checking in early. I was told to call the day before, but that there would probably be no problem. I was also informed of the Mellon Parking Garage across the street, where weekend rate was $5 opposed to $37 valet parking through hotel. Awesome.  I called the day before and was told that they were booked on Friday night and to check when I arrived at the hotel, as it would ""depend on if the room was cleaned early enough"" for us to check in early. We arrived around 12:30p and asked if checking in early was an option.  The staff, who appeared openly frustrated, basically told us no before launching into excuses. Really, it was OK, I was just planning to drop off my luggage and come back later.  We were told our room would be ready around 4p, which was perfect for us to visit the Pittsburgh Winery at the Strip and return, check-in, get ready, attend the well-reviewed hotel reception, and attend our 8p dinner reservations.  We arrived around 4:15p and were told that our room was ""Not ready"", by the same frustrated woman at the front desk.  We were informed to take a seat by her much  more pleasant counterpart.  By 4:30p, we were offered appetizers.  By 5p, we asked again, explaining we had reservations and also wanted to attend the reception.  At 5:15p, we were told someone was personally going to speak to Housekeeping (as it was their fault) as our room was STILL not done. We were offered alcoholic beverages, which the bride took, but the rest of the party did not, since we needed to get ready.  By 5:30-6p (after the reception started), we were able to check in.  The room was spacious with 2 King BRs and 1.5 baths and an open living area with pull out couch.  By the time we got ready, the reception was over, which was a total disappointment.  We had a good night and I scored my own King bed.  The caveat? I could hear the elevator going up and down all. night. long. I got up around 8a for the ""made to order"" breakfast the next day.  There was no seating, no cutlery, and a lot of the food was out.  The lines were so long, especially the MTO line.  We found a seat, and scraped together some cutlery to share at our table with two pepper shakers, though one was distinctly meant to be a salt shaker.  The buffet was really so-so. Not something I would expect from this hotel.  There were generic bacon and sausage links as well as what looked like Egg Beaters scramble.  Cereal was sugary (Lucky Charms, etc), and beverages were juices from a machine, as coffee was completely out.  There were scones and muffins that were also basic.  The fruit was hard and not entirely ripe--but the healthiest options.  When I checked out, I mentioned the discount the more pleasant clerk offered us when we finally checked in, which it appears was not noted to our account.  The woman who checked me out informed me, ""I can do $50"". A this point, I was frustrated, hungry, and ready to get the hell out of there $300/one night poorer.

There were a bunch of handwritten signs dotting the window of the truck.  No credit cards, cash only (despite the truck displaying a variety of credit card options), no bananas, etc.

I ordered a strawberry and nutella crepe.  It was $5.  What a letdown.  The girl making the crepe didn't have nearly enough batter so about one third of it was ""lace"" rather than an actual crepe.  There was maybe a teaspoon of nutella and maybe one or two strawberries diced.  That was it.  My crepe did not come close to resembling any of the pictures on the truck and not close to any of the photos posted on this site for this food truck.  Skimpy, skimpy, skimpy.

It was OK.  There were no sugars or anything else to put on the crepe.  They provide a napkin put no plasticware.

Embarrassingly, I've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit!  My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants, but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners:

(1) Location.  For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus, this restaurant's location is unbeatable.  (And since it's next door to an Espresso Royale, you can grab a coffee after your meal, if desired.)

(2) Atmosphere.  Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald's Playroom for adolescents: neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture, with underlying scents of urine and vomit.  While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge, it also invokes a strong sense of urban, artistic chic.  There are real paintings on the wall (not poster prints).  At night, they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting.

(3) Price.  I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask.  This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants, where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars.  Lunch generally runs around $7 to $10, which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests.  (And still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at Timpone's, the other ""nice"" restaurant in the area.)

All of the food is fairly conservative, with obvious combinations of flavors (brie + portobello, turkey + pesto, etc.).  I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food (but also nothing exciting).  The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality.

For lunch, I always go with the egg salad, which is creamy, well-seasoned, and always satiates my craving for egg goodness.  In the early evening, sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends.  The cheese selection is quite good (you'll find Stilton, Gouda, Manchego, etc.), and the beers are all microbrews (if you're into that kind of thing).  Dinner selections include fondue, pastas, pizzas, and some specialties, but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign/Urbana.

In terms of baked goods, I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread.  Yum!  At most places with a baking reputation, I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies, but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company.  Their treats always look colorless and hardened, as if they were made by an angry grandma.

Overall, I'd recommend this to people who like simple, light food.  If you are cheap and don't care about indie street cred, you could probably get the same food at Panera.",2011-11-13 18:00:10

dtX47epvmibMa6ehddkjtg,YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,Z9XF1y4VNFkRlGSlnoy0Zw,1,1,1,2,"I visited this store to pick up an LG G6 since it's currently discounted to $500 (from $650). I figured I'd save some shipping and time and buy from the store. For the most part, the visit was pleasant and it seemed like the sales rep did his job.

As I was checking out, I was not happy to discover they charge an ""upgrade fee"" of $20. I wasn't really upgrading since I was putting this phone on an extra T-Mobile line that currently has no phone. Really he didn't have to do anything. Just let me buy the phone and I'll put my SIM card in. Done.

But the sales rep said there was no way around it, so whatever. Instead of using my existing SIM that T-Mobile sent me a couple of months ago, the rep put in and supposedly activated a new card.

Flash forward to trying to make an outbound call, it rerouted to T-Mobile customer service instead. Turns out the account still had the other SIM card activated. So I'm not sure what ""upgrade"" service the sales rep even did. Once I popped the older SIM into the phone, everything worked perfectly. I guess now I have an extra T-Mobile SIM for future use. The phone rep that was helping me even gave me a $20 credit for the ridiculous ""upgrade fee.""

Lesson learned: Forget buying a phone from a T-Mobile store. Online seems to be better if you're not in a hurry. Otherwise, I'll just go to Best Buy or something.

EDIT: I forgot about the extra thing that prompted me to even write this review. I later discovered that ""JUMP!"" was added to the new phone/line. This is after I specifically asked the sales rep if my monthly bill would be affected at all. I have no idea if it was his oversight or this is just something T-Mobile adds automatically.",2017-05-08 18:09:31
lMSLMU5xvUVXgdwcyy0JpA,dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,ypfFfR3-PbtoslIhohNstw,3,6,4,4,"With the exception of their delish super tender and marbled fattylicious kalbi/galbi short ribs (which is now limited to 2pcs/person ayce), this was your average ayce kbbq experience for a higher price. It's now $33/person and all at the table must get ayce or nobody can. 

Blah service - they were very nice since I had my Korean aunty with me, but also very forgetful despite it being empty except for maybe 4 other tables. Had to ask twice to get a refill on hot tea, I also ordered squid twice, which they then proceeded to forget both times. Only remembered once we were ready for the check and I didn't want it anymore. 

Agree with what a couple other people said - they're ridiculously stingy with their banchan and since they rarely stopped by except the 2 times they brought food, it's hard to get things replenished. This dish with broccoli and soft tofu literally had 4 small florets, and they gave us 1 onion slice and literally 1 round slice of zucchini to grill for 3 of us. I don't get being so cheap with cheap things, it was just weird.  

I'd only been here before just for soup, both of which were bland and forgettable. This town has a lot of other Korean places, and I don't think this one is worth your time or extra money. Actually, the kalbi was very good and since ala carte for that is around $30 - I'd say ayce could be worthwhile if they go back to not limiting you to 2pcs/person. But since that's very unlikely to happen - I say pass on this place.

oh one positive is that they did let me take home the big rib bones (with meat on it) for my dogs. I figured they'd say no since there's usually no leftovers with ayce.",2015-01-12 21:50:40

We arrived about 7pm - with an Indians game downtown and the Rite Aid Marathon the same weekend, I expected a line, but we walked right in. (Note: there was quite a line later in the evening, so for the first several weeks or on a game day, get there early!)

If you didn't know this space used to be Higbee's department store...well, you'd never guess. They stayed with a sort of art deco theme that really plays up some of the best features of that old space. I loved the crystal ""chandeliers"". :)

The space is bigger than I expected. Big enough to get lost in, especially on the second floor. Tons of slots - from what I saw, most are low wager (1 to 2 cents, minimum wager of 60 cents to $1.20). Seemed like the slots were pretty ""loose"" when we got there, but by the end I couldn't win to save my life. Tip: when you're up, collect your ticket and start over. :)

You can order drinks right from your slot machine via a touch screen menu. Sweet! Still have to pay cash, but drinks were very affordable - $3 for a glass of house Pinot grigio. The servers (and the staff in general) are super nice - when I gave one of the girls an extra tip because she had to go get change, she was floored. 

Food court, with Rosie & Rocco's, BSpot, and Corky and Lenny's is on the second floor. The buffet - which is supposed to be stellar - is on the lower level. I didn't eat there on this visit...next time!

By the time I left around 11pm, the crowds were thick. Tables were crowded, and there were lines for some slots. If you want to play a certain game, get right behind the chairs and let others who approach know that you're waiting, or they'll cut right in front of you. Seriously. 

The parking deck is free if you play for 30 minutes and have enough ""tier credits"" on your Total Rewards card. I had an issue with my card - my credits didn't save... I'll have to figure this out...luckily my BF's card didn't have the same issue, so this perk saved the $25 parking cost. You swipe your card in a kiosk in the casino or in the valet reception area of the garage. Tip: check your credits BEFORE you leave the casino. The parking staff can't help. 

The parking deck was my only complaint. Again, this was a busy weekend in the CLE, but it took almost 90...yes, NINETY...minutes to get out of the deck from the 5th floor.

Overall, I will certainly return, after the crowds have died down a bit and the wounds to my ""fun money"" fund have healed. My next trip to Vegas will be to explore the area and see some shows instead of sitting in the casino. ;) I'm just thrilled to see downtown look like a ""real"" city, with folks walking around and enjoying an area that has been slowly, but steadily, coming back into good graces.",2012-10-24 00:03:21

The service was excellent, she told me to try a French fry and it was so hot. She opened the ranch and made me dip the fry in and cool my mouth lol. I was sold!

*CAJUN PARM* not on the menu but was recommended by a fellow yelper.  These were good - dry rub.  I think if they were wet based might be better BUT they are still ok but doubt I will get again.  There are too many other flavors to choose from.

I think all the other components in the drink definitely rounded the drink off well and made it taste just right. If you don't like fruity or sweet, you may still like this drink. When I looked at the menu again before we left, I regreted not trying a bunch of other drinks but I guess that will be before a later date. 

For food, my friend and I ordered the chicken wings in sriracha honey bbq extra crispy and the braised short rib flatbread to share. The flat bread during happy hour does not have French fries on it. We were expecting the French fries since we didn't read the description and that was a bit disappointing. The flatbread had a little bit of saltiness to it and was crisp. The braised short rib was delicious. I really didn't like the cheddar cheese. I'm not sure that was the best option for cheese, especially for when it started to cool off and congeal. Maybe a soft, white, spreadable cheese would have been a better option? Like a garlic herb of some sort? While they're at it maybe some caramelized onions? LOL maybe rethink the flatbread a bit. The chicken wings were perfect. They were cooked extra crispy how we wanted them. You could hear the crunch as we bit into the wings. They had great flavor, which was a little sweet, savoy, salty, and spicy. It was a balanced combo.

The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and it's right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postino's. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip.

There was a 30-minute wait for my party of two on a recent Friday night, and we sat in the indoor dining area, which overlooked the bar, which was bustling full of people and had standing room only. The restaurant is located in an historic brick building, and it has a cool wall covered completely in cassette tapes that makes it feel even hipper.

For food, my pal and I started with the Cheddar Fondue ($11) off the mostly-American menu, which comes with pretzels, apples, pork, bread and sausage. The pretzels were soft and chewy, and the portion was huge. I would have preferred just the pretzels, though the apples and cheese were an interesting combination. Definitely try that appetizer if you go-it was super-tasty.

For my meal, I got the Veggie Stack ($9), which was a pita topped with bean spread, quinoa, tomato, cucumber, avocado, radish,  corn and green goddess (I left the pickled beets off). I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I weren't wowed. Maybe it's because the cheese wasn't plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good.

Who am I to argue with the masses.

I placed a massive pickup order which included: chicken, slow cooked shredded beef, steak and beef tongue. I had never been here but it was pretty easy to find with plenty of street parking. The girl at the register was kind enough to point out which taco had what meat (I wanted to double check where the beef tongue was...don't judge me) as well as the topping bar. You have your choice of veggies to put on your taco as well as your salsa. There is no ""mild option,"" this is now the place for the weak. They conveniently have to go containers for the salsas and sour cream. Of course, I had to grab some horchata as well.

The tacos were all no more than $3 each and honestly, after two I was good. I think my least favorite was the slow cooked shredded beef which was surprising but honestly it's a point of preference. For the price, you can try things that may even be out of your comfort zone and not feel bad for how much you spent.

There was no whiff of fish smell or wasabi hidden underneath with the rice to try hide a lack of quality in the food. This was melt in your mouth goodness. The spicy prawn roll was also a hilite. So much crunch and just a smattering of hot sauce to kick up the flavour a notch. My favourite part of the meal was the green tea ice cream.

For a bit of background, my husband is half Lebanese and we've eaten our fair share of Middle Eastern food of all stripes and varieties. For really good Middle Eastern food in that part of the city, try Fatoush. Little hole in the wall run by an Iraqi man (I think).

Anyways, this place. Honestly the only reason it gets 2 stars is because hubby liked several of the dishes that I didn't try, like the kafta. First of all, when we ordered water to go with the meal, they brought us bottled water and then charged us for it. EVERY other restaurant I've ever been to in my life has either correctly assumed that I wanted a glass of water, or asked me to clarify whether I wanted bottled water or not. When the waitress turned up a few minutes later, we asked for glasses of water. After she conferred with someone in the back, we got glasses of lukewarm tap water- with no ice.

And then, the food. Granted, at a Mediterranean buffet, I expect mostly Mediterranean food, but here even that was too much to ask. Of the four buffet tables full of food, maybe one and a half was food I would have considered Mediterranean, and even some of that was a stretch. Some of the dishes in the buffet included: lasagna (looked frozen), alfredo (gummy and bland), pasta with chicken (just strange), zucchini fries (obviously frozen), fried okra (?), spring rolls (frozen), orange Jell-o squares (huh?). The rice pilaf was too salty and had Jalapeno peppers in it(?). As for the actual Mediterranean food, the stuffed grape leaves were the best of the bunch. As I mentioned, hubby liked the kafta but it was a bit spicy for me. The hummus was bitter- too much tahini. The chicken schwarma tasted like someone tried to alter a recipe for chicken parmesan. Really, the best section overall was the salads. The tabbouleh was decent although it needed more salt to counteract all of the lemon juice. And one other salad had huge chunks of feta cheese in it- the feta was strong and flavorful.

Overall, there is NO way I'd go back here, even with another Groupon.",2012-07-06 04:47:27
2cVCh5YgcTLRgcXKBfHZWg,8Ni1MmORWyvW0lJHJiqiQg,Ul6JwluSTm12PVDIqnNaTg,3,1,0,1,"I came here on a Sunday night during my weekend trip to Pittsburgh. It had come recommended by a friend. It's a Caribbean and South American fusion themed restaurant.

The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and inviting. The restaurant opens up to a seemingly well-stocked bar with recessed lighting under the counter-top illuminating bar stools resembling congo drums. The physical space is small, yet warm and intimate. Kaya would likely make a perfect happy hour and possibly date venue. Their outdoor seating is also nice on a nice warm day and allows you to take in the Strip district while enjoying your meal. Ambiance - (4/5)

The food was a mixed bag. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk wings appetizer and they were tasty. 10 wings for $9. The Jerk seasoning had a nice kick to it and it was perfectly balanced with a palate cooling cilantro cream sauce. They were juicy and well cooked. I would most definitely order these again.

However, I ordered the fish tacos based on the rave reviews on Yelp and was disappointed. The portions are large and for $17, you would expect them to be. The plate came with 3 corn tortillas with generous portions of fried tilapia and coleslaw. I am talking about Cheesecake Factory-sized portions. To be honest, the taste was also not too far off from the Cheesecake Factory's either. Not bad, but definitely not great. I think the huge mounds of coleslaw and the thousand island dressing they called ""spicy crème fraîche"" threw me off. The tilapia and corn tortillas are the true stars of the dish, but they are only masked amongst these other ingredients. Sometimes less is more and I feel like if Kaya eased up on the sauce and slaw, then the dish would benefit overall. The option of getting 2 tacos for reduced price may also be a good idea. 
Food - (3.5/5)

Their drink menu is extensive with 12 different mixed drinks and 18 beers on draft. In addition, they host a happy hour Monday through Friday from 5 to 7 pm where draft beers and cocktails are half-off. That's quite the deal and if I lived in Pittsburgh, I would probably be a regular.
Drinks - (4/5)

The service was okay. Our waitress was polite, but appeared very disinterested. Maybe it was an off day or a case of the Sundays. The drinks and appetizers came out quickly, but it took another 25-30 minutes before we got our entrées. 
Service -  (3/5)

All in all, I still had a positive dining experience at Kaya. If i'm ever back  in town, I would not hesitate to return. However, I was disappointed with the fish tacos and for this reason I will have to give them a 3.5/5 rating. 
Overall - (3.5/5)",2013-09-18 05:52:00

I'm a midwestern gringo, but I've been here 20+ years, so can take a little heat.  My wife is half Thai, and her Mom and Aunts used to sit around prepping, cooking REAL ACTUAL Thai food (and gossiping) all day long, so she knows the good stuff.  The first time we went, she loved it so much that the second time we went and got a TOGO order, we brought home over $75 worth of food for her, I, and a 12 yo girl.  This doesn't mean three $25 meals, either,  since each entree/appetizer ranges from a little under to a little over $10.  Yea, leftovers!

Instructions:
1.  Hire a group of thugs to tie you up, slip a sack over your mousse-head, toss you in the back of a cargo van, and dump your pretentious, elitist butt INSIDE the front doors of Siam.

2.  Enjoy the tastiest, most authentically prepared and flavored Thai food you'll likely have this side of Bangok, served by friendly authentically prepared and flavored Thai folk, in a very clean and ornately decorated, authentically prepared and flavored environment.

3. Go through moral, ethical, and spiritual crisis as you decide whether it is time to forgoe your judgemental, plastic-coated, dream world where everything is pristine and sanitized, so that you may indulge in the tastes of the real world, not the Real World tm.

4. Decide that you simply cannot face the ugly Glendale strip mall you know is outside those doors; have thugs kidnap you back to East Valley and drop you off at Kierland Commons, so that you can wash away the filthy feeling with an overpriced gourmet coffee amongst the beautiful people.  Pretend you didn't just start down the dark path of heroin-like spicy Thai basil & peppers.  Pretend that you won't be slinking back to the other side of the tracks to cop another score sooner than you think.  Look around at all of the fronts -- on the stores, and especially the people -- they want you to believe that they are authentically prepared and flavored, but they aren't.",2009-04-15 19:33:35

But alas no stars because the menu says all burgers are cooked to 170 degrees or medium well. When I inquired as to whether we get the burgers cooked any other way the server said ""no, they are cooked on an automatic grill"". Oh and they don't have a full bar. 

Why would you have a burger joint that uses locally sourced beef and then only offer it cooked to 170 degrees. It sort of reminds me of airport food. $8 Hamburger - well done.  We drove across the street to Madison's best and most reliable late night spot - Eno Vino. Not a burger joint- but they always get it right. 

I concede this is an un-review. Unless you like your burgers ""medium well"" this isn't the place for you. I'm sort of baffled by this policy - have confidence in your purveyors and serve a great burger the way the customer wants it. The 170 degree policy and the automatic meat cooker is a red flag as it relates to food quality and staffs ability as it relates to food safety.

The rotisserie chicken is pretty good and standard and tastes the same in every swiss chalet since I was a kid, but by good god is the service one of the worst I've seen in the food business. 

On every occasion I've come here something terribly goes wrong for example:
-Without a doubt you will be waiting at the door to be seated for at least 5 minutes even though the place is empty. The time for the server to come and take your order VARIES, sometimes it can be as fast as less than a minute or you might be kept waiting for 20, who the hell knows?

When I ordered my parm sandwich, the waitress did not tell us it will take an extra long time to cook it and we ended up waiting for LITERALLY 30 MINUTES FOR OUR FOOD. After about 20 minutes I asked the waitress and she, in a condescending attitude, told me that the chicken parm takes a long time. During this eternal waiting, we got a total of 1 refiill and our cups were left empty for pretty much 25 of those 30 long minutes. By 30 minutes I was getting pretty pissed and I sternly told my waitress that it has been way too long and we will be leaving if it does not arrive. She quickly came back with the food and tossed it at us, at this point there was so much animosity between her and us. While my food was great, my husband's burger tasted like it has been out on the counter for 3 days. The patty was stale, tasteless, and burnt, the cheese has been sitting on the patty for so long that the edges have become hard, and pretty much it seemed like they took a burger that's been made and sitting there an entire day and microwaved it. We asked the waitress to take it back, paid for our food and left.

We had the wings, chili cheese fries and today trying the crab bisque soup.    Highly recommend this place..",2017-01-08 17:49:40

First of all - it *is* a bar with a proper bar license so you can enjoy some of their lovely cocktails, carefully selected wines, and Evil Twin beers without having to order food. Huzaah!

Don't miss the food though. They will be launching a full dinner menu soon, but right now they are just trying a couple plates each night. We tried their homemade sourdough rye bread last night which came with a wine glass of warm duck broth and some whipped butter. Delicious and sort of silly and fun. We also shared a warm bitter salad of chrysanthemum greens and feta in rice paper, soft with sesame oil. It came in a surprisingly nicely sized shareable portion, and was salty and spicy and good. 

The bar is a tiny tasty new addition to the barren-and-then-suddenly-delightful land of Mile Ex. It is owned and entirely staffed by the two young guys who greet you when you enter, they are so eager and sweet and talented you just want good things for them. The room is nice on the eyes with it's simple mix of dark blue tiles and cork paneling, which also makes for a quiet calm effect to the sound even with good music playing and several couples laughing lined up at the bar. 

My only bit of negative feedback would be that I think the lights were a little overly bright in the restaurant, and that, combined with the back window that looks out onto a creepy indoor mechanical industrial room in the back, and that they frequently left the door between the warm tiny restaurant and that cold back cavern open gave a bit of an uncomfortable chill to the look and feel to the room. The plan is to make that back room a proper dining area for bigger, family style dishes and group events, so that will fix that. Maybe in the meantime just hang some lights or some art around the window and keep the door closed. 

Anyway, small stuff. I think Diplomate has potential to be one of the neighbourhood's favourite cozy hideouts for delicious drinks and playful, innovative, delicious food and I look forward to coming back to see how they evolve.",2016-03-02 16:38:56

I was only able to buy their juice there, so I have to come back to REALLY try their stuff. I got the detoxifier juice which had ginger, cucumber, coconut juice, and lemon juice. I asked for extra ginger (+$1). It was so good! So good that I wanted to try to make my own rendition of it. Of course, it wasn't the same. 

Asides from their juices, they also serve bowls, smoothies, kombucha, sandwiches and salads. I think the thing that really sticks out to me here is that they offer some rare and exotic fruits here--some of them I've never heard of. Those ones are supposed to be good for you, and I'm really excited to try their bowls with those exotic fruits.

You can get Pho Dac Biet with all six meats for $9.50 or Pho Ga (chicken pho) for $8.95. I'm boring so I went with a small bowl of Pho Tai. It was just the right amount. My broth was light, refreshing, citrusy, and not greasy.

I also ordered Cha Gio for $5.50. OMG! Excuse my French but these are the best PHOking fried egg rolls I've had in Vegas so far. I haven't been to many Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas but please let me know if you know of any better egg rolls than the ones they serve here. 

They also have a small bakery which I was too full to try. I didn't see many Chinese dishes. They serve mostly Vietnamese food. The decor of this restaurant is cute. It looks like an outdoor cafe with cute street signs such as Pho Blvd adorned with lots of plants & Asian style roofing.

Service was quick and friendly. The young waitress took my order, the food came out quickly, and in a reasonable time. She even checked up on me which is unheard of in most pho restaurants. However, it took a while to get my bill but they were busy so no worries.

Orange Chicken:  just ok.  missing orange slices and the peppers which usually accompany  this spicy dish
Egg Flower Soup:  Just ok. Not enough salt.  No noodles accompanied it which is the usual with chinese soup
Shrimp with lobster sauce:  OK.  I asked for it to be in a white sauce which they did do; however, excessive carrots made the sauce too sweet.

ShMp3ylGzyx_LV5iFhhnWQ,7I5OgoncWoaNH23xmWxBNA,wjLgM9Ybe5shoUPRrGMmsQ,5,0,0,0,"The best brunch place in Pittsburgh, hands down. Located in the super hipster Lawrenceville, this place is my go-to restaurant for a great start to the day. It has this cute diner vibe and is always packed with people. They don't take reservations for brunch - you can call and put your name on the list so its first come/call, first serve. But trust me, it is 110% worth the wait.

For your beverages, make sure you order one of their freshly squeezed juices. They make it in house and have such wonderful concoctions. I'm particularly fond of their pear honeydew pineapple juice. It is just the right level of sweet and tart. You'll have to stir it a bit occasionally for the consistency to be right. It is SO SO SO good though. I've also tried the matcha tea latte, which wasn't the best I've had. The matcha tasted a bit funky, and the latte itself wasn't made that well.

Anyway, on to the starters. Banana bread with honey walnut cream cheese and fruit? Amazing. Bread is wonderfully moist and soft - not stale at all and not too sweet. Avocado toast with a drizzle of honey? My favorite. Sounds like a strange combo but I promise you it just works.

Brunch menu always changes when I go, which makes it exciting. I've tried their pumpkin pancakes with maple butter and caramelized pears. The pancakes are so soft and you probably won't be able to finish them (HUGE portion size) . The pears were my favorite part. If you have a giant sweet tooth, this is your dish.

I've also had their scallop eggs benedict. It's not on their website menu since I guess it's a rotational one, but I loved it. I think it's my favorite brunch dish I've had there. The scallops were so large and juicy and went perfectly with the hollandaise sauce. Normally, with eggs benedict, restaurants kind of just give up on the English muffin part and it's just that - a plain English muffin. But they toasted it here and did something with it to make it stand out to me (I don't know what).

Another thing I've tried is their house cured and tea-smoked salmon omelet with goat cheese, dill, and roasted tomatoes. The goat cheese threw me off at first (wasn't expecting it in an omelet, or with salmon), but it was surprisingly pretty good. This was your standard breakfast omelet with a twist. 

Finally, I've also tried the savory duck crepe with Asian slaw and two sunny side up eggs. This dish was interesting. Slaw wasn't my favorite, but then again, I never like slaw. Eggs were fine. Duck was fine. I think it was just confusing to me in the way they presented the dish. They hid the crepe part on the bottom, covering it with the duck confit, slaw and eggs. I completely missed the crepe part until I ate through the dish and saw it, and by then, it was all soggy and unappealing. I wish they had presented it in a way where it preserved the integrity of the ""crepe,"" especially as they were calling it a crepe dish. 

Otherwise, this place is truly a neighborhood gem. It's also a short walk from Espresso A Mano, a fantastic coffee shop. Smaller groups fare better here and be ready to wait at least 30 minutes if you come on a popular brunch day!",2016-01-24 00:53:52

Great customer service!
Excellent body shop work!

At Coulter Nissan I had my best car buying experience ever when I purchased my used 2009 Altima.  No haggle purchase price, just paid the fair (in my opinion) internet price which was cheaper than the sticker price.  

A decent price was offered for my trade-in.  My salesman (Roger) had a courteous and gentlemanly demeanor.  Roger had my Altima washed and driven onto the display pad for presentation - as if I was purchasing a brand new luxury car - a nice touch!  I've never gotten this treatment even when buying brand new anywhere, and I've bought a few over the years.

Crunched my rear bumper in a tight parking area, so most recently used Coulter's Body Shop.  Price was right, excellent job on the bumper and it looks like new!

I have all my service done at Coulter.  Tuesdays is Ladies Day so there's a discount on an oil change. Have always been treated with courtesy.  Oil change is done quickly while you wait.

- I guess, it's no longer a cheap date at that price for a drink, but still not too bad, especially if you could still go upstairs to the Tequila Bar, where all tequila drinks are still $2 between 5-7, Wed thru Sun!

Moreover, offers of  $0.75 hotdog (usually before 5pm), AND $4 movie befor 4pm for SENIORS (Mon-Fri) are still GOOD!

We initially wanted to go to mon lapin but there was a crazy lineup so we ended up here because it was close-by and there were quite a few empty tables. 

I came here many years ago and I remember being disappointed. It was totally my fault though because against my better judgment I ordered the margarita pizza because it was the popular choice but I actually like  pizza with a lot of topics so I was disappointed. 

For starters, my bf and I shared the arancini Bella Napoli which is a risotto ball with ham and mozzarella  inside. It was $5 for one!! Pretty pricy if you ask me! It wasn't huge or anything either. I liked that it was crunchy on the outside but I found there wasn't much cheese inside and it definitely was not melting. I also didn't see any ham. We also shared the veal meatball because the reviews on here pretty much all raved about it. My boyfriend and I were not impressed however. It was just like any other meatball with sauce on top. And again $5 for one meatball is pricy! 

As for the pizza this time I knew better and we got a pizza with toppings! We chose the diavola which contained salami, tomatoes, mozzarella and chilli flakes. We also added sausage to it. The pizza  wasn't spicy like I thought it would be so we added some spicy oil which was really more of a paste and we added olive oil to the paste. I liked that the waiter offered to add toppings and asked me what I liked because I felt like he was catering the pizza to my taste and really cared. The pizza was good but some parts of my crust were burnt which was disappointing. It really depended on the slice because some parts of the crust were good and I would dip it in the olive oil which made it even better but some parts were so burnt that I didn't want to eat it.

Came here for breakfast and dinner (2 nights) while staying at the Grand. Service was fast and friendly, and the food was pretty good.

Breakfast:
I got the crepe with chocolate and strawberry, which was just chocolate syrup and strawberry jelly (or jam). It was ok. I've definitely had better crepes. Hearty ones with real fruit and nutella, but this was just syrup. And the crepe itself wasn't great.

Also had the breakfast burrito. They were out of sausage, so we got ham, egg and cheese. It was good. Didn't blow my mind... I've had better, but not bad.

Dinner:
One night, I got the tacos. I chose 1 chicken and 2 latin smoked brisket. Really good!. The latin smoked brisket was especially yum. I got this with the Mexican rice (you get 2 sides with the taco plate). I didn't care for it. My husband got the bacon burger, which I tried, and it was good. He liked it too.

For dinner on our second night I got a turkey burger, which I enjoyed. Also got the onion rings, which I wasn't crazy about. Too big and the onion just fell right out when you'd take a bite.

The place itself is cool. I love the set-up and decor. I do agree with other reviewers that it was a bit confusing as to where to order. I would definitely come again, to try other things on the menu. And if anything, I know the latin smoked brisket tacos will satisfy me.",2014-02-02 19:25:23

We headed up to the bistro and after arriving and checking out the menu - I would say that they represent Asian fusion cuisine.  We noshed on some raw tuna, raw salmon and spicy tuna rolls for our appetizer.  They were delectable.  We started with the Salad Caprese and for our main courses Georges ordered the 72 Hour Kobe Short Rib and I had the Halibut.  Both dishes were very tasty.  I cannot say that the food was THE best, however, it was very good.  Things seemed to happen so fast as I was on a company dinner that, unfortunately, I did not take the time to savor the dishes.  If we go back again, I would probably check out the Indian offerings they had - I believe we missed out on the lamb... the trio of desserts was an okay touch - the crème brulee was okay - not the best (I am sorry to say that because I wanted it to be fantastic).

To finish our night... as suggested by the elevator gentleman, we headed on up to the 23rd floor to check out the amazing views the lounge area offered.  I advise you do the same - up there I believe is also the check in area for the hotel.

The menu is kind of small and I had difficulty in choosing a dish (I normally don't prefer to order seafood or steak mains which took up at least 50% of the menu) so I opted for their famous burger and upgraded to Aloette fries to share.

Burger was pretty salty but decent. Aloette fries on the other hand are highly questionable. It is like fries drizzled with some cheese that you can't taste but made the fries more soggy and greasy, and lots of sriracha. Doesn't go well at all and honestly the regular plain fries tasted better. Many other customers actually left a good chunk of their fries as I saw the staff throw out lots of leftovers from 3-4 people. If you go, JUST GET REGULAR FRIES!!

Starting with the good, they are very liberal with the gravy and toppings. And it was tasty. Now for the not so good. It was tasty until it was salty and the fries were soggy, which is basically after the first, maybe second, layer of fries. Let me explain, the gravy on its own was pretty salty and hits you a few bites in. So add greasy bacon bits, or cheese curds, or a couple slices of ham to that, and well, I really needed yet another cup of water. The main dishes themselves were priced at $7.99 for a small and $11.49 for a large. I don't know if that's considered reasonably priced for poutine, but I thought it was a little pricey. Not to be melodramatic but, adding insult to injury, if you want to make that a meal, it's $3.49 on top of that. That's not terrible, you say, but what's in this $3.49? Well, you get your choice of either a side of traditional poutine, regular fries, or a cole slaw. Does it come with a drink?

I spoke to the gym manager. He is always courteous and attentive. He's receptive to feedback. Since then, the peace has been restored at the gym. I've not witnessed any  violent or dangerous situations as had been the recent past trend at nights. 

Things have changed in a matter of weeks. I'm not sure if it was coincidental or if it was due to a performance improvement plan implemented by the manager. Whatever it was, it seems to work just fine. As you come in, the towels are handed to you by the front clerk. In my opinion this is an excellent practice. Not only does it personalize service, making you feel that this is indeed a Super Sport location, but it also prevents the other users from grabbing 5 towels at a time (I never understand why anyone would need 5 towels unless you are about to clean the gym lol!)

On 8/15 (Friday night) I went in for a late workout as I always do. I witnessed the cleaning person do a thorough cleaning session of all treadmills and other cardio equipment. Moving equipment around and making sure everything was spotless clean. I was very pleased to see that. The next morning I went back for a cardio session, and as I walked in Massage Envy was giving complimentary massages ( which of course I enjoyed very much and plan to get a membership with them as well). Later, a beautiful fit woman was promoting a fitness plan at the front lobby. Call me superficial, but I love seeing fit beautiful people at the gym, that is what is all about. I want to workout where people look good and work hard for their good looks. This is what I expect out of a gym.

Finally, what sealed the deal, was a delicious scented tropical smell that welcomes you to the gym as you walk in. Spa like smell...I'm into this kind of stuff... A complete 360 degree turn. This is once again my favorite gym. I'm a sucker for good customer service and beautiful people. When it comes to gyms, I don't want to save money, I want to feel good when I work out. I will pay the additional cost if it delivers. So if you are in town, come check them out. Good place to workout at.",2014-08-24 17:57:13

I figured Flamingo is dead center of the strip so it would be convenient to get to and from our hotel. We had to go to vegas for a wedding and I only had a few weeks notice. I searched high and low for decent hotels. I read tons and tons of reviews and flamingo seemed to have gotten decent reviews. I got a pretty good deal $75/night on expedia.com. I knew full well that this was an older hotel and I wasn't expecting much. And not much is exactly what I got. The walls are really thin and we could overhear the couple next door getting their groove on. The restroom was old and tiles were cracking. However the shower head water pressure was strong. We stayed two night and the cleaning people didn't even bother to give us new shampoo, lotion or soap after they cleaned our rooms the first night. How stingy! The bed was comfy however there was no real comforter. There were like two extra thin covers and sheets. Bleh. The only real positive was that it was relatively easy to find parking, and we didn't have to walk through the casino to get to our rooms. Check in was fast and simple.

In response to the owner's comments: I didn't want to mention the poutine because I hate poutine, I've had it before, unlike other people it's not a wacky new thing to me.

I was excited to try them ever since they sent me a note on Twitter months before they even got rolling (pardon the pun).  I've now had them many times as they typically are at the Atherton Mill Market Saturdays for lunch and also at the Chow Down food truck rallies.  Just look for the long line.

Their concept is a pan-asian taco which means instead of latin flavors, they have sauces like peanut, teriyaki or panang curry and the veggies are thick cabbage and red pepper and cucumber. They have some pre-arranged taco combinations that you can choose, but I highly recommend the make-your-own combo. You can choose from chicken, shrimp or veggie, then you choose the veggies or toppings (incl. peanuts) to go on top and then you can mix and match sauces that go with them. 

I've had shrimp but I HIGHLY recommend the chicken instead and really love the panang curry sauce the best (with peanut as #2).  A combo of 3 tacos is $6.50 - what a great deal, non? Actually sometimes I think 3 is a bit much and they could get away with a combo of 2, but who's complaining? 

The only real thing to complain about is the aforementioned long line when you go to a rally. They're getting in their groove and typically the wait isn't as long once you actually place the order, but the order taking is slow because of the foreign concept, many choices and credit card processing.

I however did not get a warm and friendly feeling from the staff upon entering, but my mini tour guide who gave us the tour of the Canadian works (aka the Group of Seven) was friendly, informative and for the most part seemed an expert on the subject. 

I honestly feel that for someone like me who decides to begin my art education by just jumping in to art galleries (or at least that's what I plan on doing) the AGO is not ideal. I learnt so much more by eavesdropping on other's conversations than any plaque could have told me and unless you go on a proper tour (not the 30 minute mini tour I did) you might leave feeling a little overwhelmed, museums I've been to that have proper information about their pieces leave me feeling a lot more appreciative for the subjects but the AGO just didn't seem to do that for me. But then again almost everyone else loves the AGO here so I'm probably just a part of a very very small minority. 

I also found the overall layout of the museum a little confusing and the map while clear could have been better, perhaps highlighting some of the pieces found in certain galleries. 

I was very unhappy to learn that photos are not allowed, I hear that flashes could damage the works over time, but just let people take pictures sans flash, there's no harm in that, and I've met friendlier customs agents at the border than the security here. 

The volunteers walking around the galleries were very friendly and were honest in admitting that they were not uber experts on the pieces, just knew about them in general but had great interest in them and engaging in conversations with the likes of me. 

Oh yeah, the top 3 floors including the beautiful gallery that opens out on to Dundas street were closed so I could not check out their cafe either, that was a major bummer too.

But I will definitely be coming back here especially if they have exhibits that interest me and hopefully I'll be back with someone that really knows their art so they could educate me as the AGO does not do a good enough job of that.",2012-02-13 04:13:12

Duck fries are fabulous. To me a sausage is a sausage is a sausage, so I'm not going to comment on their main dishes, because it wouldn't be fair. This is a sausage joint, and it is obviously good at being such.

The service had some weak moments. I asked the bartender to surprise me with a beer, something German that I'd likely never had before. He gave me a Pilsner Urquell. Say what? Pretty common beer, that is just a high price point. 

Also, there is a female server who was just rude rude rude the whole time. She was the wvrst. We had a theory she was a vegan and really hated it there. She rolled her eyes when asked about her favorite things on the menu. Come on.

Since I'm not, I am not going to fall for the pressure to praise Jim Chai Kee simply because it's HK flagship received Michelin star approval. 

The first day of summer and quite the hottest day we've had in June this year, we came to Jim Chai Kee for a late lunch ordering B1 and A1 off their menu: a little bit of everything (wontons, fish balls, veggies, tenderized beef) in a bowl of noodles and as a lo mein dish.

Very lovely shrimp meat colours when I bit into the wonton, and fish balls were handmade and huge. Meats were tenderized with...meat tenderizer...so I don't really have many comments about the beef. It's not a plus or a minus. Noodles were great, because they were a cut above the usual fare.

Unfortunately, the hottest day of the summer was also a discomfort in the restaurant because they have a wall made from partially skylit windows and floor to ceiling windows, and the front of the shop was feng shui-ed with a ton of plants...essentially it was like sitting in a greenhouse at the table we were at.

Because the store's layout had no nook or cranny space where people outside pour in and stand and wait (not even a small partition), it is very uncomfortable to sit close to the door.  They also have high turnover of customers filing in and out: this can feel like a flurry of disruptive people walking back and forth.  I wish a restaurant like this with high volume of clients would consider investing a bit more in overhead and possibly make the space more navigable, or somehow expand the space a bit more to help the flow and seating plan.

Obviously, cheap food usually comes in a cheap space with mediocre service. Ain't the Ritz and we don't expect the Ritz. Food is great, seating was not, not a wonton conoisseur. Ergo, 3 stars.",2014-06-23 04:07:01

We ordered the shredded beef tacos and the grilled burrito with spicy queso.  We got our food (which I felt like it was half an hour later), and I took one bite in the burrito.  It was not good at all.  The spicy queso on top of the burrito tasted like the cheese in a jar that you get at your local grocery store.  It had this taste that I could not get out of my mouth.  Next, the street tacos.  They were a little better, but nothing fantastico!  Bill came up to a little less than $30.

I didn't absolutely love the Chicken Cutlet (Panko-breaded chicken breast AKA Chicken Katsu smothered in brown gravy) or the macaroni salad, both Hawaiian plate lunch staples. That was disappointing, but their execution of the Korean dishes were much better. Not the best Jajangmyun I've had, but not at all shabby. The side dishes (Pahn Chan) were not good, but since these dishes are constantly changing, it may have just been that particular evening. Oh, the Chinese-Style Sweet and Spicy Chicken was good!

We ordered the meatballs and the porchetta.
The meatballs come two to an order along with two slices of bread. The meatballs are made with a combination of beef and pork. My wife prefers all beef and said the meat was lacking flavor. 
The porchetta was delicious, tender and juicy from the roasted jus. The roasted whole garlic cloves just melt in your mouth. Under the pork were several pieces of broccoli which was the perfect complement.

Sure, the incredibly detailed hotels are wonderful. The lights of the strip are a site to be seen. There's museums about mobsters and acrobatic shows over pools of water and old dudes giving you flyers for prostitutes at every corner. But, Vegas has so much more to offer. Red Rock should be at the top of your list when visiting Vegas - no question about it.

It's about 17 miles away from Vegas - a super quick drive. It's a 13-mile scenic drive and also boasts more than 30 miles of hiking trails! The drive is pretty incredible and has stops all along the way to snap photos, hop on trails or enjoy a picnic.

Realistically, you can spend all day here. Plan for at the VERY LEAST 3 hours.

The first stop was the most packed. There's some great hiking and photo ops at this stop... I wish we had ventured deeper (read:higher) into the trail to get some other vantage points. It was a little crazy with kids running around everywhere, so we decided it was best to hop back in the car and continue the drive.

It's hard to put into words how incredible this place is. I've admitted in the past I am easily impressed by mountains - you know, growing up in Florida and all - but this place really is spectacular. For $7 per car this is easily the BEST value in all of Vegas.

On the very last stop we took the trail down and spotted some burros! There were two fairly near to us - and another three chilling on a nearby hill. They looked like they were pets - so well taken care of with groomed hair! They obviously aren't pets (note: These are wild animals, so beware) but you just wanted to reach out and pet them!

Our steak was tougher than it should be and unevenly cooked. It was over-seared on one side. It seemed like lesser quality meat than previous trips. The scallops were ok, but nothing to write home about.

Service was terrible. Our server was standoffish and inattentive. Even the extra service staff was lackluster compared to previous visits.

One of my pet peeves, it just looked boring.

What really surprised me as it would have been the last thing I'd have ever ordered was my friends stew.  The stew was a luscious combination of meat and vegetables.  It almost looked almost like a thick soup.  I like it when something just looks like it would be something I'd really like to have just seeing it. .  My friend said it was as appetizing as it looked.  This is what I will have the next time I go there.

second: the service is out the door the best i have ever had. the waitress not only got everything from drinks to appetizers to the meal right but did it all with out writing a thing down. i have been places where the waitress writes it down and still gets it wrong. she was super friendly and even joked with us. (we can be rowdy). 
third: the food was spectacular. i don't usually get appetizers but the ones we got were fantastic. stuffed mushrooms and mashed potato bites. the salad that came with the meal was plenty big, and it came with the meal, no if you want a salad its an extra 3 bucks like most places do now days. the portion sizes were good size and every thing tasted fantastic, not one complaint from a table of 5. i got the fish and chips and unlike most fish and chips where its all batter and no fish this was big chunks of fish lightly battered and tons of fries.

My mouth was dripping with chicken juices after a single bite WOW! I would never expected such a hidden gem. The only reason why I knocked off a star was because it was too tiring for me to eat.

I ordered the Large Nanban Rice. 

Gushi Chicken (Karaage) 6/5*
Redirect to first line.

Nanban Sauce 2/5*
There just was not enough sauce :/ I picked Nanban for a reason because of it's refreshing taste to help relieve the grease from the chicken and there was only a little poured onto 1 karaage

Nanban Mayo 3.5/5*
It was really good actually I loved the mayo but there was just so much of it and plus it didnt come in a seperate container so it was just all over 1 Fried Chicken piece and 1/3 of my rice which made it really hard to finish my rice.

Rice 3/5*
I wanted to like the rice but it was mixed with sushi vinegar I believe and so the rice puffed up and sticky so it was harder to continue eating such filling and dense textures ontop of the grease and fat. I like the idea that they put black and brown korean rice in it but the way the rice was thicker because of additional seasoning made me kinda grossed out by the end of the meal.

Overall I will definately come back to try their other options because I just simply love how they do their chicken. Top quality Karaage here guys!",2017-03-22 18:59:46

It is almost 196 acres of desert beauty not far from the lights and action of Vegas, but still a whole world away.  Here you can see the natural beauty of rocks that glow red and beige in the sun and look like sand dunes frozen in time (which, in fact, they are).  

Joshua trees, yucca, shrubs and myriad cactii abound, and if you are lucky you will see little critters such as lizards, hares, chipmunks and prarie dog-looking creatures (can't remember what they are called).  There are numerous lookout points along the smoothly paved road- motorcyclists love this drive.  It is a two-lane road and faster drivers will pass you if you are too busy enjoying the views to speed along, but fine- let 'em whiz pass you! In fact, you might want to stop at the main overlook that has a covered area where you can rest for a bit, take photos and maybe have a little picnic, then wander up the nearby path.  I see lots of wedding parties stopping here for photo opportunities.  

While you are looking down at the vast desert landscape from the Overlook, you'll see tiny cars moving along and you might wonder how they got there.  Well, if you take  the 13-mile winding scenic tour, one of those cars will be the one you're driving!  I encourage you to take the tour ($5 per car) so that you can get closeup views of the remarkable mountains and old quarries.  There are more lookout points to stop at and some dirt roads to explore as well.

Las Vegas is MUCH more than gambling, restaurants, and shows.  The  desert is worth exploring and so close to the Strip it would be a pity for tourists to skip it (and a shame for locals to miss!).",2007-09-10 15:53:46

I would highly recommend getting the Prime Rib Dinner which includes: salad, a cut of prime rib, a side of mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. The Yorkshire pudding was a little odd, but more on that later. 
The house salad is delicious, it's their signature ""spinning salad"" that is tossed table-side. After that they wheel around a whole cart of prime rib prepared to different temperatures depending on your preference. So you just tell them what size cut you want and the slice it right there for you. And I think my favorite part about eating prime rib is the horseradish sauce. Lawry's gives you two different kinds- the really concentrated kind which will clear your sinuses out for a week, and the whipped kind which is light a fluffy and better for the more sensitive palette. 
The prime rib is served on the side of some mashed potatoes. You also have the option of some a la carte veggies like creamed spinach or creamed corn.
Then they give you this Yorkshire pudding- which I always thought was a dessert. But it's a dry kind of bread that you let soak in the au jus and mop up all that delectable flavor.

- deviled eggs
- mango mousse 
- dark chocolate (that was shaped and colored like a heel)

All their beer is small market micro brewed for example.  The price only reflects this a bit,  it's not cheap but won't break the bank either.

I've never actually done breakfast here ... usually lunch and a couple dinners.  It's ""famous"" for breakfast so maybe I should actually give it a go one day.

The only things I don't like about it are: 1) the line to order can easily get unweildy and confusing, so just be aware of that during the lunch rush and 2)they have super limited hours. Both of those things, though, are totally understandable and the food is so good that I will still give this place 5-stars. 

This is a sandwich/burger place in the best way possible. Everything is made on a grill and is made to order. The menu features a variety of burgers (veggie included) with a creative and traditional toping list. I have had the traditional burger, a roast beef panini and the eggs benedict (with salmon). I have also had both the regular fries and the sweet potato chips. Everything was delicious and fresh. I cannot wait to go back and sample the beet chips. 

This isn't necessarily the sort of place where you go with a large group, I must say. The tables can be pushed together, but seating is pretty limited so it can be a challenge. I would, however, recommend this place either for a quick lunch or brunch any day of the week.",2014-12-09 18:09:40

MhR2XErr07__zem72UGsCw,LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,3,1,0,0,"Half-priced martini's and a nice collection of small and medium bites for happy hour, which stretches out way past the norm by ending at 7:30pm.  BF and I got here around 7pm on a Thursday night and were rudely greeted by what I can only describe as a tool bag at the entrance asking us to get to the back of the line where we could be carded to come in. Once security deemed us old enough to enter, we walked into the patio area to search for a table or seats at the bar.  It was really nice outside, so this outdoor patio area was hoppin'.  

After spending 10 minutes repeating what we JUST did in the parking lot (wandering around aimlessly for a spot), we gave up and went inside.  Inside the restaurant was rather empty so we grabbed a table easily.  The only problem was that it was FREEZING inside.  I felt like whatever table we were at, cold air was blowing directly on me.  We decided to brave it out.

A nice friendly waitress came over and informed us it was still happy hour, to our extreme pleasant surprise.  He ordered a dirty martini with blue cheese-stuffed olives, and I ordered the Mango Madness.  Both were okay.  Mine was a little sweeter than I'd like, and his just wasn't 100%, but we did end up ordering one more each, so they must not have been that bad.

For food, we ordered the margarita flat bread, the sliced sirloin, fruit and cheese plate, and crab cakes.

Let's start with the bad (because I like people to leave my reviews on a good note).  The crab cakes were super mushy.  The flavor was mediocre at best, but they just completely fell apart when you went to get a piece of it with your fork.  It was really more of a crab mush than a crab CAKE.  The breading was not crispy at all and just didn't add anything to the dish.  It was served with an orangish drizzle that could have been spicy mayo.  I think whatever it was, it was the dish's only saving grace because it had a delicious flavor.

The next bad dish was the fruit and cheese plate.  What a disappointment.  I'm sorry, but when I order a fruit and cheese plate at a place like Blue Martini, I would expect the cheese to NOT include baby bells.  There was a slab of goat cheese in the middle, a few squares of swiss, and two baby bells, along with an array of fruit and crackers.  There was only one strawberry on the plate and it was more green than it was red.  The whole plate, which was very large, was a complete disappointment and we ended up wasting most of it.

Okay, onto the good.  The sliced tenderloin plate was so delicious.  The slices of tenderloin (which is what a filet mignon is cut from) were so tender and juicy.  The dish came with some rice pilaf and a horseradish sauce.  All of the flavors combined were perfectly well-balanced and made a delicious dish.

Last, the margarita pizza was amazing.  So simple and yet so complex.  The crust was just the right amount of crispy.  The tomatoes complimented the light but flavorful cheese just right.  

Our server also brought my BF extra olives for his second martini because she saw me eating them out of his glass.  She was really sweet, friendly and we never had to wait on her so that was a huge plus.  If not for her service, I may have given the martini a sad 2-stars.",2013-04-01 22:05:19

Seems like the dinner menu is much better in terms of variety. Portions are on the tiny side, and I found myself to crave a little more food after I finished - as did several others I had lunch with. 

Ordered the Pacific Salmon which was served with soba noodles...it was tasteless. It tastes like something you should eat if you're on a strict diet. You should also know that the salmon is not fully cooked and left medium rare. I understand this is a new way of cooking salmon but I prefer my salmon fully cooked. I just wasn't satisfied at all with this meal both in terms of flavour and portion.

Wanted to have a cappuccino after, but unfortunately they didn't have lactose free milk. For such an upscale restaurant, that was rather disappointing. The only saving grace is that this is a fantastic location with great decor, comfortable seats, and great service.",2016-02-07 02:54:10

I've been to Shake Shack before in DC and knowing that it opened in Charlotte I wanted to check the place out. And well, it was exactly what I expected, minus the amount of people that was lined up outside the restaurant about an hour before closed. 

I ordered some smoke shack burgers, however I did ask for a lettuce wrap which I can confidently say that Shake Shack does do. The only problem with their lettuce wrap burger is that it's not the greatest. Granted they are known for their potato buns but, for me I am always trying to find ways to cut down the carbs if it's possible. We had a huge order, and let's just say they're not that great at that, so my experience was a little different than others.

This Shake Shack needs to still fix logistics problems and get faster with getting their orders out. So, I don't think it's perfect and there is still definitely work that still has to be done.

Price wise... I think it's a little high for the burgers. They aren't the most amazing burgers, and I sort of still think for fast food burgers (on the East Coast) for lettuce wrap burgers for me... Five Guys still holds supreme. But if it's on the West Coast, In-n-Out all day. And you will definitely be asked which is better if you've been to both. People in Charlotte now have the chance to weigh in on their opinions. 

Overall, Shake Shack isn't bad. It's actually pretty awesome. I think that this location needs to speed up their orders, but it's understandable that they have a line and it's pretty hyped. And also, it's nice to see it get to Charlotte. Definitely recommend you to try it out if you haven't gotten the chance to. Just know that you will probably encounter a line.",2018-07-03 17:47:14

Two of my friends had been before, but this was my first experience. When I first walked into the restaurant, I was immediately struck by the traditional cushion-y blue velvet chairs and all of the heavy draperies. Stuffy, perhaps, but also beautifully and tastefully done.

I would recommend dressing up, as most of the men were wearing jackets. Of course, they won't kick you out if you show up in jeans, but it's a classy place, so dress appropriately.

We were seated right in front of the window, which provided a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains at night. So pretty! This was one of my favorite parts of the experience.

Trying not to over-do it on my first night of eating in Vegas, I ordered the Market Tomato Salad and the Scallops. I had a lemon martini to start, and it was fantastic. I asked for more savory than sweete, and the bartender made the drink perfectly. We ordered a Trimbach Riesling for the table, and this very dry riesling from the Alsace region in France has become one of the white wine staples I keep in my home.

The burrata on the tomato salad was perfectly creamy and balanced well with the fresh tomatoes. I've had some mediocre tomato-mozzarella salads in my day, but this one was perfect. The scallops were perfectly seared, and the capers added the appropriate level of salty bitterness to match the sweetness of the scallops. Delicious!

One of my friends ordered the filet as she always does, and it was a perfect medium, with the perfect level of charring on the outside. I tried a bite and dipped it into the peppercorn sauce. It was fantastic. I had a bite of creamed spinach as well, and it had just the right amount of acid to counterbalance the cream.

Enjoying conversation with friends while watching the Bellagio fountains at night capped off the evening. I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas.",2014-01-07 14:55:44

It left me scratching my head whether I should eat here or not.  I didn't really want to wait for a table upstairs at Ichiza, so hunger took over my conscience and made me sit in Yagyu.

What caught my eye on the menu were the three types of combinations for 2. Prices ranged from $27 to $60. We decided to go with the cheapest combo, since even that seemed more than enough to fill us up. Kimchi came out, along with miso soup, seaweed salad, and edamame. Shortly after, a basic salad came out with a very light and satisfying dressing. Next, came a full plate of some fried items (pork cutlets, chicken pieces, gyoza) and about 8 pieces of sushi. We ordered two sides of Portuguese sausage as well, at $2.50 a pop. It was pretty tasty. Lastly, the meats came out while we were modestly gorging at all the dishes presented to us.  The meat showed some quality, which also proved itself in taste.

Everything came out promptly. Food was pretty good too. Nothing really blew my mind; but then again, there was nothing to complain about. Prices seemed very reasonable too, considering all the food we got. Almost $16 a person for this wide array of food + dessert. I could see myself coming back again.",2010-10-17 21:35:38

Not sure if that is a regular thing, just Sundays or just that one day... you may have to call and ask. Additionally, they were doing a special with bottles of Dom P for $100!!! I was down to do it but nobody else was so we just ordered individual drinks.

Service gets a 5 out of 5 for me. Andrew was our server and was very attentive and did a great job explaining specials and some of his favorites on the menu. As a group we tend to go through a lot of bread and he kept it coming throughout the whole meal.

My biggest negative was the price of drinks... wow. Nightclub prices at a restaurant.

Cupcake Shot:
Vanilla vodka, some sort of cream I believe and something else... the rim was lined with icing and sprinkles. I'm not a fan of these type of shots but this one was pretty good!

Tomahawk (I didn't get it but the others did):
50 oz for $169... a bit out of my price range and considering the bone probably makes up for 10-15oz didn't think it was really worth it. However, I tried a few bites and... oh man... drooooool. I'm not a big steak fan, but I could probably eat that every day for the rest of my life and be a happy camper.

Caesar Salad:
Split this with Kacey as an appetizer. Pass on this... The lettuce was overly chilled for me and I wasn't a fan of their Caesar dressing.

Short Rib:
I find that we've been ordering short rib just about everywhere we go lately. This was probably the second best I've ever had but it was really close to first. Delicious! Perfectly cooked and really good flavor.

Dessert Sampler:
I normally don't make it to dessert but seeing as how I split my meals with Kacey I had some room left over. Peanut Butter Mouse Cake (I think) with a side of raspberry ""jelly"" whipped cream of sorts on the side was the star of this platter. But the others were very tasty as well: flour-less chocolate cake, cheesecake, little hershey kiss type things and a tiramisu.

If you go and buy the tickets there, make sure you understand what timing you are getting for an entry time to the exhibit.
Timings are on the hour and it is very busy right now (during the holidays), so if you have a 2 pm or 3 pm entry time -- you may not get in until 230 or 330.  This is especially important for those who want to see the exhibit just before closing.

Also, we went there and got there before 3 pm, but when we got up to buy our tickets - they were not until 4 pm and then were very delayed and we had to leave by 5 pm --- so we would not have had the time to enjoy.   They were good about it and did refund our money.

Arguably we should have planned better -- but we do think they should have advised before we bought the tickets what time we would be able to enter the exhibition.  SO -- if you want to enter at a certain time -- either buy the tickets online for the timing you want OR ask FIRST.

We did see the Picasso exhibit here and it was great.
I do hope we get to see this before it leaves -- but I can say I will not be trying again during the holidays -- it was just too crazy busy!

UPDATE on this review --- we finally did get to see this review.  We came first thing on the Saturday morning -- best idea ever!

We started out with the cheese and charcuterie plate, which was pretty good.  Nice prosciutto.  The brie it came with was a little boring.  Next we had the garden of Eden salad, which was pretty tasty.  A nice light salad with lots of vegetables.  

Then we got to try three different sliders: blazin', BBQ pork, and Mama's meatball.  The BBQ pork blew them all away.  Yummy, tender goodness. The blazin' was pretty good, but just a typical slider with bacon.  The Mama's meatball was bland and hard to eat.  A round meatball in a tiny bun with a little bit of tomato sauce is not the best idea in the world.

They also gave us regular fries and sweet potato fries (what they call Southern fries) with some sort of pink dipping sauce.  I'm usually a fry fiend, but these things were not too good.

The dinner came with samplings of the Double Helix wine - sparking wine, chardonnay, and zinfandel.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Definitely get something else besides the house wine. 

The best part was the Hostess with the Mostess adult milkshake.  They blend a Hostess cupcake with ice cream and cake flavored vodka.  It sounds disgusting, but it was actually pretty amazing.  

It looks like they have a strong beer selection on tap.  A dedicated kegerator for Stella and some selections from Stone and other craft brews.  Service was good and enthusiastic.

My boyfriend had the Breakfast Americaine, and I ordered the chicken and waffles.

This is no Roscoe's chicken and waffles; it's MUCH MUCH better.

The chicken was roasted and came with a delicious sauce.  The waffles had bacon and chives, which sounded questionable, but totally worked with this dish.  It was accompanied by warm maple syrup and Tahitian vanilla butter.  YUMMMMMMMMMMM

I want a coffee shop where I can do my work in a peaceful and cozy setting without sitting on top of the person next to me and I'd love to have the option of a good sandwich if I happen to stay during lunch hour. I think I found that at Hob Nobs.  

After driving by Hob Nobs too many times over the years, I finally made my way inside through the adorable patio surrounding a quaint historic house. The moment I stepped inside, it felt like I had stepped into a welcoming home. The warm wooden floors complimented the historic banisters and the house had the old feeling to it without smelling old. That's a plus and sometimes hard to find in an old house. 

I looked around and saw plenty of seating options including several tables and chairs on the patio and several all throughout the house, including a converted sun room in the front. But personally, my favorite area was the living room with a worn in leather couch and two leather chairs looking at the fireplace still decorated with Christmas attire. 

The staff warmly greeted me and I asked the lady what she normally likes. She pointed me in the direction of the Smokey Joe -- Gouda, turkey and tomato on white bread. I opted out of the Dijon and added in honey mustard and it was definitely a tasty treat! The bread was toasted and the turkey was warm and freshly roasted. The honey mustard with sweet and creamy all in one. It came with a pickle and small cup of fruit. The meal itself wasn't on the cheap end ... more like middle of the road expensive...about $10 for a sandwich and drink. However, I think it's definitely worth it if you are looking for a place to set up shop for awhile and this is definitely a cozy spot. Awhile later, I needed a caffeine boost to get me through part two of the day, so I went the iced coffee route. They have a huge assortment of syrups and the coffee is freshly roasted and tasty. It was just $2 for a 16 oz cup of coffee which isn't bad in my book! So, while the sandwiches might be a bit on the pricier end, the coffee is spot on reasonably priced. Plus on the sandwich end, the ingredients are so fresh, I'd rather pay a bit more for the oven turkey like I had. 

So whether it's warm or cool weather, Hob Nobs is an excellent option for a true coffee house experience...they even have life music some nights!",2010-12-29 00:19:42

1) Do I like sushi? I guess she hasn't noticed that 75% of my reviews are of sushi restaurants. 
2) If I had known we were going to go for sushi I wouldn't have eaten so many cupcakes at the burstday bash! 

Fortunately, I can always make room for sushi.  Cara called ahead to make sure this new sushi restaurant was able to serve us at this late dining hour (almost 11pm). They obliged and there were 5 seats at the sushi bar waiting for us when we got there.

The staff here is super friendly and ridiculously fast.  We placed our orders and were eating within minutes.  We started with a scallop appetizer that was served on a pringle chip. Um, yum.  And I also ordered some hot sake to warm me up on this ridiculously cold night.  Speaking of warming me up the truffle lobster miso soup also did the trick and may have well been the yummiest miso soup I've ever had. Truffle oil and lobster makes everything better!

For my sushi fix I went with a soft shell crab roll and a piece of tobiko.  It totally hit the spot and I managed to finish it all even though I was pretty full from all those cupcakes. 

I'm typically looking for a good sushi spot when I visit new cities and I think I've found one in Cleveland!

Both were excellent.  They even gave us the StripSteak Trio of Duck Fat Fries complementary. The sauces severed with the fries were a barbecue, truffle, and ketchup.  The truffle sauce was the best.  Our entrees were the American Kobe Rib Cap and American Kobe Fillet Mignon.  Both of the Kobe beef was cooked to perfection of medium rare and seasoned perfectly.  It was so soft, that you didn't need a knife to cut it, especially the rib cap...gotta love that marbled fat. We accompanied our steaks with the Sauteed Baby Brussel Sprouts, Bacon Lardon Steam Asparagus, Mascarpone Beurre Blanc.  The brussel sprouts were out of this world...again, cheers to fat, this time the bacon.

I was so stuffed, but I forged on to eat dessert. I had to live it up as it was my last night in Vegas.  We both shared the beignet with butterscotch pudding and the dough nut with banana fosters. Both desserts were OK, and here is where I think the improvement needs to be made.  The butterscotch pudding was not memorable, as it was not as sweet as I would have liked it to be.  

I would have given it 5 stars, but the dessert was a little let down. But the services was excellent.  Shout out to our server Kyle, another local boy from Hawaii, ""you da best"".  In all, a very enjoyable dinner.  Plus they gave me one of the menu's when I asked if they had a take home version.

Why else would a some bagel shops charge $1.50 for the bagel with spread, while the others go for $2.00 plus?  And still others charge $4.00 for a bagel with egg and cheese, while other do it for $2.00?

Brueggers, as a chain, was blessed with the breakfast sandwich advantage, and they do it well.  Not only can you get an egg o'bagel for under $3.00, but you can also add spinach, mushrooms, and other fresh veggies to it for just a few shekels more.  This is not possible at your other corporate bagel stops.  If a bagel with a spread won't do, Bruegger's is a better bet.  

Add to that the fact that this store is just a doorway away from a Carribou's Coffee and this is breakfast made in heaven.  Sadly, though, I am not alone in this assessment as both sides can be quite full on weekend mornings.  This even holds true for the outside patio tables during warmer weather, where people watching is at a premium.  Sadly this can making parking a challenge too, though CMC's lot next door has helped out.

The other challenge is, as mentioned by others, cleanliness of the place.  Staff are apparently too busy serving new customers and ringing them up, as late mornings look something like a post-locust plague landscape in terms of trash and spills left along table tops.  A little gross, but easy to fix.

The challenge with this establishment is the club-like ambiance and accompanying service. Waiters forget things, don't notice you, and somehow manage to find a balance between trying too hard and missing details.

For example, during both my visits, the waiters mixed up sparkling and flat water, resulting in a semi-carbonated beverage for everyone at the table. They remedied this by re-pouring flat water, but the member of our party who had the carbonated drink in the first place was just left with the partially carbonated glass.

The dinner crowd had probably rushed off. but the service was still impeccable. My server was professional and friendly. He made sure my water was always filled. Brought fresh bread and served the oil and rosemary on my side plate.

I ordered the pasta special (sardines in tomatoe penne pasta) and a chianti clasico. This was so satisfying. Simple ingredients elevated by quality preparation. To be frank. I was thinking of the risotto but once I heard the special, I was torn and decided to get the special. No regrets.

I frequently patronize another Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood and felt like I was cheating the entire time I was there. But it was so delicious! I guess I have to return to taste the risotto!",2017-09-08 00:13:44

To sell nice things to nice people=)  Mrs. Huizenga's located at Dundas and Keele is a pretty funky vintage store.  The store stocks mostly recycled goods just like an orphanage for vintage personal items, or a super cool garage sale.  I purchased a ridiculous piece of furniture there. In retrospect I probably should have thought about it more than a second before buying this monstrosity of an item.  It truly competes with everything in the room for the most wrong looking object.  It is a fireplace/record player/bar circa 1960-70s.  I figured hey, all of my favourite things combined in one unified unit!  The store owner arranged for movers to help me with the beast.  The store employees were very charming and fun.  I think it is a hit or miss type situation with this vintage store, as so many are. The prices seemed reasonably and there was not one pretentious vibe in the store. Worth it for sure to explore if you are in the hood.  I recommend this establishment.

I had driven by this place dozens of times before, but never had stopped in until today.  Reviews seemed positive, and when is pie ever bad?  Um....don't answer that question just yet.  Read the rest of my review, first ;-).

I walked in and went over to the little display case and browsed the selection of pies.  I decided to go with 2 of their mini (5 inch) pies.  I went with a key lime pie, and a banana cream pie.  A nice lady rang me up, offered me some forks and napkins and I was ready to get out of dodge.  Total for my 2 small pies was $12.03.  Here is how they were.............

Key Lime-  I took this one out back to my car and dug in right then and there.  The pie looked pretty nice, with a smooth green color and a nice portion of whipped cream on top.  I noticed that this pie did not have any kind of crust peeking out.  I took a bite and dug into the bottom of the little pie to get a good first bite.  First impression was, meh.  The pie was a bit too sweet, and the crust was all funky.  The crust was made with nuts and was way too wet and moist.  I prefer a straight up graham cracker crust in my cream type pies.  The filling was a little bit too soft and didn't provide the best texture in my mouth.  I ate the whole thing, but was not really that impressed.  It was like a 2.5 star pie.  Not bad enough to throw away, but definitely not good enough to buy again.

Banana Cream-  I took this one to go to eat at home.  (For the record, I kept it in my cooler with ice packs for my 30 minute ride home, so I know that it didn't spoil due to temperature or anything like that.)  I dug into this one after dinner.  This pie had a nice looking top layer, with a traditional pie crust peeking up around the edges, as well as a dollop of whipped cream in the center.  I took a bite and was a bit taken aback.  First initial reaction was, yuck!  It tasted like some kind of chemical taste and not a sweet banana flavor that I was expecting.  I took another bite to make sure that it wasn't just one bad bite. Nope...next bite was similar.  I dove into the crust and was extremely disappointed in that, too!  This crust had NO flavor.  NONE.  No Crisco, no butter, no flakiness, no nothing!  It may have been the most tasteless and worst pie crust I have ever tried.  It was flat out bad!  I ate out most of the filling in the middle, just to avoid that horrible crust!  Even then, the middle of this pie had browned bananas underneath the pudding type filling and everything just tasted ""off"".  I threw this in the trash.  I ate about 75% of the filling as to not waste the whole damn thing, but even that was a chore.  This was the worst banana cream pie I have ever tasted.  Seriously...it was gross!  

The lady running the joint was very friendly and cheerful and that is about the only saving grace of this place and the only reason it gets even 2 stars.  Maybe it was just these small pies that were funky?  Maybe a slice of one of their larger pies might be tasty as fuck?  Who knows? If someone served me a slice of pie from this place, sure, I would eat it and see if today was just a ""one off"", but I'm never going to come back here to purchase a pie again, and I was totally disappointed.  Meh!",2016-10-23 06:32:13

I tried the bahn mi, since it seems to be a house specialty, and I found it lacking flavor. The Roast Beef & Cheese was better, although I tasted cheese more than the thin amount of roast beef they put on. Next time I'd order extra meat. I can't complain at the prices either, $3-$5 for a sandwich is good, and $1.25 for a baguette to take home is better than local grocery stores in price and flavor.

You're definitely going to find something to enjoy here, be it the various food booths, carts and trucks, or the diverse array of art vendors, or the art walks and music performances. I've found that vendors alone are worth stopping by to see, as there are some incredibly talented locals who display their works and designs here. But the activities and so forth that have been added on as the festival has grown are also a big part of why I love the festival. The music performances in particular are a lot of fun to experience - anyone from local guitarists to the Pittsburgh Symphony can perform during the arts festival. The result is a great opportunity to support local artists and musicians alike!

The arts festival is always downtown, which is a great location - if you work downtown, you have somewhere to go during your lunch break, and even if you don't, you're almost certainly going to be able to catch a bus that will take you in the right direction from your neighborhood. And boy, do people take advantage of their lunch breaks/days off/access to public transportation or parking garages during this event. I swear the festival is always packed from end to end, rain or shine - so remember when attending that this a popular event in Pittsburgh. Always be ready for a crowd, and on a nice day be ready to also watch your step and avoid the little children that inevitability bolt across your path.

What holds me back from giving this popular annual event 5 stars? Well, the food remains horrendously overpriced - especially for what you're getting and especially when considering how many good food joints have sprung up downtown over the last few years - but also, if you come year after year after year, things really begin to blur together and look the same. It's like the festival has kind of fallen into a rut and hasn't done a lot to spice or change things up recently. So things are still fun, but it's like you're repeating the fun experience you had the year before that, and the year before that.

I'm really not saying going to the festival will be a bad time by any means though. I think my nitpicks are just that, and could easily be remedied by not going every year if I reeeeally didn't want to. So if you live in town and haven't been here yet, why the heck not?

Since we came here mainly for the atmosphere, (and by golly was it classy), I will start off with a heads up to any of you who're looking for quality food. Coming here might not be the best idea. I ordered a ham, provolone with tomato and basil panini for us to share, a hot coffee for me, water for my mom and a glass of merlot for papa. The 'panini' came in a regular sandwich bread and taking it from my mom, who experienced working at a coffee shop when she was younger, 'ordinary' was the word to describe it, not to mention, what was served to us wasn't a panini to begin with. (it would've been a grilled sandwich and the provolone cheese would've melted. Ours was cold) The coffee tasted more like tap water than anything, really and I had to douse it in a lot of milk before I could bring myself to drink it down. 

Service wasn't exceptional although we did have a friendly waitress. She knew the menu well and brought in our food pretty swiftly. I just wish that the way the staff presented themselves was as neat and sophisticated as the restaurant they were working in was.

AMAZING. highly recommend all. By far the best tasting caprese salad that doesn't shy down on its portions or cheese slices. Fresh and light. The pizzas were done quite quickly maybe about a 10 or so minute wait. Would need a fork and a knife to cut into it because the toppings weigh down the bread a bit. Crust/appetizers/bread is very very good with the hot garlic sauce provided. If I could buy it I would! If you're not a fan of hot it might come off as really spicy. But the flavour is strong and works well with the breads for sure! Bread is fresh, with a perfect crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Price- fairly priced! About $12-25 dishes. Nothing heavy on the pocket. 

Service & environment- Amazing. Waitress kept checking up on us, let us sit near the tv to watch the Jays game. Made sure our water jug was never empty. Accommodated us really well! Environment was a quiet ambience with dim lights (on a Sunday night). Family friendly.

My last experience at Ticoz was awful... It seems like as soon as Lola Tapas closed, everything went completely downhill. The happy hour went way up (used to be $2 sangria on Tuesdays now $3.50), they hired a new staff, service became crap during busy hours, they altered their menu (to cheapen it up) - like Kat S said, there used to be 3 salsas that came with freshly fried chips...now, there is one crappy salsa that, last time I visited, came with cold, stale chips - and to top things off, their sangrias lack the greatness in flavor and quality that I once saw in them.

It really sucks to regularly go somewhere and watch it crumble. Ticoz initially ticked me off, but then won me over for the longest time. I recommended people go there and have a great experience (and sangria), but like any roller coaster relationship, the highs and lows are beginning to take their toll on me, and I know I need to just let go. I may wind up at Ticoz if a friend of mine wants to go, but I won't be leading the pack there anytime soon. #sadface",2011-02-01 23:02:22

The quality of food at Akahana matched my expectations.  I rarely have high expectation for restaurants that have huge menus and broad food styles.  Akahana serves up the usual suspects from the usual Asian countries, and they do an admirable--though definitely not spectacular--job with their food.  

My pho was tasty.  I've certainly had much, much better pho, but, as previously mentioned, I never expected to consume the best of anything here.  Ginny had a few sushi rolls, all of which I considered to be on par with similar items at Sushi 101. 

If you're in the area and you're hungry for a decent meal, Akahana fits the bill.  If your expectation is to have the most fabulous Asian dish you've ever experienced, this will not fit the bill.",2012-03-21 17:16:07

Anyways, I ordered the Vigazz burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was interesting with grilled red onions, tomatoes, cheese, and greens. It looked really good but tasted ok. Let me put it this way. Not a lot of taste. I really loved the sweet potato fries. Overall, I thought it was an okay meal. 

My wife ordered the Turkey sandwich which had tons of turkey with coleslaw and cranberry on a pretzel roll. Nice combination. I stole a quick bite and it was really good.  

The service was really good. We were greeted quickly at our table. Drinks were at our table quickly and refills regularly. They even boxed my wife's leftovers.

We each ordered Pho, but I was eying that stir fry #42.  I ordered #23, which was chicken Pho.  After a short while, two bowls of Pho arrived at our table and luckily, one was mine.  Then a few minutes later, three more bowls arrived and we were digging in to the soup.

Along with the Pho, they gave us two plates of vegetables, which included jalapenos, FRESH basil, limes, bean sprouts, and two sauces.  You can put these in your Pho, if you like.  We all put some veggies in the Pho and it was pretty good.  

This was the first time I've had Pho, so I didn't know what to expect.  The bowl was actually huge and the price was $9.95.  It was definitely worth the price based on the quantity of noodles and soup that you get, but the flavor didn't knock my socks off. I think I'll try the stir fry next time.

Located somewhat centrally towards the west side of town, this place has a limited amount of parking.. only because there are a lot of other great establishments around the area.

Right away walking into this place... it's loud! This place is a bar/restaurant after all.. With many people eating and drinking and music playing.. this place is not your quiet spot to dine... 

Booth style seating that can fit from 4 people to 8 comfortably.. and many tables in the center. 

I came here for the Lobster Pho.. and this Lobster Pho was not something to mess with..

I walked in and was greeted right away. I was already armed with what I wanted and ordered to-go. She was very nice and quickly passed on the order to another woman who gave it to the cook. The dining area was clean, quiet, dark and cool. There was a flat screen playing AMC (yay! I have no use for sports). There were a couple diners and listening to the waitress take one women and older gentlemans order, she was super patient. Explained everything to them and adjusted the order as needed. To me, its not just how they treat me, but others when they don't know their being observed. 

I ordered Vegetable Red Curry (Yea, I'm obsessed with curry). I just said Hot, not sure if they go by number system or what. I waited about 5mins., in that time a couple to go orders were picked up - good sign, since it was 4pm yet. Not quite dinner time for most. Telling me it could get busy during peak hours.

I got home and opened my containers. First, the rice they give is a very large portion! It looked like 4 scoops. The Curry is also a large serving, good for two people or for two meals. It was filled with large vegetable pieces - carrots, snow peas, broccolli, etc. And it was HOT!! I was sniffling and sweating - omg! It was perfect! I had to stop and grab the fan and sit in front of it!

This place I will definently be going back to. Its a lot closer and a straight shot for me. Only 4 stars because I did only try one dish. I'm looking foward to trying the Beef Salad, Wonton Soup and other interesting dishes they have.

Update 9.3.13 - So I decided to dine in...and learned my lesson. I was seated quickly and just as quickly forgotten. Luckily I brought a book to read. The lady who sat me just walked away. Than a couple minutes later she sat a couple and quickly got their drink orders. I was a bit annoyed. But then another lady (Lek) appeared from the back 5-10mins later, she quickly got my order and gave me a glass of water.

Wonton Soup: First it is HUGE, omg I was embaressed becuase it was just me. Lek was like don't worry, you can take the rest home. Its good for 3+ people, and its only one size. It was really flavorful, had the huge chunks of vegetables, corn, carrots, leeks, etc. No spice to it and it was delicious!

Beef Salad: It wasn't a typical salad...when I think salad, I think lettuce with everything else. This came wiith slices of cucumber, tomato and a wedge of cabbage. It was a good portion sized and super hot! I didn't care for the cabbage, but with the cucumber/tomato was good. I actually went and bought a cucumber to eat with the beef salad the next day. A couple pieces were chewy, but upon inspection, (gross I know lol) it was the fatty part of the meat. It seems they don't trim off those parts.

Over all it was still a delicious meal, and Lek serving me improved my mood. She helped me the first time I came to this restaurant. Very nice and helpful, quickly bringing me anything I might need.",2013-08-15 13:37:00

Unknowing what was to come of this new market- quietly tucked away at the far end of Bridgeland - I was intrigured to see its progression and fruition on Facebook. After opening, this market far from disappointed and on the contrary - over delivered. I was pleasantly surprised to see the vast amounts of ""unique"" stock they took the time to pick out for this new venture. The large selection of organic dry good, authentic italian supplies and products, locally produced products and stocked deli proved exciting to get to know and try. Most all of the fresh dairy, meats, eggs and produce is also locally sourced and fully certified organic (I have been converted to organic milk as a result of the delicious fresh organic milk they sell which is made only towns away here in Alberta. I highly suggest the choclate milk as well:). It appears that since opening, they have also started increasing their product lines and volumes of food which offers more and more choice and option each time I stop by. 

If looking for a quick few things while driving home after work I suggest: Spolumbos chicken cannelloni (so fresh), the organic goat cheese, Kettle Chips, organic chocolate milk, some sliced italian sausage and smoked cheddar from the deli, and don't forget the 6 pack of San Pellegrino.

TPFC9I_cF0_obQOX8LJ-dw,Hw5riZfnB-B7G79vBTOssA,NFm869_w6cvVaWaNpAzjeA,5,2,0,0,"We went to Soul this past Friday. We got there alittle before 7 and expected a wait (always expect a wait at Soul....just put your name on the list and go grab a drink at one of the bars in the area!). However, we were seated immediately!

Before I continue, I just want to state that Soul isn't one of those places where you go in, get a meal, and leave. It is an experience. They want you to order 1-2 tapas and some drinks, enjoy, and then pick 1-2 more tapas (and repeat as many times as necessary). So, if it seems like the waiter/waitress is taking too long, that's the point! Enjoy yourself, chat, and relax. They aren't trying to kick you out the door as quick as possible to seat more people. They want you to take your time. They bring out food orders when they are ready....this is way different than most other restaurants, so I think this aspect turns many people off simply because they don't realize that is how it works. I believe this specific meal was around 2 hours. 

My husband and I went with another couple, and since we frequent Soul a good bit, we already had a pretty good idea of what we wanted. 

-Drinks: The ladies started with $3 Blue Moons (this is their regular price...not too bad for Charlotte!) and the guys ordered some whiskey drink that they later regretted because it came out in a tall girly glass with straw. Don't think the guys were super impressed with the mixed drink and later ordered Blue Moons as well. I'd stick with beer and wine here. They have a decent wine list that I have ordered from before. 

-First ordering of food: We started off with the garlic fries and hummus of the day. The garlic fries came out first. They are a HUGE serving.....enough for 4 to have plenty! They are delicious and covered in garlic....you can actually smell them while they are cooking them. The hummus of the day was a roasted red pepper hummus. The hummus was really good but I think the baked pitas were just ok.

-Second ordering of food: After chatting some, we ordered two orders of the pork belly tacos and one of the tuna tacos. The pork belly tacos are INCREDIBLE!!!! I think they have to be the best thing on the menu. Each order comes with 2 soft shell tacos....pork belly with chunks of balsamic watermellon. Soooooo good! The tuna tacos come with 3 hard shell tacos. The tuna is raw with tomatoes on top....I personally dont think they are as good as pork belly but still tasty and deserving of recognition!

-Third ordering of food: Sushi!!! We ordered the Napolean roll and Soul roll to share between the 4 of us (my husband also ordered some wings but I didnt eat any so I wont comment on them). Both rolls were so good. I don't know what brown sauce they put on the Napolean roll, but I loved it! 

-Lastly they brought out a piece of strawberry cake with a candle in it, since it was my husbands birthday. I dont know if it was free or our friends paid for it, though I would assume the latter. 

Overall, great night, amazing food, and good times with some friends!",2013-10-15 13:47:47

The seafood tower was excellent except for the peanut sized oysters. My salad was very good. My tuna entree was on a par with Outback Steakhouse.

From the friendly baristas to delicious coffee makes this place a great place to hangout with friends or work/study. This converted garage-like space into a cafe with its modern and streamlined decor makes it appealing for all generation despite the crowd is full of Millennials and the upcoming young Generation Z.

Their Macadamia Almond Latte is simply delicious and balanced, not too sweet. The milk & honey toast was really good and was a balanced flavor of sweetness and savory. Paired well with my latte. Another noteworthy drink is the Matcha Latte, which was subtle in flavor and not watered down like other cafes.

Another cool aspect of this cafe is the in house roasting machine. Very few cafes promote locally roasted coffee beans but this particular cafe takes pride in their coffee. I would also suggest sitting at the bar, which allows a great way to watch the baristas prepare your delicious hand-crafted drink or the cook preparing a delicious meal or snack.

They have lots of photos so feel free to point to your dinner. Otherwise, learn a bit of Spanish...great way to practice your language skills too. 

Super friendly. You can tell they like what they do. 

There was a wait for my order. As I was waiting I was able to see other orders coming out of the kitchen. The Cuban sandwich looked big and awesome. Next time, I'm getting it. They also have carne asada, tortas, burritos, soup. But I came for the tamales! This is a solid, authentic tamale place. Now you know where to order your New Year's meal. Two tamales were under $4...that is a great price! The salsa (red/green) was very spicy hot. Sensitive to heat? This is not the sauce for you. The chicken was great, the pork was very tender, and they also have 2 dessert tamales made with sweet fruit juice (pineapple); they would be perfect with ice cream. I ordered the cheese tamales, but after eating the other two, I couldn't go on (the cheese is currently in my fridge waiting for me to have a midnight snack).

They take credit cards, but since everything is so affordable, bring cash. Feed the family, pick up for your next party, support this little place.

KIdPdM5F2MRxDCSX67oJNA,RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,NEZCr0zLIPNYWNF57KsJJQ,4,10,9,14,"Reasonably priced Japanese casual restaurant serving simple sushi, rolls, bentos and rice bowls on the East side of Las Vegas.

I decided to check them out after seeing their Groupon promotion.  It is located in a not too busy strip mall in the part of town I have never visited until coming here.  But it is not that far from the Wynn, just straight down East Desert Inn Road.

Their menu is simple, but still offers a fair selection, plus their specials board has more tempting offers.  You can drop in and order food al la carte to eat on premise or as takeout, they also provide catering services for larger orders.

On my 2 visits, I was pretty much the only customer there, so you will likely never have to wait for an open table if you decide to dine in.  Plus the service was friendly, the entire place (including the restroom) is kept tidy and clean.  And the food order came out reasonably fast.  The food is relatively healthy too, it is not the highest quality Japanese food available in Las Vegas, but for the price and the part of town, it is more than adequate.

Thus far I have tried their Katsu Curry Special (the curry is just the plain curry sauce without any potatoes, carrots, etc.) which has a decent portion and also their Okame Udon (with tofu skin, shrimp tempura, Japanese fish cake and seaweed toppings) and a side of Tuna Roll. Everything was acceptably yummy and fits my diet's macros.  As far as desserts, I don't recall seeing it on their wall menu, which is good, since I didn't need the extra temptation of oh so sweet but alas empty calories.

Bonus for Food Network fans, the TV is always on that channel. So you can eat and watch whatever happens to be on at the moment and maybe get some inspiration of what to eat next.",2015-04-08 15:03:23
lrK31KG7sbAkr8ww6O8xxw,Un8b-5KCUvq0ybAcdgc5OA,5Qr0XNS4UPLoA22rY0ph5A,3,0,2,0,"The best way to describe my lunch at Li's would be the equivalent of being on a mild-mannered roller coaster. 

That moment when you see the ride,  anticipating the conquer: 
Li's posts their menu on the restaurant window, revealing an extensive list of dishes from northern China and Mongolia. $5-8 lunch specials from the land of lamb and carb heaven? You had me at Mongolian lamb pancake. Upon stepping in, you will find a fancy decor for an Asian place, upholstered chairs and wait staff dressed in traditional Malaysian clothing. Ookay okay. 

That first tease of a downhill: 
We went on a weekend. They don't offer the lunch specials as advertised outside on the weekend. Drat. Should have read the fine print, the devil is in the details. 

That slightly bigger second bump: 
The downside of a very diverse menu was the labouring process that ordering food-for-two turned into. Think a large hard cover book binded with 15+ pages of ambiguous categories, lost in translation English titles, and blown-up photos of the dishes. The latter just aggravates our growling stomachs even more. 

The climb:  
Service is pretty good for an Asian restaurant, waiter speaks enough English to provide us with some recommendations that we agree on. The anticipation grows as we wait for their most popular dishes, Stewed Beef Ribs with Bread and Mongolian Lamb Pancakes, to arrive. 

The climax: 
The Stewed Beef Ribs with Bread. Beef is well marinated and has that chewy-but-not-too-soft texture. The bread is not your traditional ""mantou"", but slightly deep fried ""mantou"" folded in layers.

The drop:
The highly anticipated Mongolian Pancakes. Not a bad dish overall, but I think my expectations were set really high because of the exotic sounding ""Mongolian"" prefix in the title. They're just ordinary green onion pancakes with lamb instead of the usual beef. Pancake was on the thicker side so ratio of pancake to meat was not ideal.

To conclude: I would recommend this place if you're already in First Markham Place, and craving the Asian version of comfort food. And bring more friends, so you can try out more things on the menu, since each dish is not cheap at $18-20. Or with your Markham-nese parents, who will foot the bill.",2014-03-23 17:52:48

The next level has an old fashioned popcorn cart which they drop off at the tables- I liked that part. The roof-top patio is huge - many U shaped couches for lounging and about two dozen tables for dining. There are movies being projected on to the brick walls of the buildings surrounding the patio and blue light projected down onto patrons. FYI: People don't look great in blue light. 

They asked me to take my hat off when I walked into the place which I found more funny than anything else (I wonder if fashion hat fedoras are ok?). They offer shisha for 35$ or 50$, beers for about 7$ and a cocktail of the day that ends at 7pm (odd).

Mango mein mein ice $8.95 - that's how it was written on the menu. I'm not trying to be cutesy. The portion was small when comparing with Cha Me Cha.

Driving along Power, we didn't see any sandwich/lunch places except for Subway, so when we saw a sign for Kokobelli Bagel Cafe, we decided to stop there. The place itself was small - maybe 7-8 tables - and decked out in some very colorful Ikea decor/accessories. At the beginning of the line, there were bins with fresh bagels sorted by flavor and some bags of day-old (and discounted) bagels. 

The woman who took our order and rang us up was super-friendly and reminded me of one those down-to-earth waitresses in a neighborhood diner. She took our order (3 different bagels with cream cheese and a bagel sandwich - we were hungry, ok?!) and repeated it all back. We took a seat and waited just a few minutes for our order to be prepared. 

Some of the highlights:
-The texture of the bagels (not too dry or moist)
-The cheddar bagel (not too greasy)
-The spinach and artichoke cream cheese (like someone took the ubiquitous dip and successfully made it into cream cheese)

Some of the not-so-great parts:
-The blueberry bagel (the blueberries were fluorescent blue and tasted like the kind in blueberry muffin mix)
-The honey walnut cream cheese (overwhelmingly sweet; almost tasted like frosting)
-The breakfast bagel sandwich with salsa, cheese, egg, and sausage (the sausage and egg were cold and kind of flavorless)

I definitely give this place props for being a local bagel shop that still makes their own bagels and cream cheese. However, some of the flavors could use some work, and fresher/more natural ingredients would probably do the trick in a lot of cases.",2008-07-20 22:17:41

The South Point has long been a popular place to watch all NFL action.  There are a lot of options, and since they expanded the far wall to build a football lounge, there is more seating than ever.  The Sports Book is where the biggest crowd is.  Connected to the book is a lounge with tables and bar seating, which gets really crowded.  You will need to get there early to get a seat.  There is the new(er) football lounge, which is on the back wall near the poker room.  This lounge has a large projection TV and many smaller tvs, showing most, if not all games at one time.  There are tables and bar seating available.  Service is good, the waitress is good about coming around often.  They offer a special on buckets of beer.  There is also the center bar in the casino, which has only bar seating (which is somewhat uncomfortable), and the tvs are overhead.  

I miss when they had football in the showroom ever Sunday.  It is a large, open space with lots of tvs, booth and table seating and a private bar.  This is also where they hold their MNF parties.  There is usually a radio broadcast by ESPN and lots of cash/prize giveaways.  There is a hot dog stand with 75 cent hot dogs.  It's hard to beat that!

Overall, South Point is one of my favorite places in the Valley to watch football.  There are lots of tvs and fans of every team.  It is also convenient if you are looking to place wagers on the games - just note that the Sports Book gets REALLY busy, so don't wait until the last minute to place your bet, or you'll be stuck in line at gametime!",2011-11-14 21:54:33

Thank god i didn't leave, the smell inside was worth the wait already.  As this was my first time, i ordered the salmon with cream cheese on the garlic bagel.  It was pretty awesome. Everyone was ordering dozens and dozens of bagels and there i was,  in line and only ordered 1 bagel and their pretzel. Not a big fan of bagels but this was pretty awesome, i must say. 

Pretzel was typical which made it a little disappointing.  Hoping it was something out of the ordinary. 

All in all, bagels are well worth the wait. The line actually moves pretty fast. Just keep in mind,  it is cash only here. 

The salmon with cream cheese was about $6.50.  Half a dozen bagel is roughly around $4 and a full dozen will run you $7-8.  Not the cheapest but well worth it.

We started with drinks.  Everyone got beer, except for me, which they enjoyed.  I wanted a cocktail and ordered the Watermelon Collins.  Delicious!  It was fresh and made entirely in house by their mixologist.  Seems like there are a lot more of them popping up around the city these days.  The $12 was a bit pricy.

Salad was a special: heirloom tomatoes with feta.  So fresh and delicious.  I had the Quinoa Crusted Tofu, which is a sandwich!  And it was REALLY good and a big serving.  It came with fries and the Tavern Slaw which was simple but yummy.  Others with me had the Fish & Chips (pan fried) and Pulled Lamb.  Overall, the food was delicious.

I have to say, and maybe it was the build up of anticipation, I was not overly impressed. The food was not bad, but I when I go somewhere with those kind of ratings, I prepare to be impressed. 

The first thing I dove into was the pizza. It was pretty greasy and wet (could've been since there were tomatoes and pepperoni). But it did have a nice buttery garlic taste, and fresh veggies. 

Second, the Crafton sub. It was a big sub, with lots of meat. It was also very wet, this time with Italian dressing. It wasn't terrible, there was just no wow factor when it comes to the flavor.

This cozy, slightly dim-lit neighborhood gem is the perfect place to bring your friends or loved ones for some drinks and a nice meal. I went there with my parents for lunch, and everyone loved what they had ordered.

I got a hot calvacidre (calvados + cider), and my dad got an allongé while my mom just stuck with water. My dad said that personally he didn't find it that strong, but then again, he does tend to like his coffee stronger than most people do (I took him to Juliette et Chocolat the next day and he loved their espresso). I thought that the calvacidre was pure boozy goodness with a hit of apple, but smelling it before drinking is not exactly the most pleasing experience for the olfactory senses.

For the food, my mom got the shrimp tacos with arugula salad, my dad got the pulled pork buns, and I got the polenta with feta, prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes, and a boiled egg. I thought the polenta tasted amazing when combined with the other ingredients, as it tasted creamy, slightly sour from the cheese, salty from the prosciutto, bitter from the arugula, and sweet from the tomato, so it really teases your palate. The only thing I wish was slightly better was that the egg was served runny, just how I like it, but it was also cold. If it was a warm egg it would have made it that much better. The shrimp tacos were also fantastic and contained the perfect mix of shrimp chunks and vegetables, and I love how they used corn tortillas instead of flour ones. The pulled pork buns were meaty and slightly sweet, but they weren't overbearingly fatty and they were served with much less guilt than normal pork buns.

Honestly, if it's your first time here, I feel like you could order anything on the menu and it would be a winner. I've also had the mac and cheese and pulled pork tacos before, and they're nothing short of divine. I can't wait to go back and try more things someday.",2016-12-03 16:13:45

However, spotty service while dining in is nothing compared to the chaos of trying to order take-out or (even worse) delivery. The last delivery order I put in for myself and co-workers wasn't delivered for nearly two hours... when I called to follow up, the restaurant told me that they had our order ready for over an hour, but their courier service was running late... the problem with that is that hot food and FROZEN drinks were put in bags next to each other, so you can figure the rest out... When the courier dropped it off at the office, he said: ""the restaurant said to tell you it isn't their fault, whatever that means, but I'm just the messenger, so it's not my fault either."" It was pretty unprofessional behavior from both TFIC and the delivery service, but ultimately, it was a big FAIL on the restaurant's part.

I didn't take a photo but I should have because the presentation was very appealing, and they tasted even better. 

The dumplings were a small pond of a tomato ginger broth which had the perfect amount of spice. The kung pao chicken was the same idea as you'd find in an American Chinese restaurant except everything was fresh and cooked perfectly, not greasy at all. My wife had the caesar salad and mongolian beef. The salad was a fairly typical caesar but with szechuan croutons and a poached egg on top. The mongolian beef was, like the chicken, the same idea as  what is offered at American Chinese restaurants but more sophisticated and executed to perfection (the roasted cashews were a nice touch). 

And then they went ahead and nailed dessert. The fritters were fried and they were delicious. And the tea-a-misiu was a great tiramisu but with a hint of tea, I think I liked it even better than regular tiramisu.

They but alot of heart into their delicious food. Also the tools... Chesse, onions, mushrooms, pepper, zucchini, eggplant, sauce , just OMG so many and all do good.

It's behind the Neon Sign Museum and next to the Natural History Museum.  All this time, and not any significant peep of its existence.

It's a small stadium, they don't have individual seats like in a major league stadium, but it's still very nice.  They thing most prevalent in Vegas is the ""it's the thought that counts"" mentality the locals get when it comes to non-Strip entertainment.  Either it's half-ass and kind of meager, but you can at least say we have whatever locale, or they really make the most with what they have.  This is a latter situation.

I found the stadium to be clean, in a good location (next to museum row), the food service was good, people were friendly.

Of course, it doesn't hurt that the 51's won on their June 3rd outing, but they really put some heart into the field with all the hokey music, the between innings games, and their mascot.  I can't really fault anything.  Of course, $1 beer night doesn't hurt matters, either.

Seriously, Vegas needs to get its priorities straight.  I've visited Vegas for 8 years, and lived here 2 1/2 years, and I never knew this place existed.  That's not to say that I'm the defining measurement of all things that happen in Vegas, but you'd think I would have heard of something by this point in time.  I'm sure tourists wouldn't mind knowing what's up either.

The black velvet, as others have said, is bold and equally as rich. There is a strong taste of cinnamon which next time I was ask for it to be a bit milder.

I was pretty excited for the tasting menu and we both opted for the 7 courses at $85 (the 5 course is $65). 

We arrived at 6 PM and don't think left until around 9 PM, the meal took a while, with each dish taking a bit of time before arriving to us. This was fine as it gave us time to savour the dishes and we were in no rush anyways. 

The food was quite good, the dishes were as follow as best of my memory:
1. Nova Scotia ahi tuna
2. Poached lobster with tomatoes and peppers
3. Scallops and leeks in a tasty broth
4. Spanish mackerel in some divine sauce -- this was my dad's favourite
5. Halibut cheeks and Spanish saucy rice
6. Rabbit two ways, porchetta and pressed 
7. Strawberry and chamomile ice cream - seriously amazing
7.5 Baba o rhum cake 

Starting off with the fish dishes they were very light and tasty. I really enjoyed the poached lobster, the sauce was very good. The Spanish mackerel was incredibly good in this fantastic creamy, but light, sauce. I had never eaten rabbit before so I was a little apprehensive, but it was quite tender and juicy, tasted a lot like pork. 

The dessert was also very good, the strawberry ice cream was fantastic. The baba o rhum is a sponge cake that they generously pour rum over and serve with chantilly cream on the side. When I say generous, I mean super generous, the cake was completely saturated with rum! It was good, but a little strong. 

You can also opt for a cheese course before the dessert. We tried 3 cheeses: 1 from Ontario, 1 from Spain, and 1 from France. I liked the cheese, I love cheese. 

It was a pretty good place, I wasn't wowed, but it was very good. The service was also good.

And a very, very extensive beer menu.

When you walk up the stairs to this mid-level dining room, you'll immediately notice the high-quality, dense wood assembled bench/pic nic seating and tables. It's like a mess hall but much nicer and with way better quality food. There is a wide variety of different sausages of course (you may have guessed from the name :D). This is not your frozen meat section at Safeway, this isn't even the counter st your favorite butcher shop, this is made-in-house homemade not from a supplier legit you won't find it anywhere else sausages, and the quality is very freakin' good! They let you choose everything from how its dressed, to the bun to sides and how it's cooked, and then you choose the drink to go along with it. For those who need to drive afterwards, there's a good supply of Italian soda and flavored waters and juices on hand, and for those who's palate is in need of some fresh suds, the aforementioned beer list is there for your continued enjoyment. There's not much to complain about in regards to the beer, the only thing I would warn newcomers of is that scattered throughout the list are some rare and imported selections which can go as high as $40-80, if memory serves correctly. Should you not be careful, you may order one by accident and be very surprised when the bill arrives (although I am fairly certain the staff would advise you of such a thing happening should you do so accidentally).

Food is served pretty quickly, staff is friendly. The clientele ranges from Queen West hipsters, to 20 something aspiring models and Bay Street types. This tells you something: No matter who you are, they all flock here for the food!

The food was awesome. I had the roasted red pepper & tomato soup and it hit the spot. I also tried the wood oven roasted beets from my mom. The presentation of them was beautiful and they were quite delicious. As for the other appetizer, I would not get the veggie chop salad.. it wasn't even sad, it was closer to pathetic. We noticed there were different sized portions for restaurant week and normal menu customers, so maybe the salad was a victim of that size downgrade. 

For the entree I had the pork osso buco confit and I was in heaven. It was perfectly tender and was falling off the bone! Perfect. The spaetzle it came with was pretty good too. It was supposed to come with some spinach in it, but mine didn't. I wasn't feeling jerky enough to complain about it though. I also tried some of the seared Scottish salmon my mom got. It was crispy on the outside and perfectly medium? cook on the inside. I don't order salmon at restaurants much, but it was way better than I've ever made it (not that I'm a pro or anything). 

Desserts were awesome as well. The vanilla bean crème brulee was a perfect dessert for me. My sister had the chocolate flourless cake. It was another victim of the size downgrade.

That said, it gets the good rep it has for a number of clear reasons. First, the food is fresh, cooked and plated perfectly and always tastes like they intended to make something special happen.  The menu is actually quite focused. It is not so spartan that it is obnoxious, it is just pared back enough to highlight their main and plain. And what is their ""main and plain"". Simple- great burgers.

The beef is perfect, cooked and served hot, and always tastes fresh. I have been to both the Scottsdale and Gilbert locations and they both stay on point with the results put out by the kitchen.  I've said it once, and I'll say it a million more times- the key to great restaurants begins with serving the food HOT. It is a simple credo, but so many places don't stay on top of that. Zinburger is the exception in that regard. I've never had a meal where the burger and amazing fries weren't piping hot. Even if everything else was just on par, this makes all the difference in the world.

That said, their custom truffle fries are something worth spending calories for. Olive oil sizzled with a touch of cheese garnish on the fries is about as wonderful as you can get for french fries.

The staff is always great, and sets and serves you efficiently. I feel like they care about each patron and treat folks well.  Occasionally, I notice servers tend to pay a little less attention to us if our table is not drinking alcohol. This doesn't happen the majority of the time, but since we normally don't drink alcohol, I do notice how restaurants treat those that do/don't differently.  It isn't something I would complain about since it is only occasional.  I just think it is probably a subconscious thing with wait staff (having family members who work as waiters, I understand)-- they work harder when the bill is bigger and it gets bigger fast with alcohol flowing.

Overall, Zinburger is the best burger place you can go to, if you want an upgrade in ambience and even a date location for you and that someone special. The food is great, staff is wonderful, ambience is hip and the prices are reasonable. I will continue to return to this excellent upscale burger joint.",2018-08-18 01:04:25

The food.. kinda ok. we started with the Tempura Chicken (Skip it. not great) then I had Caesar Salad (ok, little peppery) and friend had the Crab Cakes ( Loved them)

The suite had a nicely stocked mini kitchen with a small refrigerator under the mini stocked bar. Should you prefer to make meals in your room, you have all the necessary tools, including a two burner stovetop. The king bed was comfortable, and both the sitting area and the bedroom area each had its own flat screen.

The bathroom was spacious and the shower had a rain shower head in addition to the handheld spout. A large jetted tub, plenty large enough for two was located inside the shower.

The modern décor extends to the hallway, including the walls and carpeting. I also want to comment on the soundproofing of the rooms. One of my biggest pet peeves when traveling is paper thin walls. That wasn't the case here. I called my friends who were staying in the room next door, and I didn't even hear the phone ringing. Pretty impressive!  

The only negative was the distance from the Palms. It was cool when we were going to Simon for dinner, but was a pain in the ass when we left to go to the Playboy Club - and it's a looooong stumble back at 3 a.m.

This restaurant is situated on a real farm.  Well it used to be a lot bigger. There are fields and gardens in the back.  There's a huge grassy area with lots of trees, benches and shady spots so families can bring their kids and let them run and play while they eat.   Families with young kids seem to enjoy it here.

I ordered the Fontina Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.  Note the burger runs about $7.99 and includes fries.  To get Sweet potato, you need to pay a $2.00 upgrade fee.

The burger was huge- 1/3 pound!  It was not a shriveled, dry, meat patty that you would find somewhere else. Definitely low fat content, moist and flavorful.  I loved the veggies on top, grilled mushrooms, roasted red peppers, homemade pesto, and fresh greens.  And the cheese was just the right flavor for the veggies.  I also added a multi grain bun which was just right.

Of course the sweet potato fries were awesome.  They came with a pineapple-serrano dipping sauce which was not needed.  These fries have enough flavor on their own.

Hints: 
*come frequently and browse because inventory is revolving 
*browse every aisle. the deals are sometimes hiding :) 
*look out for prices in comparison to competitors and keep in mind how MUCH you are are getting for the price (ounces, qty, etc) sometimes it might seem like a good deal but you might be able to get bigger box/more somewhere for less",2010-11-02 00:26:24

mGx3qPe3C51-hWu_zp60Ow,BlSbxxb1vyfFoLGjfHh5dg,ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ,2,1,1,0,"I will start by saying I could see coming back here in the future.

In for $2 taco Tuesday. 6:30 and the dining room was pretty empty. The bar was where the action was.

The place is clean. Including the restroom! But, the menus were super sticky. The chairs are many years past their prime. Clean, yes. But, all of them were very scuffed up and the frames on our chairs - and some we could observe with other diners seated - were loose.

I'm pretty sure it was the owner who was running around. He was doing it all. Busing tables, chatting it up with some of the customers. And, running orders. I believe at least some of his staff have figured this out so they aren't putting in as much elbow grease as, maybe, they should be. They know he's picking up all the slack.

The tacos were a good size. The proteins (chicken, tilapia, pork and steak) were cooked properly. The seasoning was a bit lacking. The tortillas were nothing special. For $2 I'm good. For menu price, not so much. The empanada for dessert was very tasty and came with house made whipped cream.

The service was so-so. I think the one waitress may have had to cover the dining room on her own. Not too many tables, yet enough to keep her unable to really be attentive. She was pleasant and certainly knew the menu. 

No chips or salsa served. None offered. Turns out they can be had. For a fee. $1.75. Aw, come on. Just add 25 or 50 cents to some of your menu items and relax about the chips and salsa.

Here's what kept me from going to 3 stars: it's in the details. So, the dishware was clean. But, it was really aged and over-used. The glassware didn't sparkle - maybe it's the soap. Maybe it's because the glassware is old. The flatware was also showing wear. And, again, maybe it's the dishwasher. Or, maybe the water temp is off. While the dining room decor was just fine, these little details - and the chairs near falling apart - really add up. For menu prices approaching $18 for some entrees, I think these details really matter. 

$2 tacos can do a couple things for a place: 1) it can attract a good bar crowd that will munch a lot of them and drink a goodly amount of booze; and, 2) it can attract first-time customers who want an inexpensive chance to check a place out. It's the latter that really matters because this is future business, or not. The former are most interested in the booze and so-so food is just fine because it is so inexpensive.The experience needs to be good enough to inspire a second visit - maybe for the more costly regular menu items. So-so food, and a so-so environment isn't going to pull people in to spend $16-$18 per entree.

If I come back, it won't be for taco Tuesday. It'll be to try some of the entrees that do look pretty interesting. And, again, the kitchen did a good enough job (spice levels are, I imagine, near impossible to get right for a wide range of people).",2016-06-22 03:44:26

Yes, I've always enjoyed the flavors and spices of Indian food, but I didn't truly fall in love with it until I dined at Copper.  

Copper is an upscale, gourmet Indian restaurant.  It takes the flavors of India and enhances them into delicious, beautifully presented dishes.  A friend of mine and I both had never been but wanted to try Copper.  We decided to treat ourselves to a night out.  And what a treat it was.  From the breads to the appetizer to the wine to the entrees, we had an extremely palatable experience.  

The decor and atmosphere in Copper is wonderful.  The lighting is subdued and could be considered romantic (if you were with your partner; unfortunately, I wasn't!).  Nonetheless, the soft music and low-lighting left for a great conversational atmosphere in a relaxed setting.  

The restaurant is fairly easy to find.  It's situated in an old house in Historic Dilworth on East Blvd near the intersection of South Blvd, diagonally across the street (""kitty corner,"" as my mom would say) from Paper Skyscraper.

But it was more than just the convenience of  proximity that sold us on it. It was the bartender at the sports book bar, Tyler, who kept us coming back. He is such an incredibly nice person. Yes he is warm and welcoming, but it is more than that. You can tell he is genuinely kind and caring and he is always so helpful and remembers us every time we come in. He talks sports with us, got us turned on to the Round Robin, and makes my Bloody Mary perfectly every time (he understands what ""extra spicy"" means and doesn't underestimate my ability to handle spice just because I am a white girl lol). Point is, casino management, if you do an employee of the month (or an employee of the year) program, this guy deserves it.

Such a bummer when I can only get meatloaf one night a week (other items are once a week as well but the meatloaf is my particular poison).

The servers do their job and while I've never had a negative service experience here, it's never been above and beyond stellar. 

I will say that the first time we came it was for a birthday celebration and the manager was kind enough to offer us a free dessert after we waited almost a half hour for the one we had originally ordered. In their defense, it was very shortly after they opened and of course kinks were still being worked out. Ain't gonna complain about 2 desserts, one of them being free!

As in ridiculously gargantuan. Be prepared for leftovers for days or an extra plate charge if you want to be sensible and share an entree. 

Only complaint is the menu. Too few options. Bring back the FULL MENU!!!",2015-10-02 20:50:14

First off, The 9 is one fancy place so I knew Adega would be fancy.  Felt kind of weird going in there with my Indians gear on.... OH well, a girl has to brunch right?!

The manager/host was extremely friendly and very good looking.  Our waiter made sure all of our questions were answered and gave us a brief history on why the fire alarm goes off at random times.

For brunch I had the Jumbo Lump Crab!!!!!  Oh my goodness!  It was so delicious.  I still day dream about it to this day.  

If you are looking for a delish brunch spot or just a cool place to go to- I highly suggest Adega.  Just sitting in the restaurant made me feel as though I was fancy!",2018-07-24 20:03:52

Our service was not stellar....our server was over quickly enough but the wait time it took to order our food was abnormally long. We waited and waited while our server spent her time telling another employee how she spent the previous evening. 
Once our food came out...we never saw our server again and had to chase them down to get our bill. No offer for a coffee refill....no refill on tea.....nada.

Reservations are a good idea, but half the time they screw it up. So make sure you get the name of the person you are speaking to. That saved my bacon once when they couldn't find my name. (they wrote it down as Jim, not Tim, ughhhhh)

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. They said the wait would possibly be 45 minutes but to keep checking back. We checked back by 10 minutes and they were already ready to seat us, that's quick! 

The menu wasn't expansive. Seems like a few items but done well and at a high price point - this place isn't cheap. 

Let's talk about what we ordered:

Croque Madame - the brioche bread was so dry and almost burnt, the egg was over cooked - or too small, either way there wasn't a good amount of yolk. The béchamel was bland and lifeless also they didn't give enough to offset the dry bread. I was having a hard time cutting it and swallowing. It's unfortunate that I've had better. 1/5

Plate of bacon - there were probably 8 slices of bacon. Of the 8, only 2 were crispy - The rest were soggy. We didn't even finish them. 1/5

Side of Brioche - the brioche was definitely burnt. I wanted to send them back, but decided not to because I was too lazy. 1/5

The complimentary fresh baked baguette was good and tasted great with blackberry jam and butter. The homemade blackberry jam was wonderful. Not too sweet and had a great blackberry flavor. 5/5

Orange juice - it wasn't fresh. Bottled OJ at a price that they charged is so wrong. 1/5

I am still pretty shocked that I was expecting a better meal but I ended up with a bland and dry one. I am hoping the next time I shell out that much cash, I will speak up and get something else that I may be able to appreciate.",2014-04-30 22:05:43

The waitress we had was nice and attentive, and the meat carvers were friendly and all-smiles. (The carvers were actually Brazilian too, how authentic!) The buffet of other food was fine. Some of the salads were too sweet/overwhelmingly citrus for my taste, but the cooked broccoli and the beans and rice were tasty. Also, make sure you ask the waiter/waitress for cheese bread and corn bread. It doesn't sit at the buffet, they bring it to you fresh and warm, but it's included in the price and is so much tastier than the bread sitting at the buffet. 
Also, GRILLED PINEAPPLE. Save room. 

The less than good: For some reason, all of the meat was served rare (medium-rare at best...but even that's a bit of a stretch. There was lots of blood on my plate). I told our carver that I like my meat a bit more well done (which I realize now were a poor choice of words... I should have said ""cooked a bit longer"", as I don't need my meat to be well done, just closer to medium than what was presented). He was very nice about it and said he would bring me some more well-done meat. Well, as expected, he literately brought me well-done meat (again, my fault for my poor choice of words). But I didn't mind, it was actually quite tasty and juicy. Unfortunately, the non-rare meat came around about 3 times and that was it. I should have stocked up and taken a ton of meat the first time it came around. Ended up eating a ton of delicious pineapple to make up for it. 

Now that I have learned more about this place, I would probably have a better experience next time... ask for medium and stock up the first time they come around, rather than waiting to have a bit of everything.... but hey, if you like rare meat (as my boyfriend did), you will probably love it.",2017-07-25 17:10:29

What a good buy for $5, will be ordering this when I come back. They could have had a better table arrangement to fit more tables and chairs for the growing crowd, but we managed to score a small table after no more than 10 minutes of waiting. The table still had the last person's trash and check which we thought ok, no problem, the server will pick it up. But, we didn't get acknowledged for 15 minutes, not even a look or glance. The trash just sat there, till we actively flagged someone down. And even then, she clearly did not want to be there/talk to us. Our server was nice but, not very attentive. Understandable given the amount of people opting for table service on the patio. Step up the service, I get its packed but if you are going to offer table service, then do it properly, without making the customers feel like a chore. We ordered the pretzel with jalapeño beer cheese and tatchos to share, both were yummy and fairly big. Good bar food.

I went with a group and so had tried pancakes, omelette, potatoes and toast. Pair that with a milkshake, if it's not too early for one. You can split the milkshake with a friend (although they might charge extra for that, I don't remember).

They get pretty busy during the weekends. Definitely go early if you want to avoid the crowds. Their system took a little getting used to for me, you just walk in and take a seat wherever available. For that reason, you will usually find yourself sharing a table with people you don't know, unless you are lucky enough to get one of the few booths. 

For me personally I don't think the wait is worth it. Their menu items do not wow me enough, in the sense that these are just classic breakfast items. Nothing that can't be easily gotten elsewhere where you don't have to wait for a table. So I will stop by if I wake up early enough (usually never on weekends), and if I happen to be in the area.

The pork bites came out first and were just ridiculously delish... little pieces of pork belly with a bit of a tang and a hint of spiciness... the portion was small, but the flavor was huge. The huge pile of wings were also wonderful.... they are smoked, which was a bit weird at first, but as we ate them we liked them more and more. The wings came with a 'white' bbq sauce....

In fact, the white sauce and the hot sauce on the table really saved the focaccia, which was nothing special ( but tasted good when you added the sauces).

This summer, we saw Alice Cooper/Motley Crue and Kiss/Def Leppard this summer at Ak Chin. Frankly, it's not my favorite place to see a show but it has it's old school charm.  

First, it's an outdoor amphitheater,which is fine, but because it's outdoors that apparently means open season for smokers and their various items of choice. We stood next to a group that chain smoked through Kiss like it was the last cigarettes they would ever smoke. The contact high I got during Motley Crue nearly rendered me unable to drive. That said--the people watching is second to none. You will not be disappointed at the various characters who 

Now because this is an older facility, the sound  and production can be hit or miss. The sound during Alice Cooper was horrible. It was hard to hear, the sound cut out a few times, and the lighting looked bad. That said, the sound and production during Motley Crue was excellent--and you could tell that being backed by Dodge for their corporate sponsorship means they had some super high tech professional peeps on the tour with them. The difference was quite noticeable.

The prices for drinks and noshes were a bit on the high side but I've seen worse. I think gouging people for bottled water in the middle of summer is a bit sac-religious, but that's just me. They generally don't allow cameras but check first because the website says they allow cameras without the professional lenses but I have seen them turn people away at the door with the 'approved' cameras. I think it depends on the act versus what the venue's rules might be--so again, check first. 

Parking is free which is nice but the traffic can be a killer. I highly recommend taking surface streets and coming from the north to the south rather than coming from the freeway. It can be a real bummer otherwise as you can and likely will miss the opening act and part of the headliner if you don't time it properly.  Leaving the venue is, again, a nightmare, so I suggest taking surface streets and stay away from the freeway for a few miles.  Google map it to get an idea of what streets to utilize and please--Take my advice--surface streets are the better bet.",2014-11-09 21:19:44

Our waitress took forever to get to us.  When she showed up, she told us she would bring us water which took 5 minutes.  She brought the water and took our drink orders.  Of course the drink I wanted, which was on the menu, was no longer carried to I had to settle for a Guinness in a CAN (ugh).  The waitress disappeared for a while and the manager walked by and asked how we were doing and I reminded him to get our drinks.  We finally got those and then our waitress came back to take our food order.  Of course, since she was wearing half a dress, she had no pockets for paper or a pen so she had to go find one.  She came back took our order and disappeared again.

Then it got really bad.

The next time we see our waitress, she is busing a table next to us and, as she goes to reach for the door, she spills the catchup ramekin onto the floor, splattering catchup all over my friend's white shirt (I dodged the catchup like Neo dodges bullets).  

So apologies were made, the manager brought out soda water to help clean up, and paid for our drinks...things were made better.  

Eventually the food came out.  I can only speak for myself but I wasn't as enthused about my Grilled Cheese Club as I was when I read it on the menu.  For one, the ""club"" part doesn't really work.  The bread overwhelms the cheese.  For two, they swapped out Gouda with Swiss.  For three, the bacon was more like bacon bits instead of ""thick sliced bacon"".  It didn't taste bad...it was just not as good as it could have been.  The fries were pretty good though.

At the end of the meal, the three of us were only charged $16 for three drinks and three meals.  I guess that is a positive.  Really, the waitress was what made the experience so bad.  It's not really fair to blame the whole place for the mistakes of one...but they hired her.  In any event, she probably ruined the place for us and that's too bad.

We tried a few of their 'tapas':
-The braised short ribs: good flavor, tender. 
-The shrimp tempura was ok, just 3 shrimp and mostly veggies, for the price though it's decent. Could've been a little crispier.
-Chicken sticks - grilled skewered chicken breast, a little dry and overly salty for my tastes.

I had the Zia Rita pizza which seems like a very popular option. It comes with ""nduja sausage"", fire roasted onion, and rapini. I have recently discovered that I really love rapini. Especially on pizzas and in Italian sandwiches. It adds such a delicious bitter green note and it remains firm unlike a standard lettuce green. 

The crust was perfect Neopolitan style, chewy and thin. The sausage was very tasty, I love when sausage on a pizza is not sliced from a casing but rather freely presented around the za.

I'd put this pizza up against a Terroni, Libretto, or Piola pizza any day. Service left a little to be desired, it wasn't busy at all that day and yet it took awhile to be seated, order, receive drinks, and receive our food. Almost as though because it wasn't busy the servers were in no rush at all.

When we left there were a few groups waiting. Our server was great, the breadsticks and salad arrived quickly after our iced teas. When that was done the three dishes we'd ordered arrived.

I usually like the vegetarian options that restaurants offer, but the eggplant was a tasteless paste battered and fried and covered in cheese. Which my kid enjoyed, of course, because it no longer resembled eggplant. 
Another bonus was when we sat down our server offered us a complimentary sample of wine, which we declined, but it seemed like a nice touch. On the down side, the side of spaghetti that came with the eggplant had the most boring marinara sauce ever. But I never order spaghetti.

I was immediately blown away by the attention to detail put into the decorations inside the restaurant! I was able to get a spot in the high ceiling section, which offered lots of natural light. There are swings in the back which you can relax in, and lots of tables. 

I tried: 

- The waffle: this was made with a vegan yogurt sauce, with chia gel and fresh fruits! It was quite a good portion size, and came with sufficient yogurt sauce (that was minimally sweet, but rather tart), and lots of fresh fruits. The chia gel definitely helped to fill me up! This wasn't too sweet overall, and felt very healthy. 

- The lumberjack: made with breakfast potatoes, lentils, fennel, dill, vegan smoked onion sausage, and caper aioli - this was a really good choice for a savoury dish; I was pleasantly surprised at how real the texture of the sausage was (given that I'm not a vegetarian), and it had a good smoky flavour. What really made this dish stand out was the copious amounts of savory sauce that had caper aioli; I kept wanting to dunk the potatoes into it! I even ended up dunking some of the waffle pieces into the sauce. Really satisfying!

- Coffee - cappuccino:  this came quickly and was strong. Perfect way to give a burst of energy for the afternoon! 

Service was attentive but maybe a bit slow at the end. I relaxed by hanging out in the hanging chairs at the back of the store before heading out for more shopping!

I must say that I was very impressed with the selection of beers on tap. It's a rarity for me to find a bar that has quality craft beers on tap that I have not yet tried or haven't had in a long time. Caliente's sure did deliver in that respect. 

I started out having a long time favorite of mine, Bell's Third Coast Old Ale. It was correctly served in sniffer glass and it went down just right. I followed it up with the Brew Gentleman's Mammoth, then a Bullfrog Blackberry JuJu, a Draai Laag Yodeler, Lost Abbey Lost and Found, a Free Will Barbera Grape and finished the evening off with a Dogfish Head Raison D Extra. Nice selection of beers eh? I think so. And the best part about it was that most of the brews were consumed during happy hour meaning that they only cost me $3.50 each!

We started our ""drinking practice"" on the first floor of Caliente's then as our group grew to double digits we took it down stairs. Both locations were comfortable and accommodating yet distinctly different from one another. The first floor had a more ""old skool"", traditional Pittsburgh pub feel to it contrasting with the metro kind of lounge atmosphere of the basement. It was like bar hopping without the benefit of enjoying every one of those February 8 degrees that we were blessed with outside yesterday evening

I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the pizza at Caliente's. The group I was with ordered a number of pizzas and I had the opportunity to enjoy a few slices of the Meat Lover's pizza and a few slices of a BBQ Chicken with Pineapple pizza. They were both delicious and could stand toe to toe with just about any Italian pie in the Burgh.

The beau and I were browsing around Crocker Park for a birthday gift this particular Saturday afternoon, and we were fending off our hearty desires to grab a delicious burger from the newly opened B Spot. See, we're *attempting* to eat healthy and didn't want to put ourselves in a calorie-rific situation of utter defeat.

And let's just be real here--we were looking for a little afternoon cocktail. 

So, quite defeated, we walked right past B Spot (wah!) and gave Champps a shot, hoping for some healthy options. The service was fine enough. Super nice waitresses and staff, you know, pretty standard for chains. We both ordered tuna sandwiches with side salads instead of fries, hoping for the best. What came out was what I believe is known as a level-10 fail. 

Holy effing mayonnaise. We're talking a 60/40 mayo to tuna ratio... gag me. It's not that it tasted horrible, but the look and consistency of this ""tuna salad"" was beyond nasty. It came out on four, open-faced-style triangles of whole wheat that were soggy with the wet, mayo/tuna mixture. To make matters worse, there were half melted pieces of swiss cheese on top of each. I ended up peeling off the cheese to cut the fat-grams, but I doubt it helped. The little salad had the signature ""I came from a big bag"" carrot and purple cabbage slivers. 

The drinks we ordered were super sweet and tasted little of liquor. I'm not one to bitch about cocktails not being strong enough, but this was borderline hilarious. And at about $10 a pop, you'd think it would have a little more booze.

To top it off, his kitchen masterfully executes the cooking to bring out the best in each ingredient.  Even something as simple as french fries was super addictive with the creative use of Indian spices, delicious aioli and most important of all not-your-average potatoes that tasted extra potatoey. 

Happy hour is served everyday 5pm-7pm and even though the price of everything else has gone up (as a small food biz owner I know all too well), small plates and wines are still only $5.  I have no idea how he makes any money at these prices.   The portions were perfect for the two of us and we order 4 plates (corndog, carpaccio, duck confit tacos and clams) plus the fries.

Outdoor seating is beautiful and relaxing.  Service was friendly and professional.  I've already planned my next meal here - the white truffle dinner on Nov 12th which is only $125 for five courses with wines paired.  There's no way you can get that low a price for that kind of a menu in LA, SF or NY.  We're talking lobster pot pie, pork belly sous vide, veal and even truffle in the dessert.   Boy do I love living in this city when we have restaurants like Tapino.  By supporting restaurants like this, we are also supporting local producers which keeps much needed dollars in this state.  Forgive me if I sound like a politician - must be all the debates...",2008-10-03 03:07:16

Back then, it was, ""I feel like Ethiopian food."" 

Friend: ""Or do you want Eritrean food?""

Me: ""Same thing.""

Friend: ""Say that to an Ethiopian or an Eritrean and they'll smack you upside the head.""

Me: ""Ok, I feel like Ethiopian AND/OR Eritrean food.""

Friend: ""Ok, there's like 20 places to go to, so let's narrow it down , shall we?""

Fast forward to me being in Phoenix.

Friend: ""Hey! Let's have Ethiopian food!""

Me: ""Kickass! What's around here?""

Friend: ""Well, there's Cafe Lalibela. And that's, uh, it.""

Me: ""Errrr....""

So we headed to Tempe, braving rush hour traffic, and found Lalibela pretty easily. Inside you've got the cute Ethiopian girls with big incredible eyes waiting at your tables. No harm there. 

The menu: Not as many dishes as I've seen at Ethiopian places back home, but they have all the classics. We ordered the kye sega wat (cubed beef simmered in spices), misir wat (red split lentils), and the tikil gomen (spiced carrots, cabbage, and potatoes). And of course, you gotta have the honey wine to wash it down with. 

Around 10 minutes later our platter came before us - all three dishes piled on top of a flat sheet of spongy injera bread. Just the aroma wafting into your nose is enough. Take a deep breath. Mmmm....

And verdict? All the dishes were really good - the beef being most excellent. We took our time, and got extra injera, sopping up whatever was on the plate. 

A great meal had, I'd say Lalibela is mellow and unassuming, but being so small I can see it could get pretty busy on weekend nights. It's got plenty of tasty vegetarian dishes so those of you who don't do the animal won't be all depressed like you would walking into a Black Angus.  Dishes range from very mild to dishes with a little kick, but I grew up eating raw green chilis, so maybe I'm not the best judge here.  

All in all, this place is a definite plus for east African food here in the Valley of the Sun.

WORD TO THE WISE: Ethiopian/Eritrean food is NOT lactose intolerant-friendly. You won't know it when you eat it., because you're too busy stuffing your face because it's so damn good and plentiful and there's the wine and the cute waitress and.... 

But everything's cooked in butter. A LOT of butter. So much so that two Lactaid pills offer little resistance. So pick a night you're feeling somewhat masochistic and go. Enjoy yourself. Eat boutiful amounts of dishes ending in ""wat."" And then tell all your friends you'll meet them at the bars later, after you make a quick ""detour"" home.",2007-01-09 06:15:18

Lovely decor, clean restrooms and they give you gloves to use to peel your shrimp and crawfish. I wasn't a fan of the gloves though because I felt they got in my way. It would be nice if they gave out more than one small ketchup container per 3 people so we wouldn't have to flag them down for more. 

I went with two other friends and everyone ordered a Lb of shrimp mild with all the sauces combined (forgot the name). Mild has a nice kick to it. One friend ordered the medium spicy and regretted it halfway through saying that he couldn't feel his mouth. The sauce here is watery, it doesn't have a thick consistency like other places I've been to and after a while it does get a bit salty (imo). The salt& pepper with like juice mixture helps with that. The shrimp seemed fresh enough, tons of garlic in the sauce but yet it was missing something... I can't quite put my finger on it. 

We also got Cajun fries and they were the fatter ones, sort of like steak fries and we're still super hot after sitting out for a while! You could definitely tell that they were freshly made. 

Overall, I left feeling so so since the sauce was decent and I like my fries on the skinnier/crispier side. Not sure what boiling crab prices for shrimp is, in CA I think it's $10.99,  here it's $11.99 which isn't too bad of a price difference.",2015-11-30 09:26:59

That isn't surprising, really, considering the massive python of a snaking line up they'd be touting at each and every event they would participate in. I myself always knew it was well worth getting in that line, and I knew it would likewise be worth a line up here. Yep, like so many hot spots in the city with limited seating (72 in total) and relatively quick turn around, RLC doesn't take reservations. Thankfully for us, we just slipped in under the radar (at the early hour of 7:30) and landed a deuce right away and by 9 PM on a chilly Saturday night, the place was completely packed. In such small quarters, that not surprisingly translates itself to me speaking at a higher than normal decibel and then paying for it when I wake up sounding a little like a slightly more classy version of a blue-haired cartoon character whose name rhymes with Narge. Yeah, it's loud in there, but honestly no more so than every other restaurant I've visited of late, and I'll always choose hearing music and chatter over the abrasive sound of cutlery in a hauntingly quiet space. Especially if said chatter is coming from a table of eight (yes eight!) good looking men to my left. Single (or not so single) ladies, take note. Lobster is inherently hot.

Service at RLC was friendly and efficient. Cocktails were delivered almost immediately, water glasses were refilled, and the food began emerging surprisingly quick. Only 40 minutes in, and we were ready for dessert, and yet, I thankfully was never made to feel the push to gobble up and leave. When all was said and done, we were in and out in about 1 1/2 hours, which is my preferred casual dining time.
The cocktail menu, created by Josh Lindley (of Campagnolo and GwaiLo), is incredibly enticing and exciting, offering a wide range of some of my favourite seasonal flavour profiles. In addition to the 7 cocktails and the 4 draught beers, Lindley also features 3 wines on tap, a unique bar feature that's a steal at only $1 per oz (for Ontario). But it wasn't until after the fact that I even cared to look at the drink menu, because I had my heart on one thing and one thing only- their signature Rock Lobster Caesar ($12). A Caesar girl as it is, I just had to look around the room at all of the lobster tail adorned cocktails to know what I'd be drinking that night. And this Caesar is a fiery version, for sure, with an extra kick from the pepper-heavy, satisfyingly salty steak seasonings along the rim. While I probably would have preferred a touch more Clamato to balance out all the heat, I was really impressed by the generous lobster tail peeking out of the top of my glass. An appropriate warm up to our imminent lobster marathon.

And speaking of said marathon, this is what we had:

Lobster Poutine: Yukon Gold Hand-cut Fries, Lobster Bisque Gravy, Quebec Curds, Fresh Lobster and Chives ($13)
Off to a decadent start. Hidden beneath a much-appreciated Mount Everest of sumptuous lobster bits laid a bed of seemingly sturdy fries. Despite the generous portion of protein, and the even cover of gravy, the fries remained crispy and light for our (albeit short) eating episode. And while the lobster was fresh and tender, and the curds let out a gentle squeak, it was the gravy that sent me into a mild state of anxiety as the portion started to shrink. With characteristics of any good bisque, it was creamy without a burdensome weight, and salty but with a hint of natural sweetness to balance. It was the kind of gravy I could happily drown my low- fat Special K with and feel simultaneously both virtuous and indulgent.

Lobster Mac and Cheese: Fresh Lobster, Aged Canadian Cheddar and Panko Crust ($13)

Classic and comforting, with no need for contrasting colours, shapes, unique plating or garnishes, and yet, it truly looked like a blue ribbon dish. Appearance aside, this preparation is my preferred ""style"" of a mac n' cheese- adequate sauce coverage, lots of cheesy pull, and a crispy golden crust on top.  It definitely wasn't as lobster-laden as the poutine, but the bits were chopped more coarsely, so that some bites were practically just shellfish with a little cheese. When you hit that gold, it's not something to complain about, really. With regards to the MnC itself, I found the flavour to be a little more subdued than I would normally want, however, in retrospect, I wonder if a more pungent cheese may have completely dominated the delicate shellfish.  Regardless, a tasty, decadent dish in a generous portion for sharing.

Surf and Turf Steak Tartare: Steak Tartare and Vanilla Butter Poached Lobster, Yukon Chips and Sea Salt ($12)

From the menu description, we were both expecting a portion of steak tartare AND some part of the poached lobster separately....",2013-05-20 17:23:04

I really love Mexican food.  Seriously.  My dream is to find a little Mexican girl with long jet black hair from the old country and all she does every night for me is cook Mexican food.  This is how much I love Mexican food.

So when I got here I decided to start with two tacos, pork and beef and I got myself some horchata.  Love me some horchata!  Took a little while, I was surprised as there was only one other couple in the place talking Spanish with the guy behind the counter.  When my tacos came, they're open-faced, a good sign towards authenticity.  Taste?  Not bad.  Not great, but not bad, about a 3.  In fact, I was a little surprised as ratings in this place seem to indicate the food is really outstanding here.  I check my Yelp app again to make sure I didn't order the wrong thing.  I read lots of people love the guacamole.

So after finishing my tacos, I decide to get the big nacho plate and make sure to ask for guacamole.  I notice the Spanish speaking couple ask for a free refill of horchata which I notice isn't indicated anywhere on the menu.  FREE refills?  Hmm, maybe they're not free but because the guy just gave a free refill to the other couple he's got no choice now.  I couldn't be sure to be honest but I asked for a free refill anyways and he was pretty accommodating.  

So my nacho plate comes out and?  It's terrible.  I mean really, really terrible.  Like a 1.  Why?  Because the chips are completely marketplace bought.  And they're not even good marketplace quality.  They're terrible.  A Mexican place that serves a nacho plate needs to make their own chips.  Seriously, if you're not going to do this, don't have nachos on the menu at all.  I was thoroughly disgusted and disappointed at this point.   But, the good news is the guacamole is pretty good.  

So overall just a 3, but a 3 that I wouldn't go back to.  Sorry Phoenix but y'all don't really know what great Mexican food is.  And you live so close to the border!  What's up with that?!",2011-08-10 16:49:28

The killer online special for $50 for a 90min deep tissue massage brought me and my husband in. We both got massages at the same time in the same room. The walls didn't go all they way up to the ceiling though, so it was a bit loud. My masseur was Brennan and my husband had Alicia.

We both have back pain and were desperate for relief. We've had many massages in the past, but never deep tissue and never with such an emphasis on reflexology. Brennan said that he a similar back injury to me, and proceeded to put pressure on various spots in my body that had effects in a completely different area. A momentarily uncomfortable feeling ultimately led to a relaxation of the muscles that were wound so tight. 

I could literally feel the energy become unblocked. I've agreed to come back for a follow up appointment in a week to focus on the area that gives me the most pain. Brennan said that once these spots are worked, I will be amazed that the pain will be totally gone. If the first massage is an indication, I believe him.

Brennan and Alicia were both professional and courteous. Brennan obviously has great skills in deep tissue massage and reflexology. I would definitely recommend him to anyone.",2011-11-24 05:32:40

The appearance is as described. The place is tiny and the ambiance leaves much to be desired- especially for the type of food prices advertised. This place is a casual eatery with prices/attempts to try to be a gormet restaurant; falling somewhat short.

My wife and I started with the Bruchetta, the bread was nothing to write home about but the toppings were quite tasty and it was well done. She then had the pasta e fagioli soup, which was not quite what we were expecting.  Everywhere else we had had this type of soup, the soup has a more rustic taste, perhaps some meat, a little cheese. This soup tasted like white beans and had no other depth to the flavor. 

She had the lasagna and I the house specialty, a pasta with meat sauce. Her lasagna was very rich but the tomato sauce it was served with tasted as though it came from a can which was certainly very disappointing. My pasta was flavorful but again, nothing special. We had the cream brulee for desert which was tasty to me but again was nothing to write home about. For the prices, this restaurant was certainly not worth it.

To add to this restaurant's troubles, the facility can not handle their own limited business. We were offered garlic bread with our meal (which never actually came but was initially on the bill until I noticed it). The table next to us, had the wrong appetizer come out initially and also had one of the main courses come out with the entree. There was only one server who seemed at times overwhelmed with the degree of business at the restaurant. What did not help is there was a time where she literally stood near the kitchen speaking with the manager for about 10 minutes without moving while customers were waiting to be served, or in my case waiting to pay so we could leave.

If I do return, which is far from guaranteed, will be just for their signature dish(es) & will likely be as take out. In summary, the food was fair, but not worth the prices and the ambiance and service left much to be desired.",2014-03-19 22:07:55

LOL! The good thing for me when it comes to visiting the dentist I don't actually mind too much! Each time I come in, the staff members know me by name (not because I am in here every day) because they are very personable with their clients. I have the same dental hygienist every time I come in which is fantastic because she is also very personable and we can have nice, friendly conversations before she starts her work. JODY YOU ROCK! Some people really don't care to be friendly or get to know the people that work on their teeth, but to me feeling comfortable, and feeling like these people care to remember things about me and my life, make me feel like they care to make sure I am getting the best care they can provide. It's very reassuring and I love it!

Now when it comes to actual dental work I feel like they have always done an outstanding job. I have only had 2 cavities in the 3 years I have been going to their office (High 5 to brushing and flossing only 2 cavities) and I have had no other problems. My teeth are in really great shape, so I don't have to worry much, but they do their job by making sure they catch things when needed and that they stay in good shape. My fillings have never fallen out, they are never sensitive and you can barley see them! I have never had below average or average work at that, always exceptional.

Now when it comes to their office I think I have the most fun! Each time I have come in for a cleaning I am able to watch a movie! Each station has its own flat screen that comes down from the ceiling that entertains you while you have your teeth worked on. It was very nice to have when I was in the chair for a few hours getting my 2 fillings. It kind of distracts you and takes you away from what is going on in your mouth while you get into your movie. Each station is always very clean, not a lot of tubes and craziness happening. Its all organized and set up well. When you first walk in the lobby itself, it is very fancy. It's very open, great tile work, some stone siding, large pictures and a nice front desk. It's weird to describe but I would say its professional, fancy, clean and calming!

The reason for three stars, though, is because of how annoying the business model of some of these craft burger places are. We get it, your burgers are far superior than the concoction that McDonald's passes off as a burger, and 90% of the people coming here are fully willing to pay $10-$15 for a burger and fries meal (I certainly am). The problem is always the portion size. If you lift, workout, or are anything but paper-thin good luck getting full off of these portions. Why not charge a little more and provide normal portions?

I do believe that the place had an option to add an extra patty, but that really does not help since, unless you have eaten here before, you have no clue how big/small the burger by itself is. Why would I order an extra patty just in case?

Perhaps its difficult because your relation with system varies based on where you live, the times you travel and where you are going. As someone who spends 80% of his time in downtown and the beltline, I think it suits my needs just fine. 

Considering this is a city of only 1M people I think you get decent value for the system. And I've seen some incremental improvements such as the posting of train times in downtown C-Train stations and the development of the CT app. We'll see with the extensions to the C-train if the city finally creates a service closer to what Calgarians deserve. It's an OK system, but only because I do see improvements.

I feel like a lot of places these days ask you how you want a burger cooked and then cook it medium well no matter what you say.  Not MCW.  Very juicy and flavorful.  The bun was a soft sesame seed bun, which tastes good but loses something in structural integrity.  I had to finish with a fork, but that was fine, it was a fantastic burger.  The patty had a nice crust, and was juicy to the end.  Lots of bacon and they use a nice cheese.  I would order this burger again.

The onion rings were unlike any I've had, I would describe the better as almost funnel cake like.  It was light and very crisp and had a bit of sweetness.  We really liked these, and an order is huge.  Definitely share these.  

Excellent service and quality handmade food.  Recommended.",2013-09-01 15:56:02

I have to say the instructors that we got were really lovely - they took the time to demonstrate proper axe throwing technique and took counting the scores really seriously! The way this works is that each person in the group gets to practice axe throwing. Than what happens is you're the competition: If you hit the axe on the various targets (and get more bullseyes), you're entered into a competition with other people from your group. From then, you compete against each other until there are two people left. It's long, but super fun.

At the end, the instructors will take a group shot and ask you to ""bleep"" it all - it makes for a great memory.

I would highly recommend this place for any group events: it's fun and rowdy and you will be surprised at how much technique there is to axe throwing!!",2016-05-04 16:41:00

I ordered the Gold Sashimi; it came with 18 pieces, including amaebi, maguro, tako, hamachi, ika, hokkigai, white tuna, & sake.  Not a bad spread; and they didn't include fillers like egg(although I do like it), kani, shrimp, and other really cheap sushi.  Very generous portions, but I could tell some of the fish was frozen/thawed several times(tuna looked great but was watery, as were the shrimp, and the ika was still icy.)  I would give the sushi 3/5.

I also got the grilled squid, a small Sapporo, miso soup, & salad...all for...and here's the kicker... $27!  My meal, tax, tip, everything, was $36CAD!  And that's not even ordering takeout, which is apparently 20% cheaper.  With a favorable exchange rate right now, at $.79:$1CAD, this was probably the most affordable sushi I've ever eaten for the quality.  

The decor is lacking, so this isn't a first date type of place, but the food, compared to the price, is a no-brainer.  I would like to come back some day and try other things on the menu; the squid was great so I'm guessing their other cooked items are excellent as well.",2009-03-31 04:23:38

Started out with some garlic naan. For $3, not bad at all. It was tasty and the 3 sauces it's served with were a plus! Kept thinking if the regular bread was free though as I saw it served around the other tables...hmmm...oh well. Then we went for the Samosa, which was good, but I expected some more spice. The sauce it was served with was good and necessary. I went with a traditional dish of tikka masala, which was priced at $17. I thought it was good, but it was the exact same dish in flavor and size that I had at Blue Taj for lunch and it was $10. It's a traditional dish, so I shouldn't expect much variation. I also had some of my wife's scallop dish. The flavor was good, but the scallops were a tad undercooked in my opinion.

Pros - 
Sometimes lots of food is relatively cheap

Cons - Where do I begin...

one of the worst Food 4 Less I've been to.

Most fruits & vegetables while a little cheaper than other stores are a day away from being roach/fly food

Far from fresh, most fruits and veggies look dried, shriveled up and maybe picked 
up the night before from Smiths or Albertson instead of it being tossed

Store has largely chemical or dying food smell - not a good hygienic sign...

Parking lot was so full on a super hot 110 day that you'd think food is free

All carts were out and many were broken (wheels) or had trash in them

Food isn't THAT much cheaper.  Check out Sprouts for instance, or other stores for sales before coming here. 

Frankly I'd pay 20% more so that all my fruits and veggies don't all look like raisins and must be eaten asap before they completely shrivel up and die. 

Fresh Meat prices are about the same as other stores, but given how fresh their fruits and veggies are, I'd rather pass on meat  here. 

In sum, if you're starving fresh out of work and willing to eat Albertsons' yesterday's food and save a dollar, this place is for you!",2014-07-02 20:49:03

My burger was super tiny (6 oz, not nearly enough considering I got it with no bun). There was also no option for a double Patty which was sad. It also was nothing spectacular. It was thin and not memorable. My side salad (which cost me 5 bucks) was a handful of lettuce with no toppings.

My husband got the spinach artichoke dip as an app. They gave him a handful of chips and didn't even fill the bowl up with dip. He got the loaded nachos app as an entree and it was loaded... for an infant maybe. Scarce toppings and a small portion for an app that's supposed to be shareable.

It's a cozy location housed in a fairly residential area - I don't imagine I would have noticed it at all had I not come to hear of Playa Cabana from friends and ventured to give it a try. Tip - I would come here with one friend or two, but likely not more as the place attracts a decent crowd and I wouldn't think it'd be comfortable for a larger group.

Food was certainly pricey for what you get - lunch for one can be $15+ if you get a side along with your entrée, and the food itself was by no means exceptional. I haven't gone to some of the staples for Mexican in the city yet (La Carnita, El Caballito, etc.) but compared to where I have been recently (Mi Taco Taqueria) I didn't find it to be very special. I tried the Chile Rellenos ($12), Tostadas Fritas (potentially the Tostadas Horneadas which are oven-baked but I think it was the fritas, which are fried) and Tostadas de Nopal ($12). The Chile is essentially a stuffed pepper with mostly cheese. The Tostadas are more or less bean tacos. Your order should come with the Tostadas Fritas (these are round and fairly small tortillas) and a medley of sauces (some of these are delicious!) so I wouldn't order an extra set unless you need to :) The food was just alright and I might say a bit plain compared to what flavourful Mexican fare typically comprises - more importantly, I felt kind of sick after, as did my friends who I came here with. 

While the food is just okay, the service could really, really be improved - for a crowd of ~15 between the patio and indoor sites, there were two servers who definitely seemed to be struggling to keep up with their orders. The wait for the menu and the bill were very, very long.

It's so peaceful here with a good 13mile scenic drive if you're not adventurous enough to hike.  Great scenery to take pics or just to take a breather and enjoy the hidden beauty that most do not care to see outside of the Vegas strip.

My favorite hike is turtle head.  A very difficult 5 mile hike that includes lots of climbing which I like.  My second fav trail which is a easy  6 mile loop called white rock trail.

I hike about once a week so feel free to join me if ever interested in trying something new or if you're already into this kind of thing.

I believe the mackerel is pretty good for a sushi place (mackerel is usually oily and has a fishy scent). Also, their octopus and seared tuna is DELICIOUS! Do not start ordering rolls and appetizers. Try to stick it out with the nigiri.

The appetizers are decent, but you can get better at Sushi Bay located in Henderson.

The rolls are filled with different flavors and sauces (I try to avoid this at sushi restaurants).",2012-07-07 06:52:29

I ordered the Southern Fish with fries and Joel ordered the Chicken and Waffles. We both shared some chili cheese fries as well. The prices are great. For both of us, with drinks, it came out to under $20. My Dad ordered the same as me and spent under $6. You get several pieces of fish and the cornmeal breading is so full of flavor. I thought mine was great, but Joel's chicken... Wow! I wanted to rip it away from him. I wanted to order more chicken just for myself, but I was so full from the fish! His waffle was cooked crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Now let's talk about those chili cheese fries. They came in a large to go container smothered in chili and cheese! What more could you ask for! YUMMY!

The only down side is that there is no bathroom, but they do have a sink so you can wash all the tasty goodness off in. Also, be prepared to wait 'cause they cook everything to order. Which is totally fine in my book! 

Yes, Sunny's, I will for sure be back for lots and lots of chicken!! What a great gem to have found! Thanks Yelp! You rock!",2014-04-30 04:34:19

The place is quite charming and even cozy and warm once all the guests have arrived around 8pm and the front door had been shut, up until then expect to feel like you're outside. I suggest reserving a table especially if you go with a date since every time it's a full house and there isn't much rotation throughout the night. 

Bands that play are amazingly enjoyable and if you, like I, derive pleasure from consuming dinner to a fine saxophone tune then Cherry Street Restaurant is the place to be.

This place was very cozy, clean and classy. The restaurant included a pretty bar and private rooms to accommodate larger groups for parties.

I've had meals there that make me feel that they warrant the ""Best Chinese Food in Ahwatukee"" title, and others that make me a little down that they couldn't be better.  This is one of those places where the waitstaff can switch from attentive to awkward, really positively or negatively affecting the meal.  I wish I could just objectively review the food for any restaurant, but if you forget my drink and to take my order while working the rest of the room (and I'm talking to you, Mr. Chao), then anything I eat afterwards is just not going to seem as good.

On a good night...I've had some of the yummiest potstickers I've ever had in Arizona (and beyond) - delicately flavored with the perfect amount of ginger and seared on the bottoms, I could have eaten 20 by myself.  Sesame Chicken is all white meat, crispy and perfectly sauced without being cloyingly sweet.  Mongolian Beef is tender and savory, over a crisp bed of noodles that add a great texture counterpoint.  Combination fried rice passed Mitch G's (and my) yellow rice test - large shrimp, tender beef and chicken, and the perfect amount of egg and diced veggies - I would eat a plate of just this easily and be a happy duck.

On a bad night...hot and sour soup touted as ""One of the best in the area"" was WAY too sour, oddly flavored, and full of huge chunks of semi-raw celery.  My husband took one bite and pushed it away, which left me struggling eating nasty soup for 4 people.  Beef with String Beans was overcooked, oversauced and tasted of Chinese 5-Spice powder more than anything else.  Huge disappointment.  Pomegranate martini was overly sweet, not at all strong, and a waste of a martini glass.

The decor is elegant, but a bit of a laugh.  They're trying to be modern, and while I love the specials written on the tile wall in the back of the place, the framed photos of salad greens is comical at best.  Just what I want to gaze at in a Chinese restaurant - chopped romaine.

I'm going to give Mr. Chao's another try because they are indeed ahead of the pack of other Chinese restaurants in the area, but there are some serious kinks in terms of reliability and consistency that need to be worked out.",2010-11-05 18:38:04

If you don't have transportation though, this is a convenient place to stay, hence the four stars. Apparently Super Shuttle comes here for $25 each way; I had my own rental car. I think parking was in the teen dollar amount, e.g. $15/day, but the hotel didn't charge me for parking after all (nice!). 

A shuttle runs, per your request, within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. You can tell the very nice and friendly shuttle guy anywhere you want to go within this distance. He'll also give good recommendations for dinner or shopping. I think the shuttle starts running at 7AM (double-check me), but it definitely stops running at 10PM. Basically, whenever you're done, you call a number (shuttle guy will give you a card), and a driver will come pick you up. Even though I had a rental car, I used the shuttle because it was easier than finding parking downtown (expensive to park). It is because of this, the hotel gets four stars.

The room itself and breakfast is your typical Hampton. I did find it odd that at a little after 5PM, the housekeeping service guy was servicing the room across the hall. My room still hadn't had any housekeeping service. I was only staying two nights, so I didn't need extra towels, but I did take shampoo/conditioner/lotion off of the cart, and he didn't seem to be too concerned.

At which point I begin yelling at random strangers headed to the bar that if they get me this time I'll get them next time. C'mon It's just 50 Cents! Corona Light Please! 

However, after graduating I regretfully had to get one of those things that tends to severely limit my mid week drinking binges. You know...a job. It's just not as fun to get hammered when you know you're running the risk of being above the legal BAC on the way to work in the morning at 8 am. Oh I've seen it happen! 

So now I've been more of a happy hour, weekend day drinking Dos Gringos customer and let me tell you it's much more enjoyable to drink beers (even if they do cost more than a dollar) in an actual chair...a barstool even. It's also nice to not have to watch where you walk all the time as to avoid the puddles of vomit on the ground. And you don't have to worry about those annoying drunk girls who scream at you to ""get"" them this time cuz the coronas are only 50 cents! I mean, geez, I'm not made of quarters over here!

As far as drink and food specials go, Dos Gringos is pretty solid and I'm surprised they're not busier for Friday Happy Hours. It's impossible to sit down at most bars in the area at that time, but there's always a few barstools and tables open over there. Last time my boyfriend and I wandered in at about 6:50, planning to get a couple happy hour drinks but were fine (obviously) with paying full price for the rest. Our awesome bartender basically saved us 10 bucks by throwing 6 beers in a bucket of ice for us, all 6 at the $2 price, and then making sure she came around quickly enough for us to put in some tacos before they went up to full price as well. We got 6 beers and 8 tacos for less than 20 bucks. It was glorious.

I met friends the other night who suggested this for dinner and off we were.  They have been there several times and could reocmmend things.

For an appetizer, I got a sausage roll, a spiced sausage wrapped and baked in a flaky pastry.  The sausage came sliced and was accompanied by a dish of mustard sauce that was excellent.  It really gave the sausage a nice flavor although it was good without the mustard.

For the mains, all three of us got steak and kidney pie.  This was a first for me and I enjoyed it a lot.  The steak cubes were very tender and the kidney had a very smooth texture and was quite flavorful.  The pie was topped by a flaky crust and it was piping hot.  (Sweeney Todd fans will get that).  With the pie comes mashed potatoes and gravy and a healthy serving of peas.  It turns out to be a large and filling meal.

Service was a little off.  One of my friends ordered water with her drink at the outset and was not brought it until near the end of the meal when she had to ask again.  Also, after being seated, the staff wasn't sure whose table it was until we asked.

I call ahead to see what time they close- the phone rings endlessly.
I call the hotel directly and the operator answers ""11pm"".
I ask to be transferred to the restaurant to confirm- it keeps ringing!

I checked the website to be sure and the HR website states 11pm, but the Johnny Smalls page states 10:30pm. I even checked OT to verify, but they didn't have any resos after 9:30 available. It may seem odd to extensively check, but with drive times and traffic you have to be sure that a place will be open when you arrive otherwise your night is shot. I showed up about 9:45pm and the restaurant was empty. Like a bomb went off.

I had to get a players card (the chick with the pierced cheeks was a B*itch. ""Please"" & ""thank you"" are not in her vocabulary) to take advantage of the AYCE deal.

I walk back with card in hand and no one is at the host stand so I wait at the bar and the bartender gives me the best news ever: They are not serving food and are only serving drinks. It's the best news because my friend wanted to eat there, but I HATE everything about this restaurant. My last experience was unforgettably bad and this new experience just seals the deal. 

So, it was Firefly to the rescue which stays open til 2am and is always busy, even at 11pm on a Thursday. If you want other options for tapas go to Julian Serrano at Aria or even Fluer at Mandalay Bay. Heck for a reverse happy hour (10pm-2am) within walking distance head to Ferraros across the street.

Lululemon Athletica has the best quality athletic apparel that I've owned. Yes they are expensive, but the quality and craftsmanship of their work justifies the price. They also stand behind their product and will replace items that fail from normal use. These aspects are great, but my absolute favorite thing about Lululemon is that they host weekly yoga classes for free!...

 I love this community aspect of their business. I understand that they are a business, and free yoga classes also means yoga students in their store, but genuine community develops when people show up at the same place on a regular basis, and that trumps any additional motive the company may have. I would encourage anyone interested in trying out yoga to go to a couple months of classes and see if you connect to a teacher. Lululemon invites different teachers to some in and lead classes each week. 

I am also a fan of Lululemon's yoga mats, which are actually priced more reasonably than other mats of the same quality. I have owned several yoga mats, but my go-to mat is my first Lululemon, now full of character from time spent practicing.",2017-02-27 03:51:59

So, we moseyed over next door because my hungry stomach could not handle driving elsewhere.  Walking into Beijing Noodle No. 9, I felt that something was not quite right.  The hostesses were super nice, servers had the efficiency of a Chinese restaurant BUT with a kind smile.  Staff were all milling around at what seemed like a very well oiled machine.  What?  You'll bring my dessert promptly after we're finished with the main meal?  What?  You offered my husband another beer?  (He was so shocked that he did not accept his usual second beer.)  The interior was not only clean, but it was also bright and incredibly well designed.  Drawers were professionally labeled.  No, we were not in a Chinese restaurant, but we were in the surely in the twilight zone.

I have a theory there is an inverse relationship (not sure if linear or exponential) between Americanization of the restaurant (so that includes service, decor, cleanliness) and the tastiness of the food.  The cleaner, the prettier the decor and the more ept or polite the staff is, the less tasty the food probably is.  The opposite would be the dirtier, the uglier the decor, the more the staff barks at you, the increasingly tasty the food is.  

Where does Beijing Noodle No. 9 fall?

Watching the chef hard at work hand stretching the noodles, I was hopeful for perfectly chewy al dente noodles.  It was amazing watching the entire process.  Boing... Stretch Twirl... Boing... Stretch Twirl.  

Food:
* The hand stretched noodles lacked the chew like the well developed gluten that would be in perfect noodles.  Sad face.
1.  Sichuan Dan Dan Mian - Let's talk about the sauce.  It was nice and spicy and a touch on the salty side.
2.  Braised Beef Brisket and Tendon Noodle Soup with hand stretched noodles - Perhaps my cantonese self is used to really robust flavors, but this soup somehow lacked some depth.  Braised usually means tender meat, but the chunks of brisket were decidedly chewy.  Overall, it was good but not the best.
3.  Choy Sum - Great wok hei and seasoning, but the portion size was pitiful.  
4.  Xiao Long Bao (XLB/Soup Dumplings) - Very juicy and soupy - the soup filled the entire soup spoon!  Where they did not quite reach XLB nirvana was in the dumpling skin.  It was not as thin and membranous as the famous Din Tai Fung's.
5.  Sweet Red Bean Buns (mei gui dou sha bao) - Two out of the three were delicious.  The bun was fluffy and not dry, and the inside was filled with smooth and sweet red bean paste.  The third bun opened up to dry and crusty red bean.  Pleh!

Prices:  Outrageous!  I would say each dish was two to three times the price that we were used to.  I'll chalk it up to the fact that the place is located in casino, and being that it was so ""swanky"" in decor and with well-trained staff, they needed to mark dishes up for the cost of running the place.  On a side thought - perhaps, we've all been spoiled by rock bottom prices at other Chinese restaurants and like how Korean and Japanese food is pricier, Chinese food should be priced similarly?  

Conclusion:  So the inverse relationship is true in this case.  It was swanky; the food was average.  For average food that I can get cheaper and tastier elsewhere (i.e. Yi Mei Deli), I probably don't recommend coming back.  Shows me for eating Chinese food in a casino!",2012-09-25 00:34:04

The gym is a pretty good size and has most of the machines that you'll need. However, this location gets super packed during after work hours -- per usual. I think all gyms are like that. This place is usually not that busy when it's late nights like 10 PM and after. It's also pretty empty in the early mornings like around 5-6 AM. The weekends are also usually a great time to come because everyone is typically taking their weekends off. 

They have a pool and a sauna room. Their sauna room can get pretty crowded during times but not everyone stays forever -- I mean, it's too hot in there! 

Only thing I didn't care for was when we signed up. My husband and I originally wanted to get the 7 day pass to try out the gym before we made any decisions to sign up. Because at that time, my husband was still signed up to Planet Fitness. They advertise the 7 day pass online, on yelp, and in whatever flyers they sent to your house. However, when we sat down and talked to one of reps, he told us, ""We don't do 7 day passes anymore."" Uhm ... what? After a few minutes, after he noticed our reaction, he responds with, ""Well, if you REALLY wanted it, I could sign you up for the 7 day pass no problem.""

Okay buddy. You single handedly went against your whole company's advertisements. We're not stupid -- we know that you just want to sell us a membership. But I'm not going to go off on you because there is no point. 

We ended up taking the membership anyways because my husband had wanted to switch. Eos is definitely the bigger gym, has more equipment, and it has a sauna so it has most of what we needed anyways.

I just didn't appreciate the fact that you would go against all advertisements just to sell us something. If I read somewhere that you had a 7 day pass, like your WEBSITE, you should honor it -- not tell me that you no longer do it. It rubbed me the wrong way. 

If you can get past all that, this place is great! :)",2018-01-17 06:55:24

I still adore my beloved Vanguard, but since trying out Velveteen Rabbit I will probably have to split my time between the two. The only downfall of Velveteen Rabbit is that is sits on the South side of Charleston, being kind of cut off from the rest of the downtown bars and hangouts on Main Street (mainly Artifice and Bar+Bistro). However, the same can be said about The Lady Sylvia.

Parking - There is a lot to the side of the building which makes parking a snap if there are spots, otherwise you'll have to resort to on-street parking somewhere on main.

Bar Decor/Ambiance - A nice mix of old-timey furniture with flairs for modern lighting and light shows on the wall over the interesting artwork. Menus are boards, drinks are flirty and pretty, chalkboard menus add a clever touch and a way to play with their drink menu.

Drinks - I had the ""Improved Whisky Sour"" a very delicious cocktail and a steal at $8. All of their made-to-order cocktails are $8. Less pricey than Commonwealth and Vanguard. And I tried the Blind Willow, also a nice drink. Wine was also had. They serve up some interesting-sounding beers as well. 

+1 - They serve delicious mixed nuts at the bar. We got a blend of the savory and sweet. Perfect pairing with our cocktails. And no, they do not sit out on the bar for everyone's hands to be in, you get your very own bowl.

And people that is just what I said when I took one bite of the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  Wow-Fireworks!  

The chile was stuffed with roasted eggplant and Manchego cheese, sweet red pepper sauce and lightly dusted with cornmeal not a greasy egg battered mess-just delicousness.

Then I said, ""Why didn't I order that?"" It was my sister's order. Boo-hoo. Sadly that's where the fireworks ended.  

I ordered the boring salmon for $22 and I want my money back. The menu said it had ancho chile and honey glaze and roasted jalapeno crema...doesn't that sound appetizing?  Haa haa nothing exciting. I did not taste any of those flavors! They must have sent me the senior citizen entree... just healthy and forgettable which by the way you need to specify that you want it well done otherwise they prepare it rather raw-and it was still undercooked for me. If you've had a Lean Cuisine this reminded me of one of those frozen ""healthy"" meals. Skip it!

My Margarita was okay and the starter which was the Tiger Shrimp Tamale--was good but honestly too bland and boring.  I want my $16 back. The boiled-like shrimp, sauce and cornmeal was more like baby food. How could this be a signature dish?  Please grill those shrimp till their black and add some green chile and spice.  Personally, I like my tamales like I like my men...HOT!  (actually just one man...the hubby LOL). Disappointed in this raved about dish.

The stars of the show were the Lemon Drop Martini which our fabulous waiter suggested, the free bread basket which was amazing.  Yum yum went my tum tum, a nice variety of cornbread and sweet bread. And of course my sister's chile relleno.  Glad she got the good order since it was her birthday.  

Another downer?  No churro dessert offered at lunch time!  Boo-Bobby-Boo!

Our waiter was super friendly, funny and very engaging. Five stars for the service.

The reason for 3 stars - failed communication:

I booked an appt for 50% off training facial and I was told I need a hydrating facial, which is fine however I wasn't aware nor I was let know that hydrating facial was not included as part of the training facials (that were 50% off). I enjoyed the facial very much by the new staff - she was fantastic. I usually get hydrating facials with Tamila in the past and have had Pure and SImple facial and Deluxe Radiant Lift Facial (both amazing and my skin always looks amazing because of how well these facials fit my skin and the products I have from Pure and Simple).

I wish that was communicated to me. I understand that the esthetician will recommend facials based on my skin condition (which I am very happy about) but I also wish I was told that the facial was not inculded as a training opportunity.

I had heard good things and he seemed pleased when he tried it with a friend the week before, so my expectations were high.

Here's the breakdown:

Service: Super. Better than that. Amazingly super! Everyone was very attentive, to the point where the bartender flipped the tv in our booth to the Hokies game without our having to ask because we both had on Virginia Tech t-shirts. The servers were fantastically friendly as well.

Decor: It's bicycle themed, y'all. It's bright and clean and very very bicycle themed.

Booze: The beer list was of decent length and filled with interesting, non-bud/miller/coors choices. My Cottonwood Pumpkin even came with some pumpkin pie spice around the rim. They seem to have a generous amount of drink specials which the server made sure to inform us of.  Roomie was a touch sad they didnt have Shiner on tap, but he will live.

Food: Here's where my review begins to falter a bit. I got the Cross Country, which came with pepperjack, pico-de-gallo, onion, tomato, lettuce,  jalepeno spread, guacamole (which i actually dislike but didnt see in the list) & and a partridge in a pear tree. There was so many toppings that nothing really shone through. In fact I couldn't even detect the dreaded guac. My side of sweet potato fries was adequate but the dipping sauce tey gave me tasted like straight-up pancake syrup. Not my cup of tea (or should I say, cup of sugar). My roommate go the Hungover Cyclist, which is a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches. The problem was that he sandwiches were made on texas toast so there was just too much darn bread to properly eat the thing.

I don't like to make flat out direct comparisons in reviews, but frankly, if you are thinking of eating at Kickstand, do yourself a favor and go to Big Daddy's instead. It is essentially the same restaurant, but BDs just makes tastier food.",2010-10-27 00:21:08

The place was easy to find, and parking was good.

We were greeted right away, and were shown to the computers where we could browse the dogs that they have available for adoption. 

The young man who helped us was very informative, asking if we rented or owned, if we had other dogs, and what we were looking for.

We were seated quickly in the bar area in a booth and told a server would be by soon to take our drink orders. After a bit of a wait we had our drink orders placed,( Ice teas ) and then soon we had someone else asking us what we wanted to drink. 

After the server confusion was cleared up, we confirmed that the June specials were still in effect and both ordered the fish and chips for 4.99. 
We could not have asked for faster service. I imagine that as soon as the order went into the computer, they plated our food. 
It arrived hot. I had to ask twice for the ranch I requested for my chips, but the food was good. Especially for the price. 

The decor is truly nothing special. After a week, I cannot remember anything to make note of. Its pleasant. The booths are not padded which is nice for a change. You do not sink into the seats from where other people have constantly sat. 

The service was prompt and pleasant. They asked if we needed more ice tea and filled our glasses. The only thing I could say is that she failed to ask if we were interested in dessert before bringing our check. Considering the check total was already small, she could have tried to increase it. We might have tried a Buried Treasure or an Apple Crisp. I usually either get an appetizer or a dessert. Today I had neither because I wasn't asked.

There were at least 10 daily specials including all you can eat cod.  I ordered the Mediterranean Dinner Platter, my wife ordered the all you can eat cod, my daughter ordered a BLT sandwich, and my son ordered a grilled cheese sandwich.  All orders except mine were served with fries.

About 20 minutes later, our food was served.  My Mediterranean plate took longer to cook because it had chicken and beef on two skewers.  It was served piping hot and was actually rather tasty!  There were two plates.  One came with seasoned hummus with olive oil, black olives, tomato, and pita bread.  The other had the skewers sitting atop a bed of yellow rice.  The rice was basically flavorless, but the skewers were hot and tasty.  I loved em!  The hummus was yummy and my wife helped me eat it.  I used some of the Frank's Red Hot sauce on my dishes and I really enjoyed my meal.  

I tasted my wife's code and it was very good.  The tartar sauce was rich and creamy too.  The fries were kind of plain tasting, however, and I think they were undercooked because they were not crispy.  My daughter polished off her BLT and she really liked it.  My son at most of his grilled cheese and I could see that it had a nice thick layer of cheese in the middle.  He ate most of his fries and side of corn too.

If you want to have a party at Luna's, you can.  They'll cater it on site.  They have a kids menu and the food is very inexpensive.  The flavors are slightly above average.  The service was very good as the waitresses were joking around and laughing with each other.  They seemed happy.

The enchilada sauce was pretty bland but ample sauce, chicken, and cheese were used. The crepes had fresh fruit, but the whipped cream was more like a flavorless foam and the crepe itself was an odd texture. Maybe breakfast isn't their forte.

It was a hot, sunny Sunday afternoon, and the cold treat was very welcome.

The shop was empty when we entered, but by the time we left it was pretty full. There are tables and bar seats along the window, as well as a couple tables outside. Betsy's has a wide range of menu items, from frozen treats to coffee, hot dogs, and pepperoni rolls. We were there for ice cream, though. The person behind the counter was happy to answer our questions (""What's the Pittsburgh Pride?"") and provide samples. After tasting the pear ginger and sage salted almond, I went with one scoop of the latter ($2). My boyfriend ordered two scoops of mango sorbet ($3).

My boyfriend enjoyed his sorbet. I gave it a taste. It was nice and refreshing, but the flavor didn't scream ""mango!"" at me. Cold, creamy sage, on the other hand, is delicious. The flavor was very prominent without being overpowering, and the ice cream was barely sweet. The almonds sprinkled throughout offered a nice change in texture.

I e-mailed the owner of the restaurant requesting a reservation for 10 people (grew to 12 ppl when two friends joined us at the last minute), and he promptly responded confirming my request. That was a good start. 

When we arrived for our reservation at 6:30pm, we were guided upstairs to our seats, and by 7pm the place was packed. We all decided to start with one dish, even though our waitress suggested that we each get at least 2 dishes because on average people eat 2-3 dishes each. We would have started with 2 dishes, if not for the prices. 5 out of 12 people ordered the chicken tinga ($13), and 4 people ordered the flank steak ($14), 1 ordered the tongue and one ordered the meatballs (can't remember the prices of all the items, and they do not have a menu online). I asked our waitress if I could get my chicken tinga without onions, and she said ""sure, no problem."" I was the only one that ordered a second dish. You see, I grew up on black bean soup, and for $9, I figured it would be an amazing soup to charge that much for a soup made from beans. When the dishes arrived, our first thought was that they were small plates. But they did say that they were tapas, so we could not complain about that. My soup was tiny and it had no flavor. It was so bland, that I imagined the chef throwing a can of black beans and a can of tomatoes into a blender and blending it for 2 minutes and then pouring it on to a bowl. The chicken tinga arrived with no onions on top, which was a relief. But as I looked more closely at it, the chicken was swimming in onions! How can they miss that? 

I asked my friends if they were enjoying their dishes, and the consensus was that the food lacked flavor and that the portions were too small. The price simply did not warrant the quality of food we received. So when our waitress returned, we asked for the bill rather than order a second round of plates. I also felt bad for the friends who ordered a beer. $8 for a can of beer? Are you kidding me? This is not a ballpark!

The guacamole was good too, a plus since there were no onions in it because I hate onions. The salsa was decent, spicy and it was also the same salsa that accompanied our tacos that arrived shortly thereafter. I got a carne asada taco which I was pleasantly surprised with. The tortilla was sturdy and flavorful amongst all the carne asada and there  as avocado garnishing the top, once again without onions!

As I've mentioned in my review of A Cookie and a Cupcake, I usually prefer the sugary frosting to the smooth buttercream. Not here. Yeeeccckk! It was too sugary and hard. It was also disproportionate to the cupcake and fell off almost immediately.

I sampled four cupcakes (and felt like one of the cool kids for getting there before they sold out): chocolate chip, vanilla, chocolate raspberry, and cookies and cream. I'd say the cookies and cream was the best, followed by chocolate chip, chocolate raspberry, and poor vanilla came last. First of all, the vanilla cake is too spongy and too sweet. Then the vanilla frosting is just awful. I mean, not TRULY awful but only in the way a cupcake can actually be awful. Soo sweet and had this weird texture. The chocolate frosting was great. The chocolate cake was also great. So next time I'll probably try the chocolate cupcake, which has the best combination of cake and frosting. I agree with Krystal that the cookies and cream frosting was amazing. Unlike her, though, mine was on a chocolate cupcake, which I'm sure made it infinitely better.

They were pretty friendly in there, but not genuinely so, more like ""Hi! Our cupcakes rule! You are LUCKY to be here!"" etc. Like the cupcakes themselves, too sweet to be taken seriously.",2011-03-02 02:58:03

Service is typically on point and welcoming. Probably my only gripe is the prices of the joint as I was spoiled with the numerous, tasty but cheap ones back home in the Bay Area. Veggie House knows that they're probably the best at their job in doing the Chinese faux meat thing here in Vegas so I reckon they feel they can command the prices they do.

But as an active yelper I think reviews help people make informed decisions and this is my personal opinion regarding this studios class offerings while being pregnant** 

short story: if you're pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant the class offering might not be right for you during your pregnancy. 

A lot has changed since I joined this studio 2.5 years ago. 

I am now pregnant and the classes that I am actually able to do are few and far between. Not because of my activity level, but most of the classes here are heated (which according to my doctor) is a HUGE no no. 

I frequent TRX with Liz twice a week and a kettlebell class with Christina. That's it, three classes a week and at $700+ for a year membership now, it doesn't make it worth it for me. 

Beyond being pregnant and a lack of classes to choose from I want to acknowledge some of the things I think Trufusion could work on: on multiple occasions I have become frustrated at how crowded the classes can get and the instructors allowing late students to join. 

I come early everyday (at least 30 minutes) so I can get the spot I want and the equipment I need. It never fails that the instructor will allow last minute students to join so then all the students who were there on time are forced to make room where it doesn't exist. I have had people put their mats ON TOP of mine.  

TFY please max out your classes at a reasonable number and include guidelines for rows in your classes. If the boot camp room can fit five rows mark those off so people can put their mats down to make the maximum amount of space. 

As for late comers...please say NO to them. I understand wanting to provide that customer a good experience but please also consider all the other customers who are being interrupted by late comers. 

TF has changed their schedule multiple times since I joined and every time I am left without a beloved class. 

I have struggled from the very beginning with some of my favorite classes being moved to a different time slot or canceled outright (kettlebell battle rope, trucircuit with Leah at ~10:45am, trukettlebell before 12). Their new schedule seems devoted to cycling which is great for people who love to cycle but those classes are not for me. 

Overall I would join again if I found that the scheduled changed to allow more non heated classes but for right now, in the season of life I am in, I am fine working out on my own at the gym. I'll miss the people I met there and my favorite instructors a ton.",2016-03-03 16:55:18

 Very similar to Cardenas and though prices are higher than El Super on produce, I like their lively atmosphere so much better than morgue like feeling of El Super, so I don't mind paying a little more.

 Prices on poultry are really good as well, everything from chicken breast to ground chicken, love that they have boneless skinless leg meat at just $1.19/lb. 
 I just wish it was a one stop shop, but I can't get all the meats I need there, sadly. Still have to make another stop for hot Italian sausage :/

 At 2pm today- different story. I took a number and was 23rd while they were serving 9th. But that's cool- there are a lot of employees and by the time I got done in produce aisle, my meat counter number was up.

I've been to the perch before but my partner hadn't so we decided to go for it. Host stand is tricky to find. I noticed many guests have that problem. Maybe a sign saying wait here at the top of the stairs so people will feel acknowledged. We waited a couple of minutes while a gentleman with glasses bussed a table for us so we didn't have to wait longer so I appreciated that.

After we sat down I checked in on yelp and got a free glass of wine and my partner got a sampling of an amazing beer he loved. Our server Alexis was a peach. She was so sweet and took great care of us.

We started with the Arugula flat bread with prosciutto. I'm not one for arugula because I find it too bitter but thisssssssss was amazing. From the sauce to the meat, so delicious. The appetizer almost out did the entree.

I decided to try the seafood pasta special. It was spaghetti pasta with marinara sauce and salmon, calamari and shrimp. I told Alexis I was allergic to tomatoes and wanted the dish so she made a great recommendation, get the Sriracha cream sauce instead. Man am I glad she told me to do that. My partner loved it so much I could tell he wanted my dish. 

I'm from Boston so seafood for me is always iffy out here mainly because I'm seafood spoiled. The shrimp in the dish was NOT good. Very chewy and didn't appreciate the taste. Other than that it was the only negative to the night.

I think that the staff at this Chipotle are probably the nicest and the quickest that I've experienced. This is probably due  to the location near UNLV.

Yes, this mall is small. Yes, they do not have very good, wide variety of clothing stores. However, they seem to be trying to add variety, slowly. 
   After looking around the food court upon arriving and departing, I have noticed that they do have more food options then I thought. They have a noodles and co, they have a pizza place, a taco place, and a couple places the get burgers and fries, they also have a pretzel place(that totals 3 in the mall), as well as Chinese and Japanese. So I just feel that that part of my review needed to be corrected. 
   They do need to have better signs for bathrooms, elevator(s) if there is more then one in the main mall. The children's area DESPERATELY needs a entrance gate! I can not say how many minions ran out and parents were having anxiety attacks! A nightmare for sure.

You'd like the casual, unorthodox and cluttered décor with the untraditional lamps and interesting chandeliers. 
Personally, other than the salted caramel brownie, I can barely resist the flaky layers of the Napoleon. On the savory side, I like the Roast Beef Croissant. I'm pretty sure that charming Parisian girl named Amélie would have loved their Café au lait as much as I do.

-Checked in, go upstairs, open door, find stranger sleeping in our room. Seriously Palms?!
-Front desk gave us all the room numbers we had booked for a group booking (requested all the rooms to be on the same floor.) When people began checking in, they were issued rooms on different floors even though the front desk promised to hold those rooms for us.
-Compensation for the mix up in our group booking? Manager comes out to say we can upgrade to a penthouse only if we gave up all three of our 2 bedrooms and one studio AND pay an additional $$$ (can't even remember what the amount was because it was a ridiculous amount and by this time I was so mad that I was seeing red because of their horrible customer service!)

Room:
-Two televisions, however only one worked
-Broken light
-The thing to plug the bathtub so that we can fill it up, didn't work/broken
-TV: channels were not clear, static/pixelated

-So after finding the stranger sleeping in our room (and the front desk asking the person to leave due to a mistake on their part), I had requested that the sheets be changed.

Excellent selection of whiskey and draft beers served by an incredibly knowledgable bartender, good food and excellent surroundings, hard to find a better place than this. Pet friendly outdoor patio. One of the better places in the area, must try for sure.

They recently turned this location into a sports bar, and I see all the negative yelp reviews, but I was in there last night and I thought it was great. The menu has most of the great items on it you would want in a sports bar, and everybody seemed to be enjoying their food. This will be a good place for football.

I do have to say that I HATE how hardcore sales the employees are.
Last time I was there was the worst! After I went over exactly what I wanted and accepted some offers and declined others, I left my car there and went to the movies with some friends. THREE different employees called me with in 20 minutes of me leaving to offer me more services.

This most recent time wasn't nearly as bad, but in 4 minutes, one employee asked me 3 times if I wanted an oil change. I declined three times and each time I stated I JUST had an oil change less than a week ago. I wanted to shake him and tell him to listen to me!
Additionally, every time I have gone there, they always take significantly longer than they quote. This time was twenty minutes longer, but the first two times was over an hour and a half longer each time. Being in sales and customer service for so long, I've learned it's smart to under promise/over deliver.

We found this place because of all their advertising. Yes that stuff works. When I went inside, I was surprised to see how Americanized it was. That was a bad sign off the bat, plus it was a 24 hour place. =(

I order the house special egg noodles and glass noodles soup and he order a pho tai, the one with just the strips of steak. When I got my bowl, I tasted it and it tasted really bad. I wasn't sure what it was but I couldn't eat very much of it. The glass noodles also really sucked. They were very soft and broke very easily. They were basically mush. I only ate a few bites. My fiance tried his pho and was disappointed as well. I tried the broth and boy was it full of msg. The aftertaste was really bad. It tasted so salty. No wonder he couldn't finish it.

First if you plan on going allot for a 20-30 minute wait. The seats in front of the ordering counter, side and front of the restaurant are shaped like a giant curve. They must have anticipated that their customers were going to have an extended wait. The portions are big (and according to the calorie guide on the menu high in calories) but the prices are higher than most other places. 

My one big complaint is, as opposed to the LA street food carts they seem to be trying to emulate, they need to have salsa/pico Di Gallo/ --- to scoop from so the immense burritos they serve can get a scoop of your favorite dressing with every few bites. Without that they are not terribly dry but could be much better. Really if they had a fixin's bar like other similar Mexican places I would rate them a 4 star place.

Rather than fight for a bite of food, all you have to do here is wait to be seated and order from the menu. We were lucky and nabbed two chairs right in front of the cook's station, which provided the perfect vantage point for foodie voyeurism. We watched the chef and his crew make noodles and dumplings by hand. One might think that a menu this basic takes very little time to prepare, but it's all about the details and handiwork. 

Two of us split a duo of dishes, the Tomato and Egg Sauce noodles alongside Sautéed Eggplant with Sichuan Garlic Sauce. We *almost* had the Green Onion Pancake, but didn't want to overdo it. This was lunch and we didn't want a gut-busting meal! Would never have though to put fresh tomatoes and a light tomato sauce with egg on fresh noodles, but somehow it worked!

I've been to the old location and the current one, for a work teambuilding event and for a family activity, respectively. The waiting room in the new location on Arrowridge Blvd is at least three times the size of the old one and would accommodate large groups much better. It's also darker and definitely helps get you into the spooky mindset.

Each Black Out Agent I've worked with has been exceptionally professional. They're in character even before you walk in the door, and never break. 

I'm someone who isn't great at playing along, so I wondered how I would fare in a dramatic environment like this. I have to admit, I was completely swept up in the storyline and the urgency of our missions. My adrenaline was *pumping* during several tense moments. Even though my logical brain knew I was never actually in danger, I definitely felt scared a handful of times.

I have completed both the South End Psycho and Trade Street Epidemic rooms. The quality and difficulty of the puzzles were similar in both; the biggest differences were the interactions we had with the actors that visit the rooms. I did feel like we needed more help in Trade Street than in South End, but it could be due to our smaller group size. 

Speaking of help -- don't let your pride slow you down. Take the hints! There were a few things I never would have figured out if it weren't for a gentle hint from our ""agent on the outside."" This is also a good time to recommend that you assemble your team wisely; your best friends and favorite people may not be the best problem solvers.

Our waitress was very busy and hadn't had a chance to explain what the festival meant until we were ready to order when we were informed that to make a true meal, they recommended ordering 2-3 pastas per person or ordering many for the table to share as each meal only contained 2-3 ounces (!!!) of pasta per order.  Uhhh...I don't know about you but paying $13-19 bucks for 2-3 ounces of pasta seemed pretty darn pricey.  We then had to re-group and wait to place our order with this new information.  We all decided on a soup or salad in addition to our sole pasta dish.

For an appetizer we all shared the bruschetta.  3 pieces of rock hard bread with a cheesy spread, greens, corn and some tomatoes on it.  I think it was 12 bucks?  So like 4 bucks per piece of bread...it was okay but the bread was entirely too crisped.

I had the peach gazpacho soup and did really enjoy it.  It fit the warm night perfectly.  I didn't get the addition of a plop of avocado in the middle of it, but who doesn't love avocado so I rolled with it.

For my meal, I thoroughly enjoyed my 2-3 ounces of cavatelli with fennel sausage, ricotta, spinach and crushed tomatoes.  It was really delicious.  I would have loved more!!  I made sure to use the bread to sop up every last drop of sauce.  However, my mother had ordered the lasagna for her meal which was your pretty classic marinara and bechamel sauce containing lasagna.  It was plated on literally a small side plate and the whole piece of lasagna was probably about 1.5-2 inches squared.  It honestly looked insultingly small, this tiny piece of lasagna, on an itty bitty plate.  Just put it on a real plate or something that could pass as a real plate!  It just seemed to highlight that you are paying a good chunk of change for a few bites of food.  The lasagna was also dried out and just pretty blah.

For dessert we tried the dark chocolate bread pudding. It was the first thing we ordered all night that came out looking like it was actually meant to leave you feeling full.   Bread pudding is like one of my all-time fave desserts and this was good...but not the best.  However, this would be a great dessert to share because it actually came with food!

Overall, we had a good time but definitely it was because of the group of people we had together, and not much to do with the food.  I gotta say that I love a fancy restaurant here and there, but this just did not feel worth it to me.  I do not think I will be back.",2016-07-21 14:20:43
wRF6iISjWR7SmsdA70M4ZQ,hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw,rmNI_2C1gchMQoqIpqLkGw,1,2,1,1,"This Wal-Mart used to be just a regular one - clothing and other dry goods. They finished a major remodel recently and in the process, they managed to jam all the other departments (grocery, electronics, clothing, personal care, jewelry, pharmacy) into the store. And by jam, I mean that the aisles are barely wide enough for two wagons to pass carefully.

Good luck doing a food shop here - in the evening hours, the place is a sardine can. Way too many people trying to figure out where everything is. It's not their fault. It's a little scrambled. Dairy and cheese is in two different fridges (the fridges are actually pretty good - double doors and they can be opened first from either side). It took me three passes down the food aisles to find the small section with coffee. Product and brand selection, even for Wal-Mart, is limited.

As for the rest of the store, it's also mixes. For example, there was a display of pillows in the kitchen area next to the crock pots. I am not kidding you. The ""home"" section was in one area but the ""home office"" was in a different area of the store.

I picked up what I absolutely needed and I got out. If you're looking to save money and buy Wal-Mart, then I suggest you spend the 20 minutes and drive to South Tryon or Charlotte Highway in Fort Mill.",2012-02-14 13:10:34

It's been a while since I've visited this joint, so I gladly accepted.  When I arrived, they were already seated and the Appetizers were coming out.  They ordered Coconut Shrimp (Crispy large Shrimp hand-breaded with sweet flaky Coconut & a Citrus-Mustard dipping Sauce) & Creole Baked Goat Cheese (In roasted Red Bell Peppers served with vine-ripened Tomato Salsa and Parmesan Toast).

The Coconut Shrimp was OK, not great.  They're large sized Shrimp.....the Coconut Breading was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The Creole Baked Goat Cheese was excellent!  If you try the Goat Cheese, you have to slice up the Bell Pepper and eat it....it was amazingly good.

For an entree, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta (Jerk Chicken Breast, fresh Asparagus and Mushrooms tossed in a rich Parmesan-Herb Cream Sauce with Bow-Tie Pasta).  They weren't kidding when they said this dish was ""rich"".....I think I gained 5 lbs after eating this thing.....it was very good though.  Despite being rich, the Sauce didn't overwhelm the dish and it had a nice flavor.  The Jerk Chicken was cooked perfectly and was of good quality.....you could taste the flavor that Jerk Chicken is known for....I was left wanting more.  Thank God it wasn't bottomless, otherwise I'd have to buy new clothes afterwards....ha!

Overall, it was good service and good food.  This place is a solid 4 Stars.

A few months later I began to have issues with my passenger seat belt locking up, I brought it to Henderson Hyundai because it is under warranty.  They ordered the part. They replaced the part. Or so they claim. A month later it started again. I was told they would have to order another one. So Recently I brought the car in because they said the part was there . I bring the car in and 4 hours later I go to leave and when I got home I saw on the passenger side of my center console there where two gouges. So the next day I take it back to the dealership.  They admitted it was their fault and ordered the parts to repair the damage. We determined the mechanic must have had a screw driver in his back pocket and while working on the belt and caused the damage. 
I am now at a point where I would rather pay to have my oil changes done then go back there again.
I can't trust them to do the work, or not damage my car.",2014-09-20 06:22:24

The only common ground here is the surly wait staff. Belgium, being a largely French culture, does not pride itself in its service. As tipping is not the norm in many European countries, Belgians to not see the need to go beyond their call of duty in this regard. However, what's the Canadian excuse here?

First off, the 'restaurant' itself is simply disgusting. It's one thing to be a local hole-in-the-wall weathered down by years of service and steeped in tradition, or to even have a hipster hole-in-the-wall facade, but it's completely another to open an actual hole-in-the-wall. I don't want to throw this word carelessly but it struck me as an unhygienic sort of place. 

Now onto the food: although Brussels-style waffles are not as sweet as the street variety, Good Eten's were dry and flavourless, accompanied by sad-looking toppings; the Bicki burger (sic) was served on a soggy ciabatta bun; and the cheese croquettes contained an unidentifiable mixture involving blue cheese.

The only nod to reality were the frites, which although greasy, tasted somewhat authentic.

First the bad: we started calling Luis, the Cabana Manager, the Cabana Nazi!  We're Elite members and couldn't believe how bad it was. We paid the $100 member fee for a cabana that supposedly fits 12 people, but only has seats for 3. No kidding. When we asked to get more seating, we were told it was against the rules. When we started bringing over lounge chairs for our guests to sit, old Luis wasn't happy and advised that this wasn't allowed. When I told him that I wanted to talk to the manager, we were all of a sudden allowed to keep the extra seating.

We were told that we had to be at the Cabana by 9am. Which we were. Our plan was to settle the charge, go have breakfast, and come back and spend the day by the pool. We were then told that we were not allowed to leave. What?? I'm paying your fee and now we can't leave the premises....why does that no make sense?? We were told that if we left, they would rent the Cabana to someone else, and we'd forfeit our $100 fee.

Now the good: with the exception of the 7moths that we killed, we loved our 4 bedroom suite. The checkin staff were great and the bell desk guys were super helpful.

Overall, we'd come back....just not utilize the Cabana area...which is too bad. Doing stuff like that, is why you come to Vegas.",2017-05-07 17:16:47

It started out by me taking my 11 year old in for simple haircuts,  Then it progressed into taking my older daughter for up-do's and blow outs.  At the time, I wasn't a client here, I was seeing a ""five star"" color specialist, an hour away,  in Phx. (I live in Mesa). I was just bringing in my girls for cheap trims and haircuts and fancy up-do's.  It was close to our house and not expensive. My girls  usually saw Rayna, she even gave me a few blow outs and did a nice job. Once she wasn't available, so we were booked with Cassandra.  After awhile of noticing that the  stylist Cassandra was actually really good, I thought instead of driving up to Phx for my next blow out, I'd give Cassandra a try, since it was just a blow out, it would be fine. She did a fantastic job, at half the time of driving to Phx, and half the cost.  
So, the next time I let her touch up the color on my hair and again, great job and great price.   It has quickly evolved over three years and now, not only are my two daughters and my son  Cassandra clients, but I have personally been going to Cassandra and every experience is wonderful and pleasant. I recently just had Cassandra add some highlights to my dark hair and my hair looks so good. I always get compliments on my hair. 
I see Cassandra every 4-6 weeks for color (and trims) and more often for styles and blowouts. Cassandra is a great stylist.  She is young, pleasant, smart, articulate, and consistent in her work.  She also does a great blow out, without relying on a flat iron to do the work.  I have really gnarly , dry, Brillo pad type hair, she blows it out smooth as silk. It is very very hard to find a stylist who can do that. I know this from many years of experience.   This Regis salon is convenient for me and I always have an easy time making an appointment. The pricing is very fair and reasonable.  
It isn't an elaborate, fancy place by any means, sadly, that's why I had always been skeptical about coming here and why I only took my children here. But I am extremely happy with every experience I have ever had here. 
If you are ok not paying for the over styled,  pretentious. high end salon -look, and just concerned with getting a great color, cut and style at a reasonable price then give  Cassandra a try.  Go in for a simple blow out or style just to try her out and see how it goes.  Heck, take your kid in for a cut and style and see how it goes.",2016-11-04 00:30:01

First of all.. maybe it's a bad day at the restaurant, but they have to get their AC fixed!  My friend and I were literally sweating while eating our dinner.  The server saw me faning with my menu, she was kind enough to move us to another table with a better location with the ac.  We did feel the air move at the new table (one of the booths), but the air was not cold and minimal.  That made the dining experience not very enjoyable if I had to wipe my forehead while eating...and I wasn't in Asia eating street food.   

Service was great, with 4 or 5 servers in the little restaurant, they were all very nice and come refill your drinks and take away your plates.

Food is ok.  Solid 3.5 stars.  The chicken thigh skewers were perfectly grilled; the pizza one...well, guess it's our fault to order pizza skewer at a Japanese place; chicken wing was meaty and nicely flavored; grilled whole squid was done perfectly, not too charred to make it ika jerkey, just the right amount.  I wish they give you more ground ginger on the side (like Ichiza does) instead of more of that mayo sauce.  

Tried 2 cold dishes, the sashimi carpaccio and their version of tuna tataki.  Sashimi carpaccio is 2 stars at its best.  It's a combo of halibut and salmon, I think they dressed it with some kind of oil on top instead of just ponzu type of dressings.. it made it pretty oily for my taste, especially the salmon was already a belly cut with extra fat.  And again, didn't feel the dish to be very refreshing because it wasn't very cold... again, maybe I was just hot from the lack of AC in the restaurant.  Seared tuna tataki was much better, with a huge amount of red onions on top, although flavors were great and the right amount of dressing, wish the star of the dish would be more of tuna itself instead of red onions.  It's hard to find the tuna under the huge pile of onions.  Needless to say, both cold dishes were not my favorite of the meal.

Chicken karaage... I think they need to cut the pieces smaller, either bite or 2-bite size like other izakaya places.  They were huge pieces, 4 in an order, I felt like I was eating the chicken tenders from Cane's.  Although flavors and breading were pretty good, the size was just way too big and made it kind of gross... I had to double check every bite to make sure the inside of the chicken was fully cooked since the pieces were huge.  

Dessert: They didn't have the matcha soft cream, I was looking forward to try it.  Tried their Honey Toast because who doesn't love some Honey Toast, right?  Who knew you can screw up honey toast.  It was overly sweet....not sure if they were using extra honey or bad kind of honey, it's too sweet for my taste.  And they had to dust powder sugar on top to make it ""prettier?"", like it's not sweet enough, we need extra sugar on top.  The vanilla ice cream was probably a very cheap kind... it's SO WHITE, like hospital white and not very natural taste.  So, definitely would not order honey toast if I ever come back here.

Overall, it was a decent meal, most dishes were tasty, but nothing memorable.  My friend and I love Japanese food so was really looking forward to try this new spot.  Unfortunately I don't think I'd want to come back here.  With their limited selections of izakaya and overall taste of the food, i know I'll have much better experience at other places, unfortunately.",2015-09-23 06:40:10

There are 'fun' bars and there are 'cheap' bars - but for my overall favourites, Else's is part of an elite circle in my rankings.  My criteria:

1) Good selection of whisk(e)y and draft beer
2) Unpretentious without being collegiate/divey/hipster - I should be equally comfortable going there in shorts and flip-flops or in a suit - it should be cozy and dark with a relaxed vibe.
3) Good for all occasions - suitable for any celebration that entails copious consumption of alcohol or drowning your sorrows by the bar by yourself or drinking for a wake
3) Friendly, eclectic and interesting regulars and patrons
4) Knowledgeable bartender and staff that clearly love their jobs
5) No TVs - NONE.  I don't like sports in my bars.  And music should be in the background and never intrude on conversation.
6) Classless and appropriate for all (drinking) ages

Else's has all this in spades.  And it's definitely a locals bar being off the Ste-Laurent drag and it was one of the few places in Montreal that allowed me to start a tab (seriously Montrealers - paying per round is lame).  Yes, they are officially licensed as a restaurant (check out the history of licensing struggles on the menu) so you may be asked to order some food to drink here.  But there's a $4 vegetarian pizza on the menu... you know what to do.

In a word - this place is comfortable.  I walked in timidly at 10PM expecting to grab a quick pint before calling it a night.  I stumbled out at 3AM with an invite to a rock show, hand-rolled cigarettes, toasting to East Vancouver to someone that lived 3 blocks from me and a few solid recommendations on good hip-hop joints in the city and armed with the knowledge of how to fake a (male) orgasm.  This place is that good - slink in for a bit and you'll comfortably lose a few hours here drinking and bullshitting.  It didn't take long to figure out that no patron here works a 9-5 job - ""everyone here is either an artist or has a story"" as one of the regulars told me.  So yup, I came back for another visit.

Patio alone in the summer time is a 4.5 stars for sure!
I've been here a couple of times now for both dinner and brunch. 

For dinner:
I had the mac and cheese because it was very highly recommended but i was disappointed. It was a great portion and perfectly baked cheese crust at the top but the flavours and the creamy sauce just weren't satisfying enough. The abundance of peas was quite overwhelming and actually distracted me from enjoying just a hearty mac and cheese. For me, this would probably be a whole different dish if it weren't for the peas.

For Brunch:
I wasn't very impressed with their brunch menu which is served until 4 pm - i would've had liked a little more selection. I had the eggs benedict - perfectly poached eggs and runny in the middle. I substituted the ham with spinach on the scone. Although perfectly cooked, it was low on seasoning for me - it definitely needed a kick of something to make it more satisfying and flavourful for me. The home potatoes it came with were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was perfect and quite unique. 

They have a convenient and quite the perfect location and for the reason and to try everything else on their menu I would return here again.",2012-10-07 06:28:32

The exterior of the restaurant is nice and there is ample parking... but unfortunately that is where my great experience ends.  Our waitress was ok.  It took her a while to come over to us, which was shocking because the place was a ghost town.  We sat for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to even acknowledge us after the hostess sat us.   There were a few wait staff walking around the place and we were promptly ignored by all of them.  there were people seated in our section and they were acknowledged, but not us?  Weird.  So lets get to the good.  I ordered a blueberry flapjack which was tasty and freshly prepared.  Unfortunately the corn beef hash that my fiance ordered for us to split came out on a cast iron skillet and it was COLD.  here is the deal:  either this was not freshly prepared or it was not heated to proper temperature before serving it to us.  we waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged and waited like 6 minutes for the food to come out.

Spending most of our time in Ohio City and being from around the neighborhood we've always wanted to give this place a go and I'll say this right now - not impressed.  

I'm not going to talk about the decor or the ambiance - that has nothing to do with my review.  It was strictly a lack of good service and terrible food that weighed in on this review and as much as I wanted to like it, I just couldn't.

We tried the Natin (coconut ground pork w. crispy rice) - not too bad but not something I think I would order again.  For my meal I had the khmer bunn and again, not impressed.  To be frank, the flavors of this dish were not pleasing to my palette and in all honesty, I can't really even remember specific details about what it was I didn't like - it left that little impression on me.  The bf ordered something with beef and asked for hot, and hot he got.  So hot, in fact, that he was having a hard time eating it and this is not a guy who can't handle spicy foods.  The flavor of this dish far surpassed mine but you couldn't enjoy it because the heat was just way too overpowering.  So beware - you want hot, your mouth will get it. 

I really want to give this place another shot - I feel like it has a lot of potential and maybe I just need to find that one dish that blows my socks off.  But until I do, I'm stuck at 2 stars.

P.S. on the plus side, this place is BYOB so you can at least wash down your food with some of your favorite adult bevies.",2013-05-01 15:03:25

I believe that ground animals are indeed a good thing. The more foreign the animal, the more intriguing and likely I will order it. Wvrst does this. They offer the ""coolest"" selection of sausages you can find.

Kangaroo, Guinea Fowl, Duck+Fois+Maple, Rabbit, Venison, Pheasant, etc.
There are tons to choose from, on a bun or curried. 
I had my Duck sausage with kraut and onions on a bun. However I did hear wonderful things about the curried option, which i will definitely try next time. Along with the sausage were my duck fat fries. Served with a side of rosemary/maple sauce. The combo is addictive. I would go back just for the fries, they are crispy, salty and delicious.

Their Wall of Beer is cool too. Probably over 10 taps sticking out of a wall beside the ordering counter. You can't miss it, its wide and stretches across end to end. The hall style restaurant/bar was very welcoming. I like this layout a lot and I can imagine holding larger parties here, reservations made two weeks prior at least.

Earl been wanting pasta, so at 3pm today, we decided to visit Sauce.  When we arrived, we see no cars, so we hesitated for a bit.  As we were walking toward the entrance, we saw a word doc taped to the door.  Earl assumed that they have moved.  But nope!  It's just letting guests know that they will be closed on Memorial Day.

We were greeted and walked to one of the booths by the bartender, who also took our order.  This restaurant is huge, with many tables and different dining area.

We chose the following:
-Tomato Basil Soup: Pretty good.  I would order this again.  Very hearty with croutons in them
-Arancini: The coating was too thick.  It was served on a bed of greens and marinara sauce.  Skip.
-Pasta is $16.50, you chose the sauce, the type of pasta (my hubby chose wheat penne, which cost an extra dollar), two toppings, and 1 free add on.

My angel hair pasta with pomodoro sauce (I had ordered Bolognese, but she placed pomodoro.  It's ok, because this turned out better), wild mushrooms, roasted garlic, and anchovies.  We both loved it.  I only killed 1/3 of this dish.  It was a lot of food.

My hubby got wheat penne with alfredo sauce, sun-dried tomato, roasted garlic, and prosciutto.  He loved it.

Service was definitely fast which was a good thing and they had items I havent seen at your typical Japanese ayce places. But it was hard to wave down a server and you would tell them one thing and they'd turn and leave but you had more to tell them.

Then three weeks ago, I bought a 2017 Mustang and had the worst experience ever. Even though the car was brand new, it had been a demo and had a paint gouge on the rear fender and some black dots (on a white car!) scattered over all the panels. The dealership assured me that they would take care of both problems ""in a couple of days"". Even before I drove off the lot in the new car, the timetable became, ""maybe a couple of weeks"". Eventually, they did a stellar job, but only after I called to remind them of these problems. The person I spoke to, the one who had told me that Peoria Ford would take care of everything, acted as though he knew nothing about my bringing the car back in for the cosmetic work. I was also assured that PF would pay for my rental car from Enterprise. Just today, Enterprise called me to say that they would be charging MY credit card $490! Also, it took PF a week to get me an Owner's Manual and a second key fob. 

Finally, on the day I bought the new Mustang, I had the ""old"" Mustang serviced because I was giving it to my husband. When I brought the car in, it was clean, having been washed three days earlier. When my husband was handed the keys, he couldn't, at first, figure out which car it was. At some point during the servicing, it must have been parked under an overhang that was dripping water. The entire car/windows were covered in streaks of mud. Complimentary car wash with every servicing? I had to ASK for it.

Fast forward to 2016, and oh my have things things fallen for this place....

To be honest, I was surprised that Caffe Demetre was still even open. When my friend and I had a sudden craving for ice-cream, we decided to check this place out...and was quickly reminded about why I probably stopped coming here so many years back. The dessert options here still suffice, but are pretty much just on par now with most other dessert places/cafes in terms of selection and quality...the service and management here though literally had me shaking my head.

We were actually surprised at how popular this place still is, but were fine waiting in a short line for our turn to be seated. What was a bit of a turn-off though was watching servers and the manager repeatedly walk right by empty tables (there were at least 3), without realizing it might be a good idea to quickly clean them off and actually seat some of the patrons standing in the growing and increasingly crowded line-up. At first I considered that perhaps they were understaffed, or busy with something else, until I noticed staff members literally just standing around and joking with each other. 

I do like how customers are able to customize their crepe/waffle topics - I went with the ""Roche"" ice-cream, with white-chocolate sauce and roasted nuts on a waffle, and it tasted great! What was much less great however was the $15 cost. $15 for a waffle and ice cream, really? 

The fact that the server got my order wrong TWICE, was also a bit frustrating...my friend was not pleased either with the glass of water that arrived at our table, as it was only about 1/4 filled, an looked as though it might have just been another customer's leftovers lol.

I don't know if this place recently changed management or not, but the lifeless expression on the face of our server screamed ""I hate my job.""

was totally satisfied with the quality of the beef ribs, sides and banchan.

I pull into a parking lot and pop the hood and there's a little bit of steaming. Freaked out, I walk to Meineke and ask if someone will check it out. A guy came out and asked me to pull it in so they could do a pressure test. He was like ""Hopefully its just a loose thermostat or hose!"" and therefore gave me hope. I wait as they hook up various machines and test. 20 minutes later the manager trudged up, shows me a vial of green liquid and says, ""Well, did the tests and your head gasket is blown."" !!! I was devastated as he tells me it'll cost over $2,000 to repair. ""Well I don't have that kind of cash right now so I'll have to think about this,"" I tell him. He's like ""Really? Yeah well if you want to sell it to me instead let me know.""

I drive home, scared my engine is about to blow, trying to figure a budget for a new car and stressed out! My neighbor comes over and wants to check it. ""OH...your radiator cap is loose and is spraying water and antifreeze on the engine."" He then proceeds to fill my car with 2 gallons of water and some antifreeze and tightened the cap.

Cheap, greasy, open late at night Mexican food should practically be a god given right. Food baby seekers look no further, just about anything from Roberto's is coma inducing (food and more) , and is the promised land for Mexican munchie heaven.

I heard through the grapevine (read: drunk guy waiting in line to order) that this first ever Roberto's to open in Vegas. While I can't be sure of how true that is, I am certain the place practically looks it. A total dive with a handful of tables and a counter for ordering, along with suspect odors permeating the air that make you question if that's food or just the bathroom door left ajar. I've been to much nicer Roberto's before, but the dodginess of the strip mall and shady parking lot are charming enough to keep me coming back.

Be it burritos, rolled tacos, or their infamous carne asada fries, all options here are a guarantee for satiating that hunger. The wet burritos are of worthy consideration and the enchiladas are plenty saucy, not to mention cheesy. Not to be confused with rich textural Mexican platos, Roberto's is more akin to junk food 2.0 with a little Mexican flair. Beware of too much crema, the back of your pants might just start whistling.

Over the years, the prices haven't changed much. Most items are in the $4-7 range unless you decide to go baller status and throw in a few camerones (shrimp) dishes which are as much as $12. Seafood isn't cheap in LV and Roberto's is no exception. Thank goodness they accept credit cards.

While I can't say I would recommend the tamales (dry, a bit of YMMV), I am definitely a sucker for their breakfast burrito. It's not too big, but it's hearty enough to pass for any sub 1,000 caloric breakfast item. Eggs are usually fluffy, the meat is solid, and the spiced out potatoes give an extra kick. For those of you who are back and forth with the meat selection, just know that machaca (shredded beef) is the way to go.

The food is delicious, and the service is superb. The prices are a tad high for the portions, though that's at least consistent with the theory of a restaurant next to a concert hall in a hotel in Las Vegas, so it's not a huge surprise.
I cannot recommend the sliders highly enough; they're fantastically delicious, and you can add on a couple extras if you're hungrier than the three or four or whatever's included by default for $9.99. The meatball ones were delightfully spiced--not overhot, just enough to make you feel it--and I probably ate more of them than I likely should've. I burned the calories off rocking out later in the evening, though, so it probably balanced out.
The beer selection is only so-so, especially when it comes to drafts. For Guinness or anything microbrewed, you'll need to go to a bottle, which can rack up the cost quickly when you're talking a 12-ounce bottle for seven dollars instead of a sixteen-ounce pint for about the same, but the food's worth it. Just make sure you have something to wash it down with.
The service was always great when we were in, though sometimes the cover bands they had playing weren't stellar. Maybe it's an unfair comparison from me, as I was there to see a professional band rocking their auditorium later that night and nothing was going to quite compare, but their Rockstar Karaoke where they have people sing in front of a live band was fun (or, alternatively, horrifying--after all, it *is* karaoke) to watch.

The food: Of course I got the chopped salad.  It's just fantastic, and I wish I lived closer to Scottsdale so that I could eat it on a regular basis (note to self: try to make my own at home....).  My entre was the filet (I got it both times I was there) and both times it was perfectly cooked.  For desert I shared the peanut butter brownie.  It was apparently voted the best desert of 2010 by Phoenix Magazine, but I wasn't overly impressed by it.  It was good, but not the best.  (the chopped salad would make a great desert)

Trying to get a table: the first time we had reservations, and no issues sitting a group of 9.  The second time, a Tuesday night this year, I failed to make a reservation because I didn't think it would be busy... it was a Tuesday night after all.  Well I had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  We finally got seated at 8pm.

So lesson learned, no matter what day of the week, just make a reservation... and get the chopped salad no matter what!

8.9.12 - Figured I should add more to my review.... I still love this restaurant and it is still my absolute favorite place to eat in Scottsdale.

My friends and I went here recently with an out of town guest.  Of course I got the chopped salad to start out with (sharing with a friend).  Still fantastic and a requirement if you ever go.  For dinner I had the pork chop.  I generally don't order pork chops and didn't really grow up eating them... whenever I had one before it was bland and dry.  Cowboy Ciao though made the best pork chop of my life.  A month later I'm still craving it.  It was about half an inch thick, perfectly cooked and juicy.  Amazing.

For desert we ordered a bunch of items.  The cobbler and the donuts were great and I ordered the ice cream sampler.  The flavors I chose were duck fat buttercream, smoked chocolate, and spicy caramel.  I think I was the only one who liked the smoked chocolate, but I also love the taste of liquid smoke.  The duck fat was the most unusual and the least favorite.  Left a weird after taste.  The caramel was good, but not spicy enough.

Don't get me wrong, I love cold beets so I ate them but I was completely thrown by the description. 

The bartender was mostly MIA (there was a basketball game on so I guess that made focusing hard). When he was around, he was very nice and pleasant but hard to flag down. It was also not busy, less than half full, for a Saturday so I was pretty disappointed with the food and service.

I am really sorry it took me so long to make my way in to check you out, but you were totally worth the wait!  I literally felt like a kid in a candy store when I walked in.  I didn't know where to start... all of your merchandise is so fun!  I made my way around solo at first, and then Julia, who by the way was dressed super cute in a colorful outfit, gave me a tour as well.  

I escaped without breaking the bank, although it took some major willpower.  For $17.21 out the door, I bought a handmade chocolate filled cherry candy cane, a tin of egg nog flavored bubblegum, a bag of sugar free cinnamon cubbies, and a unique duck pen that lights up and quacks!  Other things that I may have to return for in the near future:
-Hello Kitty stuff... lots of it!
-Stickers, stickers, and more stickers
-caramel corn
-lunchboxes
-all kinds of candy
-fun baking accessories including really cool cupcake liners
-so much more!

While I was there, I noticed other shoppers enjoying themselves just as much, if not more than me... both kids and adults.  Sweets, Treats, & Novelty Items - there is something at Smeeks for everyone!

It may have taken me a few months to make my way in, but I'll be back again soon, Smeeks.  After just one visit, you've become my go-to candy boutique!

Sincerely,

Gabi",2009-11-24 04:34:39

They did not disappoint! The chocolate ganache cake was to die for and I'm not even a chocolate lover. A day later I'm trying to figure out who has a birthday next so that I can order them a cake to try other flavours.

The service was also top notch. So friendly, knowledgeable and easy to work with. If I could assign a bonus star I would. I would hands down recommend Brulee to anyone looking for cakes and pastries for any occasion.",2011-11-13 21:35:51

This is one sad mall.

Can you really argue against this point? A shopping mall whose two main anchor stores are Costco and Wal-Mart? WTF? The food court of this mall? It's Costco's $1 dogs and pizza! What should be inside Costco is now food for the unmembered masses. 

The Costco itself deserves an extra star since it's conveniently on my way home, and I see a Target ready to open soon, but that just means this is a mall made up of big box stores, a Big 5 sporting goods store where a paranoid employee is eyeballing everyone as a potential shoplifter, recruiting stations for all the armed services, a JC Penny's which doesn't really count as much of anything and the saddest merchant islands I've ever seen.

You think I'm kidding about these sad merchant islands. Just walk from one end of the mall to the other. The cell phone guy? He's sad. The Indian lady selling cheap jewelry? She's sad. The guy hawking life insurance? He's sad. The two army recruiters? Hell, even they look sad. 

What a glum-ass place to be.

Had there not been a Costco, I'd have no reason to ever set foot in here. It seriously is competing with MetroCenter as the ghetto-est mall in Phoenix (although a buddy of mine who grew up here tells me the ghetto-est of all lies on Thomas way out in the west side somewhere, but I'm not so sure about that, because I saw three different ladies come from outside the mall with 64 oz Big Gulp cups, walk up to the Costco food court soda fountain, help themselves to 64 more ounces of high fructose corn syrup, and walk right back out. Seems pretty ghetto to me.)

NuTiwT6pTaqKofi_RP4y3w,ymCk-L8o6WFbCCMK7uCkXA,KWojrEKjUqHCRI5HO7pB4g,4,7,6,7,"I went to the AGO this past Sunday and spent about 3 hours there.  

ART WORK
I am a person who doesn't really care for modern art so floors 4 and 5 were not too much of interest.  Floor 3 is usually reserved for special events/exhibitions so I skipped down to the 2nd and 1st floor for European and Canadian Art.

If you have the same interest as me, I would suggest you take the elevators up to the 5th floor and walk down the stairs after each floor (mind you, you have to take the elevators to skip from the 4th to 2nd as they don't allow you to walk through the 3rd).  This way you can use the crazy stairs that protrude outside of the building and not use so much energy b/c you're walking down the stairs, not up. It's a great view and the concept of realizing that there is nothing underneath you is a bit thrilling.  One stairwell is better than the other so look out for that. I spent most of my time on floors 1 and 2.

FAVOURITE EXHIBITS
1. Stretch (on the 5th floor) Someone uploaded a picture on Yelp so take a look
2. The group of seven - The artwork from these artists are beautiful and looking at them gave me a sense of pride as they are world famous Canadian artist from the 1920's.  Also, we studied them in public school so it gave me somewhat of a nostalgic feeling.
3. Henry Moore - is a famous sculptor. I remember seeing his work at the AGO when I was a child and the same sculptures are still there.  Toronto also has 2 more of his sculptures. 1 is outside of the AGO and one is at City Hall.

SPECIAL TREATS
On Sundays, they have mini concerts/entertainment on the ground floor.  Unfortunately I didn't know about them but I was able to get a picture of ropes climber (see pictures). They also had a pianist and violinist perform earlier in the day.  So check that out every Sundays.

COST
I still feel the AGO is a bit expensive for young adults. $18/adult which amounts to almost $40 for a date.  That's 4hrs of work for a person earning minimum wage. Therefore I personally wouldn't go to the AGO every month per se.  But as a NPO, I can understand why the charge those prices.  It just doesn't help me.  

Also for the special exhibits such as the King Tut (which is displaying now until April 18, 2010), they are quite costly. I think it cost $32 to get into the King Tut Exhibit and I HEARD (don't know for sure) that the main artifacts of interest such as the famous ""burial mask"" is kept in Egypt. And apparently you can only stay in the exhibit for a limited time (1/2hr it has been rumoured). So please check on this before you buy the ticket.

But if there is any consolation, the AGO has this magnificent statue outside of the museum which is a great photo op. (see pictures)

I always have a nice time at the AGO and if you haven't yet paid a visit, I would suggest that you do. The renovations were beautifully done.   Just be careful where you sit. My friend and I accidentally sat on artwork and security shooed us away. But really....it looked like a bench.",2009-12-08 19:57:47

The decor is pretty simple and gets the job. There are anime canvas posters on the wall and anime window poster shade things on the side. The girls who work here dress like maids and have typical anime girl hair, adds well to the overall theme of the restaurant. 

They were nice, but their service needs a little bit of fine tuning. Waitress came by and read us the drinks on the menu, and when we said water she took away the menu without giving us a chance to take a look. They seem like nice girls though.

Now to the important part, FOOD!

I will be comparing the food to Monta a lot because.. it is the one to beat.

Definitely not on the same level as Monta and ramen is slightly more expensive (@ $8/bowl). The way that they serve the ramen was interesting, had a spoon that lays perfectly on the side of the bowl, but the soup is filled only to the height of the noodles. Personally I prefer my noodles to be ""drowned"" in soup. The miso ramen was somewhat bland, but with the increase in price they do come with a few extra amenities like half an egg and corn. Tonkotsu ramen soup was less salty than Monta, but didn't deliver. The pork that is served is also thinner than Monta's. I had no problem with the noodles since they were cooked al dente. Lastly the gyoza was okay, the taste did not compensate for its smaller size @ $5/plate.

At this time they don't take any credit cards other than Master (weird) unless you're paying with debit. 

I will probably come back in the future to try the chicken wings, but I'm in no rush to come back.",2011-09-19 22:36:09

I went through a lot of trouble to get here (I also stupidly tried to get to Caesars palace from Flamingo which apparently is ok if you're in a limo or are VIP),  and just for a coffee. I found their coffee offering is limited, only five espresso drinks. I had a mocha with Parisienne flavoring, which is mainly dark chocolate. It was good, not too rich but definitely flavorful. It woke me up and I'm ready to roll on some work again. I also tried the caramel marshmallows if only because it took me so damn long to find it. I didn't understand why they kept them refrigerated until I bit into one, the cool temperature of caramel and chocolate swam right over a warm, fluffy bed of marshmallow.

I ordered the pho tai and a Vietnamese iced coffee. Veggies brought out were stingy (literally, a single sprig of cilantro on what was to be shared between 2). The beef was overcooked and I could taste it in the otherwise bland broth. 

My pho judgment is based on how much I have to doctor up the broth. Maybe it is because I was raised on Southern Vietnamese tastes, but I squeezed 5 or 6 pieces of lime and two spoonfuls of hoison sauce and it still was very ""meh."" That's relative to the 2 lime pieces and maybe a small squirt of hoison I add at either at home or other Vietnamese spots. Oh, and I also got charged the same price for a small bowl for a regular bowl.

My iced coffee also was pre-brewed. Perhaps another cost saving measure, but it was much heavier on the French coffee side than the condensed milk side.

I was so excited to be there after all the reviews I read on Yelp and the hype my friends created. However, both me and my friend felt this place is overrated after finishing our tacos. Here are more details.

The interior is definitely different from a regular restaurant in Pittsburgh. I remember visiting restaurants with this dimly lit, sophisticated themed interior when I visited New York city. Maybe part of the hype is due to the interior. Our server was nice and the service was quick though the place was packed. 

We started with Papas Bravas - fried potatoes served over tomatoe sauce and topped with roasted garlic mayo and green onions. These are definitely the best fried potatoes that I had in a while and it was a good quantity for 2 people. I highly recommend this one. It also has a nice aroma when they bring it to your table. 

For entree, we ordered 2 varieties of tacos - Pollo Asado and Shishito. Pollo Asado is lime marinated chicken taco served with avacado and other garnishing items. I did not find any lime flavor in the chicken. It is bland and lacked seasoning for my preference. My friend like the Shishito tacos, but again I did not get the well seasoned flavor profile I was expecting. I wish they offered a wedge of lime on the side for the tacos. 

For dessert, we ordered tres leches. I had tres leches in the past and it was way softer and fluffier than the ones I had here. However, the taste is good. Not too sweet and it is good quantity for the price. Entire plate screamed holiday theme with a heavy pumpkin spice flavor.

ccMjIhz5grlqfRe5VEdNaA,ZVu9TDpTvIgCN8x6IY-KmA,Y_WNd6vSY55dti7mJoqvBA,3,4,1,1,"The Locker Room is a little tough to review... it probably represents a number of different things to different people.  To me, it has always been an out of the way (obscure) place to grab lunch.  I've never been here other than at lunch time on a week day, so my frame of reference is somewhat limited. I suspect that during the evenings and on weekends, it is a completely different vibe.

The Locker Room is in a little strip center on S. Tryon (Hwy. 49), just below the Woodlawn/Billy Graham Parkway intersection.... across from the Embassy Suites.  It is a dark (dimly lighted) place that reminds me of pubs in the northeast.  It is definitely a Steelers fan haven.  They've been here for years... I've been coming here on occasion for probably ten years or more.

A modest sized bar, a bunch of booths, and a good sized game room in the back.  A true sports bar... not a place that just put up a bunch of flat screens and calls themselves a sports bar.  This place is 100% sports, 100% of the time.  I have no knowledge of this, but based on the vibe, I bet if you wanted to place a wager on a game, you could find a way to do it here.

The menu is surprisingly diverse.  Not gourmet by any stretch, but decent, and the quality is good.  Not limited to just the ""typical bar fare"" of burgers, wings and nachos.  I don't go here often, but when I do, I usually have the open-faced roast beef sandwich, and today I was able to get it with mashed potatoes, which was a side intended for the special of roast turkey.

Service is always good, and friendly.  The other patrons can be interesting and funny (in a positive way).  A great place to come if you wanted to have a quiet and/or private lunch where a confidential conversation could be held.  No one would bat an eyelash if you had a couple beers or a few martinis with lunch... which I never do.",2009-12-03 19:07:31

Likes: 
-Dumplings are cheap and delicious. You get 15 for 5.99 and they are huge.  Some are slightly more expensive (e.g. lamb is 7.99).
-They have 20 or so different kinds of dumplings.
-Big menu with 100+ items

Dislikes:
-Dumplings are only prepared by one person so it takes around 15-20 minutes to arrive.  
-Their other non-dumpling dishes are fairly small for a Chinese restaurant
-No XLB (soup dumplings)

Verdict: overall, I still like this place and I think it's a great place for those who want traditional Chinese dumplings, great choice. If you would rather have anything but dumplings, there are better choices in Mississauga. #Dumpling love",2015-07-07 23:56:35

The place obviously uses high-quality ingredients and has some nice ideas on the menu, but the cooking is a bit sloppy, and the atmosphere wasn't for me.  I'll give it another try when I have a hangover - maybe that's the right fit.

Went here with the wife & toddler on a Saturday morning.  

Food
---------------------------
I had the Wolfpack - Eggs, Cheese, Bacon sandwiched between layers of hashbrowns - and a slice of french toast.  The wife had blueberry pancakes and bacon, and chocolate chip pancakes for the little one.  2 coffees, an OJ, and an apple juice ($35 before tax/tip - mildly high for breakfast).  

My wolfpack was generally yummy, but the eggs were a total disappointment.  A place called Over Easy should be able to make eggs over easy, right?  Nope.  Fried egg (no sign of liquidity or even softness in the yolk).  The french toast was made of an obviously high-quality brioche, but hardly battered and neither soaked nor cooked through.  Bummer - woulda been really good :-(.  The blueberry pancakes were tasty, but one was uncooked - literally cut in and watch batter run out.  Bacon was thick, high-quality, cooked nicely, and generally good, but nothing special.

Service
---------------------------
No real wait and seated fairly promptly, if clumsily.  Hostess was pleasant, but seemed a bit confused/frazzled.  Server was prompt.  We did not have any issues, but the staff seemed, frankly, a bit depressed.  Not a lot of smiles except from two guys apparently expediting (looked like brothers - maybe owners family?).

Atmosphere:  
---------------------------
This is probably someone's lifestyle or keep-the-kids-busy business.  It's a relatively small dining room - not sure if they use the connected area (a sister place called 18 Degrees) for breakfast - with small octagonal white tile - Who uses white tile in a restaurant?  I'm sure they mop every night, but it was looking like a public restroom floor when we got there.  The decor is sort of retro/weathered, but just looked confused.  The staff was made up  of mostly young servers/bussers wearing simple company t-shirts and jeans (some of the ladies wore shorts).  The male staff was noticeably unkempt (maybe that's just fashionable these days) with long, uncombed haircuts that had you looking for hair in your plate.  Lots 3-day shadows with untucked shirts and ripped jeans - with the notable exception the aforementioned expediters - one of whom wore a red shirt (all other staff in black) and a hat.  Interesting.  Noticeably, most of the staff seemed a bit down (not bad, just low energy, not having fun) - with the exception of the two brothers who seemed to be having a good time - but not exactly working a lot.  It really doesn't seem like a for-profit business to be honest.  I suspect it's a great place to be when hungover.",2012-07-03 20:45:30

For around $9, you can get half-serving of katsu curry. You literally get half a cutlet and some curry. Cutlet was nothing special. I'm not one of those people who over-lace their rice with curry, and I still ran out of curry.

The main dishes were larger than I expected. Each was a full plate full of food. The General Tso's Chicken was a little sweet. The sauce had a nice texture.

They used to be located on Rural and Elliot, but have moved to this new location in the past year. The space is big, open and modern; with high ceilings, minimal furniture and modern art, it makes for a very relaxing vibe. We arrived at 6:30 on a Thursday night, and while the place wasn't completely full, most of the tables were occupied. Our waitress came by and took our beverage order, and then gave us some time to look over the menu. And time she gave us, because it seemed like it was 10 minutes before she finally returned; they must have been understaffed that night, because it was just her and one other waitress covering the whole restaurant, so we decided not to get to upset by this.

When she finally did return to take our order, she couldn't have been more pleasant; answering our random questions and suggesting items on the menu. We got the Thai Rolls and some Tom Kha Gai to start.. The rolls were cooked to a nice, golden, crunchy brown, but they were seriously lacking in the veggie department. The plum sauce was good, but they are probably not something that I would recommend for anyone to order.

I absolutely love Tom Kha Gai soup, but almost every Thai restaurant that I go to doesn't offer just a single serving bowl of it, they get all fancy and serve it in these giant silver urns, so I rarely end up ordering it. When I saw that I was able to order just a bowl of the soup, I knew that I had to give this version a try. Well, I have to say, this was the best version I have ever had; it had a touch of heat, mixed with the cool coconut and lime leaves, it was heavenly. My sister had never tried this kind of soup, so I scooped some into a bowl for her and she too thought that it was really good. The flavors were so well balanced, that I really could have eaten a giant urn full of this version!

I got the Pad Thai as my main dish....it was AMAZING!!!  The best pad thai I have had to date; sweet and spicy and just all around great.  I was impressed by how un-greasy it was, my only disappointment with it was that it came with just 2 shrimp!

Last weekend I wasn't able to get into Noble Beast so stopped at a pet store in North Phoenix (off 67th Ave and the 101) and was fleeced on food. Same items at this store cost me $20 more than at Noble Beast.

I also like the Wag N Wash, but unless you can catch one of the brothers, their staff changes too often. Noble Beast is consistently good. I trust the people who work there and they appreciate their customers.

Regular service: so far so good...no scorpions in my house this summer yet! Last summer I counted 22 scorpions INSIDE my house during the hot months...(not all at once). The summer before that I counted 18 scorpions INSIDE...and stung by one in my bed!

They only just opened two weeks ago! We were just walking by when we saw a little boy inside eating a piece of Cheetos and gas coming out of his mouth- that definitely lured us in! It's called Frozen Breath, if you wanted to give it a try.

The girl working there was very nice and took the time to talk to us and explain the concept of their ice-cream. It's cool that you're able to see all the steps they take to make the ice-cream in front of you. When the ice-cream is ready, the girl proceeds to pour more liquid nitrogen overtop- both a perfect photo-op and cool to see! 

We tried the original chocolate flavour, and it tasted light and creamy. It was less dense than store-bought tubbed ice-cream. The chocolate flavour tasted pretty typical and wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I liked that the ice-cream was really cold, but at the same time some parts of it were really really hard (too icy?) and hard to scoop with a plastic spoon.

It was a COOL experience and fun to watch, but overall the ice-cream wasn't anything extraordinary and not worth the $5.50+tax for that small scoop. Don't think I'd be returning any time soon.",2016-09-05 00:13:49

Never had bad service or food 4 that matter, but notice a marked improvement each time I visit. We decided 2 visit as the previous day we missed dining here on account of their hours (which I think is pretty ingenious). I'm sure they get a good portion of their business due 2 the fact they close @ 2pm, (unless it's fri open till 8p 4 dinner) so if u snooze u lose! Places like Denny's that r open 24/7 r probably put on the back burner by people that like them because u can go anytime & they'll always b there (except 4 the loc8ions that have shut down).

   I remember back in the day this property used 2 b a bar (named Last Call or something 2 that effect) w/ a weird shaped roof 2 look like a sports arena & there were a few Xs when near accidents almost occurred as drunkards leaving there were almost turned in2 speed~bumps staggering across the road right in2 traffic, oblivious 2 any danger. Glad that's long gone & now replaced by a 60's style place that puts 5 & Diner 2 shame & probably had something 2 do w/ the L8 Nifty 50's & Ed Debevic's being out of business as far as Gr8 pricing 4 Better food w/ Generous portions. 

   1derful classic look decor w/ black & white tiled bar & funny themed signs/collectables throughout. When u come in, make sure u stand a li'l 2 the right (not enough 2 fall in a diner's lap) but enough where u can b seen 2 b seated as their busy tending 2 patrons inside unless u opt 4 grabbing a spot @ the bar top. Their windows have been upgraded 2 the frosted logo/design which helps keep u from cooking while w8ing on ur grub & the bright sun out of ur eyes while staying cooler, Nice!

   Service can b w/ a smile or none depending on who u get as ur w8ress but never had bad & would gladly take their worst over what we went thru @ Kiss the Cook!! I also like witnessing other servers helping out other tables w/ refills, clearing pl8es etc which made us wanna tip them 2 (since they were actually friendlier than our w8ress) but hey, she didn't bark @ us or fling our pl8es like frisbees either so I can handle non~smiling (better than being nause8ingly fake/phony if not naturally 'nice').

   Gr8 lamin8ed menus w/ breakfast on 1 side/lunch on the other & I dig the novel concept of the booth tables w/ local places advertising their business/services (actually jotted down a few of interest 4 future reference). What was ordered: a Veggie omelette chock full of spinach, tomato, onion, mushroom, broccoli florets topped w/ sliced avocado, hash browns, a crispy on the outside fluffy inside waffle w/ all natural syrup, an AMAZING Banana Muffin (shoulda got 2), texas style toast w/ grape & mixed berry jelly, perfect no lumps grits w/o being soupy, & apple juice. EVERYTHING was DIvine in complimentary flavors, textures, freshness & portion!!

   What woulda made this 5*? Bring back your AWESOME Bread Pudding we planned on sharing, that YUMMiness was the *Bomb* & we were disappointed not 2 get slightly tipsy from the bourbon or whatever it was made w/. Perhaps that's why they removed it from the menu/no longer offer it. Can see it now: 'No officer, I haven't had anything 2 drink, I just came from that diner & all I had was some bread pudding!'

It's a dark and dingy place where you should be prepared to show your ID. Drinks of course are typical.

The fried cheese curds were fantastic and decently priced (truly the star of the show). Burger was also delicious (just a note that tomato and lettuce are extra). The ribs special was really disappointing though (definitely made better at home). Tasted like pork slathered in sauce. The onion rings were decent and crispy (the batter was kind of thick though).

There are a ton of stores with a wide variety of goods that they sell. This mall is always packed. Opening at 9:30 to 9:30, you can go do all you shopping here.

There are plenty of decent stores that you can hit up to get some good clothes. However, they don't have the high end retailers that can be found on Michigan Ave in Chicago or 5th Ave in NYC. They do have an Armani Exchange but don't actually have a Georgio Armani nor Emporio Armani. Not to mention Louis Vuitton, Versace, Zegna, Gucci, etc that can be found in Chicago or NYC. Hell. They don't even have a Neiman Marcus.

What they do have are stores that sell towards the not so high end people. The Abercrombie's, A&E, Banana Republic, etc. There are some very good stores too if you want to drop more money. There's even a GNC here too.

If you go here with a girl, plan on staying here for the entire day because girls will literally check out every store, look at every dress, every shoe, every piece of clothing, then decide that they don't anything here or it's too expensive or you don't want to pay for it, then they'll go to the next store.

Enter my quest on just-eat.ca to find something for us that was vegan and would deliver to my neighbourhood!

I had heard about Flipp'n Burgers and we decided to order a couple vegan burgers and sweet potato fries! I was very impressed by the amount of toppings available. Our delivery arrived right on schedule despite the weather (thank you delivery driver for being rad and existing). 

Upon opening up our take out containers, we felt a little confused initially (as were the kitchen staff apparently) because our toppings were a little mismatched from what we ordered. Luckily, both were still completely vegan so I was happy to eat it either way. I had to throw out the generic ""aoli"" every restaurant seems to give out even when I specify it's no use to me, but the yam fries were fine. 

Was very impressed by the vegan burger itself and the quick delivery, as well as the cute bottles our sodas came in. Would like to stop in and check out the decor and stuff in the future, though I'm rarely in the Kensington area around dinnertime! Will order again :)",2014-01-08 04:41:54

She stopped to chat a few times while we were waiting on food and then after it had came. I got the sloppy burger with a side of their homemade fries and goatcheese ranch. SUPERB and hit the spot. Those pretzel rolls? THE BOMB! My friend ordered a French burger that came with tomatoes and melted brie... it was out of this world!

I have heard nothing but good things about Fran's-and I have nothing but good things to say. I cannot WAIT to try there again-and will hopefully have a better experience with a now trained server :)

She has specials, and of course-the burgers. I was floored. I could only eat half of mine but every bite was divine, cheesy and meaty goodness. Ahhhhhh. Oh-and the tea was so deliciously strong, perfect on a warm and sunny afternoon!",2012-04-09 22:13:28

*The tacos are reasonably priced. They have taco tuesday where its $8 for 3 tacos

-Chips + Guac with Mexican Coke and Pineapple Jarritos
The chips were lightly salted which went well with the smooth and creamy guac. However I do prefer my guac to have a bit more lime and good chunks of avocado to give it more texture.

-Chorizo Taco
The chorizo was seasoned perfectly - slightly spicy but not in a burning hot sensation. A hint of saltiness from the tangy queso fresco went well with the chorizo and the pico de gallo added that dose of freshness to the taco. The flavor really can't be beat, and it's definitely a must try if you haven't already.

-Baja Fish Taco
fish was lightly breaded and still able to hold its shape. ! I appreciated how they kept the taco refreshing by not drenching the slaw in dressings and the fish was not oily at all. To blend everything together, just squeeze some lime juice and it was pretty much one of the best fish taco I have ever had in Toronto so far.

-Chicken Hermanos Taco
The shredded chicken with a super sweet and spicy sauce all nestled between corn tortillas with a sprinkle of sharp red onions. Topped it all off with some juicy and sweet pineapple to tone down the heat. Are you drooling?  I'm drooling.

-Tofu Taco
Since they used firm tofu, the small bits of crunchy tofu added a nice texture to each bite and I found the overall taco to be quite sweet? I was hoping for more spices or other toppings to balance the sweetness. Tien and I decided to add their house special sauce for more flavor and oh boy, it was HOT. Later we found out it was habanero hot sauce.. so add it in moderation :)!

-Barbacoa Taco
I found the beef to be quite tough and chewy, not ""fork tender"" like what I would expected from being braised for a long time. I also thought the beef was not as flavorful as others, but I really liked the fresh pico de gallo. 

-Pulled Pork Taco
On the other hand this taco was just..ohmygosh-so-good-bursting-with-all-the-flavors-pulled-pork. The meat was soft, succulent, juicy and had that ""fall-off-the-bone"" texture. Slathered in a delicious BBQ sauce and topped it off with some crunchy slaw - It. Was. Magnificent.

-Churros
Nothing beats a fresh, still-warm churro, with its crisp outer shell exploding with cinnamon sugar and soft, chewy inside that helps balance the cinnamon sugar sweetness with a light saltiness. I also loved how both the chocolate and caramel sauce had a mild sweetness to it - which was quite dangerous as I finished 2 churros in one seating .. oops.",2016-03-23 14:51:33

d49LeG0lojU7_GIqZnhuKg,OM7G4pA1H1VKr92CCS6meg,ODTI9W7fHMKNWZ3g8VcFUg,3,8,2,2,"I think my love affair with Mallorca is over. I used to come here all the time, but let me give you the rundown on why I think we've grown apart and why I would prefer to spend my $$$ elsewhere.

No valet last night but we got a spot in the lot for free which was great.

It feels fancy inside. It was a nice excuse for date night and to get dressed up a bit.  

As soon as we entered there were lots of friendly movements to take our coats and offer us to our table.  They knew us by the reservation, and even knew who we were when I called to confirm they were open during an ice storm.

We had an expiring groupon that we had to use, and studded snow tires, nothing holding us back.

It was 830 and not many people were there. There were two people at the bar we knew, (love Pittsburgh's two degrees of separation) and only two tables were seated in the restaurant.

I spotted at least 6 waitstaff in their spiffy black vests milling around.

First thing I liked/didn't like. The waiter rattled off a huge list of appetizer and entree specials. This was both impressive and annoying at the same time. We couldn't remember half the list, but it would take too long to repeat. A printed copy would have been better.

The Sour dough bread was very tasty, nice crust / soft middle, could have been a bit better if warmer. the butter was lame.... peel away butter pats, like you'd see at the likes of Eat N Park. they were frustratingly difficult to open and not enough butter inside to make the effort worth it. Maybe good for dieting but not to go with the bread.

Other Portuguese restaurants have good honey butters or at least a nice dish to scoop out butter. For the expense of this place, I expect more.

We had a Premier France Champagne that wasn't bad for $32.  It was less expensive than the least expensive sparkling wine. 

They were a bit over the top regarding pouring of the champagne. I love a good show, but it took a while, and it held up another waiter waiting to serve us our  stuffed mushrooms and calamari.  

Finally, a third waiter pulled the adjoining table together so that we could receive our appetizers and didn't have to get rid of bread or salad plates.

The Calamari breading had a wonderful light crispness to it, but sadly they were super tough and chewy inside. 

The mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat were good but not super exciting. But the sauce was really good with the sour dough.

Unfortunately, the head waiter/manager came over and took my bread plate away while I was mid bite. I was too confused to realize he was taking it away altogether, it still had food on it, he was super quick and never asked me if I was finished. 

They were just seating a new table for two, no reason to rush, and we now had an extended table, so why? It left me with no plate to put my share of the tough calamari or mushrooms on. Luckily I was with my husband we share, what if it were a first date?

Adam really liked the sauce on his steak. If you have had the steak years ago, it's changed to a Portuguese style sirloin with two eggs and lots of garlic slivers.  I miss the old, but this newer version was good.

We were both happy with the perfectly blanched veggies. 

My Wild Boar Osso Bocca literally fell off the bone and was very tasty.

When the head guy asked how things were, I felt moved to be truthful but not in a bitchy way. we said how everything was lovely but that the calamari was super tough and chewy. He said he'd tell the chef but nothing came of it.

Adam had the Plain cheese cake,  not overly sweet and he loved that the focus was on the good tasting cheesecake

My Creme Brûlée was a treat with a nice crispy cover and a good custard.

The cappuccinos were a good finish to a nice meal. 

And they didn't have the surprise shot of that yummy liquor that I remembered. 

It's been a few years. maybe it's not just Mallorca that has changed. Maybe it's me. 

Was it worth $100 (not including the wine)?

No.

It's a nice show, but Pittsburgh has changed too and I think there are enough fine dining restaurants now that they need to up their game to get my attention.",2015-01-30 12:25:48

The difference is real.  The prices here are lower than Saigon Bay but the portions are smaller and the flavor isn't to my liking.  Both have competent waitstaff and plenty of parking.

I went to both days and must say that I think day one was a bit more fun (it was rainy and dreary which made the lines a little less intense and the food a little more satisfying (IMO). One of my faves from day one (and the winner of my day one Yelpee award for best overall performance and best dessert) was Gertrude's ... OMG they had a 'cookies and milk' play that was some kind of delicious ice cream on top of chocolate soup of sorts.....I LOVED that. Other honorable mentions include: Davanti Enoteca (full portions of pork sandwiches au jus.....ridiculously tasty and the smell was out of this world), the tiramisu from North, the ice cream sandwich from Churn (mint ice cream FTW), the whoopie pie from Whoopie Baking Company (seriously the best wp I have ever had...yum), and the short rib ravioli from Federal Pizza (When they had it again on day two I was doing a little happy dance, this ravioli was good...creamy cheese with amazing melty short rib in pasta...how could you go wrong? I was really turned off to FP, but now I am turned on once again! (TWSS)). 

Day two was a beautiful sunny day in Phoenix, but also made for longer lines and more crowding. The crowd became close to unbearable in the back by Kai. I'm not sure why they had Kai and J&G and a couple of the other sought after booths all in the same section, but the crowd was completely insane. When I finally made it up to the Kai booth, the food wasn't even THAT amazing, but I'm glad I got to taste it before paying for it. Kai had a funky cheese 'cake,' Foie gras mousse (this was off putting....everyone around me thought so too), and a delicious creme brulee (that I have a feeling was not creme, but something much fancier). They served their food in cute reusable dish wear, but only had ONE recycle station that was completely engulfed in the mob of a line that was around Kai. Needless to say, a lot of the adorable glass bottles and bamboo spoons were left on the tables in that section.

 Ok, on to my own personal Yelpee awards for day two: Best overall performance- Different Pointe of View for their Venison. Holy mother of someone..... this was so flippin delicious. The meat was the most tender meat I have had in a very long time. The polenta cake was amazing. The personal talk with the employees at the booth was even great. I never wanted to go to their restaurant, and now I definitely do, so bravo to them! The winner of best dessert goes to Kai for their delish creme brulee thingy (although they definitely get the winner of most pretentious booth with the biggest crowd sooo...). Honorable mentions go out to: Short leash...always delicious, friendly, and personable (Thanks Brad and Kate!), J&G - their steak with the cheese ball was really good, my only issue was the steak was super rare for me, but the flavor was great, House of Tricks - their duck soup was my second favorite dish overall of the day, so yummy with an awesome play on flavor and texture, Federal Pizza's short rib ravioli (again), Barrio Cafe (always delicious...this was no exception), and (surprisingly) the vegan salad from Brat house was very fresh and delicious. 

The Yelpee for best drink? Definitely the cucumber concoction from Windsor...I drank too many of these. 


Ok, Ok, this is all nice, but there are a few things that can be improved upon for this event next year including: Consider the lay out of the restaurants to include some lesser known or less desirable restaurants near the big draws to reduce the crowding in certain areas, make announcements of some kind when the demos start (maybe they did, but I didn't hear it and the one demo I went to started 20 minutes late so we were all sitting there like wtf for 20 minutes), put out recycle bins, don't make us carry one wine glass around all day so we don't have two hands to eat the food with....or provide one of those nifty wine glass slings or trays with the glass, and (I never ever thought I would say this but....) make the portion sizes smaller! Yes, I did say smaller. I had full plates of food being passed out by some of the vendors (*cough* chelsea's kitchen and Davanti*cough*...in fact, I didn't even try Chelsea's kitchen because I knew I wouldn't want that whole plate and didn't want to waste it). I love getting a big plate of food, but when there are 30+ places to try, I felt guilty wasting a ton of food due to either not liking the item or just being too full to eat that much. I bet at least 5000$ worth of food was just thrown away over the weekend due to large portion sizes. If the restaurants gave out a bite or two each, that would be perfect and reduce all of the waste (and allow people to go back and try their favorites again without being WAY too stuffed to do so). Overall, this event was amazing and I will attend next year again!",2013-03-11 14:43:34

The view is nice as is the ambiance, although there was a large dinner meeting going on (group of about 20 business men at one long table) which got a bit loud at times.  The Groupon gave us a 5 course dinner with sake.  The carafe of sake was served warm and really quite tasty.  We started with miso soup which was one of the better miso soups I have had at a restaurant.  Next was the mandarin and almond ginger salad which was the usual iceberg lettuce salad and ginger dressing elevated a bit with the mandarin slices and some toasted almonds.  The sushi course was 4 California rolls and 6 pieces of sashimi (tuna, salmon, and some white fish), so  decent size.  The California rolls were pretty good and the sashimi was nice size pieces and cut pretty thick, not the usual small thin pieces you would expect.  For the entre course, I had the beef which was 2 skewers which were good quality meat and not over cooked and with a tasty sauce.  This was accompanied with seasonal veggies and rice.  Dessert was a scoop of either green tea or ginger ice cream.  This was the usual small scoop you expect topped with a strawberry.

This was my first visit to the actual bakery, whereas I usually get the treats when my husband brings something home.

The was a bit surprised by the size of Choux a la Creme, but oh it was so heavenly! It's a generous dessert size treat (you could probably split it via twisting it like an Oreo). The filling has a nice creamy mouth feel, with the slightest hint of vanilla. The choux dough was nice and crisp several hours after picking it up. The flecks of the vanilla bean were easily seen, which was a nice surprise.

In fact, it almost seems to reduce the care and attention paid to guests, or at least to me. I visit Calgary as often as every month, and on all but one of my stays, I've stayed at Hotel Arts. And without fail two things happen:

1. The front of house staff thinks it's my first visit, because they always inquire. Isn't it written right there on the computer that I've been there before? I guess not, because after the first visit where I was upgraded (read my first review) and someone came in, turned down the sheets and gave me complimentary water, I haven't received anything more than downgrades.

2. Every time, since the first time, I've been put on the second (read second class) floor. The floor with frosted glass half windows because it's too close to the street. The floor that's down a level off of the elevator. The rooms with no desk chairs. The room that has caused a tradition for me - to crank up some tunes and do a happy dance just to usher away the depression that sets in the moment I walk into my Hotel Arts room. 

Bonus:  Even though I have a corporate rate, the rate tends to fluctuate from hiked to hiked higher. I did receive some staff attention when I booked with an online deal they weren't willing to match on the phone. On that stay, under the door of my room, they slipped me a 10% off coupon if I booked directly with them.... [sarcastic] I guess that's a form of loyalty building. 

Sure, it's a boutique hotel, the rooms are clean and there's Aveda products, but visit after visit, I feel like a second rate guest. If it wasn't clear yet, I'm in the market for a new hotel home.",2011-06-17 07:24:21

After all, we all know good Mexican food comes from health food inspection failed places. I'm from Los Angeles, but I can recommend this place with two thumbs up.

Everything on the menu is good, like most Mexican places, it's the same stuff packaged in different things-- tacos, burritos, nachos, enchiladas, the food is the same but you choose how you want it served. The one thing to know is that the PORTIONS ARE HUGE. My girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla because she 'wasnt hungry' and received a half pizza-like monstrosity of cheesy chicken-y goodness overload.

My personal favorite are the carne asada nachos (order them to-go- for bigger portions) at around $7.50 coupled with a large horchata ($2.50) and you've got yourself a meal. My brother likes the #6 with steak (enchilada and burrito combo) and loves the red sauce on the enchiladas. Make note that pictures on the walls are not correct because the portions aren't that small (all the better for my bro) so I'd say for most things, you could split it with another bulimic person.

A couple of things I'd like to note:
- They're open 24 hours.
- The sour cream there is really good. I swear it's mixed with crack so if you like sour cream, try ordering a side of it for $0.99. They'll give you a lot.
- The guys there are really cool and speak relatively fluent English.
- They take credit cards.",2009-09-01 17:13:45

Not only do they have fresh sushi rolls but they also have soups, salads, spring rolls, fried rice, salmon and other entree on the buffet for you to choose from.

The spring rolls are the best from a buffet that I have had and the salmon was tender and cooked perfectly. Even the desserts from the buffet was delicious!  It was such a great experience that I'm excited for my next visit.

Originally the home of James Garfield and his family, this is the place he campaigned from for the presidential election.

The home is ornate but not pretentious. It is filled with original artifacts from the family and Garfield's life. These items and the home are in amazing repair following the refurbishment. There is a Visitor Center where you can buy tickets, $10, guided tours leave on the hour. The Visitor Center itself is loaded with memorabilia and historical artifacts. They play a 20 minute film that will greatly enhance your trip. Watch it first to get background and perspective.

This place is great. There were very few if any nearby sushi options worth trying, ie Ten. Which if you read Richard Z's review, I was there, it was that bad. But back to the place at hand. 

The happy hour here, albeit short and a little early is cheap and filling. It goes from 3-6, but they do have a reverse as well from 10-close. I remember eating there with someone during happy hour for a quick dinner, sans drinks. We walked out of there after getting 2 Spicy Crab, 2 Spicy Tuna, and a Crunchy Special(not on HH), stuffed and for under $20, before tip. The sushi is always consistent, consistently great. The Crunchy Special is my favorite. Tempura shrimp, crab mix, cucumber, covered in eel sauce and tempura flakes. I want some now just writing about it. They have regular Asian type food as well for the non-sushi eaters. Which is decent. 

Service there has always been spot on as well. You can watch the sushi chef making rolls behind the counter via a camera and monitor mounted on top of the bar. They have a fine selection of beers and sake. They also have a pineapple infused vodka sitting in a big glass jug on top of the bar. I have been told it is good.

First, our server Maria G. was an angel. Once again, a lackluster meal is made better by a great employee - thank you Maria! 

Back to food. I really, highly suggest NOT getting a crepe. The egg part was weird and spongy. Pancake-y might be a better description. Also not a fan of their house made chorizo, which was bland with strange texture. I almost choked on globs of cheese inside the crepe omelette- seriously. Coffee was too watered down for me, and I really dislike non-dairy creamer, would much prefer a tiny cup of cream.
Back to the positive notes, I was a fan of their spiced potatoes (spice was similar to Lawry's) and their bottled Salsa Verde helped flavor up the bland Mexican Omelette.

Skip this place, even though it's been around for a while (and it shows), there are other choices in the East Valley to spend your money for Scrapbook stuff.",2010-06-25 20:03:54

After going here for most of a year, I'm a totally happy customer and still love this place!  Joe is my regular barber now, but when he's not around any of the other barbers do a great job too.  And Denise usually cuts my son's hair.  Never a complaint!  Read on to see my original review:

A real barber shop!  That's where I told my son I was taking him when we went to Figaro's for a haircut several weeks ago.  I went once, took him on my second visit, and just enjoyed my third visit there yesterday.  Time for a review!

The barbers are very friendly, professional, take their time and have a great amount of experience.  And the place looks and feels like a barber shop ought to.  Everything on the walls is interesting, the music is never too loud, and you can even get a shoe shine.  What I think I love most besides a great haircut, is the shop isn't based on a particular gimmick or theme to try and draw in business.  Figaro's is a quality barber shop, knows it, and stands solidly on that fact.  As a result, they don't hurt for business.  By the way, mornings, lunch time, and late afternoons can be busy, but things are fairly quiet in the late mornings and early afternoons.  Keep that in mind if you're on a schedule and intend to just drop in.

I've taken the first available barber on each of my three visits and all three haircuts were great.  At some point I'll settle on a particular barber, but for now I'm still enjoying meeting each of them.

The price is right:  $17 for a regular haircut, which includes cleaning up around your ears and neck with hot lather and a blade, a hot towel, and some tonic to cool things off.  As with other good barber shops, there are additional charges for a shave, beard trim, custom cuts, etc.  You can see all the pricing online, or posted clearly on the wall in the shop.

Figaro's is located in a storefront.  In's easy to find and there's always lots of parking.  Next time you or your kiddo needs a haircut, I highly recommend giving Figaro's a try.",2016-01-15 18:05:38
oIGq-J_scivuhBT-r2_Ahw,iylyMoq92gzB8RYMfO2NmQ,OD09pm-MzynigAvD5KoGPA,5,6,0,2,"Yep another five for the work 'hood. I drove past this place many times and never, ever would think of stopping in. Thank goodness for my fellow yelpers showing me the way...

Tiny place in a tight, old, somewhat run down strip mall. Minimal parking. Tiny restaurant with maybe 8 tables? And yes two HUGE TVs on either wall loud and proud on a news station - I'm not sure if it was Fox. My first visit was during the noon hour and there was a line. People ordering off of lists for lots of other work folks but it's simple ordering and they are fast. 

I listened to what the pros were ordering and everything sounds great. When it was my turn I asked for an 'Open Burrito' not really sure what that was. She grabbed a bowl and asked if I wanted rice, No, beans? Yes, black or pinto? Black. What kind of meat (which later my husband reminded me was Friday during lent whoops) I asked her to describe everything she had - chicken, red pork, green extra spicy, - she had me at extra spicy so I didn't listen to the rest - then the fun stuff - cilantro, cheese, ROASTED CORN, guacamole, sour cream, onions, yes, yes, yes!  Do you want a tortilla? Spinach, plain, Chipotle - yes that. Then they had a side bar with more chile sauces, limes, onions, jalapeños, I got limes and red chile. 

About $7+ dollars later I walked back to work with my bowl. It was amazing, fresh, perfectly cooked meat, super spicy and flavorful. All the extras made it incredible. I decided this is where I'm spending my one day out at lunch until further notice. And I can walk. 

I wanted to immediately write a review but I made myself go a second time to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Today was my second visit - fantastic! And I love the staff, so friendly, happy to explain the food. The place is clean very deceptive from the exterior.

At first we were confused because we thought it would be a sit down restaurant. Instead it is more like a cafe within the new LGBTQ Center. That is not a deterrent for me to come back here. I would love to find out if they do volunteer projects here because it would be another reason to eat here again.

The roasted vegan sandwich served on wheat bread is good, but I would change it out to the pita the next time. Add a side for $2 and it is a full meal.

Now, I can say that I'm a hot dog connoisseur and Maui Dog hit the spot! I went all out for my first endeavor and got a dog, tots and a SPAM slider. The slider was awesome! It was totally flavorful, sweet and a little spicy. The saltiness of the SPAM totally accompanied the sweet sauce and the roll brought it all together. The tots were what you would expect, crunchy and delicious!  They weren't soggy at all, and that sometimes is a problem with tots. And, as for the dog, my mouth was in heaven. I got an all beef, and I was tempted to go with one of the Shaka dogs (the already themed hot dogs) but decided to combine my own ingredients for a sweet and spicy, salty and juicy quadfecta! I topped mine with spicy chipotle-garlic mayo, mango relish, pico de gallo, passion fruit mustard, bacon and avocado. Soooo good! The flavors went together exactly how I expected them to, and I couldn't get enough of them!

Hes funny, engaging, and best of all seems to really radiate the fact that he enjoys what he does. Bringing a number of guests onto stage throughout the show was nice as it changed up what was happening and you never knew how they would react or be on stage.

Some of the tricks were awesome and a few were obvious but at the same time i was still thoroughly entertained and thats the point.

The meat is the best part though.  They have nine different cuts on any given night, and the cooks come around and slice you off some of whichever meat they are passing around.  The top sirloin was a perfect medium rare and probably their best meat.  The duck was delicious, the flank steak had amazing seasonings on it, and the bacon wrapped tenderloin tasted great.  The rack of lamb had a little too much garlic, but other than that was pretty good and both the leg of lamb and the parmesan pork were delicious.  The sausage they offered was tasty, but did not set itself apart as spectacular.

6FVKr98E8vbOSeCi31fYHA,O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,4,2,1,1,"I arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. I mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn't stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did I want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. When the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.

As soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the Restaurant Week menu. As that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.

We also noticed a birthday card from the staff. Details, people, details!

Getting to the good stuff (well, mostly):

Duck-fat Fries (3.5/5) - The truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. The herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, STRIPSTEAK!). The last one, I can't remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don't like mustard). 

Foie Gras Sliders (1.5/5) - Ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the grilled foie gras they list as an extra. We were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. OK, we thought, we'll try it. Spoiler alert! It was still a single piece, just sliced in half. This made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. The bread (I tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. The garnishes were OK. A single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. Overall, high hopes dashed.

Duck Spring Rolls (3.5/5) - Generous portion and, I was happily surprised, not too heavy. The wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. Again, however, it was not heavy. The crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. The meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. It was a bit dry in spots. I am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.

Heirloom Tomato Salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - Fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn't weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.

NY Strip (4/5) - Slightly overcooked based on our order. We were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. The sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.

Roasted Chicken (4/5) - A tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. I love that they left the skin on; I don't eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. The truffled mac n' cheese (4/5) was really good. Almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it's own amazing profile.

Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Biegnets (5/5) - The brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. The biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. Another detail we thought was fantastic, sis's dessert came out presented with the words Happy Birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!

Wines (5/5, nail on the head every time). We started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of Gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish Oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. We spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked AND what we ordered). Given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.

The service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. There were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. 

All in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.

There's plenty of indoor seating, but the weather was too nice to not enjoy it so we sat at the outdoor bar top alongside about a dozen other midday drinkers. The bartender immediately gave us a menu and beer list informing us that all State 48 beers were $2 off. That meant forget the flights and give us full pints of beers.

The brewery's beers cover the whole spectrum that didn't go too far to the extreme from the Blueberry Ale fruit beer to the double IPA Big Stick. In that list, were a couple in my wheelhouse including an American amber and a British brown ale called the Dust Devil which had the signature roasted, malty flavor with a smooth finish.

To go with the beers, we demolished a chef's board, a brisket sandwich, and the schnitzel sandwich with not a crumb left on the plates. My brother and I powered through the food and 6 pints in one hour totaling an affordable $64 before tip. If you're looking for an overall solid brewery with a list of conventional styled beers and food made from scratch, you won't have to look too far if you're in Surprise.",2018-07-03 06:30:59

So where shall I lunch?

The only acknowledgement of existence I had of this place was once spotting a television host in here during my first visit to Queen Street through the window. It looks posh enough from the exterior, but far too contemporary for my tastes. But so it goes, I was alone..and I wanted to park my vehicle at a busy place during the weekday and have the parking assholes unable to exercise their very small..minuscule authority. 

The restaurant was nearly empty, and it boggles the mind why the Maitre'D sat me by the counter in the very front of the house. The décor seemed cheap. Like IKEA cheap. I figured it was an Asian eatery, but had no idea it was Thai. One should understand, the word ""Thai"" in North America for restaurants is really just a substitute for 'lacking in variety'. I've never been to a 'Thai' restaurant on this continent where the menu was very interesting. I would be angry if I were from Thailand and had my rich Culture reduced to shrimp-noodles and fried-rice. They also had dim sum here...this can't be right?

The staff here were fairly sharply dressed, well groomed, young, and all appeared to be UofT students. Not in an unprofessional way or anything. They were just young. They seemed to be occupied the entire time, with only four tables in the whole restaurant? What were they doing?
Despite the location, EAST! was rather spacious, well lit, clean, and I didn't have to wait very long for my food to arrive. Since I had all this free time, I figured I'd order a good portion. But when I saw the prices for the dim sum I had to mentally count the cash I had on me. $4.00 for four pieces of dumplings? Were they steaming it in truffles?! 
Everything else was reasonably priced, but the dim sum was just offensive. Chinatown is not a block away, where's the justification for this pretension?
I ordered the most expensive dim sum dish to see what is so special about the siu mai here to be priced at $1.00 each. Couldn't tell ya!
I also got this fried rice pyramid thing with shrimps I think. What is the significance of pyramids with regards to Thailand? Springs roll, $5.00 for two. Why don't you just point a gun to head? 
The prices for what go as 'snacks' in actual Asia are held to the level of ransom demands in this restaurant! These spring rolls better promise to love me long time afterwards. 

The food just isn't very good, and the wait staff weren't very engaging. The décor gave off the vibe as if this were some kind of a uptown karaoke bar, and the location is just all wrong for what they're selling. I don't buy it. But of course I did, because my bill came. I got out of there within an hour, and headed back to my hotel with an hour to spare...so I can do nothing.

Are they a little bit more for a sandwhich? Maybe a little but we would spend the same amount at Firehouse with chips and drinks, so its not outrageous.

Ordered a double cheeseburger with grilled onions, cheese (40 cents extra), extra pickles, ketchup and onions.  I also ordered a breakfast biscuit with bacon egg and cheese for the morning.  
The burger was totally packed and literally fell apart (in a good way).  Their bun is not one of those huge fat buns so holding the stuff together is difficult.  But I like their flatter bun without the huge dome.  Remember, the larger the bun the more calories you consume.  
The biscuit was not as good as the competitor's (M).  The biscuit needs to be more crumbly, and the combination of flavors just doesn't make it.  Even the bacon tastes better at the other place.

My boyfriend had a chicken wrap and fries. He really enjoyed his meal said the sauce that came with it is what made it even better. The fries were shaped like gold coins, which I found a bit amusing.

Their fries are fresh and twice cooked, so they literally blow In N Out's limp, useless fries out of the water. Be advised: one small order if fries is more than enough for two people, and the standard burger is a double decker (ask for the ""little"" burger if you want what is usually considered ""standard""). The atmosphere, such as it is, is a lot like In N Out, utilitarian and clean. They have cute little touches like free peanuts and they stack their bags of raw potatoes and jugs of peanut oil in the middle of the restaurant, I suppose to show you how fresh their fries are. The cajun fries are not cajun nor particularly tasty, but their regular fries are awesome city. I love that they don't skimp on the toppings and they kinda compress the burger as they wrap it in the foil. It comes out like a delicious, multi-colored hockey puck.

If you're not a fan of Starbucks menu then this place wont really change your mind. Main reason I'm giving this branch 4 stars is because of the service from the staff. Extremely helpful and efficient whether in drive thru, in store line, or with mobile pick ups. They're also very friendly and would not hesitate in actually conversing with their customers. They're also very attentive to their store, whether it needs cleaning or restocking. Most of the time, this particular branch is busy, probably because of it being across the Orleans. As far as I'm aware, this branch is also one of the few that has a 24 hr drive thru which is pretty amazing. That being said, why not 5 stars? Like I said, they have the typical Starbucks. But most of the time, other non popular options aren't in there. I'm a drink tea lover and their Teavana Peach Tranquility is amazing. But most of the time, they dont have it, and a lot of the employees thought they discontinued it. I understand the supply and demand of each store and how the workers dont have control on that.

I'm not that big a Flay fan, but I was really interested in trying his food based on the pics I've seen on yelp which look pretty damn creative.

I stopped over for lunch and based on early recommendations from my friends and my own curiosity, I didn't waste any time with ordering.  I started with the Blue Corn Pancake for my appetizer and their Chile Relleno for my entree.

Blue Corn Pancake with Barbecued Duck - with habanero chili and star anise sauce. 
http://bit.ly/Y2YRp1
This was pretty much like a duck taco.  The duck was very tasty and had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to it.  It was really good and I'd order this again.  The only hiccup I had with this was the fact that I ended up chewing on a bone near the end.  That was a red flag and I told my waiter about it.  He was shocked!  The real sucky part about it was that I didn't get any compensation for it.

Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno -  with Roasted Eggplant,  Manchego Cheese 
Sweet Red Pepper Sauce, and Balsamic Vinegar
http://bit.ly/VmHanC
I've had my fair share of Chile Rellenos, but this has got to be the most fanciest Chile Relleno I've ever seen.  And it was good as expected!  The Chile crust had a nice crunch to it while the cheese was nicely melted down.  And to exhibit a little bit of food porn, check out the gooey cheese oozing out from inside.  (http://bit.ly/WYhacm)  Ooooooh yes!!!  

For the most part, other than that hiccup with the bone in the duck pancake, service was still good.  My waiter was very courteous and always checked on me over the course of my meal.  It would've been nice to have a little compensation or bill removal for the bone which I probably should've requested, but I'm not that aggressive.

I'd probably consider going back again to Mesa Grill to try their other menu items, but it probably won't be for a while.  The food is good, but I'd really have to be in mood for it to go back.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4!",2013-01-25 10:39:57

I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store, when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call, and their prices were competitive. Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz.

The process was pretty easy. We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety, and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage.

I paired it with with a cup of miso soup and a drink for  around $8.50.  While it is certainly not the best quality sushi I have ever eaten, for a ""fast casual"" sushi joint, it was fine. 

The employees were friendly and helpful.  The only thing that bothers me is the same thing that one other reviewer points out... they put your roll into this machine to cut it into pieces.

Decor: Love this Asian fusion restaurant. The decor is so cute. Especialy love the wallpaper and the ""let's nhau"" quote (vietnamese for let's party/drink) in the corner of the room. There's also a huge bar that greets you and FOURTEEN flat screen tv's all over the place. It's totally set up for some good eating, drinking, and sport gatherings.

The CAFE SUA DA (Vietnamese iced coffee) was perfect. I am a coffee lover, and I'm extra critical. But they nailed the coffee here. Strong and sweet.

Appetizers: the GARLIC AND SERRANO PEPPER WINGS are good. Comes out hot, crispy, and moist on the inside. The serrano pepper definitely gives it a kick. And the side of pickled radish adds a nice touch too. The SHAKEN BEEF SALAD comes out on a huge bed of lettuce and tomatoes. The beef is sweet, salty, and savory at the same time. The beef could be more tender, but flavor wise, it was exellent. We also asked for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to dip the meat which really enhanced everything.

Entree: the STEAK AND EGG is where some of the asian fusion comes out. It's not the traditional t-bone steak you might expect. It's actually more like the shaken beef appetizer.  But the flavor is more sweet. This beef actually is more tender though. And the fried egg, which was over easy, was actually over easy!! *clap clap. The SLOW BRAISED PORK BELLY IN YOUNG COCONUT JUICE was a little on the smaller side for an entree. Also, the flavor was not as intense as I would have anticipated. It needed more bang, more salt. The OX TAIL PHO came with two big pieces of tender ox tail. It was so tasty and actually fell off the bone. Curiously, the pho tasted like Pho So 1. Which is also a restaurant in chinatown that does very well for itself.

Overall, this place has the potential to be great. I can imagine coming here to watch the game and grabbing a few drinks after work. The staff is young and friendly. And occasionally, the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing. That's so cool. It definitely feels like a family friendly environment.

First off, the parking lot is small so I'm not sure how it would fare on busier nights or weekends. The ambiance of the place including the parking lot makes you really feel like you're not in Canada. It really is a testament to the Mexican culture and vibes at every turn. The employees greeted us promptly and were very friendly, we were offered indoor seating or patio and we decided on the patio. The place is really just a large house with a backyard (patio) full of trees which was lovely. The patio/backyard has typical backyard style furniture which was somewhat uncomfortable to eat on because the chairs are too low for the table. There are hardly any tables outside (maybe 5?) otheriwse the patio experience was nice being in all the trees and hearing the birds singing, they also light the 'tiki stick' cintronella candles like the ones you bring camping for mosquitos which adds to the nice vibe (although it smelled more like gas than citronella). We ordered the mushroom tacos, the chips and guac, and a side of mexican rice. Our server was nice but the food took a long time to come out even though they weren't so busy. When the food came, I was extremely disappointed in the portions. The prices for everything that was ordered was not worth what we received. The tacos were delicious but weren't filled enough compared to what is typical in Mexico. The guac was so basic, and avocados were clearly a day or two too old. I have had better guac at Kelsey's for crying out loud. There were no added spices, and not even any diced onions or tomatoes in the guac, on top of that there was only about 12 chips. Definitely not an app you can share. The mexican rice was an even bigger disappointment, it looked like packaged rice from the grocery store: a white rice with a couple peas and some green bean pieces, and no seasoning again (for $4.50), also came as a small portion. Plain white rice, really? We were not offered a dessert menu, but instead we were told what was available which bothered me because I could not see the prices for what I was getting. Considering the amount we paid for the other food I was not wiling to risk getting dessert and get another tiny portion again. Drinks were ordered at a table beside us and they looked huge, did not drink anything but water so I cannot comment on that but it might be a good place to come for drinks. They were setting up to play music/DJ not sure exactly, we left before it started (after 8pm) so I can't review that portion, although from the time we were there they played fist bumping kind of music which didn't exactly give the 'Mexico' feel. Overall, I will not be back which is unfortunate because the look of the place is so absolutely beautiful and would be awesome for a date night, but the food is too underwhelming and expensive for what you get.",2018-06-26 15:25:05

The chips were good, light, crispy and hot and I liked their salsa, a little bit of smoke to it. I ordered the cameron al maya -fried shrimp taco with mango and habanero salsa. The shrimp had a bit of a fishy taste to me, and yes I know they are shrimp so they are supposed to be fishy (duh...), but this was the scrunch your nose up not so good fishy taste. Still holding strong though and not sick so that's a good sign! The shrimp were pretty small. The tacos had a kick to them with the habanero salsa.  They came with beans and rice but it was sent over on a small plate to be ""family style"" with my friend - the ""family style"" portion is about the size each person would get on their own plate in a normal sit down mexican restaurant.  You received three tacos with any of the taco plates. It was $12, and the tacos were equivalent to a standard street taco as to size. I think they price was a bit expensive for what you get. The drinks sounded good, but I did not imbibe. Overall cute place, decent food, a bit pricey for what you get, nothing memorable as to the flavor profile. Also, I asked the waitress what she recommended she immediately steered me to the most expensive item on the menu ($22) - I am always skeptical when this happens but maybe she gets to eat for free and that just happens to be her favorite, she recommended a few other of the higher priced items too. Ultimately, I just got what I wanted in the first place. With so many other places in town, and for being a pricier mexican establishment, I don't think I will be back.",2014-03-07 22:12:15

The daifuku mochi taste very fresh. They are more like the western style Japanese sweets. The wrapping is soft and chewy and the inside is creamy and fresh.

I've seen this place before, but haven't tried it until now.  Looks like they have re-done the inside at some point and the outside porch awning was brand spanking new... and there were some construction contractors on the  top roof unloading materials when we arrived.

Anyways... onto the food!  The menu definitely have some unique things going for it.  I ended up choosing a vegetarian dish:  Meatless Loaf and Soy Milk Mash.... came with 2 sides of which I chose the sweet potato fries and hush puppies....  After I ordered, I realized I could have gotten more veggies, but I was happy with what I got.  The loaf was amazing... we sat there trying to figure out what was in it... but man, I could have sworn there was some sort of meat in there.

I did order the pig wings for the table, which were AMAZING... our server said it comes with (5) pig wings, but we ended up getting (6)... I guess the extra wink I gave to our waiter paid off (or probably not).

In my experience, all events held by Toronto Common provide very good value, but I will focus the review on the food here. 

We got to taste a mixed appetizer dish, along with all 4 of the pasta dishes featured in the restaurant's menu, and a dessert:

Wagyu beef carpaccio with black truffle crema, rocket (arugula) and parmesan; Black ink cod fritters with smoked paprika aioli; Polenta fries with roasted red pepper salsa; and Octopus carpaccio with dill veloute and pickled vegestables - This was basically 4 appetizers shrunk down in portion size and made into a single dish. I quite liked the fact that I get to taste so much and the portion was perfect and think this should be on the regular menu. The stand-out item was most definitely the beef carpaccio with the truffle crema (delicious!). The other items were okay, it was a great starter nonetheless.

Orecchiette (small shell) pasta with basil pesto, grilled asparagus, semi-dried tomatoes and fresh ricotta - this was the lightest tasting pasta of the night. This is an ""okay"" dish. Personally I prefer pasta with meat/seafood in them but other guests really like the fact that it's clean-tasting and light.

Nero di Sepia: Squid ink fettuccine with grilled calarmari, shrimp, roasted tomatoes, chilli and parsley - I really like the squid ink and the seafood combination. The chef was a bit heavy on the black pepper and that distracted from the taste of the dish. Overall this was an ""okay"" dish as well.

Crab meat carbonara linguini, with pancetta, peppercorn, lemon cream and quail egg - the presentation was perfect with the quail egg on top. This was my favourite dish of the night and I like the creamy pasta and the combination of crab meat & pancetta.

Animale pappardelle pasta, consists of a 3-meat ragu (lamb, pork and veal), porcini and tomato - Most of the group were full at this point including myself, so I had only a bite of this. My impression of the dish is that is a great pasta dish for meat lovers, and I thought the tomato sauce on it was of good quality and tasted ""homemade"". I would rank this as the second-best pasta of the night.

Cinnamon and delce de leche panna cotta with candied orange - I like the smoothness and creaminess of the panna cotta. The candied orange was a nice and interesting touch. Delicious overall and a great end to a meal.

Looking at the prices on the regular menu and considering that the somewhat big portions I received were ""downsized"", I would say the Peasant Table provides very good value with respect to their pasta dishes, which are all under $20.

The restaurant had a nice modern and welcoming vibe and is definitely a great neighbourhood restaurant to have around. The food (at least for the pasta) here will not ""wow"" you, but it's solid, hearty and comforting. Negative reviews centre mostly around brunch, so perhaps that is not their strong suit for now. I would recommend coming here for dinner.

Peasant Table is ""A-Okay"" (3-stars)",2017-03-21 14:40:05

The doctor said that she didn't have much experience with pediatrics so we would be referred to an Ortho. Long story short, we asked for the referral to be done stat considering my son is 12 and the doctor basically couldn't tell us much about ""all that was going on down there"" (her words, not mine). The MA said word for word ""You must either work in the medical field or you have watched too much ER"" after I asked if we could get the referral done possibly early Monday so we could get in to see Ortho asap. I ignored the insult considering I HAVE worked in the medical field for several years. Actually I worked for a doctors office that referred to this place when our office was closed. NOT ANYMORE. After the MA asked what I did in the medical field and I told him, he laughed in my face and then laughed when I mentioned who I had worked for. Extremely inappropriate. We were also told the referral would be done Monday and that we would PROBABLY be in to see an ortho doctor sometime next week. The doctor also rudely answered her phone while consulting with us regarding my son and said ""Hey, I'm gonna have to call you back"". You really couldn't have, I don't know, stepped out of the room or even simply ignored the call considering it obviously wasn't that important if you were able to call them back. All in all the worst situation I have ever found myself in. We live around the corner and have several friends that do as well and we will NEVER be back.

It's literally twice the price of IN-N-OUT and just as good.   The meat is not as flavorful, but they got a lot of toppings to chose from and if you like community peanuts, they got some hors d'oeuvres for you.  I prefer the no non sense of IN-N-OUT.  

Ah. .and they have a next generation Coke machine that can create all sorts of funky soda for you. If you did not grow out of mixing orange soda with root beer and cola, then you will be in heaven.

Then if you continue to stand there, you will be rewarded with the yummy smells and it will draw you in like a magnet!

I stopped for a crepe today because it was a bit rainy in Phoenix here in November and I wanted comfort food. This little gem has been opened at the Biltmore shopping plaza for about 6 months. You get the Euro-French feel with the marble, chandelier and subway tile. It has some indoor seating. Rather cozy. And more seating outdoors though I think it's for anyone. There is a glass case that has some scrumptious pastries, if you don't want to order a crepe. Illy coffee machine behind front counter. There is a self-service condiment and beverage bar with spa water, Royal coffee and glass cases to purchase other bevvies. Not quite sure how that works since you place your order up front.
Business was steady. The register/order taker seemed a little flustered. She had to keep switching between taking/processing orders/bussing tables/explaining to customer why coffee pot on self-serve was empty/making coffee up front.I saw 2nd waiter guy but he kept going to the back. Maybe doing dishes? 3rd guy was the crepe maker and he was spot on.

I was told this place can get pretty crowded but we were fortunate that it wasn't too bad.  We got a corner seat along that back wall long bench.  I have to say the tiny table sure limits the amount of food one can order... anything more and we would have to borrow the next table.  

The decor provides a warm feeling.  The exposed brick is industrial chic; the hanging whole peacock is kind of rustic; the couches make it more a lounge than a restaurant.  For a date (which I was on), I think it's intimate enough of a setting without being too much.  Hip, but not over the top.  

Now the food.  We had the curried lamb skewer, portabella mushrooms, shrimp ceviche, and spanakopita.  Amazingly I got pretty filled up.  My fav was definitely the lamb: juicy, tasteful, and the mango chutney provides just enough of a sweetness to it.  The ceviche was good too, especially with the small twist of coconut flavor in it.  We ended the night with the pistachio & coffee ice cream.  Pistachio (as odd and green as it was) was better... the coffee ice cream was more icy than creamy.  I do wish that they have a bigger dessert menu but hey... it's all good.  Otherwise the menu provides plenty options. 

On a side note, a friend of mine told me that I can watch the best sunset on the balcony... and I swear it was the most orange, biggest setting sun I've seen in a long time.  But it was too darn hot to sit outside, but even a glimpse was magical enough... ok, I now sound like I had 2 wine too many haha.

WNlEl7cdmv7vwFMmWjAZVg,Jk0AcqPCVMfc_DTWO3SzwA,rOHLBGBcWzlxdvNI6squgQ,5,2,1,0,"A wonderful place to get my taco on! I met my gf for lunch on a Friday at 11:50. When I pulled up I was concerned the building was closed. They were weren't. I just happened to be the first arrival for lunch. 

I was seated quickly & my server encouraged me to download their app. Upon doing so a complimentary serving of chips and salsa arrived at the table. (Score!) the salsa and chips are tasty! (Double Score!) The thin salsa is fresh with just a mild amount of heat. A perfect start to a lunch. Not too much overpowering spice. I didn't have to guzzle water after each bite and instead could continue consuming fistfuls of chips with salsa. A good indicator to just the right amount of spice and fresh ingredients. 

When my friend arrived the staff quickly took our order. They were aware that her lunch break time was limited. Staff was very aware of our needs & the time.  As it was our first visit we decided to try the tacos because we could order multiple style of tacos a la cart. 

We ordered 3 tacos each. Each taco was between $3-3.50. I chose the chicken, shrimp, and fish. My friend chose pork, another version of chicken, and something else. The idea was we'd get a wide taste of their taco variety. 

What really happened was this-

The taco's are HUGE. I ate 1/2 of my fish taco and realized I was getting full. I then had a bite of the chicken and a bit of the shrimp. That was it. It was SUPERB. It's not a bad thing the foods delicious and plentiful. Prepare to take home leftovers or try not to over order like we did! 

Sadly because of this day's work, I was unable to bring leftovers home. I'm still craving more of the fish taco. It is flaky, lightly breaded, and flash fried then served in a double tortilla, with fresh pico, and guacamole. I don't even like guac but this guac was not bad at all. And for me to say that is saying A LOT! 

Each taco arrived with guacamole. I don't care for guac and wasn't expecting its presence.

As for the Chicken Taco. Not having the room to indulge in it's Chipotle goodness was truly a shame. The pulled chicken served in a double corn taco was delicious and it will be a regular treat soon enough.  Delicious! Absolutely Fantastic! 

Now the Shrimp. By the time I tried the shrimp, I was just filled to the brim and could only pop a few shrimp into my mouth before calling it a day.  The shrimp were delicious. Grilled and perfectly seasoned. 

Overall, I have no regrets about my first trip to Bea.  I wish I could have eaten more and longer because the meal served to us was superb!  The atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Food was perfect. It's now my favorite place to order Taco's from.  Thank goodness we found it!

I am going to be brutally honest, we had been spending a lot of time making reservations at the trendy tako place downtown that makes me wait 30 minutes to go to the bathroom and leaves us with at least a $100 bill. BeaTaquria has food that is MUCH tastier. They don't have the bar scene or a DJ spinning while you're eating but the food is much better. Your taste buds & wallet will thank you for making this you're new favorite place for really good taco's. (and other food!)",2016-10-08 14:12:59

Absolute food perversion. Possibly the BEST restaurant in Las Vegas. We had a 4 hour experience here and I dream about this place all the time. You better be ready to pack on the calories and please do not bring anyone who pushes their food on the plate. Bring people who love a true dining experience. 

I've tried foie gras - which I said I would never because it is just so inhumane, but it was absolutely amazing. I will never have it again, however I can say that it was the best thing I have tasted in a long time and preparation was the key. This was on the specials menu so I am not sure how often they have this specific item.

Oysters, dover sole, NY strip, hanger steak, gnocchi, roasted veggies, 2 bottles of Northern Rhone wine..... heaven. Just heaven! 

The steaks and sides come with béchamel sauce which was just too much for me at one point, in terms of creamy fatty things, so the chef prepared me a delicious shallots and wine reduction steak sauce, which was absolutely amazing. 

The chocolate dessert we didn't care for, possibly because we have just gorged ourselves with insanely delicious foods.

First thing I notice is that the employees were pretty friendly. They'll gladly offer you any any samples you are interested in and explain the ingredients. We tried several flavors. I certainly enjoyed the mint. 

We ended up eating a mix of some cappucino flavored ice cream and a mint with chips. It's good ice cream-- better than you would find at a Baskin Robbins (are those even still around?) or a Dairy Queen. Yes, I understand that this is not exactly the same kind of ice cream as you would find there but this was all I could really compare it to because I know nothing about gelato. I wasn't exactly blown away by the stuff to be honest though. Sure it was good and had a nice creamy texture but I wouldn't say it was better than you would find at your local Ben & Jerry's or Coldstone. Of course-- it is DIFFERENT as a gelato and so it's not really fair for me to make that comparison. If this is what you are craving, I don't see why you shouldn't give it a try.

But like that BMW, you're going to have to contend with a lot of a certain kind of buyer, and pay a premium for those add-ons, like salad...er...I mean heated steering wheel.  

Seriously though, this place serves a purpose: to serve the folks working in Uptown, so during lunch, it's like an adult cafeteria.  Long lines should be expected. Parking at peak times can also be a beast. 

But the food itself, I think is quite yummy. The pastas for example, are all made to order, and the chefs at each station (like the pizza or salad station) make everything fresh before your eyes.  There's something satisfactory about watching a chef (or, I guess more like line cook) assemble your meal, and add sauces and mix and chop. 

The place looks like an upscale cafeteria, and you'll definitely pay upscale cafeteria prices, that rival, let's say a Mama Ricotta's.  (I say MR's because it's Italian.)

To those who aren't thrilled about the despondent looking workers...I'd say not all of them have that dull stare.  It depends on who you get.

I guess I can start with the good: Shrimp tempura, kalbi, futomaki, and ice cream were on point. That's it.

Onto the negatives... where to begin? Servers went out of their way to ignore you. No, really, they would grab your empty plates and run as fast as humanly possible before you could get their attention. And when they walk by your table they will have tunnel vision or stare at the ground even if they see you in their peripheral looking, waving, doing backflips, etc. Food took forever to arrive. You don't get spoons with your soup or ginger with your sushi. Hot tea tasted like bitter pee. I don't know, it was funky and sour and bright yellow and oily(?). Several ordered items never arrived and had to be ordered twice. Miso soup was all salt. The avocado on my green dragon roll was extremely mushy and ruined the entire roll. Old, soggy shrimp tempura in the shrimp tempura roll. Towards the end of my meal I contemplated whether I should tough it out and get my money's worth or just put up the white flag. In the end I gave up and made my own personal history by leaving an AYCE for the first time ever without being stupid full to the point of having to harness all the energy in my body just to keep it from spewing from all orifices of my body.

The overall quality of the food was not as good as I remembered and fell more in line with cheap buffet food, which to me actually isn't bad, but I feel like this was much worse than that.

Last week I met up with a friend who was staying at the Mandalay Bay. We walked around, looking for a bar to have our next drink at and then this place caught our eye. We headed inside and took a seat at the bar. Service was quick and friendly-- our drinks were ready in no time. My friend is an old fashioned connoisseur and so naturally I just had to have my first one with him. Maybe his expert opinion would be different, but I thought it was pretty good. Thumbs up from the newbie!

My visit here was short this time but I would definitely be back to try the food. At a quick glance around the room, I saw a few plates that looked pretty good. Steampunk, octopus, and cocktails in a skull glass-- who can say no to that?",2018-05-07 03:47:37

I was not aware of Honest John's until my friend and I parked right in front of it.  Always wanting to support Homestead businesses we decided to go in and have a drink and check it out.  And ended up staying for dinner!

Very cool layout and decor.  The sleek bar is in the center of the establishment, with a dining room to your left, and another dining area past the bar in the main area.  And, when the weather finally breaks, they have a great little patio for dining outdoors.

Nice selection of specialty cocktails along with several Moscow Mules.  I had ""The Homestead"" which was perfect for a cool night, a great mix of whiskey, ginger beer and an orange.

My friend and I could not help but to choose the breads and spreads plate where you can pick either three or five different cheese/spreads which is accompanied with several different breads.  My favorite was the goat cheese, which actually went pretty well with the garlic spread.  It can't hurt to mix things up a little!

For my meal I chose a half pound of wings with the BBQ sauce.  A half pound ends up being about 6 full sized wings.  The sauce, while plentiful (and messy), was really good!  You'll need several napkins for this, but certainly worth the sticky fingers.

My friend ordered the appetizer portion of the muscles, and it was definitely a large portion that served as a dinner portion.  

The owner, John, was at the bar area and introduced himself to us.  He talked about the menu and ideas for happy hour specials.  The staff was all very attentive and friendly.

We had an 8 person party and enjoyed the late seating. The server was professional and friendly and handled our large boisterous group with ease.

The waiting room is a little cramped based on the number of patients waiting. Weekends are apparently the busiest times with the least amount of staff as I just overheard the receptionist tell another patient.

However, the biggest complaint is the lack of parking provided for centre patients so you must either walk, take public transit, take a taxi (oh so cost effective, NOT), or find street parking which is only free on Sunday.

For many of us, walking, taxis, and/or public transit is not always a cost-effective viable option. It would be nice if we could use the public parking lot and get a ticket stamped.

It was a Friday at the beginning of lunchtime.  Mesa Grill was empty and we could've sat at any table we wanted, but we decided to sit at the bar.  The bar is dominated by a heady array of fine tequilas and whisky.  Given it was before noon, we elected to just have water and some coffee.  Arturo, our bartender/server was friendly and spot on with his service.  We opened with an order of Rough Cut Tuna ""Nachos"" served with mango, habanero hot sauce and avocado crema.  The ""nachos"" were exactly as advertised, a Southwest-style ceviche with a great balance of sweet and spicy hot with an avocado creaminess.

I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.

The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.

Sorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing.",2011-09-15 03:47:55

JBq0GewJxTSNNq8L8JsWQw,LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,5,4,1,1,"I was surprised to be able to get a reservation for dinner the same night when I called on Friday at 4pm, especially since it was a busy weekend with AVN in town.  I got there before my friend so I sat at the bar and got a dirty martini, which was perfect but SO expensive at $20.  I had, of course, looked at the menu before making reservations and prices seemed very reasonable for a steakhouse on the Strip so I was shocked to see the $20 tab for one drink.

My friend showed up and we were seated in a big booth facing the catwalk.  I loved the ambiance, decor and atmosphere of the restaurant.  They had specialty acts to keep you entertained while you were eating, in case simple conversation with your dinner companion(s) wasn't enough.  There were a couple of gogos walking around on 4-foot tall stilts.  On the catwalk were rotating acts of various beautiful women dancing, doing acrobatics, or just walking around in extravagant costumes.  The addition of all this entertainment really added to the whole wonderful experience we had.

The drink menu came and the drinks were very reasonably priced, which made me all the more shocked about my $20 martini.  I decided to switch it up and ordered a specialty cocktail with champagne, which was just ok.  We started off with fresh oysters, which tasted incredibly smooth and delicious.   We decided to share an 8 oz. filet, lobster tail and a side of ""little bakers"".  The price tag next to the lobster tail said ""MP"" and I've had lobster at various places along the strip and have never paid over $100 so I figured we were okay.  The food came and our jaws dropped at the sight of the lobster tail.  No exaggeration, it was nearly the size of football.  I remember thinking, ""oh boy, we are in trouble"" with regard to the bill.

EVERYTHING was unbelievable.  The filet was cooked perfectly and that lobster tail was probably the best lobster I've ever eaten in my life.  The ""little bakers"" was this dish of little roasted potatoes cut into pieces and topped with sour cream, bacon, cheese and chives.  It was amazing.  We also shared a bottle of Zinfandel that the sommelier suggested.  It went perfectly with our meal.   We were completely stuffed by the time we were done eating so we did not order dessert.

When our bill came, once again our jaws dropped to the floor to see that the lobster tail was $140!!!!  I was seriously like HOLY SHIIIIIII...!! Our total bill was $340, which was quite a bit more than I had expected, but I have absolutely NO regrets and think the food was worth every penny.  

Other than the lobster tail and the $20 martini, the menu prices are not that bad at all in comparison with other steakhouses on the strip.  Our filet was only $36.  You can very easily have a wonderful meal here for 2 for under $150 to include steaks, sides and wine.  This may be my new favorite spot.  Our entire experience was phenomenal.",2013-01-22 00:29:58

Its small enough to feel cozy, but yet you don't feel cramped. The location is central.  It's a place you can come on your own, with friends, with your parents and feel like you've impressed them with an out of the box choice. And the price point is good too. 

Came here around 1:45pm on a Saturday afternoon. They don't take reservations, and the place was full! Waited about 5-10 mins, and we got a nice table for two. 
I did very much like how it was a four person table, with us at the corner seats. It made for a less cramped lunch. 

Our server was friendly and made conversation, but wasn't intrusive. 

The restaurant's namesake is Bannock, which defined on their menu is a thin, crunchy pizza, folded over with food goods inside. 
We got the Duck Poutine Pizza. Although it was very good (and very filling), it was basically fries, cheese and some duck meat on top of a thin crust pizza. We opted for the pizza instead of a Bannock, because he said it was the most popular. 
I think I regret this choice, because although good, I don't like the feeling of grease inside me after a meal, nor was it something unique (fries). 

We also shared the Roasted Pork Shoulder. It was amazing. And I was sad I couldn't eat more because I was full from my one slice of pizza. 

For dessert, I noted Tong J's suggestion to get the Sour Cream donuts. Yum, it was melt in  your mouth. 

My only thing about the food here, is that it's heavy. You have definite itis waddling out of here, so choose your dishes wisely!

They also have a great takeaway lunch area.

It seems like a great place for commuters to meet, but coming here with a car was difficult. Parking around Eaton Centre is expensive (Green P street is $3.50 an hour) but you can also try City Hall as well.",2012-01-17 16:37:53

Kennedy's has one of the best front decks in Charlotte as it allows you to spread out and relax and people watch. There are lots of fun nooks inside the bar with an adequate upstairs.
I have personally not eaten here but my friends have had a few sorted items and always seem pleased.",2011-06-11 02:21:12
LQOHYyV5aJ2Yp1c0kxnZow,5dKToOB8XcZNnNHUXe63kA,vR5Hppx__U_VXObK8VPLOw,3,3,0,0,"Second time at Graft last night. A friend and I went for cocktails at the bar.  The cocktails were both pretty good- I had the tasty Bracht Show, which was rye, raspberry and Cynar on the rocks- but overpriced at $11 per. I'd opt instead for a more carefully crafted (& boozier) drink at Merchant, or even the old standby Whisky Tango Foxtrot around the corner at Tornado, which packs a punch and is I believe 2 bucks cheaper. 

I mention last night's experience because we were struck by the lack of service at the bar- and indeed, a fellow seated at the bar to our left bristled at the bartenders ignoring him on an obviously slow night, and left without ordering any food, angrily admonishing the bar manager.  I think we saw him sitting there for a good 15 minutes without any communication from the 3 people behind the bar. The first time I was at Graft I also experienced a lack of attentive or knowledgeable service (granted, we were also seated at the bar). 

After my first Graft experience I did not see myself going back. Let me tell you- I wanted to love it. The space is stunning, lovely atmosphere, the open kitchen is gorgeous and I love the aesthetic of everything from the uniforms to the glassware. But even for a discerning diner willing to get a little spendy, it is ultra overpriced. And the menu is totally uninspired.  I feel somewhat reluctant to write this review as I know there are great people in the Graft kitchen- that said- I know they can do better and hopefully they will! The fried chevre ($6) was three tiny bites, probably less than an ounce of cheese in total, and did not come with the honeycomb per menu description.  The mushroom ravioli also came as an order of three, and was really bland and swimming in a runny, equally bland sauce. The scallops were our favorite, but seemed to be two full scallops sliced into three pieces, for $15- again, there are other places even in this landlocked city where there is a better value on fresher scallops.  And there was no grapefruit with the scallops, so they also failed to live up to the menu description.  My friend and I left still hungry, having spent $89 between the two of us for two drinks each, and, we estimated, literally eight bites of food apiece. 

I will return to Graft because it's a great space.  But I don't think I'll be dining there again until the menu begins to look a little less like a Food Fight menu (interesting macaroni and cheese! dolled up Brussels sprouts! deconstructed s'mores! and so on) and portion sizes increase relative to the prices.",2015-10-02 21:20:50

They carry a lot of 5.11 tactical stuff and some Magpul, Froglube for your rifle and other maintenance supplies. It's worth coming in or calling just to see of they have what you need. 

The range is clean, well ventilated and brass is swept frequently and equipment is well maintained and in like new condition.  AKs, HK carbine, Deagles, FN SCAR, Benelli shotguns and some funny zombie targets are available. 

Ammunition prices are competitive.  I typically go to Walmart or online for ammo but I find quality reloads are about the same price here so I just buy at the front store and head to the back. 

The counter personnel and range masters are friendly and efficient.  No attitude - unless you're an unsafe handling douche. 

It can get busy with tourists but there's a lot of stations so you won't wait long.",2012-06-17 04:00:56

The menu has Ribs, Chicken, Pulled Pork and Shredded Beef and a few sandwiches and a salad.  Many sides and five or six sauces.  
Had a plate of ribs that were nicely smoked, tender and easy to eat off the bone. 
Ordered the mild sauce since we were told the Jorge (hot) sauce was very hot.  Ended up getting the hot sauce or the mild is very hot.  The sauce was OK, but hot and had a vinegar flavor. Had a side of Mac N Cheese (which was OK, nothing special), and cornbread.  

The interior is painted bright yellow and has 4 tables.  All the tables were in use when we visited.

Been here many times over the past 5 years or so.

I think they make the one of the best Portuguese Chicken Baked Rice ever!!! - which is my standard order.

I do usually get take-out and rarely dine-in.

My friends like to order the Pork-Chop Baked Rice, HK-style Toast, and Hainanese Chicken Rice.

Take-out lunch with a milk tea drink is usually just under $10pp.",2016-05-18 04:40:50

And it never disappoints. Home made chips and a side of habanero sauce how could you go wrong? The veggie tacos and the Mexican street corn are equally enjoyable. I haven't been able to enjoy a margarita yet but I've heard they're amazing. Shout out to the manager Chad! He's awesome.,2015-12-02 00:06:12
