byg_RBxf25cOt06hC6jAFA,IYzUzFMj-pOQcnGVlp0MQA,owsVSnllxn994EpBR8ZFwQ,1,0,0,0,"I am disappointed in their cancellation policy. We had two memberships, one for our teenage son and one for my husband with both having the ability to bring a guest. We were told we can cancel at any time for any reason. Since my son was using a different gym, we no longer needed his membership so I called to cancel and was told to call a different company to cancel. I called them and they told me I had to send an email confirming my cancellation. I was told I had to give a 30 day notice so I was charged another $24.95 for the month. Then the next month another $24.95 was charged. I call up the location they said they can't help but to call the other company again. I call that company and they say they can't help either. Then I'm calling the gym to talk to the manager who says she will try to get it refunded, it's been months and no refund. Then I send an email 2 months ago to put my husbands acct on hold while he's recovering from surgery and restricted from lifting weights. We are charged a $5.95 fee for the acct to be put on hold. 

I send an email the other day and say, just cancel the acct, I'm giving a 30 day notice, keep the $24.95 that you owe us and use it as the last payment for the 30 day notice and today we are charged $64.95. I send another email and no response. 

I'm not a fan of this location because it smells and us always crowded. I like the one on Sahara better. I never would have canceled my husbands membership but did because of the lack of correspondence. I'm contacting my bank to get involved with the shady charges. 

Avoid this company or be prepared to pay even after you cancel. Highly dissatisfied!

It's been several months and still no refund and no one from EOS is contacting me back!",2018-06-23 21:44:59

Szechwan Palace is nestled in the Chinese Cultural Center.  The menu is varied and offers a very good value for lunch specials which include entree, soup, salad, and spring roll.

On this visit to Szechwan Palace, we ate off the Americanized Chinese menu.  The food was very well-spiced, flavorful, and freshly prepared.  We had the Mongolian beef and the Cashew Chicken.  Both dishes hit the spot!  The service was friendly and the decor is modern.

The place is owned and managed by very nice and sweet people originally from France so the menu is credible and legit. Service is great. Everyone is always checking up on you if you need anything.

Crema Coffee was absolutely crammed with locals for the several hours that I spent working using their strong and reliable wi-fi. Lots of people having business meetings, reading books, working on their computers and SAHMs with their tots (a bit of a minus but not enough to deduct a star - noise cancelling headphones are a godsend!).

The decor is classic, with vinyl seat cushions, grade school style pupitre chairs (you know, the wood ones) and beautiful masonite dog portraits along the cafe walls. There's a cute tip jar on the counter that declares ""Bad tippers are lame in bed!"" and a sticker on the front door of a dinosaur yelling ""Doorasaurus says roar, shut the door behind you!""

I worked along to Death Cab For Cutie's ""Plans"" and The National's ""Boxer"". Great soundtrack for working. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable, not to mention: cuuuute baristas. 

I had a large chai latte with soy milk ($4) and a homemade apricot and cinnamon iced tea (unsweetened). I was happy to see that they had liquid sweetener and I injected my drink with a shot of it. They also have a self-serve water cooler, which is a nice touch when the lineup is out the door and you don't want to burden the baristas with your water request.

As for food, they have desserts from Wanda's Pie In The Sky (brownies, dulce de leche, cookies) and cupcakes from Yummy Stuff in Parkdale. The red velvet cupcake that I had was absolutely perfect!! I was so happy to see it in the display case that I almost lunged for it. They also had - wait for it - a MAPLE BACON CUPCAKE. I didn't dare try it, but can someone please, and report back?",2009-06-18 13:46:54

I ordered delivery and I was happy that the food all came neatly packed and well organized. The delivery was also faster than the suggested time of arrival which is always a plus!

As an appetizer I got the N.H style pot sticker and I really liked them! They have a sauce on the top that balances the flavors really well. I also got the panang curry with white rice and I really liked the flavors and spice level. Even though this was ""mildly spicy"" it was still pretty spicy. The level though was perfect for me!

I've had both the Farm Chicken Sandwich & the BBQ Chicken Flatbread. The sandwich was not that great; I ordered it with American cheese & grilled onions ... & the fries that it came with left much to desire as they were ridiculously salty & greasy. The flatbread was not a much better alternative.

The price isn't worth the quality & the restaurant is out of the way from everything so I don't see myself making the drive out there much. Also, most of the seating is outdoors & there are a lot of flies. 2 stars is even being a little generous but it's nice to know they use local ingredients from the farm.",2014-07-07 06:00:18

A friend, Greg loves this place so I have gone with him.

I find the decor and feel of the place, cold and uninviting. We have always gone in what would be considered off dining hours so there were often no one else in the place but our table. We were always greeted with enthusiasm, but this is because Greg has one of those personalities that screams friendly and he always gets it in return. So our service has always been spot on.

But the food lacked inspiration. I have never had a dish that would pull me back on my own. It was never terrible or inedible, just blah.

But Greg loves this place and so do others I see. I am just not one of them.",2008-10-02 18:51:52

These chocolates use goods that are ethically sourced.  The flavors are thoughtful and complex.  Can I say...Glorious.

braKK7BTWHLB8unDohhEGw,YWWDhFvemd93HKof8D-QoA,XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg,4,9,5,6,"I'll just go ahead and get my main gripe out of the way: Mesa Grill is one of the most unimpressive looking 'fancy' restaurants that I have been to.  If it wasn't for the fact that it is in the middle of Cesar's Palace, I would have guessed that it was just your average South-Western/Mexican restaurant.  It was when the hostess asked me to remove my hat when I realized that they take themselves pretty seriously here, and thanks to the food, rightfully so.

My meal was delicious! I ordered the Tiger Shrimp Sweet Corn Tamale as an appetizer, the New York Steak as my main entrée, and mash potatoes as a side.  I actually had a difficult time selecting what I wanted, because although the menu is small, most of the items were unusual dishes that I wasn't interested in trying.  The menu consisted of a lot of seafood and less traditional meats, and I just wanted something basic.  Thankfully everything that I ordered turned out to be really good.  The highlight was the shrimp appetizer.  It was ridiculously priced for how tiny it was, but the combination of flavors was outstanding.  The theme of the meal in general was flavor, and everything from the bread to the pear margarita that I ordered pack a ton of it.  

In addition to my food, I tried my date's Pork Tenderloin.  It was amazing!  I would highly recommend it as a main dish, and it is most likely what I would order the next time I am here.

Mesa Grill is not a place that I could eat at all of the time, nor is it a place I would take someone to impress with ambiance.  However, they have superbly flavorful food that was well worth the visit.  It will not be one of my 'go-to' places when I visit the strip, but I can see myself coming back from time to time.",2014-12-10 00:46:17
Bb7TBgAnflzxwhTMwMG1rQ,52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,4,1,0,0,"Wow, first time posting a review in forever!  I've had a grand change in my life with new work and new town, and of course bunch of new restaurants to try!  I had all the intentions to catch up on all the reviews for the past 6 weeks or so, but then it became too many and now I've given up on that.  So now that I don't have to worry about that, I'm starting with today!  My first is an adorable big place called The Crepe in Tivoli Village.

There is so much to like about this place besides the food.   Will critique the food separately, but will bullet-point the rest:

 - The adorable, highly talkative owner Agnes
 - The special events every day and evening (readings, DJs, guests, tastings, you name it)
 - Big place with spacious room between seatings
 - In Tivoli, a very cool place
 - Absolutely divine crepe pancake that is light and paper thin
 - Fresh ingredients, many from local vendors, Agnes said
 - Not just a restaurant - I didn't pay attention too much but they have books, gifts, retail foods, etc.
 - Reasonable prices for an upscale feel (in a way)
 
Only thing I wasn't crazy about is the price of the beverages - high with no real choice for more reasonable quaffs.  Now, the food.

I had the France crepe, with ham, eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and parsley.  First of all, the crepe wafer is divine - light and paper thin, with slight crunchiness on the edges and soft in the middle.  It was just perfect.  The sauce was delicious, sort of bernaise-like but with a hint of sweetness that was ideal.   The taste was a bit peculiar, however.  Although they didn't mention it, there was a distinct taste of sage which I didn't think went well with the rest.  It overpowered the other flavors.   As a result, I wasn't in love with the overall flavor and this is the reason they don't get a 5-star rating.  But I can't wait to try the sweet crepes, which are what I really love anyway.  Tougher to mess that up on the inside on these and the wafer itself is divine, as I already mentioned.  That should make for a fabulous breakfast, and I'm DEFINITELY coming here on a weekend morning and ordering one of their sweet crepes and a cup of (again, expensive) joe.  That might cause me to bump this place up to a 5.

Table-for-1 Factor:  This is another big like for me.  Perfect for a solo guest to enjoy with their coffeehouse-like feel.",2014-07-21 22:22:46

Sunday Fundays should be started with food similar to what is on the menu at Mickies Dairy Bar. I woke last Sunday morning with a wee-bit of a headache, a dog breathing in my face, and my friends waking me telling me to get up for breakfast.
As someone who doesn't say no go greasy eggs and potatoes, I was all in.

My friends were veterans to the Mickies Dairy Bar scene. Me, being the newbie had no idea I was walking into shoulder-to-shoulder breakfast goers. We hunched around a table like a pack of wolves about to descend on some prey. As soon as the people got up from their table, game on. 

Our server was great. She arrived promptly, and never let my coffee get empty. No errors in our order either, and my friend's order was pretty fine-tuned/precise (she's a bit of a princess). Our food came out hot and plentiful.

I ordered the scrambler, aka a heart attack on a platter, and ate about a 1/3 of it. The eggs were good, but the potatoes were mushy and lacking in flavor. I tried adding hot sauce, as well as salt and pepper but it was still lacking in flavor. 

If hangover food is what you are looking for, this is your place. There is a lot of food, but from I tried, it is lacking in flavor. Would I come here again? Yes, if you are looking for greasy-spoon type food, but not if I was looking for a more flavorful classier breakfast.

It is loud. It is red and white. It is Wisconsin.",2013-02-12 04:57:53

It's set up to look like a dinner but the lights are slightly dimmed to cater to dressy attire as well.

Tartare- very good, if you like raw meat you can't go wrong.

Snail- never tried them before and for a first experience I would say they were seasoned appropriate for their texture and made them quite enjoyable.

Burger- we got it with extra foies gras. It's like a glorified cheese burger ... It had to be the most satisfying cheese burger I ever tasted. The foie gras adds to its fatty and greasy texture. Overall my favourite dish.

They have a steady flow of customers (many different cultures) in and out. Service from the ladies was meh but whatever, I'm here for the food.

Tried the bun bo hue. The kitchen is super fast at getting orders to tables. I read some of the previous reviews about people inside the kitchen not wearing anything to catch hair...yesterday I observed the kitchen staff and they were all wearing a mix of either hairnets, caps, and bandanas. So, they fixed this practice., which is good.

My bun bo hue was a one size bowl for $8.50. It was pretty well sized with lots of toppings, pork blood, pork meat, beef meat, and vietnamese processed ham. 

The soup was tasty and well seasoned (perhaps a tad on the saltier side), and had a nice kick of spice. The noodles were for the most part cooked well leaving a nice chewy bite, though some strands were undercooked and had a hard bite. I was not impressed with the meat... The beef and pork meat were so dry/tough/stale and not tasty. Seemed like all of the juices from the meat went into the soup.

What struck me was how dark it was, needing to use the server's pen-light or phone to see the menu - and the noise level such that the band could barely be heard, with conversation taking great effort. It was difficult to feel comfortable as our table was in a traffic pattern, continually passed by wait staff.
The service was extremely efficient (bordering on abrupt,) with perfect timing between plates.
The food was okay...just okay.  We ordered two appetizers (served one at a time), two lobster bisque soups (not so good,) and of course the ""claim to fame,"" warm butter cake. Portion sizes are generous so half of our food went uneaten, except the cake.  By dessert time we were full and brought it home...and yes it lives up to the hype.
All in all my experience was underwhelming.  The constant foot traffic ruined it for me.  On the other hand, I heard the band and accomplished my mission.

I called 3 times before going down there to make sure that I had everything  I needed  to rent the car. I walked down to their office and had all the paperwork they asked me for and my DEBIT card, which they said they accepted. I showed up and had to wait for her to finish her conversation about going out the night before before she helped me. When she finally turned around and asked how she could help me, I gave her my driver's license and my card and she turns to me and says sorry we can't rent to you using this card, gives me back my card, and turns around to continue talking to her coworker. She did not even tell me why we could not use my card or any other card. I have a credit card, I have other debit cards, but she did not even bother asking me if I wanted to use another card, instead, she just turned around, and continued gossiping. Even if she would have said sorry, can't take this card, do you have another? I would have been ok with it but she was too busy with more 'important' matters. Rude and no way to keep customers. 

I left there and just rented at Enterprise. Yes, they were a little bit more, but honestly, it is worth the extra amount if anything just for their service.

Dad ordered the scrod dinner. He said it wasn't bad. Salad that came with it looked good. Two sons ordered burgers with fries. They reported the burgers tasted better than Red Robin but not as good as 5 guys. The fries were big and tasty though! 
Lol teenaged boys! Other son ordered the shrimp marinara. Decent sized plate of pasta but only 5-6 pieces of little salad shrimp. Hubby ordered the chicken Parmesan. Looked pretty damn good. Serving was huge! Lastly I ordered the country fried steak dinner. Yuck. Wish I would have gotten the chicken parm. The country fried steak was submerged in some nasty, gelatinous brown gravy. It seemed like it wasn't fried hard enough if at all before submerging. Wasn't a fan. Place was clean. Wasn't busy at all. While I appreciate the persistence to keep the place clean it was VERY weird to see one of those white plastic sanitary napkin disposal containers attached to the front of the register stand. I'm so mad at myself for not taking a picture of it. 
Update: Today we stopped for lunch since it was a snow day. 3/4 of us had burgers. Not bad. Fries were fabulous like last time! I had the chili cheeseburger. Was tasty but I've had better elsewhere. 4th person had the chicken stir fry. Instant rice but he said otherwise it was tasty. Service was still great. Restaurant still looked clean! I did get that picture though....",2017-03-14 18:02:15

What a great event on a hot Summer day!  We went for an hour and ended up spending the day!!  We watched the qualifying races which were great fun.  All the race cars were so cute!  And a lot of them ran really, really fast!  We even got to hang out at the starting line.  Also, we were very amazed by the car shows.  There were Aston Martins, Austin-Healeys, Bentley's, Jaguars, Lotus', Mini's, MG's, and Triumphs.  There were Lamborghini's and Maserati's and Porsche's and heck, cars that I had never seen before!!  Plus, there were a lot of muscle cars from the 60's and 70's.  I was totally amazed!  This awesome event only comes once a year, every July, so get ready for next year!!

The lunch buffet is ample, with many vegetarian options, as well as a few meat choices. Almost without exception, however, every dish I've tried here is just too spicy. Now, I enjoy spicy food, and delight in the variety of chiles that are available, from the wonderful bite of a fresh green chile to the deeper and more complex flavors that dried chiles provide. What they use here at Tamarind is cayenne, which is a fairly one note chile that delivers little in the way of nuance and much in the way of simple heat. Then they overdo it, so the spiciness of the chile steps all over the other flavors. It's boring and frustrating, and I'm over it. They even put cayenne in their raita the other day. Raita, that wonderful, cooling yogurt delight, is supposed to be the foil, the relief from the intensity of the spiciness in the other dishes. You take a bite to give your palate a respite, a soothing vacation, from the food, not to intensify it. 

There were a couple of things I liked on the buffet...the Chicken Curry was very good, and I enjoyed the little fried veggie balls that they served with sambar and coconut chutney.

In any case this little cafe located @ J-Town serves an interesting combination of Italian and Japanese (Wafu) pastas, along with pastries and different flavors of coffee.

On my visit, there was only one waitress working the small seating area, but service still took rather long.  The waitress also forgot about our coffee orders once, but was at least apologetic and trying her best. 

The food itself was quite delicious -- the carbonara was creamy, eggy, and bacon-y, with green peas to add extra flavor, texture, and color to the cooked to al dente pasta. The other pasta we ordered, a wafu pasta, was interesting and good, though the carbonara was definitely superior.

There aren't many good pasta places in the area from what I know and each pasta dish is quite cheap ($10-$12, iirc), so this is totally worth a shot if you haven't tried it already!

The French are known for their Steak & Frite. I heard of this Entrecote Saint-Jean a few weeks ago and figured I'd give it a shot. 

Now. If your menu has only ONE item and your restaurant is jam packed like it was tonight, shouldn't the grub just blow me away? I think so.

While the restaurant is a thing of an age gone by beauty, the food isn't. 

It's simple. You get soup, salad, steak & frite and desert... let's go through them, because when I want to crush something I do it step by step.

Leek Soup. Not half bad, piping hot, but severely lacking in the seasoning department. 

Salad. The lettuce hadn't gone bad but some leaves were definitely damaged. The dressing was so so and very rare, as in barely a teaspoon of it for the whole salad.

The Steak & Frite. Now this is where I get bitchy. Firstly if you promise me match-stick fries, don't bring me frozen McDonald's like French fries. Secondly the steak... This is a French restaurant. The French who invented everything about cooking worth a damn, should know something simple, some very rudimentary about steak preparation. Once you take it off the heat YOU HAVE TO LET IT REST. It's the only thing on their fucking menu and they fuck it up. My plate was a bloody mess, completely screwing up the sauce. They have ONE thing on the menu and they haven't mastered it. What a shame.

Desert was the saving grace. Profiteroles, delicious and refreshing. But I doubt I'll be going back. When I don't finish a 6 oz steak, there's something wrong with this world.

The service was good, but never were we asked about how are meal was going, if it was any good. All in all it's a very pretty restaurant, with decent service, but really unimpressive food. I can't understand why it's so packed.",2012-08-26 04:06:21

Cons
- Small location

tESf_pE4gXKMLnEEWeIWNQ,_7zgzdB1Qog-HUWQdbH0pw,GIfZNMP0oIJCje_Xp0Bgrw,1,3,3,0,"My girlfriends and I were in town visiting friends from college, and we had tickets to a comedy show Saturday night at the Hilarities comedy club. After looking at a lot of menus online, we decided on the Greenhouse Tavern on East 4th. We had 8pm reservations and they were ready for us as soon as we got there, which is always nice. That was probably the only good thing about this whole experience. I'm not one to be very critical of dining experiences, as I can usually find anything good out of it, but I have to say I think our server was the worst part. Now, it could have been that he was just having a bad day, but he was not personable, and when we were asking questions, he almost seemed annoyed to have to answer our questions. Aside from that, they brought table bread for us, with a hummus spread. My friend was in the process of fixing herself a piece, and as soon as the last piece of bread was off that plate, someone came and took it away, even though she was still using the spread. Okkkkk we thought... moving along..

Our first course came, which was really good. I had the curried squash spaghetti, which was really good. No problems with that. Our next course came, and my friend had gotten an omelet dish. She had put her fork down with maybe 1/3 of her meal to go, and another waiter came over and picked it up to take it away! She quickly said ""I'm NOT done with that!"" and he put it down. This happened 4 times throughout the meal where they would just grab plates when we weren't done with our food. It was a little bizarre and we just kept laughing at disbelief. 

The portions aren't large, and I feel overpriced for what you get. I ordered a vegetarian dish that had ONE piece of tofu, ONE piece of a chick pea loaf, ONE carrot, and broth and it was $22. Seemed a little silly. After spending almost $50 and not having any alcohol, we left hungry and disappointed at the level of service in what seemed to be a higher-end establishment. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here nor would I ever visit this place again.",2011-03-28 15:53:07

The food, was good.  My go-to is coffee and a pastry.   The cruffin was absolutely delicious.   The chocolate croissant was amazing.  The ham croissant sandwich and the lox on brioche was as ok, but wished they'd toasted the brioche to avoid that super soft texture in each bite.   The side salad on each plate was good too.  

The fail was the actual coffee and service.   We got a regular coffee and a Guatemalan pour over.  

My Keurig makes a better cup of coffee than the regular they serve.   I like a plain old cup of coffee but this was awful.   Almost instant-like.  Very acidic, not much flavor beyond that.  And no one coming around checking if it was ok.   I was willing to try a second cup, as maybe the first one was just off, but I don't even know if you get a refill there for regular coffee because no one offered or checked.     

Now the Guatemalan pour over.   Waterlike, lukewarm and not much to it.  It filled 'grandmas' tiny floral teacup..and barely.   For $5, they could've put it in a coffee mug, not a teacup.   They had plenty of mugs all over the place with Gabis name on them, so it wasn't like they didn't have the mugs. 

Overall I gave 3 stars because of the coffee.  Maybe I'll bring my own from home or another coffee house next time, because the pastries were amazing.",2018-08-20 21:43:17

When I found out that Georges serves brunch, I called up my friend and said we had to give it a try. We decided to meet there this morning and lets just say I am now in love....

The restaurant is adorable. There are photos from Vogue all over the walls, my inner fashionista was screaming. We sat down and were greeted by our very friendly waiter. I ordered a cup of coffee and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was really delicious and actually pretty strong. 

We started with the beignets which were very fluffy and very delicious. We quickly scarfed those down and placed our order for Steak and Eggs Filet Mignon and I am very, very happy I did. 

The steak and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The steak was rare and incredibly flavorful and the eggs were perfectly poached. The hollandaise was some of the best I have ever had. The potatoes on the side weren't the best I've ever had, that would be my only complaint. 

In addition to the fantastic food, our waiter was incredible. I never saw the bottom of my coffee cup or water glass. He gave us suggestions of what to order and when we told him it was our first time dining at Georges, he brought us the dinner menu so we could take a look and see if we wanted to come back for dinner some time.

There was no one else around for at least 15-20 minutes. There were a few options on the menu. Both the strawberry and chocolate soufflés come with a sauce, while the lemon soufflé does not. I decided to try the lemon soufflé and the baked alaska. The baked alaska is an ice cream covered in a torched meringue. The ice cream changes daily. I was hoping for sesame, but today's option was Bailey's.

After 15-20 minutes, the beautifully torched baked alaska came out first. It had the aroma of roasted marshmallows and definitely tasted like marshmallows. The meringue was room temperature while keeping the ice cream cold inside. It's definitely my favorite of the two desserts I tasted. After 30 minutes, I was told that the soufflé was placed in the oven. It didn't come out until 45-50 minutes later. The soufflé was beautifully presented as well. I didn't care too much for the confectioner's sugar on the top, since it made me cough every time I took a bite, so I scraped it off. The soufflé was light and airy. It had the flavor and consistency of Japanese cheesecake (e.g. Uncle Tetsu). Although the soufflé is technically challenging and was executed well, I didn't care for it too much.

Overall, I think Sweet Note has potential. It's a 3.5 star in my books. The wait was a little too long, even for the first customer of the day. I didn't complain or ask, but they offered me 10% off for the wait.

Yuck & pricey! They've also gone from using good quality cuts of meat to some cheap stew meat that is laden with fat in the different currys, this has happened on several occasions.

The food is OK and the people are always friendly but it is starting to feel a bit overpriced for what you get. Nice atmosphere for dining in. I do recommend trying it and seeing what you think.

My friend ordered the Udon from the lunch menu which came with char siew or bbq pork belly in Ju's Special Broth, whereas I ordered their Asari Ramen which was limited only 10 orders a day - so I decided to give it a go!

Tea was served and service was good and they were attentive. The salad came first, presumably because of the lunch menu. We shared the salad, it was alright, nothing special about it.

My Asari Ramen noodles came next, which has tons of clams and it is supposed to taste ""light and rich in flavour"", which was very true. The broth tasted very light at first and the rich flavour after.

However the entire bowl of ramen was very plain as it was just tons of clams, with green onion and ramen noodles. For $16, they gave tons and tons of clams which I was delighted about, I mean, they had better gave a lot for charging $16.
A little tip that I did was to peel all the clams from their shells before tucking into the meal & I placed the shells in the empty salad bowl.

Next up was my friend's Udon, which came with 2 pieces of BBQ Pork Belly, green onions, drizzled with seaweed. My friend claimed that the meal was just alright, and had has better elsewhere. I've also tried the broth and their ""Special Broth"" didn't taste anything extraordinary.

They also had these condiments on the table. I would like to say that they are authentic Japanese spices but I don't know that much... It seems authentic with the Japanese writing and ingredients listed, etc. It is J-Town afterall! I just found it pretty cool:) .

Halfway down our meal, our server brought us the bill... I know we were late to their lunch service and they close before reopening for dinner service. But we still felt rushed and pressured to finish our meal without enjoying or savouring it... Ohwell.

Overall, this place was just okay to me. Even though I thought their Asari Ramen was their recommended/popular dish since they advertised it separately, it was just meh and nothing too special. Everything was just average here but I do like the service (before they rushed us by bringing the bill over). Servers were attentive, checked back on our meal and refilled our teas without us asking. It could also because we came late to the lunch service and there were not many customers were in the restaurant... thus we get all their attention, so to speak.

Felt like it wasn't worth the value and I definitely had better lunch elsewhere.",2016-06-28 00:28:40

Mr. Flay's establishment fit the bill perfectly.  Despite making a reservation through OpenTable, they could not find our reservation when we arrived.  Luckily, they were not crazy busy and could seat us.  Initially, the host left us with the wine/cocktail menu, and I was disappointed not to see any margaritas listed.  I thought this place was known for margaritas.  However, when our server came over and introduced himself, he asked if we wanted to see the margarita menu.  Uh, duh!  YES!  Quit toying with us!  He provides the menu and gives a few moments to contemplate.  I am torn between the cactus pear and white peach.  I opt for the cactus pear, and my husband choses smoke on the water or something like that, it's mezcal based.  My cactus pear is a tad too sweet, and my husband didn't care for his, but I liked it.  Then the bread basket arrives and all the breads are delicious, but I am smitten with the jalapeño one.  We try not to fill up as we decide to share the mushroom quesadilla with fried egg and salsa verde as an appetizer.  It arrives and we enjoy it as we eavesdrop on the table next to us, and hear one of the women ask, ""Is Bobby here?""  The server says no, he comes in the spring time.  (Ok, note to self, come back in the spring!)

For entrees, so many enticing choices, and I chose the mango spice crusted tuna steak.  My husband chose the 16 spice chicken and a side of sautéed spinach.  I was very happy with my choice and gobbled it up.  I also ordered another margarita, the Partida with a lot of salt on the rim.  I preferred this one over the cactus pear.  As for my husband, he said the chicken was just ok. I didn't taste the chicken, but I did taste the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes that accompanied the chicken, and they were excellent.  In my husband's opinion, the trick with the food was simply to add some sweet/savory chili sauce.  He believed even he could make the chicken (although he doesn't cook).  So if I'm not mistaken, I do believe that he indirectly challenged Bobby Flay to a throw down.  Now we really need to return in the spring time!  No dessert for us, we reached maximum capacity.

My boyfriend found out about this shop when the owner came in to buy a battery for his truck and invited him to check it out.  These past few months we've owned our vapes we WERE pleased with the service at first..  Big smiles and personable staff.

Today we stopped into a different vape shop  that's right around the corner from our home. Reason being my boyfriend's vape has been acting weird and hits weak.  Well the guy behind the counter was EVER so polite to check it out. He then pointed out this vape is a complete knock off after showing us their display and what looked to be a nicer version of what my boyfriend has. We've pretty much chucked it up as a loss since I know they don't want to hear it from us. I get it, it's retail business but selling people JUNK should be a crime.

I've come into this location and mentioned that my vape has a burnt taste to it. I was then told I was vaping ""too long"" and that's why I get that nasty taste. So I started counting how long I use it, each rip.  I also clean it vigorously with a Q tip and make sure the tank isn't leaking AGAIN, which it does frequently.  I've been replacing my tanks over & over until I finally stopped using it for a month or so out of frustration.  THAT and the fact I know from reading previous reviews they don't want to own up to anything or help anyone. FINE!  I rather take the $75 loss and take my money else where.

 I should of known the day this guy barged into the shop yelling about how they sold him a $300 dollar piece that was JUNK. This guy was livid, ranting about how he owns his own vape shop where he's from and he paid a taxi driver $60 bucks to get there from the vape convention that was going on.  I thought the guy was crazy.  After finding out my bf's piece is an $80 CLONE? I'm in disbelief they could do that knowing we were looking forward to coming back and spending good money.  Super pricey, won't recommend it to anyone I know ever again.",2014-01-27 03:43:10

The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and it's a 5-minute walk from there. Street parking is available but metered and hard to get - you can find free parking on side streets but check the zoning.

The place: It's pretty small and the tables are close together. The decor is simple and similar to most hipster-like places. The vibe is good and I found the place to be cozy and bright.

The goods: I ordered a latte and two eggs with sausage and potatoes. I don't know which roast these guys use but the coffee was awful. I found it a little bitter and there was a smoky taste to it that almost seemed burnt. In terms of food, it was solid and the portion was pretty darn good. I would have liked it to be hotter. One of my friends ordered the French toast and there was nothing left on his plate when everything was said and done. He mentioned it was a bit too sweet but nonetheless, he enjoyed it. 

Service: Good. We got there around 10ish and we were seated right away. The wait staff was friendly.

I wonder if it would have been the same if it was a host/hostess greeting us instead. The ""chef"" sat us out at the patio per our request, soon after we were greeted by our waitress.  Service in general was great considering our untimely arrival. 

We ordered a collection of dishes. The scallop entrée ($27) was fabulous. The 4 scallops were perfectly seared. The poached lobster small plate ($13) was small, and quite frankly the potato gnocchi stole the show. I could just eat a plate of the gnocchi instead (and ideally be cheaper). I am a foie gras newbie, only had it once before, and I found this one to be relatively tasteless. The duck confit offered great flavor, but the duck leg was surprisingly dry. The steak tartare was probably the best tasting and sizable appetizer out of all that we ordered.

So... Mom and I were at Khoury's for their ""birthday party"".  And we decided instead of partaking in the yummy smells coming from the food truck that we would mosey over to this Italian restaurant for a good, sit-down meal.  SO GLAD WE DID!  You walk in and it smells divine!

This is now my Go-To for when I'm hankering for Italian food.  I mean.. there's lots of Italian places in Henderson that are tasty... it's just that this one is easy to get in and out of on Eastern.  Plus, their menu has a little of everything for everybody from meat eaters to pizza lovers to carb loaders to everything in between.
AND I really like the homey, casual vibe inside.
+The bread knots!  Seriously... could make a meal out of these with some wine.  Be Careful... they are addicting!  And best enjoyed hot out of the oven!
+Arugula salad.... definitely shareable size. Super fresh and crisp!  The dressing is citrusy, tart, vinegary and went great with the green, peppery-ness of the arugula.  Just a hint of red onion and parm.  Perfecto!
+Chicken Marsala - good portion size... unless you are starving.. you will be taking some of this home with you.  I only ate about 1/2... and it tasted just as good the next night when I warmed it up for dinner. Comes with a side of pasta... I mean... the ""side"" was enough to feed like 3 people. I'm not complaining.  I even mixed in the left over arugula into the pasta so I felt like I was eating healthier.  ha!  Well... I got some greens into my meal at least.
+Capellini Andrea Korimba - this is a good size portion too... it's like baked pasta and eggplant parmigiana had a big baked baby.  YUM!  Mom took 1/2 of this home too. She said it was just as yummy the next day too.

Service was really good.  We arrived about 7:30pm on Friday and it wasn't packed so we were seated immediately and they brought out the addicting knots right away.

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving ""modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu.""  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL",2014-03-09 04:19:18

Menu also includes Specials for each day of the week + tons of combo options (w/ Soju), so it's good for groups.  And for vegetarians, there's even a menu for you!  Could be a downside if you're feeling indecisive that particular day.

There's a call button on each table which I thought was very good!  So you if you prefer, you'll be left alone.  Restaurant itself is much, MUCH LARGER than it appears, quite updated contrary to the location.

Sides were just ok in my option, only 3 for 2ppl.  However, I did bump into an old acquaintance who was there and she had like 6 different varieties.  They were smaller, but I did notice that she had different items.

I ordered the Soon Tofu (w/ tuna) + Beans Rice ($10.99) and it was hot (temperature-wise), quite spicy (to the point my nose was running), & sour all at the same time.  I was turned off by the 'sour' taste which probably was from the loads and loads of kimchi that was inside.  Tuna was probably a quarter/half of a can.  Tofu stew did not come with a raw egg and I didn't notice egg as an ingredient.  Still not as good as my usual tofu stew place, so perhaps I shouldn't have ordered this.

MAKE A RESERVATION

They say you don't need a reservation, but if you don't want to be treated like you're second class you had better make a friggin' reservation.  We went there once without a reservation because the dummy on the phone told us we didn't need one.  So imagine our surprise when we showed up and the host looked utterly taken aback when we said we didn't have a reservation.  After fumbling through some papers on his little wooden podium, he advised us that it would be a 45 minute wait for a table, (even though there were no other people waiting and we could see several empty tables) and in the mean time we could wonder around the restaurant and look at their decor.  What?!?!  It was like six different kinds of retarded.

But Morrissey's Irish Pub has come to the rescue more than once.

The food ranks somewhat above the average bar food, and on holidays like mother's day and St. Patrick's day, they run a variety of specials. Their corned beef is actual corned beef and not that bizarre red stuff wrapped in plastic. Breakfast is hearty (perhaps a bit too hearty) but affordable. I recommend the short stack of pancakes with extra syrup. 

I like that the restaurant portion of the pub is completely blocked off from the bar. Smoke doesn't trickle in and, except for the weird 70s and 80s progressive rock, the dining area is very quiet. We enjoy going here after we've been working in the yard to enjoy the frigid air conditioning and tall backed booths.

I don't know if this is a chain or not, and I'm not sure if it matters. I love the decor of old photographs featuring men with slicked back hair and severe looking women. The women in the photos, by the way, look nothing like the buxom bronze statue in front of the pub. O.o

We choose to get ham and pineapple on ours to make it a Hawaiian pizza-my favorite.   I can honestly say this is the best pizza in Pittsburgh.

When I go there for lunch, i usually go to Lemongrass for their speedy service in getting the food out or the Vietnamese place for Pho or Vietnamese sandwich. The sandwich from this place is good, $3 on average, so this Vietnamese place is actually not bad but the rest of the restaurants are just under par and hence two stars for food as a whole for this mall.

* Fresh Rice Noodles with five star general fried chicken (Spicy)

The noodles came with corn, pickled carrot (?) and peanuts. The meat was also served on the side. The fried chicken was awful, had a lot of bones and barely any meat. The beef tenderloin was unfortunately mostly fat.

The noodles came out fairly quick and honestly it did not look appealing. The taste was just not right, it had a burnt taste and lacked depth in flavour. It was spicy but that's all, it was an overall disappointment. I couldn't even stomach to finish it. Not sure why anyone would come here, it's awful.

Having reservations for 7:30pm we arrived on time and were told that our table was not yet ready and that we would have to wait at the bar (until the current customers left). We were given menus and shown to a bar table. The waitress in the bar area was, to say the least, lost/confused/stunned. We ordered 2 margaritas and 1 Coors and 1 Diet Coke. The Margaritas came out within 5 minutes. The waitress then walked by our table with the Coors and pop and put them on the table next to us. The people told her the items were not theirs....she left the drinks there and went to the bar. She returned a few moments later and took them off their table and brought them to ours. Really? What if that other table had tampered with our drinks? Not cool and surprising as she only had 4 or 5 tables ordering drinks.

At 7:50pm, the manager came over and said that they had prepared a table in the sunroom at the back...a comfortable room with amazing views of their patio and surrounding trees...I was surprised at how comfortable it was.

Once seated, we expected someone to be by shortly to take our order or ask if one of us wanted a refill of our empty drinks. We waited and waited and waited until finally at 8:20 (1/2 hour after being seated at our table)...one of us flagged down the male server in the room and asked for a glass of water. This server walked past our table several times (while we were waiting) and not once did he greet us, acknowledge us, ask any of us if we wanted a drink refill...nothing...Nada. It was though we were invisible to him.  When he brought the water out we asked if he was our server as we wanted to order (remember, it was 8:20pm and we have been at this restaurant since 7:30). He mumbled something and responded that he didn't know, but that he would take our order. He took out a pad and paper and asked us what we wanted...never making suggestions or engaging us at all. He was, perhaps, one of the worst servers I've ever encountered in a restaurant. 
Anyways, we started with nachos....they were very good, although small for the price. 3 of us ordered the taco sampler....4 small tacos of fish, steak, pastor (pork) and chicken. The fourth person ordered Alambre Supreme (he said it was fantastic) Our food came out staggered...the 3 orders of the taco sampler came out and we waited for the Alambre to arrive. It came out approx. 5 minutes later (somewhere Gordon Ramsey is screaming as this is a major no-no at a restaurant). 3 of the tacos on the sampler were bland (the pastor one was wonderful) until one of our group said that they thought they had read that it came with sauces. When the manager came by to see how everything was, we asked if the tacos came with sauce. He acknowledge that they did and rectified the issue immediately. Shouldn't our server have noticed this? The place is called (translated to English) I Love Tacos, after all. The sauces, while good, did not make up for the flimsy tortillas that fell apart while being eaten....or our server who flipped us off during our meal. 
Anyways, dinner for 4, which came to $142, included:
2 Margaritas, 2 Coors (draft) and 1 Diet Coke
1 Order Nachos (good)
3 Taco Samplers (average)
2 Side orders rice (awful)
1 Order Alambre Supreme (excellent)

No more Lunch Specials but their ramen is quite reasonably priced from $8.50.

Spicy Ramen Level 2 was quite satisfying . This may not be a ""Japanese"" owned ramen restaurant but quality and quantity both decent. Noodle cooked with a good point and the broth was spicy and rich. The most standout experience though was the friendly and attentive service.

I would be back to Koi Sakana when I have some ramen craving up at Richmond Hill.

Long story short, my dog  had to go to a vet hospital. The dog had a very enlarged prostate and UTI. The vet hospital provided antibiotics to help fight the infection and recommended the dog get neutered the following week. During that procedure I could opt to have a biopsy performed on the prostate to rule out BPH vs. cancer. They sent copies of everything to Dr. Anderson's. I contacted Dr. Anderson's office three times , three different days, and was told each time Dr. Anderson would review the material and call me back. Two times I was put on eternal hold and hung up on. When I didn't receive a call back (almost two weeks from my dog's emergency visit) I sought a new vet because the dog was off antibiotics for a week and appeared to have a UTI again. In two days I solidified a care and surgery plan for my dog  with the new vet. I called Dr. Anderson's to inquire when I was going to receive a call back. I got to speak with Dr. Anderson and he informed me he's been really busy (no apology). He looked at the documents from the vet hospital and tells me the document says to get the dog neutered. I informed him the document also suggests a biopsy. Dr. Anderson then informs me they don't perform biopsies and doesn't feel it's necessary.  I ask why it took so long to get this information and his reply was ""I don't know what to tell you"".  I asked if I would have gotten faster service if I actually had an appointment and he said it probably would have been better. I ask him why his staff didn't suggest that in any of the three phone calls I made. Instead, I'm told by his staff that I would receive a call back that day. Sensing no concern or remorse,  I informed him I found a new vet and was no longer bring my dog to him because I've lost confidence. He proceeded to tell me I need to go where I'm most confident.

Although, I didn't come here for the Mexican Sushi that's so popular I got an order of Carne Asada fries because I haven't had any that are on par with the famous San Jose Iguana's or La Victoria Nacho Fries here. Looking for the next best thing I suppose.

The shop is small, but with ample seating and serves tacos, shrimp cocktail, mexican sushi, dessert and of course carne asada fries. For drinks they have the aguas frescas and soda. Adorned all over the register are small snacks and candies, many of which I grew up eating like De La Rosa Marzipan, Vero Mango, Lucas, all the spicy Tamarindo types and pinwheel chips.

I ordered the Carne Asada Fries and Horchata for about $9, not bad for a large lunch. The fries aren't typical fast food fries and have that little battered type texture around the fries, meat is a bit small in portion. The sour cream and guacamole were scooped neatly on top. A bit plain in my opinion so I topped it with pico de gallo, lime, tomatillo salsa, jalapenos and that spicy mayo that comes on the side of their Mexican sushi. It was good, but nothing mind blowing. Their salsa bar is pretty good, definitely one of the better tomatillo salsa's I've had here. Still definitely better than Filiberto's Carne Asada fries that's for sure! Horchata was good, not too sweet but not the best Horchata I've had in PHX. Definitely needs a little more cinnamon, however still good and you can tell it was made fresh.

The shop is clean, big and the staff is friendly and fast. The only con is that the parking lot is limited and it's on a main road, so dining here during rush hour can be a struggle.",2015-05-19 21:35:14

The buffet of $16 includes one drink (Bloody Mary or Frozen Mimosa). The buffet contained a salad, chef tended omelette station, egg's Benedict, boneless chicken fingers and waffles, potatoes with peppers and onions, bacon, sausage, and bagels with toppings like smoked salmon. 

My omelette was really good and made well. I also liked the potato mix and found the bacon to be made at the perfect crispy level - though you had to dig for it as there were a lot of fatty pieces. The Benedict and the chicken and waffles were really basic - literally plain chicken fingers (great stand alone option if you brings kids I guess) and plain waffles. 

For the price though you can't beat it and both of the free drink options were good. There is a nice bricked patio out front. And our waitress was really nice. She kept checking on us, she was super friendly, and when she accidentally dropped a knife near one of us when she was clearing a table she gave him a free drink. Proactive and full of smiles.

Wanting to break the monotony of the same cuisine with one of my friends, I had suggested coming here. The large restaurant was steady, but nowhere near full capacity. 

Both of us were hungry enough to get an appetizer to share, and individual entrees. To start, I had ordered the crispy pork intestines for us. They were not quite crispy, but they were melt in your mouth. Unlike most intestine I have had, this one was stuffed with green onions and then fried until the outer layer was golden brown like the skin of a roasted duck. The hoisin style and chili sauce complimented the meat while the pickled diakon and carrots helped cleanse the palate of greasy. I followed this up with the ginger scallion duck with rice. You can get a full order, for $12, but I don't think it comes with rice. Plus no matter how hungry I am, I couldn't eat a family portion on my own. So for $7-$8, it was a good serving. Now this is where Island started to lose me. The dish was rather bland. Normally I don't complain about that in Asian food, but with strong flavors such as ginger and scallions, it should be more prevalent and bold. The pieces of meat were the bonier pieces over the rib cage, so most of my time was spent picking off bits of meat. What I did get off of the bone was dry. My friend got the BBQ pork fried rice and Malaysian coffee. He seemed to be happy with his order. 

The food warrants three stars, but the service made me want to move it to a four. All the servers here were attentive to our water glasses and as soon as food was placed on the counter, it was moving towards a table.

The 3rd time was when I started see the service issues. Don't get me wrong, on my third visit Kazuma gave me one of the best haircuts I had ever gotten, but the problem was in the service. Because he gave me a haircut first it seemed the timing for taking other clients kind of clashed with mine. I felt like my perm solution wasn't left on nearly long enough to take full effect. This was seen soon after when I started to notice less waves. Perhaps it was because my hair was getting too long and pulling down the curls...but I don't think so. 

So since I found my hair lacking volume I booked an appointment only 14 weeks from my last appointment. My hair had a few split ends and since I loved my haircut I decided to book in for a digital perm and cut again. I think he took it too short and I really didn't want my bangs touched but I trusted him since I loved my last haircut. This time I didn't feel he put as much effort into cutting my hair as last. But the real bummer during this appointment was the assistant rinsing my hair. After the perm solution was done processing she hardly rinsed my hair!! Ahhh!!! As a former hairstylist I have to stress how important it is to rinse the hair entirely for 5 minutes to get all of the perm solution out or the hair strand traps the perm inside once the neutralizer is applied. Big no no!!
And to top it off, some guy walked in and wanted to push his appointment forward so Kazuma squeezed him in while I processed for 20 minutes in the rods. That's fine, but still....I didn't appreciate that. And I also think my appointment was cut short. The assistant didn't book enough time for a perm and cut because by the time I was done my last rinse Kazuma was busy with his next client and couldnt finish my hair. I will go back for digital perms alone. As for haircut I'm not too sure now because I didn't like the scheduling involved. I'd rather book perm only and do a haircut another visit. That's why I docked one star...assistant needs more training and scheduling needs improvement.",2013-07-02 02:47:13

We called and spoke to Caitlin who could not have been nicer to see if we could check in early as we had arrived ahead of schedule. She assured us that our room would be ready and told us to come in. Upon arrival Caitlin was busy with another guest. We were approached by a woman who didn't have a name tag. She said nothing but just looked at me. I said I would like to check in. She asked if I had stayed here before and I answered yes. She said the code for the internet had not changed. I said I was unable to remember it from my last stay and I received a stare then she wrote it down. We were given a room on the 4th floor and we hauled our luggage to the room.  Someone had just left and it was not prepped and actually was disgusting. I called the front desk and she told me that she thought the room was ready and would check to see if something else was available. I asked since we were in the building and on the 4th floor could she see if there was anything in that rae so we wouldn't have to transport luggage to another area of the hotel as one of the two elevators was down. She said hold on and she would check. Now were sitting in someones dirty room and on hold for 10 minutes. I left my wife on hold and walked to the front desk where this person was sitting down chatting while my wife was still sitting on the phone in the dirty room. No apologies she just gave me a room on the 5th floor and turned away.  I called the next shift at the front desk and asked that the manager call me which never happened.

I ordered beef samosas, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan.  Note: rice does not come with meal - you have to order it. 
The beef samosa was ok. Having made them myself with my ex Pakistani mother in law (who is a great cook), I do expect a certain level of deliciousness.  This level includes and is not limited by:  all around flavour, texture of the meat and peas and the overall cooked finished product.  Like I first mentioned it was ok.  I found it lacked body and the meat was a bit too soft and I missed a subtle sweetness and fresh burst of a green pea.  I think the samosa were a bit overcooked in the fryer.

The fries tasted just the same, which I really enjoy. The fries are cut there and fresh. A regular fries can easily feed 2 people. Don't go for the larger size, you'll regret the cost and having so many extra fries.

I enjoy the simple menu and you get to decide what toppings you want on your burger. There are several options to choose from.  

The free peanuts is a nice touch to snack on before your meal is ready..I always enjoy a handful.

With this location, the biggest issues were the floors were dirty and the music being played was VERY loud. I'm at a place to eat, not a rock show or club.

While walking down Baldwin Street (in itself a hidden gem and amazing downtown surprise) I came across this cute little Italian restaurant. I was tempted to try it already, and then discovered the three-course for $15 lunch menu! Sold!

I was a bit skeptical about how good my meal would be, as so many places offering these type of deals cheap out on the quality of the final product. However, I needn't have worried. The tuna bruschetta was an interesting twist on the average bruschetta appetiser, and was pretty tasty - perfectly seasoned tuna served on white Italian bread topped with tomatoes. Unfortunately it wasn't perfect - the bread was a bit soggy, not the freshest. Then again, we did visit on a holiday. No fresh deliveries that morning, perhaps? The vegetarian risotto I had for mains was packed full of flavour, with the peppers and mushrooms cooked to perfection. The risotto was a nice consistency, not gloopy and stodgy, but not overly watery either. As with all risotto dishes, it was totally filling and left me feeling that I had definitely got my money's worth. 

The caramelised topping of the crème brulee dessert seemed slightly burned, but other than that, the final course was sufficiently tasty and a perfect way to round off our unexpected lunch on Baldwin.

The service was fantastic. Our server was genuine, friendly, speedy and made us feel very welcome even though her shift was soon to finish.

I'd definitely return here. I don't know anywhere else in Toronto where you could get such a cheap three-course lunch with the quality of food, nice ambience and excellent service on offer here.",2014-08-05 16:20:59

The ambiance at either the Uptown and NoDa location are so fun. I love the eclectic Parisian theme with the odds and unmatched furniture and décor.

The place is huge and has tons of seating as well as a great outdoor patio I love to sit in and people watch.
The service is always friendly and the desserts make me feel like I've stepped into a European bakery. If stopping in for lunch, this is a great place for a light sandwich and soup, but isn't the best spot if you're looking for big portions. The breakfast sandwiches are delightful.
I love the uptown location because you can watch the staff create all of the delicious desserts that you serve. I am telling you NOT to get a window seat if you are on a diet. One look at the salted caramel being swiped over the tin of brownies and I'm DONE.
The macaroons are delicious and the perfect amount of chewy and light. The only thing I would call out to the staff is it would be great if the staff could label the kinds of macaroons. It gets old in line hearing the poor staff member recite each flavor over and over. Sure, yellow is easy to imagine would be lemon, but do you know how many potential flavors light brown macaroons could be? Cappuccino? Chocolate? Spicy hot chocolate?

We decided on the California Coffee Bar because it was close to our house and they had been at the latest community Yelp party.  The inside of this place gives off a homey feel with lots of wood colors everywhere.  The coffee bar is situated in the middle of the restaurant here with seating on both sides and had a number of different pastries which you could also buy.  Last but not least there is an elevated seating area complete with wall fireplace.

For breakfast on this morning I decided to get a 12 oz dark roast coffee and a Greek yogurt bowl while my wife also went with a 12 oz dark roast and an oatmeal bowl.  In both their oatmeal and Greek yogurt bowls you are allowed to choose 3 mixins and so I went with chia seeds, bee pollen and raspberries while my wife went with strawberries, granola and local honey.  Within a few minutes our food was delivered to our table and looked quite pretty.  It ended up tasting very good as I made the correct choice with the raspberries and bee pollen providing some sweetness to the natural tartness of the Greek yogurt.  My wife also really enjoyed her oatmeal and loved the toppings that she picked, especially the local honey.  Last but certainly not least is their coffee which i found to be flavorful, strong and most importantly smooth.

Lemon Cupcake: it was decent. It has a lemon curd filling and buttercream icing. It wasn't lemony enough for me but then again I LOVE lemon. 

Red Velvet Overload (I think): it had a cream cheese filling with cream cheese icing and it was SO moist and chocolately. OMG!!! It was so good. I had to take that home to finish it off. So glad my dude is not a chocolate fan. I needed that cupcake all to myself. 

Berries Cupcake: Really fresh and not too sweet. I love fresh berries in my cake. The icing was so light and whipped to perfection. Basically we're going with this one. 

She's so accommodating with doing something different as we want to make them our baby reveal cupcakes, so when people bite into them it'll reveal the gender.

The other order of BBQ wings were great  it's amazing what a bit of prior warning can do. 

Brushchetta :  Crudely cut tomatoes, minimal to trace levels of garlic and basil on quite dry bread, had a look at menu and there's meant to be red onions in it too. It was just large tomatoes in oil.  Appearance , color is there,  bland, left most of it.

 I usually get the beef combo and you choose what type of meat you want. I get the skirt steak and the rib eye. This is to me the best combo  everything else  is  included like the brisket and steamed egg and spicy tofu soup. They call it spicy miso soup.

 Then they start the cooking process and tell you what's what like the cheese dip and the sauce for the meat. 

 Now you have to appreciate the whole cooking process as these guys and girls are bending over cooking your food the whole time. This is cool as I don't have to get dirty... lol but the workers say that they are used to it!! 

 Then as you are eating they will come back and check on you to see if you need refills on any of the sides.

We are within walking distance and it has a great location right on Brookline Boulevard. I wish they made their own ice cream (they use Hershey's ice cream) but the wide array of flavors certainly makes up for this.  My go to is the salted caramel which is the perfect mixture of sweet and savory. They also have a tasty birthday cake and many chocolate options including mint moose tracks.  I have to mention their homemade birthday cakes which are cakes with a layer of your choice of ice cream.  My only compliant is that the actual cake gets stale pretty quickly.

Having enjoyed the one in DC for dinner in the past, and more recently a stop at this Charlotte one on a food tour for a drink and dessert, we already had fond memories of Vapiano.  (me more-so than Husband, as he still debates the ""cafeteria"" style).

Anyway, Sunday morning in Uptown staying at the nearby Omni, we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  (There was one other couple who seemed very happy with their breakfast).

TIP: Get the breakfast pizza!  There are a few to choose from. Husband got one with bacon and sausage and it was way bigger and way yummier than he expected.  Had we known, we would have shared it.  (I still stole bites of his).

My Italian ""Crepe"" was way heavier than I expected. It was quite thick and hearty.  Turkey and Spinach in it were good...tomatoes, not overly fresh as it's off-season for them.  I found myself digging out the insides to eat and leaving the heavy ""crepe"" to be sadly discarded.  (hate wasting food!)

I had seen some previous reviews on Yelp but hadn't thought to check the place out. My parents were in town today and saw a full-page feature in the New Times on this place, so my dad suggested trying it. By the time we arrived after our delightful yoga class at Urban Yoga (how very Central Phoenix - I know, I know), it was about 1:40 and the place was completely empty. Sometimes, that can result in a less-than-enthusiastic greeting from owners or waitstaff but the man who greeted us was friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we were there. I love that. 

He took our drink order right away. The sodas were a little under-carbonated but no big deal. Easily fixed, for sure. My mom raved about her iced tea, so no complaints there. 

The menu was a little smaller than I expected (the owner later explained that he wanted to start more minimal and then branch out after getting a customer base, which is a good strategy IMO), but several things stood out to me. My dad and I ordered loat chat, worm-shaped rice noodles, but substituted tofu for beef (not immediately obvious that we could do this but we were gracefully accommodated), and the stir-fried shrimp (came with white rice, pickled vegetables and an egg roll). My mom chose the chicken noodle soup and we also got some fresh spring rolls for the table. 

All of the food came out very quickly and was extremely flavorful and robust without being too greasy or salty. The shell-on shrimp were a particular favorite of mine - although they were very messy to eat, they were very tender and had a nice kick to them. The rice noodles were also great and the shredded egg on top was a delicious touch. 

All in all, our meal was great - and affordable, to boot. All of our drinks, entrees and the spring rolls came out to only $34 including tax and tip. The owner was also great and we all loved his passionate approach to his business. He even told us that he opened the place because he was told that a Cambodian restaurant wouldn't survive in this city.

Shame on me for randomly judging because The Vig is by far one of my absolute favorite restaurants. 

The atmosphere is relaxing but fun. It definitely has a bar type feel but the Uptown location is much larger than the original location off of Indian School. It has about three times the number of booths and a huge outdoor space. The bar area is spacious and the environment itself is just really calm and modern. 

The food. Can we talk about the food?! It is I-N-S-A-N-E. Try having giant tator tots stuffed with cheese. Or a queso dip that will make you scrap the bottom of the bowl. OR...THE MAC AND CHEESE. Seriously. The Vig is not messing around: they even circle for you on the menu and have a big arrow that points to it and says ""wow!"" At first I thought that was kind of arrogant and gimmicky but really, this dish is iconic.

- The boozy, housemade horchata situation.

- The drink thing with the whole egg in it also contains crème de mure, stout, and whiskey.

- There is a literal smokeshow that accompanies the Lawless (a tobacco-smoked glass of bourbon, wormwood liqueur, and house-made ""truck stop bitters."")

-  Vodka's day at the spa in my mouth: grapefruit liqueur, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, rose flower water.

- The cheese plate. Fig spread. Good bread. Pungent chevre.

Upon entering it was noticeable that all 3 employees had set up camp in the lobby and had to get up to take our order at 11:30. I would think that should be a lunch rush, but the place was EMPTY. During our entire stay till around noon not another sole had come in and the staff resumed life at base camp in the lobby.

The sandwich... #9 has been craved for years, and oh I have eaten many from 1976-1985 near my Campus of Buchser High, and SCU. I also have many fond memories of a efficient, bustling, and energetic Togos. I remember the pans of hot steaming Pastrami that the sandwich makers would dip the tongs in to fill your sandwich. Today with modern technology a microwave is used to warm the cold pastrami as its ordered. The taste was close but it was the bread itself that was way off. The bread was probably better then day old and the crust cracked but not in a tasty crunchy way.

I tried again, and I do feel bad for the Arizona Franchise owners that have never found the magic of one of the greatest sandwich shops ever opened.",2017-07-05 23:20:42

The meatball while good, had a flavor reminding me of a peppered beef stick/jerkey.  I will try the sausage next time.

While there were plenty of other, much less expensive, restaurants I could've taken my girlfriend, unbeknownst to her, I planned to propose to her over dinner and the occasion called for something special.  Upon stepping through the door and up until we left several hours later, Joël Robuchon exuded style, class, opulence, and Franco/Vegas charm in all facets of its operation. We elected to have the 16 (or so)-course degustation menu.  The team of wait staff was off the charts with its informed, surgically precise, personable, but never ""stuffy"" service throughout our meal.  Likewise, the sommelier was spot on with her wine recommendations (we had two splits, one white and one red), which were surprisingly affordable and very well suited complements to the varied courses of food received.

Our meal started off with a bread cart, which was more aptly described as a boulangerie on wheels.  Every type of French style bread or roll was present and was served with amazingly creamy butter and an exotic sea salt.  After the bread, came our culinary Tour de Force.  We received the following...

La Cerise - Cherry gazpacho with pistachios and ricotta ice cream
La Tomate - Salad of tomato with basil infused olive oil, tomato gelée topped with mozzarella  
Le Caviar - Red turnip and radish with yellowtail carpaccio, delicate cream of corn, caviar on a fennel cream served as a surprise
La Saint-Jacques - Pan seared sea scallop in green curry and fresh coriander
Les Crustacés - Truffled langoustine ravioli, Sea urchin prepared in ""chaud-froid"" with anise juices, spiny lobster served atop spinach in a black Malabar pepper sauce
Les Petits Pois - Sweet green pea veloute with vegetable aroma and hints of mint
Le Foie Gras - Seared foie gras with red berries and kumquat compote
Le Bar - Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks
Le Boeuf - Grilled beef rib-eye, black olive and bone marrow condiment
Le Broccolini - Broccollini and soybean sprouts cooked as a risotto
Le Pop-Fraise - Fresh strawberries and strawberry mousse with Rosé Champagne cream and soursop sorbet
Le Dome - Black fruits on a delicate chocolate fondant and dolce.

Our meal closed with the Le Moka-Le Thé, a cart filled with over 35 different Mignardises.  It was the proverbial sweet finale to an amazing meal!  Every course was beautiful in its presentation, but easily matched by the complex, yet exquisite flavors delivered with every bite.  In truth, I can't pick a favorite course since they were each amazing in their own unique way.  It was definitely not traditional French bistro fare.  

Joël Robuchon was the perfect choice for our most special occasion.  I highly recommend it for yours.  And if you were still wondering...she did say, ""Yes"".",2013-07-23 04:22:04

After walking up the stairs and peering into the place, I was overwhelmed by how spacious and massive it looks. The sign says it can hold 145 persons.

Ordering here is straightforward. Read the menu, pick your sausage, a side if you want, a beverage etc. and then pay your bill. You get a number and you place it where you are seated. The staff are polite, helpful, and chilled out. If you're the type of diner who needs seclusion and privacy while seated, you probably won't find it here unless they aren't busy.

Must-try items:
Duck Fat Fries

The turkey-chicken sausage tasted just like I imagined, it was absolutely delicious. You get 2 free toppings so I chose sweet onions and sweet peppers. I'll try other toppings and meats in the future. It was my first time ever trying duck fat fries and it was strangely delicious. The meal was fun to wait for and eat.

It's got a rustic korean street food flare to it and the meat selected for grilling is perfect late night beer, soju, and makgeoli food. Back to the meat, it has to be the best selections of pork by far for alcohol. They do also serve two other types of beef cuts but they mostly serve pork.

Me and my friends ordered the Kookminhakygyo Assorted that included Pork belly with and without skin, pork jowl (fucking amazing), pork skirt steak, and pork shoulder butt.

IMPORTANT*** 
You have to cut up your pork belly otherwise the cooking will get no where and fret not, they have scissors for you to do so and you can control how big or small your pieces of pork belly can be. 

You can cut up the other pieces of meat but I preffered not to.

They also get you a STEAMING pot of Egg Souffle (that's what me and my friends called it because we have no idea what it was called - Korean Steamed Egg I believe) and it was SO FLUFFY!!! So mouthwateringly delicious and hot and refreshing! I love the extremely light flavour and broth/extra flavouring they used to steamed it with if they did at all and this is a must! In fact we ordered another one because it was so good.

The whole grilling experience comes with thinly sliced green onions and garlic, pickled onions and jalapeños, bean sauce and salt and sesame oil to dip, and lettuce to wrap. The side dishes were radish and cabbage kimchi and the soup was a light kimchi vegetable soup with very small amounts of beansprout in it.

We also ordered two Vegetable Bibimbaps for our Vegan/Vegetarian friend. Our first order had radish kimchi in it so they couldn't eat it because they can't tolerate spicy due to health concerns, however the server was very nice and the kitchen staff was very accomodating to remove the radish kimchi and add more of the other vegetables present for my friend in our second order.

Last but not least, never expect shit service here because the service is here is AMAZING. The servers are SO WONDERFULLY NICE. They were always smiling and very courteous and even though the place was jam packed at midnight on a Saturday, the service was very fast because these servers know what they're doing.

I called the hotel front desk to find out what the $250 charge was for. She said that the maid found marijuana in the trash can. She also told me the room had a marijuana odor. She said that I had signed a form saying that I would receive this charge if there was any smoking in the room. 

When I originally booked the room I requested a smoking room. Upon checking in I was offered upgraded rooms for an extra charge. I declined and asked for a smoking room with a view. I am assuming that this is how my room was switched from smoking to non, but I'm not sure. I was never told if my room was smoking or not. 

I was told there would be $100 deposit for incidentals. I was never aware of any extra fees that could have been incurred due to smoking in the room. I was never told do not smoke in the room. I never saw a no smoking sign in the room. 

The room was left clean. The tobacco from the inside of a cigar is actually what was left in the trash can. I sprayed the room with Ozium and made sure there was no odor of marijuana. 

I am disappointed and will not return because I didn't receive any notification that I was going to receive this charge, I was unknowingly booked into a non-smoking room, and because I have stayed at GVR before with friends and have never heard of this being an issue. 

Not only will I never return to GVR, I will never return to any station casino.

On top of all this there was a party going on in the room next to mine and the smell of fish was quite strong. Could hear everything going on in the next room when the tv was off.

This was a free midweek stay offer I redeemed Through the MyVEGAS app. This all seems like a scam and I will be sure to update my review as this all plays out. 

The manager told me I would be receiving an email tonight with the paper work I signed at the time of check in. I have yet to receive this email. I was promised a call back for tomorrow and can't wait to see how that goes.

Cooking style is divided into categories as Bites, Smalls, Greens, Ocean, Ranch and Farm. Having visited the San Diego ""Gas Lamp"" store, I was also impressed at the Scottsdale location which reminds me of an awesome bachelor pad.

Looks like from what I remember, Searsucker Scottsdale pretty much duplicated the menu and design of the Diego mother ship. But after a while I would expect Smith to put his own stamp on the menu.

In California I learned to enjoy stout from a beer knowledgeable gal at the tap room. So I see Karl Strauss Imperial Stout on the menu and since I have been to Karl's I go for it. It pours black. Coffee dominates with some cocoa and roasted malts. Taste is very smooth. $12 for the bomber, a 22 oz.

I've been here 4 times so far: 1 breakfast, 1 lunch, and 2 dinners.  Let me tell you- this place is A-MAY-ZING!

For breakfast, my husband got the tryst omelette and I got the pancakes.  The omelette was awesome and the pancakes were so good that my husband said he wanted to go into the kitchen and hug the cook.  The portions are hearty (I got a side of sweet potato tots as well) so I actually took home leftovers of the pancakes!  Leftovers of pancakes!  Seriously!  They were sweet and what I loved most about them is that when totally drenched with syrup, they still held together!  I hate when you end up having those few chunks of pancake that are so drenched that they fall apart and are too sweet to eat anyway.  Not here.  So amazing.  Even after pulling the leftovers out of the fridge they were still awesome.  Hot, cold, with or without syrup- you have to get the pancakes!

Had the grilled cheese for lunch and my husband got the turkey burger.  Also- SO GOOD!  The bread is perfect and the strawberry jam on the burger added an extra awesome something to the meal.

As for dinners, I highly recommend the beer battered string beans for an appetizer and the portabello sandwich.

It's been a very very long time since I was here like back in the early 2000s to watch a movie here. Needless to say they've changed some of the theater seating for sure. We decided to be in the ""XD"" theater so we paid more for that. I guess the sound was better?? ‍ cleanliness was good. I didn't see a bunch of trash everywhere under the seats so that was a plus. The arm rests move up so my 2 year old was able to sit in between myself and my 5 year old comfortably. The theater wasn't big but I know the seating takes up more space. What I really like is that you can pick your seats and not have to worry about getting there early to get the ""best seats"".

I had driven or ridden by this place several times (don't drink and drive, kids, unless you're very good at it) and wondered whether it would be worth stopping by.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a shot.

I arrived at 11:30 on a Saturday morning.  It smelled WONDERFUL.  Three or four tables were occupied, and it was evident that all of the patrons and the waitress knew each other.  A middle-aged man could be seen cooking in the kitchen.  

I ordered a Pacifico and a pork burrito smothered with chili verde.  The friendly waitress brought back my Pacifico and chips with two types of salsa.  I expected the smooth, red salsa to taste like tomato paste; much to my surprise, it had a complex flavor and tasted fabulous.  I could drink this shit, I'm telling you.

The pork burrito arrived - it was simple and filling.  The chili verde was outstanding.  Probably should have just had a bowl of chili verde instead...oh well.

The waitress was totaling up my tab and preparing to drop it on my table.  NOT SO FAST, MY FRIEND!  It's time for some dessert.  I read an article somewhere about their sopapillas, so I decided to go with an order for $5.

The sopapillas quickly arrived in a basket...and there were seven of them.  I can mow down grub with the best of them, but I am NOT eating seven sopapillas.  These were heavenly, words cannot express their goodness.  I tore off a corner and filled the first sopapilla with a slab of butter and some honey, and sprinkled some cinnamon on top.   Fabulous.  Just fabulous.  You have not eaten a sopapilla until you've eaten them at El Sombrero.

I got through three of them, and would've eaten more if I could.  The waitress seemed slightly chagrined that I didn't eat more.

The sopapillas take this spot from four to five stars.

When I return to The Hat (and I will), I will bring people with me so we can finish the sopapillas.",2010-09-15 17:31:38

When we got there at 7:35, we were immediately seated.  Our table was all set with all the condiments and side dishes.  Our waiter, Jackson, poured us water and took our order.  We must have just waited 5 minutes when our order arrived.  Just so that people know,  the meats that we ordered is raw.  It is then cooked in front of you.  Most Korean BBQ places we go to, we normally cook the meats ourselves, but here at this restaurant, Jackson cooked it for us.  First the brisket, which is the most common meat at most kbbq. Then, the beef skirt, when that was done, the ribeye was placed on a new grill.  Once the ribeye was cooked, along came the short ribs.  And all the while, Jackson kept refilling the side dishes, which consist of Kim chi, pickled radish, tofu, mash potato, bean sprout salad, regular salad, tempura veggies, and pickled daicon.  Along with the side dishes, we were also treated to tofu soup and egg soufflé.  By the time the short ribs were cooked, we were all very stuffed.  I couldn't move....food coma. Lol.  The other waiter, Oah, who took over Jackson was very nice as well. Their customer service is exceptional.  And to top it off,  the owner of the restaurant, TK, stopped by our table to ask if everything was okay and if we needed anything.  Now I know what the raving is all about.  I'm raving about it too.

The salad bar here is excellent, as I assume the restaurant makes a higher profit if you chow down on leafy greens instead of meat. My solution to this is to fill a salad bar plate and take a clean one for meat so I can munch on the salad bar options during the rodizio service. I can only handle so much meat without mixing in a few vegetables! However this meant that no less than five servers asked if I wanted them to clear my mostly full veggie plate, which I took to mean the servers are a little too on top of their job or are used to seeing a lot of waste.
The meat selection is amazing, I would recommend the lamb chops (and I am not usually a fan of lamb) and the filet mignon.

The only other places that I know who have recliner chairs is the Luxury theatres and they never have any specials on their movie tickets!

For the Orleans, you can book online on Fandango as well. However, there's going to be a online booking fee .. I believe it's like $1.25 per ticket, which isn't bad unless you want to drive yourself to the theatre just to buy tickets.

Came here on a Tuesday night and had a decent time. I didn't feel particularly blown away but there was also nothing awful about this experience.

The location is prime, although it's somehow also awkwardly situated up some stairs on a corner right in front of the aquarium/rogers centre, etc... It's a long narrow space with a patio, I liked that they had outdoor tvs to watch the Jays games but they also had really loud music which usually i'm ok with but I wanted to have a conversation with my friend and felt weird yelling especially because the place was quite empty. 

We ordered a couple of drinks and the nachos to share. The nachos are massive, I'd say share this with a group of 4. Guac and all those accoutrements are extra as expected. We had asked for no onion but unfortunately still received them. No big deal, my friend just doesn't like onions but if it had been an allergy issue, that would have been a problem. The nachos were thoroughly covered in cheese and the usual nacho toppings and there was plenty of sour cream and salsa. It looks like there are lots of drink specials, we had some $5 pints of bluemoon, If I can remember correctly, which is a great deal considering its location. 

Service was not bad, waitress mostly stayed out of our way, once we were seated she came over and started talking to us but was then called away by another customer and she just kind of left while we were trying to ask her a question, it was a bit off-putting but she was ok the rest of the night, not particularly nice but not rude or anything. As for the actual restaurant it's pretty nice. I would say it looks like a typical sports bar type of place. If you dropped me in here without seeing the name of the restaurant, I could easily mistake this for a Kelseys or Jack Astor's, in terms of the interior, food and even the service. Again, prices are pretty on par with what's in the area with the exception of their specials which are good. 

I can see tons of people coming by after or before a Jays game, it's the perfect spot to be wearing a baseball cap, super casual and relaxed atmosphere, plus it's steps from the Rogers Centre. Personally, I'm not sure if i'd go out of my way to return or recommend this place to friends as there are tons of great, unique spots in the area that I would just rather go to.

The famous Brisket enchilada's were good, but at lunch they don't put it in a skillet and cover it with cheese. I'm not sure whether that whole process is worth 8 bucks more at dinner either. The lunch serving just has a few lonely enchilada's on the plate looking quite in need of a cheese bath. Everything else was pleasant enough including good free chips and a nice server.

My first trip with just friends to Vegas and we decided to stay at Planet Hollywood Towers. One of the things I liked off the bat was that they have a no smoking policy. Yes! The other perk was how close the place was to the Miracle Mile shops. 

As for rooms, we had each booked a single studio suite (two in total), but had requested to be in rooms as close to each other as possible. Since that wasn't possible, they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a two bedroom suite! Sweeeeet! 

The suite was full of awesome. The master bedroom had a jacuzzi and the most comfortable lounging couch. The kitchen comes fully stocked with dishes and utensils. We could've cooked a gourmet meal and eat it on the 6-person dining table too, if we had planned it earlier. The living room also had a nice view of the side of the strip and a projector screen that covers the entire side of the wall for TV viewing or drunk karaoking. Plus, we had a washing machine/dryer combo for all our laundry needs. What a deal, huh? 

The reason why I can't give them 5 stars: the first day, the non-master bedroom only had one towel. The following day, even after housekeeping came by, no towels were replenished for the non-master bedroom. Big disappointment. Secondly, we tried doing laundry and the door would not open; the machine had the lock on and we had to keep pressing buttons to try to unlock the door to get our laundry. Third, on their website, they advertised their two-bedroom suites as having two spa tubs with separate showers. False. Only the master bedroom had the spa tub. 

Other than that, I had a lovely time staying at the Towers and enjoying the convenience of having a kitchen to reheat up food and a projector with screen to watch TV with. I also saw the floorplan for a four-bedroom suite, so that's next on my Vegas hotels to hit!",2010-10-23 21:10:41

The openness of the restaurant with its loudness reminded me of a cafeteria, but a hip cafeteria indeed. 

I concur with other reviewers about the pricey plates, the atmosphere, the operations, etc. but I did enjoy my time, so a solid three out of five stars for FC and I may return in the future.

There seemed to be a large number of employees (and now that I think of it, FRC's do employ a decent number of workers in proportion to square footage). Two cashiers took orders and a line several folks deep waited behind us. Although a lot of tables were taken, we easily found one with good spacing. No cramping, no leg touching under the table, no one bumping into my chair while passing behind, no ""excuse me's"" with polite but annoyed smiles.

So that was definitely a plus. Another plus are the healthful options on the kids menu.

Utensils wrapped in napkins were the table centerpiece, still you can help yourself to more which are located against the wall alongside the teas and colorfully-mixed ades. 

Food was brought to us in three rounds. The plates are small, but I gotta give Flower Child credit for making the dishes look so ungreasy and clean. A+ for presentation. The chicken wrap and salmon hot pot that the others ordered looked good and came with a portion of veggies or salad.

I was the last to get served even though I thought my order was the simplest. 

- avocado hummus with pita:
pita was too thin and hard
hummus mixed with corn, radish, pumpkin seeds
salty taste, could not tell it was hummus 
I don't favor chunky hummus

- bowl of Pho:
who orders pho at a non-asian restaurant? 
I stupidly raise my hand, guilty as charged
tasty, but I didn't finish it
too many noodles
not enough mushrooms
came with sides of basil 
jalapenos, bean sprouts, lime
and two sauces barely palatable
the red sauce tasted like a spiced up catchup 
the darker sweet sauce...plum maybe?
I honestly have no idea what it was 

- side of roasted asparagus:
literally three spears of the plant cut in half 
salty seasoning with an umami sauce
""roasted"" turned out to be ""blackened"" and overcooked

- lemon cake:
resembled an upside down cupcake
yummy, good lemon flavor
no overly glossed sweetness

Desserts are not listed on the menu but they are displayed next to the cashier. 
After dinner I reviewed my receipt and found out that the lemon cake was gluten free.

I wasn't even Elite status yet, and knew no one but Misti was nice enough to invite me and my wifey to see how the Vegas Elites get down!

Fast forward a couple of years later, tons of new artwork, shops, and exhibits to check out. Aside from all the art galleries, there is a drop-in yoga studio, you could take guitar lessons and art classes here, and even pick up comics, graffiti supplies, and sweet vinyl toys here.

We first stopped inside The Trifecta Gallery next to the yoga studio and the lady running the gallery and her jack russel terrier greeted us at the door and was very informative in explaining
various displays, who the artist was, and a little backstory to the artist and his/her artwork.

One very eye-catching piece was a beautiful tapestry of the Las Vegas Strip(Circa 2007)  done by an artist who went by the name SOLA(Alone in Spanish). It took about 8,000 hours over the span of 3 years to complete using recycled sweaters of Las Vegas residents emphasizing the community focus of her work. Literally living out of her rolling suitcase, she travels from city to city setting up in pop-up studios and purchasing furnishings from thrift stores and gives them back when she leaves. The leftover material is turned into knit hats which generate income that SOLA lives off of. As soon as a donor is found, this tapestry will be hung up in City Hall. Her 40 tapestries can be seen in 10 cities and are absolutely beautiful!

We went upstairs and also got to chat with other local artists while creating their latest masterpieces. We also got to see a work in progress of a beautiful colorful Tibetan sand painting
which takes an eye for detail and a VERY steady hand.(Sorry, no photos allowed for this one...gotta check it out yourself!)

I'll admit, this is not my first time here but it certainly will be my last. I live basically hop, skip, and a jump away and this would be way too convenient for my ultimate craving (which, yes, happens daily ;) I stopped in for dinner around 7:30 and there is one cheese pizza sitting under the lamp for god knows how long. From a previous trip I remember there being about 6-7 specialty pizzas ready to take a slice and be on your way. Specialty pizzas are my thing. You would NEVER, I repeat NEVER, catch me ordering a cheese or even pepperoni pizza. There is just way more to life than to be plain Jane like that! So the dull toned lady tells me that it's $2.50/slice and an additional $0.50/topping. I should have to just politely said no thank you but I was set on pizza for dinner so I ordered chicken, spinach and mushrooms which the man takes the cheese slice that had been under the lamp for unsaid amount of time, adds the topping and puts in back in the oven. I will eat pizza hot, cold, reheated, etc but to have my pizza cooked a second time as I'm ordering it is just not my idea of deliciousness!

In case you don't long story short is incompetent server wearing little clothing can't do anything right, spills ketchup on friend's white shirt.

I checked out the menu for this place online, and I was super excited, there were a lot of things that sounded great.  Unfortunately, this is one of those really irritating places that has a lunch menu and a dinner menu.  I ended up ordering the meatloaf sandwich.  The meatloaf sandwich was less than satisfying.  It was served open faced, which was cool, but that left the congealed gravy to cool almost instantly.  The bread underneath was really tough and hard to eat with the meatloaf.  The meatloaf itself was overcooked, practically blackened, and it had peppers in it.  I thought it was weird and rather unappealing.  I don't think mushroom gravy and peppers belong together.

Service was just downright awful, but I think it was only the girl we got stuck with.  She was rather rude and pretentious.  A particular moment in time that stuck out to me was when we commented how heavy the menus were she shot back at us ""well you're not the one carrying them all day.""  Sure sweetheart...  I'm pretty sure she is a trust fund baby who is now forced to work her first job ever because of the economy.  She picked the wrong one.

The food wasn't bad but nothing stood out as omg. I did like their seasoned fries but the seasoning didnt stay on the fries and made eating them kinda difficult. The fried dishes were lightly battered and the food fresh making a delightful appetizer.

Before I forget (not that I would ever forget how bad this was) They have a fried banana that is just not right. Bananas are supposed to be served cold and eating a hot mushy banana was just kinda disgusting. I would assume this would be like eating hot baby food and would explain a few eating disorders in young children.

The Ramen dishes were served in large bowels and had great flavor. The sushi dishes were fresh but serving sizes were kinda small. The names were amusing and the presentation on the plates were cute. The teenage girls I was there with loved the hello kitty plate.

Ok the anime theme was cool and we all caught ourselves watching different shows. The wait staff was sexy in their costumes and very patient explaining different dishes and the rules on the big wheel they have. 

We were there for an early lunch but they allowed the girls to spin the wheel and gave them free cookies for playing.

In keeping with its reputation as being one of the best sushi places to go to in the GTA, Zen focuses on quality and presentation.
Their service is excellent, well mannered and very accommodating.
As for ambiance it truly is a beautiful and intimate with hints of Japanese architecture.
As for the dining experience, I highly recommend the counter seats as you get the opportunity to interact with the chefs as they prepare you're meal providing you some details about what is being served to you.  This also gives you the opportunity to see and have a greater appreciation for their culinary work in putting each dish beautifully together.
She had the Omakase Meal for one which featured a full course.  I on the other hand had the Omakase Sushi meal all prepared by our chef.  
Both meals were fantastic highlighting the quality, freshness and delicacy almost a melt-in-your-mouth type of experience.

The interior is well designed with modern decor, creating a pretty trendy atmosphere. This is about the only good thing I can say about the place.

The concept seemed interesting. When you walk in, you are greeted by the host that hands you a card (much like a credit card) and a menu. Once you decide what you want, you go to the appropriate station to order. It reminded me of being in elementary all over again, standing in cafeteria lines.

Since the concept is new, I think it would make sense if there were some form of an info-graphic to inform customers on how the restaurant operates. During our visit, two other customers questioned us on how to order. Furthermore, we were not sure if we were suppose to wait for our food or if someone would bring it to us. 

Once we got the food (by the way, you go back up to get your food), it was a huge disappoint. It was so BLAND, absolutely flavorless! My friend got the Primavera Specialty Pasta, with added shrimp, and I got the Chicken Pesto Panini. Both dishes were flavorless. The pasta was basically boiled noodles with veggies. No spices. No sauces. No flavor. We had to ask the cook for some sauce (which was basically some form of tomato soup). My chicken was completely dry. We both added balsamic vinegar (A LOT) to our dishes to have.. oh what's it called... flavor! It was probably the worst ""Italian"" ""food"" I have ever had in my life.

In the often plastic (some might say ""soulless"") city of Phoenix, it is to the city's myriad ethnic restaurants where one must travel to find real personality and character. Greektown does not disappoint. To use crude language, the owner is one ""cocky son of a gun."" But, I still loved him! His enthusiasm for his food is contagious. It's hard to describe in words, but let's just say that he eats his Wheaties in the morning! All inquiries about menu items are answered in a detailed fashion with a hearty side of wit. You really have to come to the restaurant to see what I mean.

The food was good, but I don't think spectacular. As other reviewers have said, the restaurant is a good value. Your meal includes soup, salad and plenty of delicious pita/garlic bread. I ordered a chicken entree that included artichoke hearts and was satisfied, but not wowed. Perhaps it's me or perhaps it's the restaurant? I can't really say given that I've never had Greek food before. I will share, however, that one of my dining partners found the sauce used to make his ""Greek lasagna"" similar in taste and consistency to that found in Chef Boyardee canned pastas; sort of sweet and slimy. Desserts were a definite treat. Most of my tablemates pronounced my cheesecake the best of the bunch (even better than the super-sweet Bakalava).

Come for the crazy owner (HINT: You must love singing and attentive service), but stay for the cheesecake. If the ""good, but not great"" entrees leave you less than impressed, the overall experience will still make the time and money expended worth it.",2008-10-08 00:58:02

Barbacoa Entree: It was really good, although a little dry. I didn't notice much of the dryness because it came with a heaping portion of avocado and the beans and rice were addictive.

We buy 3 bags at a time since they comp our drinks with the purchase. I always get a toddy to go, and I love the simple syrup pump they have out because I can quickly sweeten my drink.  

The staff is pretty nice and polite, no attitudes detected here. One server even took the time to explain different techniques to make iced coffee when I asked about some of their equipment.

The coffee itself is my absolute favorite. It's smooth while still providing a good caffeine kick. It has comletely ruined us. It's not cheap, but I justify the splurge since my morning cappuccinos are what gets me out of bed in the morning.",2012-08-28 05:37:21

The restaurant has the look and feel of a real old-time diner/soda fountain.  Something straight out of Leave it to Beaver or Pleasantville.  In addition to ice cream, sundaes, and shakes they also offer hot entrees like burgers and meat loaf.  I can't vouch for the food but I did overhear the table next to us tell the waitress that ""the soup is cold.""

We got two scoops to share - Turkish coffee and almond pralines.  Both were pretty dense yet creamy and definitely high on the sweetness level.   Almond praline was probably our preferred flavor.",2017-01-11 04:18:54

Kiku is, hands down, the BEST AYCE sushi place that I've ever been to in terms of quality and selection. There are a great deal of specialty rolls on the menu, which is a huge plus for any AYCE sushi joint.

I came here with a group of 5 hungry athletes and we ordered a great deal of sushi that day, but here are a couple of my highlights and must-trys:
-dynamite hand roll (tons of hand rolls on the menu)
-red snapper sushi (some of the freshest red snapper I've ever had at an AYCE restaurant)
-rainbow roll (fresh fish up top... make or break for a rainbow roll)
-calamari tempura roll (huge and full of flavor)

Our food was served faster than any other AYCE place that I've ever been to, and they were quite busy that day. It was $24 for the AYCE dinner menu since it was a holiday. I think I definitely got my money's worth. 

Why not 5 stars? The waitresses were quite cold and very irritable. We had asked our waitress a question and she gave us a bit of an eye roll, a big exhale and walked away to yell at the sushi chefs. I'd like to think I rolled up here with a good group of people that were pretty low maintenance, but the servers just seemed very unhappy and annoyed. A step up in customer service will give them a 5. Til then, I'll enjoy my food and substandard service.",2013-07-02 15:03:21

On était 10 et près de nous, il y avait aussi deux autres grandes tables qui fêtaient des anniversaires. Le restaurant est donc adapté au groupe. Il faut noter que c'est un apportez votre vin. 

Décor et ambiance: 
Le restaurant avec des murs garnis de vieux briques donnent une impression de restaurant venant du moyen-âge. Ils ont des ampoules rustiques qui donnent une ambiance plus chaleureuse. Rien d'extraordinaire, mais correct. On est allé samedi soir et c'était bruyant, car on était au moins 3 groupes qui fêtaient des anniversaires. En soirée dans la semaine, ça pourrait être un lieu pour un petit souper romantique. 

Nourriture:
J'ai pris pour entrée un ravioli au homard déconstruit. Ça donne la drôle impression que le cuisinier ne réussit pas à faire des raviolis, alors laisse les pâtes et l'homard séparés. La sauce était gouteuse et le goût était correct, mais je ne recommanderais pas cette entrée. Une grosse déception quand j'ai croqué un morceau de carapace de l'homard qui aurait du être retiré. Comme plat principal, à la suggestion de la serveuse, j'ai pris un Pavé de saumon cuit avec croüte de panko et une purée de légumes, dont la courge. La purée de légume était bonne et me rappelait les samfainas de catalane. Le saumon était bien, mais un peu trop sec à l'intérieur. Très bon plat en général. Mes voisins de tables ont pris un tartare au boeuf et un pavé de boeuf qu'ils n'ont pas trop apprécié. 

Service:
Notre serveuse était une jeune femme blonde. Service excellent. Ayant été serveur, j'apprécie que le service soit efficace et qu'on ne manque jamais d'eau. Nos bouteilles de vins étaient toujours débouchées rapidement et lorsque nécessaire. Le panier de pain vide était toujours remplacé rapidement. Par contre, il y a eu un petit décalage lorsque les plats ont été apportés.

Prix:
Pour un apportez votre vin, le menu est de 25-30$ le plat et 10-14$ l'entrée. La table d'hôte qui inclut un choix parmi 3 desserts est de mémoire 35$. Ce qui n'est pas si cher pour un apportez votre vin.

I came here on a Thursday night and it was a bit quiet but there was also a snow storm going on so I assume I was one of the few people willing to tough out the storm to go to a buffet on a Thursday night.

Well, more food for me.

For dinner, you'll find your regular Chinese veggie and meat dishes, and they also have a Japanese food table which serves sushi and sashimi. There is also a grill section that serves teriyaki and bbq chicken and beef etc. I was so full that I didn't have a chance to have any of the roast beef but mmm it looked delicious.

Apparently there is a $9.99 deal on Tuesday for lunch -- what a steal! You can barely get anything for 10 bucks these days.

I'd recommend coming on a Friday night or weekends, and for the Tuesday lunch special. Apparently these guys get a lot of parties coming from the various Community centres and ice rinks near by so it can get busy!",2018-01-16 21:29:50

Back when Smeeks was at Central and Camelback, it offered a large selection of retro candies and unusual handmade candies, along with novelties. The store in The Union at Biltmore is still utterly adorable, but it's less than half the size, and it's more a novelty store than a candy store. It's also probably closer to a 5-star experience on one's very first visit, when the sheer exuberance of the place is delightful.

Retro candies are on the small back wall and include candy bars I don't recall seeing at the candy store on Mill Avenue. Retro is where the action is here, possibly because it goes with the retro charm of many of the novelties.

There are bins of taffy. There is a wall display of manufactured candies and then the tables have a few artisanal items of the marshmallow, caramel, and candy bark varieties. The suppliers may rotate, as the chi-chi caramels I tried and liked in June did not appear to be the same chi-chi caramels offered in December, though both brands had a spicy chile version (which you, too, should try).

There's been a good deal of Archie McPhee catalog action to stock the novelty section, including embrace of the current trend for fixating on mustaches. Now that the Green Parrot is a dead parrot, this is the only place I know in Phoenix to buy any frivolities of this ilk, so I wish they'd go for the full McPhee and stock the action figures and bacon products.

If you think of this as a frivolous little gift shop amidst the high consumerism of Biltmore Fashion Park, it works quite well. If you'd be happy to find any sort of retro candy, it's still #1, thanks to slippage among its rivals. If you're looking for a large variety of candies like the shop used to have, be prepared for a bit of frustration.",2013-12-21 03:44:50

jmCuiQ6MBwlz5XnAkFVV0Q,hmT6ygPjklrNEjvA2FYuVQ,lpYFsXFrojiBZ1kbWR2lZw,3,3,0,0,"Four Peaks Grill & Tap is a lot like all those brewery restaurant chains all over the U.S. You have some in house brews and good 'ol grill and pub food in a more family friendly environment. They aren't master craft brewers, they aren't master chefs but in the end they are a comfortable place to grab some beers and some decent grub in an environment that would be better than that of your typical bars and grills closer to the university.

Four Peaks is much like the chains that you'll find such as the BJ's Brewery chains, Oggi's, and others. Much like those, they offer about 8 in house beers, several types of food that just pair well with beer such as pizza, sandwiches, salads, etc. Basically, Four Peaks has something for everybody.

So the grub menu is good. The pizzas are solid and the rest of the menu probably is too.  I got a half ""Veggie"" and half ""Abe Froman"" and it was definitely good enough to have to not have any leftovers. I had some eggroll thing that I can't remember the name of as an appetizer and it was pretty good too. All in all, their food appears to be pretty solid.  

The beer, well the beer is just alright. The downside to living in San Diego is that the IPA scene is killer. IPAs for days and hoppy beers in SD will ruin you forever if you go anywhere else. With that said, don't expect that same level of beer satisfaction here. Don't get me wrong, they are still considerably better than getting a domestic but they just don't hold a candle to what I'm used to in SD.  Their Session IPA didn't really taste too much like an IPA and their Kilt Lifter didn't really blow me away. The beer is great to pair with the food and wash it down but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here for the beer only.  That's just my personal preference only since it seems a lot of locals love the beer here.

The server attending the table was extremely friendly and helpful so I can't knock service.

When all is said and done, this place fits a nice niche in the Scottsdale area.  Grab some good food and wash it down with some beer all in a family friendly, comfortable environment. It isn't anything you haven't seen before but that certainly isn't a bad thing.  

This place is still okay in my book and I approve. ;)",2016-08-19 19:50:14

McKnight Kitchen is located on you guessed it, McKnight Road.  It's in the building that formerly housed both Qdoba and Burger 21 and so is only accessible heading Northbound on McKnight.  The inside of the restaurant was bright and open with a number of booths and tables.  There was also an area where a sushi chef was making the sushi fresh as it was ordered.

For lunch on this day I decided to go with the chicken hot basil lunch special at the highest spice level while my wife went with a pad Thai.    The menu described my meal as chili paste with bell pepper, onion, bamboo shoots and basil leaves.  Then since it was a lunch special it also came with a spring roll and my choice between a soup and a salad and I went with the chicken rice soup.  The soup came out first and ended up being quite tasty.  After I had finished that my entree came out.  It looked fairly spicy with all of the red specks on it and its taste corresponded with its look.  The chicken was cooked nicely and my favorite part of the meal was how the basil paired well with the spiciness of the sauce.

The best thing about the Malta Bake Shop is the environment. A European feel with pictures on the walls, small tables for a communal feel, and a great buzz during busy periods.

If you come when its not so busy I don't recommend the Pastizzi as they keep it under heat lamps. Try things like Asetat (Molasses rings) or traditional Maltese biscuits), just ask the staff to run through the options.

My fiance and I went to check out J's Kaiyo last night for dinner and were not disappointed. We were quickly seated, partially due to them still being new and unknown, and partially due to the fact that it was a Wednesday night and they were not very busy. We chose to sit at the sushi bar so that we could get a look at the fish in the display case and we could see that everything looked nice and fresh. Initial service was great, the hostess came and grabbed our order quickly. We ordered the Pork Gyoza, Squid Salad, Heat Stroke roll, Rainbow roll, Monster roll, and the Geisha roll. All though she was extremely friendly, it seemed that the hostess took our order and then instead of giving it to the chefs/kitchen, she went back up front to greet a couple of more people before getting the order in. Because of this there was a wait before we received any of our food and instead of receiving our apps first we received our apps with our first two rolls. This resulted in not only a crowding issue, but we were also eating delicious hot Gyoza rolls with chilled sushi at the same time. Not the best way to eat either one. However, The Pork Gyoza's were the best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy and delicious with every bite. I could have sat down and eaten nothing but a dozen of those and walked away extremely happy. In fact it was all delicious, well prepared and fresh. My personal favorite of the rolls was the Heat Stroke, but I enjoy heat to my food and loved the fresh Jalapeno on top that added an extra fresh layer of heat and a nice crisp bite. They did forget to provide wasabi and ginger with our order, but the sushi chefs were quick to provide it when asked. There was a slight delay in getting our check after the meal, but again, she was super friendly and pleasant to deal with. All in all I would give the food itself 5 stars and the service 3/3.5. I'll be heading back in the future to explore more of their menu and to eat many more Pork Gyoza's. I'd also hope that any lack of excellent service received last night was due to them being so new and still having some new staff that are maybe training.

Akahana is most often reviewed for their BOGO sushi rolls, and while the sushi is fine - I prefer to dig in to the rest of their menu. There are a number of items on the main menu that really standout, including the Signature Pho served with thinly sliced steak served on the side to allow you to determine how long you want the steak to cook in the pho, the seafood hot pot with snapper, shrimp and scallops in a light oyster sauce, the red curry (I like it with the tofu), the spicy tuna/avocado bowl and the vietnamese crepe.  

Pho tip - if you don't want a bowl full of noodles, you can ask them to sub veggies for the noodles for a couple dollar upcharge.  On those days I'm watching my carbs (they come and go), this is an excellent option!

For dining in, try to get a table on the right side of the restaurant (the bar side).  The left side of the restaurant has harsh fluorescent lighting and a completely different feel to it.  

If you order takeout, be prepared to wait.  The orders often pile up and it can take a while for the host/hostess to sift through all of them.  Also, be sure to check your takeout order before leaving - as, sometimes special requests to the orders slip through the cracks.",2016-04-10 16:03:29

Good fortune has smiled on us - if you go to 2827 E. Bell Rd. in Phoenix, you'll find one there. Crazy Ed's Satisfied Frog (a.k.a. The Little Frog on Bell) opened last night.

 This is the home of my favorite fried chicken, and some mighty good ribs, beef and pork. The original Satisfied Frog lived up in Cave Creek in Frontier Town. He'd been around since 1981, and his demise came amidst a swirl of controversy, about two years ago. Crazy Ed and his wife Maria kept in touch with the faithful by e-mail, and he continued to sell his ""world famous"" Cave Creek Chili Beer on line. Then came the news that he was planning a come-back, and we hung on his every communication. Last night was our reward.

 The new Frog is much smaller than its predecessor, but much cuter. There are rustic wood chairs and red tablecloths. Terrific lantern light fixtures, and for those who can't do without, 12 TV screens. And the food is even better!! Our chicken ($14.99, enough for two) had crackly good skin, the fries were just the way I like them (you know, nice and crisp). A house salad was included, unlike at the old Frog. The price for this dinner was $3 less than previously. For dessert we had our old favorite, strawberry shortcake ($6.99, again, enough for two). The quality of the ice cream has been upgraded, and nice biscuits sop up the syrup, instead of cake which used to get soggy. This was $2 less expensive.

 In fact, all the prices are quite reasonable. The meats, which all come from Harris Ranch and are organic and hormone free, range in price from $6.99 for a ground-fresh burger, to $18.99 for a full rack of St. Louis ribs. All-you-can-eat beef ribs (boy, did they smell good!) are available daily for $10.99. There's pulled pork and brisket, and fish and chips ($9.99 for a basket and $12.99 for a platter). A new item on the menu is cream of green chili soup ($6.99), described as heavy cream blended with mild green chiles and butter, then topped with croutons and cheese. I've got to try that next time. There's lots more on the menu, which you can find on line.

 I think I'll go find some more princes to kiss and see what pops up next.",2010-02-17 04:27:47

Did any places in the '50s actually get built to this extreme or has this look become an over-exaggerated cartoon version of what we think the era to be? The open kitchen is a cross between a Fatburger and Johnny Rockets, the restaurant is a mix of everything you could ever think of. It is filled with almost all 4 person booths, along with a few loose tables for larger groups. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) I didn't get to witness any of their singing which supposedly happens here. Still it is definitely not quiet in here as the music drowns out pretty much any sort of conversation you may want to have. Their menu features pretty much any item you could possibly think of for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert at any time of day. Within this menu are many options for burgers, including the more recently hyped Claire Sinclair's Sin City Burger to commemorate her new burlesque show in the property, which is a half-pound burger with a fried egg, pepper jack cheese, mushrooms and caramelized onions.

What came out initially looked decent, but turned out to be a mess. The huge, dry vacuum of a bun sucked any moisture and flavor from this burger the entire time. The large pre-formed and probably frozen patty had good char flavor upon first bite, but that char quickly turned to a bitter flavor and wasn't that great the rest of the way. It was cooked a little too much for medium rare, which was probably ok given the quality, and still managed to make a large mess on my plate and hands even though it came off as very dry throughout my meal. The fried onions were cold upon arrival, and not much better than the premade generic ones you get for your typical green bean casserole dish on thanksgiving. The 'caramelized' onions were your typical pan fried onions, not very caramelized but had ok flavor. The egg was non-existent, as were the mushrooms; I pulled one out to try on its own and it had decent flavor. The lettuce and tomato were decent, if maybe a little light compared to the mass amount of everything else. Overall this tasted like nothing but dry bun with a bit of onion flavor. Not really sure what all the local bloggers and press people were raving about, but maybe if I was staring at Claire while eating this I might like it more too?

The fries were awful; almost approaching room temperature, and of your basic frozen variety complete with a stale oily flavor. And if the meal was barely tolerable, it took a solid 7 minutes of me staring at my empty plate with a crumpled napkin on top and empty glass of iced tea before anyone acknowledged me again to get my check. But I guess going anywhere in the lovely Stratosphere, let alone a crappy '50s diner, you're not coming for ambiance or excellent service despite what its visitors have to say online. And apparently you're not coming here for a decent burger either. My burger and iced tea came to a completely unreasonable $17.27 for what I got, and I couldn't recommend avoiding it any more. Now that the Top of the World restaurant took the burger off their menu, I'm not really sure what your burger options are within the property, but I'm not really sure what you're doing there anyway.",2013-07-09 18:21:24

I have been a lush fan for many many years and have turned more then my fair share of Bath and Body Works Lovers into Lushies.....

This location is tucked away in a tiny corner almost under the escalator on the upper lower level of the mall - I think they put it here to over power the smell of piss from the subway entrance....smart if Cadillac Fairview (The mall owners) did....or it's just a happy coincidence.  If you follow your nose you will be sure to find it....trust me.

The staff are always cheery, and willing to help - I have to say this is the only store that I enjoy the sales staff asking me if they can help.  The store is small in comparison to other locations, but it's packed to the brim with product.  They have large quantities, but not a wide variety of selection as other larger stores do.  The products that they do have tend to be more of their best sellers and tried and tested products.

I tend to make a beeline for the Bath Bombs wall, I kind of feel like a kid in a candy store looking at all the brighly coloured balls that will fizz and make me happy.  I have to say they are by far my fave product that Lush makes.  Yes they are $5-$6 a pop, but it really is worth it - TRUST ME!!  I tend to stock pile them...not sure why, I guess it's the way I justify spending $20-$30 on things I don't really need and only last 30-45 mins - depending on my bath length.

If you can, order online from their site, as they have all of their products and even their ""retro"" products that you can no longer get in the stores, or only come out of the ""vault"" and into stores like Disney movies every so often.  Most of the time shipping is included.

Yes, that is more like a tip, but you normally wouldn't think to order a salad at a burger place, so I put it in all caps and at the front of my review. My wife and I enjoy that salad so much that we split a large salad and a burger. 

So what, right? Well, that means that we have to *agree* on which burger to get. We have vastly different tastes, so that can be a real challenge. Still, it is worth it to get some Napa Salad awesomeness. It may not sound like much: ""Mixed Greens, Iceberg, Dried Fruit, Marcona Almonds & Goat Cheese Vinaigrette,"" but the combination of flavors and textures is fantastic. (Note that the ""Goat Cheese Vinaigrette"" actually means that there are pieces of goat cheese in the salad, not just mixed into the dressing)

So, enough about the salad. The burgers here are good, too. They cook them a little more rare than other places -- they're thick burgers -- and ""medium well"" to them means ""a little pink in the middle."" Keep that in mind when you're ordering in case you like your burgers w/o the red. Don't like their burger combinations? You can BYO burger from a list of ingredients and even swap out the burger patty with a slab of ahi, a patty of turkey, a breast of chicken, or even a veggie patty. For those into that kind of thing, there is even an upgrade to Kobe beef patty for $5 more.

Burgers are large and don't come with fries. The side orders are usually big enough to share among 2-3 people. The onion rings are usually nice, and serving them with BBQ sauce was new to me. I usually do mustard, but people tell me I'm a bit off there and that ranch dressing is the proper accompaniment. Anyway, the BBQ sauce was a good choice and adds a nice smoky flavor.

They also have shakes and pies. I don't know about the pie, and I haven't had a shake here, but the list of possibilities is very long and I may have to break down at some point and do something about that.

Overall, great experience and lots of happy memories made at this local Markham venue!

Let's start with dim sum :)

Dim sum is available everyday from 9:00am to 3:00pm. The prices have stayed the same for the past few years; it ranges from S ($3.20), M ($4.20), L ($5.20), XL ($6.20), SP ($7.20). For the price I'm paying, they really deliver! All the items come out piping hot. Be sure to order the giant Shrimp Dumplings, they are so meaty and delicious! The steamed rice rolls are silky and smooth. I'd definitely come back. The only con is that it is gets SUPER crowded in there because they try to pack a lot more tables than it should under one roof.

On to Weddings and social events :)

Most of the weddings I've been to were hosted at The Beaumont Room of Shangri-La Banquet Hall. A modern twist to a traditional banquet hall, features a long bar area and exposed ceiling. This room fits between 100-180 people. It also links to a gorgeous backyard area which is perfect for outdoor ceremony and outdoor photoshoot. The room itself is very romantic - the backdrop of the stage is pre-designed with white floral decor, and you can adjust the LED lights for the room according to your preference. Bridal room is conveniently located across the hall - equipped with washroom and a decent area for lounging/changing. Chinese food 10+ course meal is mainly served at this venue, and the food is consistently very good. The Beaumont Room also has the perfect area for your photobooth, sweets tables, or even a gelato bar ;) I would recommend this Markham venue to couples who are looking for a decent western styled banquet hall that also caters delicious Chinese food.

Other room options include:
Garden Tent (Seasonal): 100-200 people
Grand Ballroom: 300-400 people
Woodbine Room: 50-100 people
Alden Room: 30-50 people
Esna Room: 200-300 people",2018-03-09 20:08:28

This is the only Indian option on my (southwest) side of town, and it's surely just about the only Indian restaurant without a buffet. The cruelty!

(They had a buffet for about five minutes a few summers ago. Eight dishes, heavy on the okra, heavy on the management's voiced opinion that it wasn't cost effective to run a buffet.) 

For a long time I thought the lack of Indian buffet in my stretch of the valley was just meanness on the universe's part, even though the taste of Mantra Masala's food - be it dine-in or carry-out - was never really above three stars. I know they market themselves as ""healthy"" cuisine, and I suppose it shows.

But we finally called it quits on our frequent take-aways after paneer portions became more and more skimpy, naan often ended up kind of burned or tasteless, and we realized that there was a lot of ""miss"" and not really a single ""hit"" to justify being *that* lazy. Sometimes you just have to shrug and order a pizza instead.

I don't know how Mantra Masala has managed to survive - maybe they do because they're the only option out here - but if they're looking for more customers (and if the parking lot is any indication, surely they are), I beg them to consider the following:

1. Drop the healthy angle. It tastes weird. 

2. Become a copycat of the successful Indian restaurants elsewhere in Las Vegas. I can't believe I'm advocating unoriginality, but at this point I just want to be able to get some solid, good Indian food near home. Being a copycat includes copying the proportions - no more skimping on paneer cubes!

3. Do a lunch buffet with some interesting angle. (This is where you should get creative.) Maybe a really wide range of desserts? No one else seems to play that up. Live music? Dance? Yeah, I know the old lunch buffet didn't work, and maybe it's because the population is more sparse out here, but it also was a boring buffet of limited items. (We looked over every dish, apologized, and left.) Maybe not every day, but at least run a buffet on weekends.

4. Cooking classes. DO THEM NOW. I have begged Indian restaurants across the valley to offer these and everyone just laughs politely and nothing happens. Here's a way to sell the buffet, too - as in, come for the buffet and get X amount off the cooking class immediately afterward. I know so many people who've expressed interest in learning how to cook Indian food, and at best we get the odd demo here and there. No one is doing this. 

Offer hands-on classes on Saturday afternoons, just after the buffet, and change the topic every week. Gulab jamun class? I'm there. Naan in a home-oven class? Enrolled. Buttery paneer for the gringo soul? Let me BE the valedictorian!

(Note: Um, but you need to do steps 1 and 2 first, okay? I don't want to learn how to cook what you currently have going on.)

5. Explore the hipster space. Chutney tasting hour with matched cocktails? Bollywood pajama parties? Loaner saris at the door for those who want to get in the spirit?

6. Update your website. Turmeric has been the ""Spice of the Moment"" for, literally, years, and you don't even serve the kind of food where people are happy to walk away with turmeric-stained fingers. How about online ordering for take-away?

Mantra Masala, I'm sharing these ideas because I want some tasty Indian near my home. Right now you're providing meh food at ambitious prices. Please fix this. I want to cheer for the home team. RAH RAH RAH! GIMME KOR-MA!",2012-01-18 02:58:46

What's the most worth it is the combos they have on the chalkboard or in their menu. The combos comes with 2-4 types of rolls or sushi's for $10-$20.

I got the Roll Combo A, which consisted of spicy salmon, california, and avacado rolls. 18 pieces of good sized sushi for $11. My friend got the kokoro combo 4, which consisted of 10 giant pieces of dynamite sushi (the one with tempura in the middle), and 6 pieces of spicy salmon for $12. It was delicious and really filling. My friend couldnt even finish her combo and i had to help her (cuz i eat a lot). The spicy salmon was a little too salty but filled with really good sauce, the rice on all the rolls were pretty standard. Definitely not skimpy on the filling. My favourite thing about the dynamite roll was that it also contains tempura yam, along with tempura shrimp. Super awesome. 

They also have a little dessert/ice cream bin if you wanna buy things like mochi balls...mmm....

The only downside is that there's no room to sit inside. There are three small tables and chairs outside if you wanna eat there and you're lucky there's space. But I'm not sure what you can do in the winter. Just get take-out. Definitely worth it!",2012-07-28 00:11:35

The bubble tea is pretty good.  In my opinion, they overcook the bubbles.  It's way too squishy!  I tend to like my bubbles with a little more bounce in them.  I've tried traditional Taiwanese Milk Tea and Thai tea flavor.  Both were tasty and refreshing!

I recently stayed downtown and due to the fact that the hotel I was staying at didn't have a restaurant in it I needed to find food elsewhere.  Yes, I know this is part of a hotel itself, but I did not stay at the Westin.  I was looking for a place that had later hours due to the fact that I was going to have a late dinner.  This place fit that bill on that fact alone, but I probably should have looked elsewhere.  

When I had shown up I had all intentions to sit at the bar to dine, but once I entered I decided differently.  After a rather sad sports day in the city the bar was lined with some long faces and drunken attitudes.  After the host had a lengthy conversation with a coworker I was finally noticed at the host stand.  When I told the host that it was only me and he suggested that I sit at the bar, I deferred that notion and requested a table.  Once seated at the table, it wasn't any better.  Those drunken attitudes seem to have spread out through the restaurant.  To say the noise level was loud is close to an exaggeration.  If I had to hear the drunk lady tell her daughter and son-in-law how much she was ready for a baby any longer I may have offered to help that process along just to get her to shut up.

Once I had a chance to look over the menu I was a little confused.  Everything is priced extra.  That is unless you get the platter deal.  The burger by itself is not on the cheap, ranging from $8-$11.  The sides start at $3 and range up to $6.  So if you were to go on the complete cheap side of things here, your meal before anything else is already at $11.  They do say that you can make your burger a platter, but it is basically the same pricing.  I went with Big Bill's Deluxe Platter.  At $13, it is probably the best value.

The burger patty is bigger, but that didn't make up for the lack of spices.  There was no taste to this thing at all.  And let's touch on the grease issue.  Or should I say let the grease issue touch on you.  There was so much burger grease that the bottom half of the bun was saturated and nearly inedible.  The fries, cold.  However the fries did have a decent seasoning on them.

I really need to touch on the customer service before I end this review.  My server, or maybe I should say order taker because he did not serve a single item to me, was so scarce for me that he might as well had been a ghost.  After my order was taken he only came back to give me my check.  The guy that actually served my food was the most pleasant person I had an interaction with the whole time here.

After finishing my food and drink, I waited for twenty minutes.  In those twenty minutes I watched my ""server"" whiz by multiple times.  I even attempted to wave him down so I could get my check and go.  I'm not sure how he missed me on all those occasions, especially when he stopped at the table next to me to hand them their checks.  People seated after me were already gone and here I still sat.  Finally I received my check and was eager to pay and leave.  I will never stop back here again, this visit has left a less than desired taste in my mouth, figuratively and literally.",2015-11-04 03:54:12

Oil changes are a cinch. Pull up, give them your keys, go wait in the waiting area for about 45 minutes and off you go after you've paid (if there is payment required.) Appointments are generally really good.  They get you in the next day sometimes or within 3 days. The shuttle service is great too! They'll pick you up if you need them to after your car is done.

I've since sold my RAV4 and bought a 2014 Toyota Sienna in Ontario. We moved back to Calgary and shipped it and I wouldn't bring it anywhere else to get it serviced. The DVD Navigation system went kaput and once they ordered the replacement it was fixed. Toyota headquarters didn't send the DVD itself back, so my service advisor, Don, went out of his way to figure out where it could be. If the DVD wasn't found they would cough up the replacement cost.

The show consists of 19 songs--showstoppers from Broadway musicals--that were evidently chosen by Steve Wynn.  There are 19 songs in all as of this evening.

The show opens with a medley of songs from Hello Dolly and Mame, then Cabaret and finally Chicago.  In between there are some shows that are represented by one song including one called ""Ol' Las Vegas"" a takeoff on the song ""No Name City"" from Paint Your Wagon.

The cast consists of 66 people counting a full orchestra and a large complement of singers and dancers with several lead singers.  The cast is extraordinarily talented.  They sing beautifully and the dancing is done very well.

My favorite numbers for the evening were ""Willkomen"" from Cabaret, ""Cell Block Tango"" from Chicago, ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" from Gypsy, and the ""Chorus Line/One"" opening number for A Chorus Line.  The solo numbers were absolute standouts including ""All That Jazz"" from Chicago.

A few thoughts on the show.  Note, I am a theatre junkie.  I love all types of theatre, especially Broadway.  While I enjoyed this show a whole lot, it's too short at just about 1 hour and 5 minutes.  I couldn't believe they were doing curtain calls so quickly.  The show started about 5 minutes late--what do they think this is, the Smith Center?  Perhaps the late start was opening night.  Early on, one of the characters introduces a number with some short comments.  After that, a recorded Steve Wynn introduced some sections and individual numbers.  Do we really need a recorded Steve Wynn telling us what ""Razzle Dazzle"" from Chicago is about?  All I could think was, ""Pot, meet kettle.

On the way out, we were handed a survey to help them improve the show.  The last question is ""Would you recommend this show to family, friends, and Las Vegas visitors?""  The possible answers given are:  1) Yes - it's a great show for all; 2) Maybe - depends on whether they like Broadway or not; and 3) No.  And there's the rub.  The show will be liked mostly by people who know and like Broadway.  The show will appeal to the older demographic, certainly not the Tryst nightclub goer.

I hope the show succeeds but I wonder if it can.  Very talented singers and dancers weren't enough to keep Spamalot and Avenue Q in this theatre and there are no bells and whistles like Phantom.  Time will tell.

As a tip, the website did not allow choosing a seat rather you are assigned one.  I'd recommend sitting at least four to five rows from the stage.  If you want to be assured of where you're sitting, I'd call the box office and have the seat map on your computer.",2014-12-17 05:54:33

It just looks like an apartment complex with lots of green around. To summarize, here's what I did and didn't like:

- Air conditioning was our main issue. We were first given room #131 on the third floor, then we switched to #113 on the ground floor. In both rooms the air condition was not working at first. It couldn't get lower than 77-78 F (still too hot at night). They tried to fixed it and it worked for a little bit, yet, it couldn't reach 70 degrees F. Then they moved us again always because that building was having constant leaks...Finally the last room we moved (#611) was satisfying our expectations in terms of climate. 

- Pool is small and not a diving pool (it's only 5 feet deep). Also it closes at 10 pm...that made me think it's a place for old people. Cause a pool that closes at 10 pm is NOT FUN! I tried to ask for an exception (One night I had some friends over) but no way. 

- The hot breakfast is good and moderately variegated but It doesn't even last until 9.30! So basically If I wasn't an early bird myself at my young age, I couldn't even catch breakfast. :/ 

- The kitchen is not fully equipped like they say. My father and I stayed for 13 days and we both love to cook. But I had to bring some pots, pans and other stuff from my house. So if you're really big into the cooking, be aware there are some ""missing pieces"". No problem, we still cooked anyway. 

- Parking is free but it's neither gated nor covered...and there's little shade. So expect your car to bake under the sun all day long. (Hope you don't have a black car) They put a guy in front of the entrance for late night arrivals as a ""gate"" to prevent non-guests to get in, but still, I could have said a random room number, he would have let me in. Not a very efficient way, in my opinion. Fortunately Scottsdale is already one of the safest areas in the valley. 

- The irrigation system is dangerous and annoying: they irrigate the grass in the morning right when you get out of your room to reach the breakfast hall. The walkway gets all wet and VERY SLIPPERY! Be aware! My father fell and got injured. I can confirm it's annoying to walk on something you could fell on at anytime. 

Here's what I liked instead: 

- Customer service and room cleaning was top notch. Staff always friendly, courteous, and professional. I've had Deidra (I hope I spelled it right) taking care of the air conditioning issues. She was very nice. Also the GM Erin came to our door personally to offer us another room, and he also took a night off the bill to apologize for the inconvenience. Very nice of him. 

- Fitness center is a bit small but still functioning. You can at least burn some calories  without getting Arizona nasty sunburns. 

- The night fare was reasonable, not too expensive for an Hyatt.

- Rooms were very clean and comfortable, wi-fi fast and functioning. And it's free!! 

- The omelette station is fantastic. The lady makes the omelette with a bunch of different stuffing right in front of you. Light and scrumptious. 

- For being located in the heart of the nightlife, it's very quiet. We didn't have any noise issues. Very good. 

In conclusion, 3 stars to this Hyatt House, to balance the good and the bad. Perhaps I'm a dreamer, but for an Hyatt I was expecting a little bit more. Will I go back? Yes in December!! When I know I won't have air conditioning issues and I won't use the pool.",2016-07-13 14:25:59

A note about spice level--I'm a bit of a wimp and asked for a 2 on a 1-5 scale. My food definitely had some heat. A 3 would have been too much for me, but a 2 was just right. Err on the side of going lower than you otherwise might--they are not fooling around!",2016-04-18 03:10:36

Mozen was one of those place I've had bookmarked forever, mainly for their brunch but $30 for lunch seems very reasonable for such a high rated spot.

The service was top notch from the get go.  They were very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and even though we almost went a la carte, our waiter urged us to go with the RE menu since ""it's the best of what we offer"".  Who wants to pay more than $15 for Indian curry anyways? :)

The Benito box offered a variety of diverse flavors.  It was almost like a mini tour of Asia!  The box had chicken tandoori in a mahkani sauce, California rolls (with real crab), garlic naan, miso mustard sliced steak and the matcha tiramisu being the perfect ending for it all.  My favorite was the salmon crudo tartare.  The freshness of the salmon combined with the nice spicy kick it had was fantastic.  I tried to buy another can of this as it would've been just perfect being mixed with a bowl of rice but alas...

The waiter said he mentioned to the chef that they should offer this combination lunch daily and apparently he scoffed at the idea.  Perhaps too many dishes to deal with all the time?  It would rival Estiatorio Milos for best lunch on the strip if they did.

Hancock Fabrics was one such fabric store we used to frequent.  That is until they went out of business in my home town.  It was a while ago that I discovered this location.  I tell my Grandma about it from time to time and it is on our list of places to see next time she visits.  Until recently, though, I had never been into this particular store.  I don't have a sewing machine so there is not much need.  But I am planning on making a pair of shorts soon while I am visiting my Grandma and needed fabric.  

I like Hancock better than JoAnn's solely for the fact that they are smaller and more focused on the fabrics than they are the crafts.  This Hancock's fits that bill well.  It is a small store packed full of fabrics.  Such a variety too.  They have upholstery, fleece, flanel, prints.  Color coordinated. Style coordinated.  Sales table.  It is fabric galore.  I was in it for some green plaid.  I found almost exactly what I needed knowing full well I was not going to find an exact match.  So close enough was good enough for me.  I got two yards and saved more than what I paid since this fabric was on the sale table.  The sweet elderly ladies at the cutting center remarked about how much they liked this woven green plaid.  They had all sorts of ideas of what they could make with it.  One thing they mentioned was shorts.  I guess I am on the right track.",2015-06-03 21:04:02

Their tea is really nothing that special - average prices, average food, not something worth coming out of my way for.

Their dinner is fantastic though.  Great food for a competitive price. For about $60 a table of 3 can go away full and still be bringing food away.

Favourite dishes are their shrimp and egg rice.  Definitely a little more expensive than the typical dish in their menu, but this never fails to amaze me.  Topped with some diced, deep fried onion bits, on shrimp and egg fried rice, for about $11, this is well worth trying out. 

They have a starter soup for the table and usually little desserts (a soupy dessert and often some cookies/pastries), definitely a nice touch.  Service is decent, attentive and polite servers for the most part.

I was a tad confused, as I went through the J-Town by the Sea entrance, and the sushi place on the left was closed, and I thought Sasaki was as well, but it wasn't, so huzzah! 

Got the sesame and the matcha daifukus ($2.50 each) to go. I wanted to try the chestnut one as well, but we'll save that for another day. We asked for them to go, and they were put in a small, plastic container with the Sasaki logo on it. Super cute. I felt like such a little kid holding that small plastic container walking back to the car. In a good way, though. 

I did not, and probably will not, have the sesame. Saving it for my brother. My dad had the other half of it. He liked it. He said it was soft. 

I had half of the matcha one though. It's ridiculously soft. I mean soft as in pillowy. Soft as in like a cloud. The matcha cream definitely had a dinstinct matcha taste, and worked incredibly well with the red bean inside. 

Another review mentioned that this mochi is about two bites. My half a mochi was a pretty big bite. I mean, it fit in my mouth, but I probably should have bit it in half again so that I could savor it properly, instead of trying to down it in one mouthful. 

At $2.50, I think it's justifiable as a special treat once in a while, but I doubt I'll make this part of my regular routine.

First, the good things. The space is gorgeous, including inside the theater. I loved the scrolling movie poster marquee they have on the walls. The screen was huge as well, I've never seen a theater with that many reclining seats in one screen.

Things I didn't like: I didn't care for the seats overall. About an hour into the movie I was pretty uncomfortable. The food options are underwhelming for a place like this. Just some appetizer like things you can get to pick at. (cheese plates, etc) The beer selection at the bar was very disappointing. Basically Bud Light, Sam Adams, and a couple of Four Peaks. The AMC Esplanade has more interesting choices. (also not great, but it's AMC)

This theater will be polarizing. As a frequenter of the old Camelview 5, I know they catered to an older crowd. I'm 35, and I was usually the youngest person there. That audience is not going to like the higher ticket prices, trickier parking (although not terrible), and bigger crowds. (since this theater is showing wide release movies in addition to the smaller fare) And honestly, I sympathize. It was nice having a completely separate theater for those kinds of films. There were no teenagers rolling up deciding what to see spur of the moment, it was a more sophisticated crowd.

As long as this location continues to show the smaller/more indy type movies I will be there. I hope Harkins maintains it's commitment to keeping those at Camelview. I have a feeling attendance may drop sharply though.",2016-01-09 17:06:28

Every staff member we encountered was caring, professional, and thorough. I do not consume dairy at all anymore and mentioned my food intolerance tonight. The servers and kitchen staff all took it very seriously, going as far as to note it on paper, omit dairy products from products that normally have dairy (i.e. roti, eggplant bharta), and warning me before every course which dishes do still contain dairy since my partner still enjoys it. Our water glasses were constantly refilled and despite how busy it was here tonight the servers never forgot about us. Only downside was that food was a bit slow to arrive at our table, but it has been a busy night.

Very vegetarian friendly, but vegans do make sure you tell the staff in advance of your dietary restrictions because as I learned tonight that even vegan sounding dishes like eggplant bharta, dal makhani, and vegetable samosas contain animal products/dairy. In the case of breads and veggie dishes, modifications can be made to exclude dairy, but in the case of vegetable samosas they cannot as the samosas actually come frozen and they reheat it - we don't recommend ordering the samosas here as only 2 comes per order and there's not much filling.

Complimentary papadum to start along with 2 sauces, but additional sauces like mango chutney must be ordered individually. Carbs such as naan and rice are also not complimentary, so you must order these additionally. If you're looking for a healthier alternative to naan, which tends to be white flour and buttery, I recommend ordering the roti ($2.25), which is whole wheat, resembles a naan, and can come with or without butter. The vegetarian mains are quite small and at least $10.95, so I do recommend ordering a few different mains and sharing. I liked the eggplant bharta, which was moderately spicy, enough to induce that tingly sensation. 

The food highlight tonight was actually the vegan Bhel Chaupati appetizer ($5.95), which is quite a large portion though not that filling since the grains are puffed, not dense. It's basically chaat - well seasoned semi-sweet and -savory and has an interesting texture that's crunchy yet a bit chewy too.

No outdoor seating. Venue gets a bit noisy due to all the families and young children here, but nothing too loud like the bars across the street. We did notice that most of the clientele appear to be Indian, so that can only be a good sign :)

While the fish sandwich and fries I ordered was pretty good, the price and service are what brings this review down in stars. The atmosphere looks more upscale, however since the restaurant is located right outside PNC park, it has multiple tvs and also tries to achieve a sports bar feel. Just for a fish sandwich, I paid $13 and it wasn't any different than one I could have gotten for half the price or at any of the actual sports bars in the area. It was not crowded when we were there, yet it took 20 minutes to get our check and one of our orders came out wrong. Ultimately, I was kind of disappointed",2018-02-17 21:19:17

If you like guacamole, this is the place for you.  They make it at the table while you watch, and you can have it seasoned to your taste.  It's a bit pricey to get the guacamole, but it's pretty delicious.  Just be prepared because you'll get a LOT of guac.  If you don't like the guacamole, you will probably be pretty satisfied with the complimentary salsa.  

If you like tequila, you have come to the right place.  There are plenty of different types and there is a good variety of margaritas.  I am more of a beer man, myself.  There aren't a lot of drafts to choose from, but they have Dos Equis Amber and when I'm eating Mexican food that is good enough for me.

So what really inspired me to write this review was the dish I had the other night, the barbacoa de puerco.  I cannot believe I've been to Cantina so many times without trying this thing but it was amazing.  The dish consisted of slow cooked, shredded pork with pico, guacamole, and charro beans and rice.  The pork was tender, juicy, flavorful, and delicious.  It came with flour tortillas to load up with the meat and sides.  It possibly the best Mexican meal I've had.  

If you aren't interested in the barbacoa, I'd recommend to get some tacos.  There are about 10 different types so there's something for everyone.  

In conclusion, if you like Mexican food you need to go here.  Be sure to make a reservation if you're going on Friday or Saturday.  If you don't, you will likely be waiting for a while.  Standing around waiting for 45 minutes watching the waiters carry around the delicious looking and wonderful smelling hot plates is a torturous experience.",2013-02-10 21:04:51

Let me give you an example. I was making spinach dip and needed a Knorr soup mix. First I went to Fresh and Easy. They didn't have it. So, I went to Smiths, because it was closer and thought for sure they would have it. NO! So, knowing that I can trust Albertson's I drove a little further away knowing they would pull through for me. When I walked in and went to the soup section it was like the sky's parted just for me and there stood the Knorr soup mix. Ah! Finally!!

Also, I have had really experiences with the bakery here. One of my favorite cakes is the Chocolate cake with Chocolate WHIP icing. It is way less sweet and is so yummy. One time I was running late on getting a cake for a special someone, however they had it for me the very next day. It was awesome and was only like $20!

Seriously, they are minutes away from being on Kitchen Nightmares. When we arrived, it took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us. I had just said that if we wait another 5 minutes I was going to walk out, we were 2 minutes away from that when she arrived. She was very apathetic and it was obvious she was just going through the motions. We were served some extremely sour, sourdough bread. For the record I enjoy sourdough, but this was almost inedible. After consulting my seafood watch card, I settled on the Parmesan crusted Alaskan Sanddab. I chose garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as my sides. When my meal arrived the fish was piping hot and the sides were stone cold. The fish was not too bad, there was no seasoning and really no lemon sauce which was disappointing because it would have actually been a good dish otherwise. Unfortunately, it was a bland, slightly oily mess. I could almost hear Gordon Ramsay screaming about the lack of seasoning. The mac and cheese was not only cold, but completely flavorless. The garlic mash was OK, but nothing special. My husband had the fish and chips. I am pretty sure the cod was frozen and the fries again were edible, but nothing spectacular. 

Our waitress was not very friendly, but she went through the motions. I did observe her playing with her mouth and lips after I had eaten, which completely grossed me out. I observed another server push a falling knife back onto a plate with her chest, this plate of food was full and on its way to a patron. Again I could hear Gordon screaming in my head, ""Just set the plate down!""

Kings is a dinosaur in the dining world. They are stuck in an era that no longer exists. People want flavor, not food that they can cook themselves at home (and a better version at that). The place was almost empty on a Friday night and many of the patrons were very senior. Kings really needs to modernize if they hope to survive in this foodie city.",2012-07-28 03:38:19

The customer service is what quickly locked me in as a guaranteed repeat customer. Small location/a bit crowded on Sat night, but was immediately welcomed upon entering.

Okok so I got the Jasmine Latte Tea with Boba and Salt Sweet Cream and boyfriend got the Sunrise Sunset Slush. Mine was milky/flowery/herbal/green tea-ish and his was fruity. Both great choices however, I'm sure the Salt Sweet Cream addition would've tasted better on a cold brew, oolong, or black tea rather than an herbal drink.

The BBQ pizza was good, but not blew me away good. I think I'll order a burger next time.
Sweet potato fries were good and the portion this time was huge!!! Didn't like the sauce they came with.

I've already been to Smashburger three times, each time having their Spicy Baja Black Bean Burger with a side of smash fries (and on my last visit I also indulged in a milkshake as I had a 50% off coupon).  The veggie burger here is no imitation meat product- it's a handmade patty that is falling apart full of black beans- get it signature style with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun, or use it in place of the meat in one of their other burgers, like mushroom swiss or avocado club.  Skip the plain fries and opt for the same-price smash fries instead- they are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.

The three times I've visited I've taken my food to go, as I'm ashamed to be seen in a fast food restaurant (yeah, yeah...), and they do a great job of packaging the food so that it stays in perfect condition.  We're talking plastic hamburger cases and poutine with the wet ingredients packaged separately.

We opened the menu and found our usual Mexican staple, Enchiladas. The price was $22!!! Even if these were the best enchiladas we've ever had (and we've had some GOOD ones) I'm sorry, there would be absolutely no way to justify $22. 

Other prices on the menu were equally ridiculous. I couldn't do it. I simply could not bring myself to order $22 enchiladas on principle.

Yo Amo Tacos (or Yo ""heart"" Tacos as the sign confusingly shows) is NOT a trendy or upscale place that can dare to charge prices like this for show. It's a run down joint that really should be fairly priced and awesome like mostly every other Mexican restaurant I've had the pleasure to give positive ratings to.

A year ago it was a barren space filled with trash, old signs and like a boring, empty hilly lot. Now, it's got a ton of playing field, basketball courts, kids playground type jungle gyms, bathrooms, a cool little walk circuit, nice layout, and most importantly-a dog park!

Now I don't have a dog, but I love to go to parks and watch other people's dogs having fun. Nothing makes my lunch time go faster than grabbing some to go, and stopping and parking and watching the dogs in the dog park. If there aren't any dogs present, I like to watch people doing sports or what not in the main field areas. 

The park is still relatively new, and hasn't succumbed to any major graffiti or vandalism, so that's good-hopefully it stays that way. There are a few picnic areas with shade-but I definitely recommend bringing some sunglasses if your going to be here for a while and do the walking trail. 

Some of the paths don't seem well thought out, and it seems like people cut through some of the areas to get to the bus or other places on the Tropicana side, but I don't use them that much-I just noticed other people doing that. 

Not sure if there is security, but I probably wouldn't come here after dark just because of the area, but all in all, great job by the city utilizing the space for good instead of building more warehouses or something. 

Cheers!

I tried a big bacon/cheese burger with jalepenos, fries and the whatachicken thats like chicken tenders/nuggets.  
First of all the burger did not look very nice and had more of the ""Five Guys"" scruffy sadburger look but without the ""FG"" taste to it. 
The fries where soft and the chicken tenders where tto big with a thick layer of breading and superdry in the meat. 

I would say this was one of my lowpoints when it comes to american burger places having tested In n out, Fatburger, The Counter, Wendys, Sonic, Jack in the box, Five Guys, Hodads etc etc.......

 It all started in a little Italian family restaurant in ""Snowville"" in Parma for me.  They moved across the street and expanded quite a bit.  This was the place my family went as a kid, it was the place we Holy Namers always went after our high school games.  It is where I go now for CONSISTENTLY Great Memories and great pizza.
 First off, I must clarify my review is based pretty 90% on their pizza...sure they have other stuff, but is it great?  Some yes (try for one Muffalatta) others no (say salad, always been white iceberg less than appealing, however their grated mozzarella and pepper is a good cover up)
 I can describe their pizza and what makes it so good....For me it's always a deluxe....GREAT freshly baked pizza dough and perfectly crunchy to bite yet soft to chew crust...A well done sauce, and great toppings.  I always to opt for Extra cheese.  No pizza place anywhere ever gives you enough cheese on any pizza.  Fresh pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions finish quite well.  Soft chewy warm.  Dough you can taste and that tastes good.  This is fantastic.  From time to time I will get one of the other types of pizzas but the deluxe is by far my favorite.  Fresh ingredients (except for mushrooms) make this excellent.
 Another of their lesser known treats is their Chicago Deep Dish.  Not many places can pull it off like Antonio's; even the Chicagoans have forgotten what a pizza PIE is.  
 Overall to sum it up, this has been my lifetime favorite.  In fact it's the pizza I compare all pizzas too.  Thank you to the LoSchiavo family for your great product!",2011-03-04 16:50:07

Lunch or dinner - I highly recommend coming to Scadda for a really delicious meal. I'm not sure what their parking situation is, but it's a 5 minute walk from Dundas Station. There's also free wifi in their restaurants. This restaurant is 2 floors, and around 10 or 11 at night, the bar downstairs will play fantastic 90s throwback music!

Favourite food to order:
All proceeds from their charity bread goes to one of three local charities that they partner with (Sick Kids, Mississauga Food Bank, Starlight Canada). Charity bread starts at $4.47 and goes up depending on what type you get. My favourite thing to order whenever I'm at Scadda is their naked fresh mozzarella ($13.28), but fresh mozzarella is unfortunately only available after 5pm. Their spinach and artichoke dip ($12.98) and bruschetta ($6.77-small and $10.97-large) is something I would order for a part of 2 or 3 because their portions aren't that big. I didn't try their stuffed meatball ($13.58), but my boyfriend tried it and it is one HUGE meatball.

I have tried their chicken parmesan ($19.98) which is very, very, very filling because of all the pasta. My go-to entree here is their pizza - specifically the Sophia ($16.87). It comes with chicken, goat cheese, and caramelized onions - my favourite 3 ingredients for pizza! After 1 or 2 starters, I usually am full enough to take home some leftovers from my main.

Service is not bad, but nothing very memorable. My friend decided to host her birthday dinner here for about 12 people. She said that the staff member she talked to when making her reservation tried to get her to use a price fixe menu for this dinner multiple times, but she kept refusing because she knew it would cost more per person.",2017-01-24 01:50:47

I like my rooms luxurious even when I know I will barely be in the room. It's just so nice to come back to a big, clean, luxurious room after partying all day lol. 

3 stars compared to OTHER rooms at the Venetian and Palazzo. Compared to other hotel rooms, it's a 4 star. When I checked in, they offered me this tower instead  because it was a packed weekend, I checked in late after taking a side trip to Death Valley first, and all the double beds in the main tower were gone... just one accessible room left and I didn't want to take that room because what if someone really needed it. 

Anyways, so the Venezia tower is closest to the check in desk... but far from everything else!! The check in girl lured me in by stating there was a private entrance, lobby, pools... and she had a pool view room for me... while that was all true, it is very inconvenient! I tried the room not know how much walking I would have to do and what a maze it was. 

To get to the rooms here, you take 2 elevators. One takes you to that building and other takes you up to the rooms. You go into the first elevator... get off, then walk a long ways down to the next elevator. While the walk is pretty (you walk through the wedding area), it's kind far, especially if you have a lot of stuff. It is also here where Buchon is located. 

Like the girl said, there is a more private pool area here, and this one is open year round. My friend and I checked out the pool area, but did not swim because it was cold, but we saw people in the jacuzzis, maybe the water was warm? I felt the water in the pool and it did not feel cold though. Buchon overlooks the pool area. 

As far as the rooms... for some reason, it felt smaller to me. Maybe it was the decor? I like the rooms on the Palazzo side better because it's very easy to get to from the parking/elevators and the rooms are a tad bit bigger. Anyways, like I said, I'm spoiled and like the rooms here, so I was disappointed to see only 2 TV's in these rooms instead of the 3 that are in the other rooms! There is no TV in the bathroom. I like to have the music channel on while I'm getting ready! The beds also felt smaller. I'm thinking they were full beds and not actual queen beds... Another thing the rooms here lacked compared to the other rooms was remote controlled curtains!! The rooms in the main Venetian tower and Palazzo have buttons you can push to open and close the curtains as you desire. I was not happy seeing a small sofa bed couch instead of the sectional one as with most of the other rooms. Yes, I so sound spoiled lol. Trust me though, the room in the Venezia tower IS nice, and yes much nicer compared the other hotel rooms on the strip... and the Venetian is my favorite hotel and having stayed here many times in the main tower and Palazzo, compared to those rooms, this room didn't compare. 

If you were to have a wedding here however, then these rooms would be more ideal as you don't have to walk around the casino and the rooms are in the same area. 

I think from now on however, I will book the Palazzo side. It's just much easier and closer to the parking/elevators! I guess I shouldn't complain much though... my room was completely comped for the weekend, no resort fees even, lol. The housekeepers were friendly and did an excellent job, cleaned around the same time each day so we always came back to a fresh room.",2014-01-26 21:34:58

We ordered the pad thai and the Malaysian shrimp curry to share. The portions were huge, and everything seemed extra fresh. The curry comes in a large bowl with a generous side of rice and salad on a separate plate. After eating about half of each dish, we were completely stuffed. We agreed to pack it up and eat the rest for dinner. About 5 minutes after making this decision with my mouth full I believe I said something like: "" I know we should stop eating but... I don't want to"". 
The flavours, especially in the curry, were very bold and perfectly spicy. The pad thai was very saucy.

On Sunday, they have brunch with bottomless mimosas, bloody Mary's and bellinis. I personally had the bottomless bloody Mary's and the shortrib country hash with a side of bacon. 

The bloody Mary's are nice and spicy, and were definitely not lacking in alcohol. Our server was really friendly. He has on French fry socks and for some reason was holding onto a few children's books. He was very entertaining and made sure we were well taken care of.

The shortrib hash was really good. It has sautéed mushrooms, peppers, the short rib and nice crispy potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon and it was thick and crispy. Which to me makes perfect bacon.

However. My absolute favorite thing here is the monkey bread. By far the best monkey bread I have ever had and everyone should order it. You would definitely not regret it. 

There is a lot of parking near this location, but it is all paid parking, so be aware that it will cost $3-6 depending on how long you eat and want to shop around

Their Northshore tacos are pretty good too with their marinated shredded chicken, but better if you get a side of sour cream. 

I have lots of friends who are big fans of their burgers, but they've never been my thing.  Their cheddar fries are another thing all together.  I know how wrong it is to get a platter of cheese fries, with folks eating them with both fingers and fork, but somehow that works here....

The deal was fab.   Definitely a good business use of group-type vouchers as I would never have otherwise heard of, or gone to this place.  The gelato was very refreshing and delicious - two generous scoops piled on top of a cone was enough for us to share.  A bare bones location decoration wise, there were a few metal tables and chairs to sit at and chill while enjoying the dessert and people watching.  On a humid, rainy Saturday night, there was a continuous stream and line up of people coming in for their cold sugary treat.

The attitude that Karyn B. noted barely raised its head as it seemed the servers were more interested in moving the crowd along.  The servers could smile more yes, but they were efficient and unpretentious, so I didn't mind.  What I was taken aback by was the little signs that they had stuck into various gelato that basically said, 'No sampling'.  At first, I thought it was just for some popular flavours as there wasn't a sign for all of them, but then when I observed the lack of sampling spoons, I realized that they meant for everything.  Fair enough, as a business practice, however, given that the industry uses sampling as a general mode of operation, it did plant the seed of 'this place is really too high up on itself' into my brain.  I'm not sure that given that there are so many other frozen treat places out there and in the immediate area, that I would want to give my patronage to a place that treats me as a person that would take advantage of them (by trying too many flavours just because I can).  I don't even know them!

$5 for a small and extra for a cup vs a cone (or that could just be for the amazing deal I had).  I would come here again for their large scoops of yummy gelato.",2011-08-15 15:54:24

We don't even go up the stairs or follow the arrows, because that shit is for showroom suckers. We turn right around and go the wrong way and bam we're in the ""market"" section where everything is actually for sale. We keep each other focused on the list (NO! No coasters! No wicker baskets! No spontaneous glassware damn you, focus!) We move with military precision to our targets, (slow is smooth and smooth is fast!) We go at Grandma-speed because the crowds open up for a cute old lady (she is a shopping shark, but she's cute as hell.) 

Anyway, this is the only tolerable way to do Ikea. Have a precise and narrow list, have one or two awesome helpers with sharp eyes who don't lose focus; get in and get your on sale lamp or curtains or lounger, get into the self checkout, and then get the frick out.

Social Nuit is buried on Queen Street West right near my old haunt: The Drake Hotel. Haven't been there in awhile, but still love the neighborhood. You'll walk right past it the first time. The storefront is so freaking unassuming. Look for the ""Nuit"" script in the window.

Make reservations. It's tiny. A front dining area, a small bar with bar dining, and a tiny back dining room (the best place for a more quiet dinner).

There are share plates and then charcuterie. I chose the place because, unlike most restaurants on Valentine's Day, they didn't have a stupid prix fixe menu. I hate those overpriced prix fixe bullshit menus with their $100pp multi-course fiesta that always turns into poor quality and sloppy. What Social Nuit had instead was a $70 per couple (per couple! sweet!) deal where you could choose 5 items from the meat/cheese/olive menu, 3 share plates and 2 desserts. Just my kind of place.

We chose a hard goat cheese, a soft blue cheese, and a creamy French cheese. Beautifully presented along with prosciutto and salami. A little crostini, sweet jams, spicy mustards, tart pickles. Perfect. 

For the three shares, we had the arancini, pork ribs (served over mac n cheese), and beet salad. All were amazing. Arancini was deliciously light and flash-fried with delicious sausage lining the center. The pork ribs lived up to the other reviews. Fall off the bone and barbecued similar to Korean BBQ. The combo with the mac and cheese was great. And the beet salad wasn't too cold or too sweet (my pet peeves with beets). Sweet potato complemented this salad nicely. 

We added on half a lobster tail. It was good, not great. Slightly overcooked, maybe a little overpriced. It mattered little in the grand scheme of things. 

Dessert -- get the parmesan cheesecake. It was far better than the dessert special, which was an apple custard. The parmesan lends a savory edge to the cheesecake, which is unusually wonderful. Just a small piece, very rich, not very sweet, a perfect finisher. 

Our drinks were also spectacular. I had something that was perfect for a cold winter's night -- bourbon with smoked rosemary. Loved it. 

I'm going back to Nuit Social. It was the perfect mix of spirited, aesthetic, romantic, whimsical, tasty, fun and easy on the wallet. Hooray!",2016-02-18 01:43:30

I also tried the Bannock fried bologna..which comes with pita bread, potatoes, eggs, tomatoes, and.. fried bologna of course. The dish was interesting but I wouldnt get it again. Too much of a breakfast dish.. And while it was good, there honestly was just too many carbs there (pita, potatoes) and combined with eating the poutine pizza, I felt quite heavy.

It is ""suppose"" to only transport you from bar to bar to get your drink on. Here are my tips to make this experience all you ever dreamed of.....

*Pick only your coolest friends who know how to party. This is key to the whole equation equaling awesome.

*Load your ipod with all of your favorite gangsta rap and the Killers or whatever gets you in the mood to fuckin' rage. This crazy apparatus does not have tunes of it's own. All good, just come prepared.

*Adjust your damn seat. You may be too faded to hear the dude running the show point this out. If you are part hobbit like myself you have to lower that seat or you may not be able to sit like a normal human being for days and it will royally suck balls.

*Master the art of fake peddling. News flash: YOU DON'T HAVE TO PEDDLE IN REAL LIFE TO MAKE THIS BIKE MOVE. IT'S A MAGIC BAR BIKE YOU CAN'T DRINK ON. Pretending is always more fun. What's even more fun is if you look around at your friends really peddling like this is a high intensity spin class. Just smile and wave and do your fake peddling. It's Friday night and this is not the Tour De Vegas. It's like a booze cruise on the city streets.

*Tell the man in charge where you want to go. Otherwise he will take you to lame places like the Nacho Daddy or other lame tourist traps. Create your own destiny guys.

*Bring a ""coffee thermos or something"" filled with a tasty beverage that you can disguise as water or coffee or hot chocolate. That's all I have to say about that. If you can't decode that message than maybe you should just be home playing Candy Crush or something. 

That's all I got. Overall this is an amazing experience with the right group of people and the right music and right level of intoxication. Not 5 stars for me because the owner should A. Have his own music program. B. Negotiate drink deals with the local bars he drags you to. C. I wish it lasted longer.

- There was a short wait (20 min) which would normally be a turn off, but Coca takes your cell phone number and calls you when your table is ready, leaving you the freedom to explore the boutiques lining Butler Ave. I really wish more restaurants would do this!
- The banana bread and the zucchini bread (see photo) were fantastic! I highly recommend them. Whatever is in the butter that accompanies each must have crack in it b/c I couldn't stop eating it!
- My girlfriend got the goat cheese stuffed french toast. Not the best stuffed french toast ever (head to Dozen for that...mmm...hungry just thinking about it), but very interesting and very tasty.

Sadly, though, that's where the greatness stopped. I ordered the smoked salmon omelet with the goat cheese and a side of sausages. It was, well, bland. The salmon wasn't very salmon'y, and the eggs weren't very egg'y. I don't know how to describe it other than ""blah"". Oh, and my sausages were shaped liked meatballs and were completely flavorless. What gives?

For a place that I've heard nothing but good things about, this one feel a bit flat. And even as I write this, I'm torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars (damn you Yelp and your lack of 1/2 stars). On the one hand, the bread and my girl friend's dish were delicious. On the other hand, I could make my dish better with very minimal effort. So I think I'm going to leave it as a 3-star rating but with the caveat that if you order the right things, you might well give it a higher rating.

Good luck in finding the right dish at this trendy, but underwhelming eatery.",2009-09-13 17:37:42

Guess what? I like kangaroo meat. Who knew! If it's a fancy meat, they have in sausage form. Their duck fat fries are also good. Everything in duck fat. All of the time. 

PEPPER'S PISSED: About how they handle reservations. If someone is over 30 minutes late they have to wait outside? Be treated like a walk-in? Even if most of the party is inside already? This is a big city with busy people and we're spending money drinking and eating there all night. If it's about turnover, guess what? We're not leaving until the whole party sits and eats together... so.... you're actually making the whole thing slower. YA HEAR?!

Wowza! I was really pissed there. But again, mmmm sausage.

It's located on the industrial part of Losee where an old burger joint used to be. This is SO much better! The menu looked really interesting and the photos were appetizing on Yelp, so that's what brought us in.

Our server was super awesome! To be clear, subtracting a star had absolutely nothing to do with service. She was so great and attentive the entire time.
We ordered this trio with shrimp ceviche, fish ceviche and cooked octopus and shrimp as well as a dozen oysters. I absolutely LOVE oysters but not these ones. My husband didn't mind them, but they didn't seem fresh. The outer shell was still dirty. The texture was way off and they were almost room temp. I am really hoping I don't get sick later. There was something that was just off about them. I'm hoping it was just a fluke but next time I'll follow my instincts and get the guac. The trio was fantastic though! I have not one bad word to say about it. Our server brought plenty of tostadas, a little cup of salsa (which was fantastic- nice and spicy, but not too spicy), and this cup of shrimp broth that was great too.

One more thing, the entire menu is in Spanish.. But she was totally willing to help us out, although I do think they'd benefit from having an English translation or version of the menu for the sake of others who can't stumble their way through it.

Food; pretty decent. Chips and salsa were good. I had the chicken sabana. This was recommended by the waitress. I couldn't tell how big the plate was, and she recommended against ordering more.

The improvements were really nice and more modern and brought the hotel/casino into the new improved Vegas. 

As far as the rooms go they're not very big but are decorated nicely with flat screen tv. Sucks that they don't have a coffee pot in the rooms, there is however a hair dryer, iron and ironing board. The shower/toilet room is super tiny, you almost have to step in to the tub just to shut the door, otherwise the vanity area is decent. 

I'm also under the impression that they are now charging a $10/day resort fee to their guests. Also make sure you print out some sort of confirmation paperwork to take if you're staying there because if you don't you'll have to pay $5 for parking, although you do get a parking pass to use upon check in that allows you to leave and come back without paying.

Be careful when you exit, because it is very narrow on the single lane down, and watch for traffic; there is a stop sign for people exiting. Also, there are two ways to go- left to Koval (i'm guessing) and right- to Las Vegas Blvd/ the Strip (it's a light, so you don't have to worry so much about pedestrian traffic). I do agree with LJR on the beautiful views from the parking garage. 

The elevator has a bridge option. Go to the 1st floor for the movie theater. Other notable attractions/restaurants nearby: M & M's World, Coca Cola, Tix Tonight (discount tickets to shows), Hard Rock Cafe, Showcase Food Court.

This is an older movie theater by Las Vegas standards. This was built right before the in-casino boom. The ticket counter is outside. When you walk in, there is a small concession stand, to your left. To the right are the bathrooms (side by side, for men and women, but not single) and coin-operated candy machines (mini ducks, monkey hangers, stickers, etc.). The women's bathroom was pretty clean. 

We went here last night. This particular one had three areas to sit. We sat in the middle towards the front. The first four rows were left empty. The seats were just as I remembered- uncomfortable and stationary (not staggered, and for me (I'm short), when it's like this, I'm just hoping someone really tall doesn't sit right in front of me). The seat next to our friend, had gum on it (yeah, gross), so it was empty. My husband said the screen to the right of it had a line of green light. 

I agree with Connie R. and Matthew C. that this is an older theater and it's seen better days. It would be nice if there were a renovation project (better seats and a better system) but not likely as the economy is not so great right now. It's basic, and it's on the Strip, and it's alright.

I started off with the unagi don and truthfully, I've had better at ayce places (ni ji, even Sakura). There wasn't much unagi to begin with, therefore definitely not worth the $15.80 tab. Next was the beef tenderloin. It was not a bad presentation - a hot stone abed a wooden board, where you place each raw strip on the hot stone to grill. This was also $15.80 but not really worth the price either bc the strips were few and tiny. Last was the ebi mayo which I thought and was hoping would be stellar, but after one bite and look, I could tell it wasn't worth the $9 cost either. Miku and Nomé have wayyyy better ebi mayo's and they dress them up/present them very well (sauce-wise) Miku also accompanies their ebi's with salad which is actually delicious!

The drink does not have to be alcoholic and the deal also applies to takeouts as some places only have deals for dine-in. 

I got 2 lbs of wings and a coke for a total of ~16$ - not to mention the wings came with fries. I got the sweet chilli thai and the house sauce flavours. I enjoyed the house sauce more because it was different - a hint of sweetness + spicyness and tarty from a bbq sauce that they used. The wings were big and full of flavour.

I have to admit that the café is beautiful and full of vibrant colours due to many flower decorations. The coffee is okay, and I tried their been, caviar and salmon jerky salad, small portion but quite good. The price is quite high according to me because I find the quantity and quality were not extraordinary, but at least the taste is fresh and they have a variety of choices. The café can get quite crowded and they tend to ask customer alone to move to the counter (which is my case) because the capacity is limited. Try to avoid going there at peak hours (lunch time).

The organization makes it a good time for people of all ages. It's not nearly as flamboyant(obnoxious) and pompous as a Cavs game. Maybe it's because the cheerleaders can't actually get on the ice. Or because the mascot,a seagull, doesn't do the tired dunking off of a trampoline bit every stupid NBA mascot does. They even let two pee wee hockey teams play during intermission. It was better than the actual game.

The beer choices were slim and expensive. If you marvel at the fact that you can still get a decent brew at most bars for 3 to 5 bucks, try the Q for that authentic big city price gauging people move to New York to experience. $6.75 for a Bud Select. You read that right, Bud select. The concession folks are all hard working and friendly. The other staff at the Q seems very disinterested in their work. But you don't really need people with walkie talkies standing every five feet apart, so it doesn't matter if they work or not.

Our seats were in the nosebleeds, which is fun if you just want to stretch out and talk to your friends. We later moved down closer. That provided more of a feeling of being part of the action. That's where we saw the capper of the evening- -little boys taking their shirts off and twirling them over their heads like drunken football fans. It was hilarious.

The tix were free, but i could see paying around ten to maybe go see some hot shots from the NHL playing on a farm team until they recover from injury or whatever. It was also As Seen on TV giveaway night. I got a jupiter jack that turns your car speakers into a speaker for your cell phone. It kind of works. I still prefer to text and drive myself.

They take cash and credit cards, which is very convenient. Once you purchase you pass to get in you can access all of the trails and the visitors center. The park is as the street name suggests, a scenic loop. As you drive around you'll take in some seriously amazing views and be able to stop along the way to make your way through various trails.

I am not a connoisseur by any means, and I am not Korean, but this was the best overall experience and food I have had. 

What makes it the best in my eyes? 

Freshly prepared everything.  All the side dishes are wonderfully prepared, and everything is included.  We got soups, salads, sides, and everything in between.  Run out of something?  Just ask for it, and you have it within minutes.  Some other places really skimp out on these important staples.

Service...this is the hit or miss at Korean BBQ spots.  Sometimes you are your own chef (hate this way, but it still works), and sometimes you feel like you have your own personal chef table side.  This is the latter!  We had two different ladies checking in on us, ordering our food, refilling our drinks, and most importantly, cooking our food for us!  

Meats....also freshly prepared.  Don't expect to be digging out your own food raw buffet style.  That always weirded/grossed me out truthfully.  You want bulgogi?  Ask for it, and it is prepared and brought to your table.  Want more kalbi ribs?  You never get a dirty eye or feel guilty about pigging out.  And the meats are full of flavor!  Try the spicy pork dish and rice cracker dish (it is spelled out completely in Korean)!  Yum!

Lastly, the atmosphere is great.  The location isn't nearly as seedy as a lot of other spots, and the decor inside is very trendy and classy.  The grill tops work very well, and are super quiet fans that do their job well.  Since the food is prepared fresh and everyone is friendly, you feel very welcomed and can fully enjoy your short stay with them.  They have only been open for about a year, and with Mr. Lee's money behind them, you know they will be serving the best quality and selection at the most fair prices, just like their liquor stores.

Grandma's Chicken Meatballs $14

Chopped Kale Salad $14

Sea Scallop Cioppino $29

Hot Pot $20

Biegnets with Raspberry Sauce $10

The chicken meatballs were absolutely divine! They were probably the best chicken meatballs or maybe meatballs in general i've ever tasted. They were tender but still had a good texture and the tomato sauce and ricotta cheese helped the dish add more flavors. The kale salad was good. Next time though i would ask for the dressing on the side bc it was dressed pretty well. I liked the apple slices in it which made it refreshing. My cioppino tasted good but I thought it was too small of a portion for $29 and the scallops were of the small variety. My wife's hot pot consisted of kurobota pork, kimchee fried rice, and a fried egg. I thought it was good but not worth $20. The dessert was fantastic! The beignets were surprisingly light and airy with the acidic raspberry sauce to balance it. The service was great. Our waiter described to us in detail about the menu.

P.S. Having been born and raised in Chicago, seeing the words ""Chicago Up-side Down Pizza"" on a menu is an automatic turn-off.

I have a disease that limits what I can eat to Gluten-Free products only and up until last night I felt any restaurant who carried GF items was ok in my book because it meant they were at least taking us into consideration.  I was completely wrong and at the hands of one of my previous favorite restaurants experienced the worst kind of discrimination and was YELLED at for inconveniencing the owner who said, ""I only ordered this stuff to please YOU PEOPLE, I don't make a dime off of this.  What am I supposed to do, check every order that comes out of the kitchen?""  No, but you are supposed to educate your staff if you are going to take on the responsibility of catering to an entire community of people who become extremely ill when they encounter any sort of wheat flour!

Top Must-Get: Bombay chicken 
Top Regret: Spring rolls

My friend and I have come here for lunch a few times as it's right in the area. It's in a quiet plaza just south of Frederick's, which is a more well-known Hakka restaurant - making comparisons between the two natural. Frederick's offers literally more (both in menu options and quantity), but Hakka Legend, in my experience, has a slight edge in flavour and taste in some of its dishes.

FOOD
Manchurian chicken: this is my go-to Hakka dish. At Hakka Legend, it was good but not incredible. The colour of the sauce was less vivid than others (and that's a good thing - I find I am a bit more cautious eating bright red foods than dull coloured sauces). 3.5/5

Bombay chicken: amazing flavour in this dry rub dish, although it leans to the slightly salty end. This has plenty of kick, and the more you eat it, the more the heat will kick in. 4.5/5

Lunch specials come with your choice of soup or spring roll. Neither were particularly amazing, but the spring roll tasted oily and soggy the first time I had it. The second time around, it was slightly better, but I definitely wouldn't come here for those.

SERVICE
You get your seats and your order in pretty quickly, and your food comes not too long after that, but that's where it seems to end. It's not too busy, so the slow service is really puzzling. 

We had our water refilled once (and only after a few minutes of trying to flag someone down), and this has happened almost every time I've been here. To be fair, the owner seems to care when he's not in the kitchen, but the serving staff are definitely not appearing interested in customer service.

My thought is that restaurants that want to get away with shoddy service or check-ins should really provide whole pitchers of water/drinks. How can you serve spicy foods and not expect people to get thirsty?

The service pulls it down to a 3/5. However, the Bombay chicken (and close proximity) keeps me coming back from time to time.",2018-02-17 04:27:58
la1cqZFEDwUl8h-SDi6UJA,HNvtQAbgSeLBSkmXz2AkSg,bcTeQtSdHW5pyLjXz05QEg,4,1,3,2,"Bart was bummed out at work today, and he wanted a sandwich. But not just any run of the mill mid-week office lunch hour sandwich - he wanted a true to life sandwich experience. There was no doubt where we'd find this. I said, ""Fran's.""
Squirreled away inconspicuously at the corner end of the Park Square shopping center in Dilworth, Fran's Filling Station is an unfortunately all-too-often overlooked lunch spot in the greater Park Road area. Surrounded by so many mediocre options in that area that our coworkers are so often complacently willing to settle on - Jason's Deli, McAlister's, Which-Wich, Penn Station, etc. - I felt in Bart's diminished mood, he needed a trip to the glorious little hovel of good food that is Fran's. 
Not ones to adhere to a conventional businessday lunch hour, we strolled in around 11:15am. There was no one else in the dining room, just a pair of waitresses leaning delicately across the blocked-wood bar, fingers intertwined, elbows crooked and pressed upon, faces plain yet subtly eager with start-of-the-day malaise. 
Bart had never been to Fran's. He gestured an approving curl of his lower lip. ""Hmmmmph,"" he said. 
I nodded. ""Yep.""
The waitresses greeted us charmingly, as they're apt to do. Fran's isn't a hoity establishment. It's a classic southern cafe, done up in folksy art, hand-painted table tops under heavy lacquer, fresh flower bouquets, etched wood carvings, and clever 60s/70s era pop art adorning the brick walls. You feel like you're all friends there, like you're all in this together, like you just walked onto the set of Fried Green Tomatoes or something. 
Our waitress came over, smiling wide, a gorgeous creature, tall and well-shaped, broad shoulders and hips, a strong core, thin neck and soft cheeks, long brown pony swinging playfully behind her like a mane. I eased back in my chair, stuffed my fingers in my pockets, and stretched a tight-lipped grin. ""What are you guys drinking?"" she asked. 
I glanced at Bart and his frumpish scowl, then down at the menus our waitress was placing before us. I cocked my head as a wily thought entered: beer. I nudged Bart and chinned toward the bar. ""What ARE we drinking?"" I asked. 
Bart's scowl lifted into an illuminated beam. ""Whoah..."" he eased out in a breath of unanticipated joy. ""They have great beers...""
Bird Song, Southern Tier, Natty Greene's, wine, liquor, more beer. The waitress saw us eyeing the bar and let out a little chortle. ""Do you guys want a beer list?"" she asked. ""We don't usually get many people ordering beer at 11am on a Wednesday."" 
We shrugged incredulously. That notion just seemed silly. 
We each opted for a Southern Tier IPA, and then our marvelously-built waitress left us to our perusing of the menu. As we were reading through the mind-blowing list of fried appetizers, decadent salads, opulent burgers, and mouth-wateringly descriptive signature sandwiches, I recognized the opening horns of Born to Run floating down from the overhead speakers. ""Springsteen,"" I acknowledged aloud, forefinger pointed to the sky. Bart nodded approvingly. 
""Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected, and steppin' out ov-er the liiine,"" I sang. ""HOoo-whoooahhh!"" I rapped my thumbs sideways across the slick wood finish of the table and stamped my heels into the flat of the cement floor. 
Our waitress returned with our beers, her own mood clearly lifted by the good time Bart and I were starting to have. She took our orders. I went with the number 4 - a chicken salad sandwich with lemon aioli, avocado, and pickled red onion strings. Bart ordered the Reuben, and we each chose the farmhouse style cottage cheese as our side. ""And another beer?"" she asked before leaving. We smiled and nodded. 
Springsteen ended and we both paused with bated breath for what might come next. The opening chords rang out and we both lit up - Alanis Morissette! But not You Oughta Know or Ironic or even All I Really Want... Nope, it was m-f'in Head Over Feet. I belted out, ""Are you kidding me right now?"" Bart nodded approvingly. 
""You've al-ready w'ON mee ooo-varr... in-spite uv meee,"" we sang in gorgeous, baritone harmony. ""So don't be al'ARMED if I faa-aall... hyead ov-ar feeet.""
Our food arrived with our second beers - beautifully stacked trays of tall sandwiches, mounded with meat and sauce, overflowing cups of seasoned and garnished cottage cheese, face-fuming aromas of spice and dough and dairy, like a farm, like a fable. We stuffed our mouths, silly and contented,  avocado glaze speckling my beard, napkins ruined, shirts spotted, beer spilled and lyrics slurred ignominiously to every tune soaring above us. 
We ordered another beer, had our leftovers boxed, and cleaned up our ridiculous Wednesday mess. When our trim waitress returned with the check, Bart fumbled around under his ass for a moment, face locked in embarrassment and concern. ""I don't have my wallet...""  
I laughed. ""Don't sweat it; this one's on me.""
Bart finished the rest of his day in a fantastic mood.",2013-02-15 15:18:51

Our orders were taken without much ado,since no one wanted drinks,but the appetisers were a bit slow coming;since so many include pork, which I don't eat,I passed,but my companions seemed to enjoy theirs. Next we each ordered their famous pizzas: I ordered the Siciliana,which is your basic tomato and cheese with eggplant. There certainly were the two aforementioned ingredients,but not much in the way of eggplant,just a few chunks,and the crust was a teeny bit under cooked. My companions had the Margaritha,essentially the same thing,without the eggplant,they really enjoyed theirs, one ordered with extra cheese,another with extra oil and garlic...extra charge too. For desserts,you get a choice of gelato,biscotti,or tiramisu,I just opted for cappuccino,but four of my companions ordered;one mistook the choice of biscotti as one choice,but was very surprised when he got a platter of biscotti,all different choices. The two who ordered the tiramisu,were also surprised when theirs came on a platter with not one but THREE cakes! The gelato guy was probably the only one who got shortchanged here as his serving,although generous,was not enough for three people.

We cruised over on a sunny Sunday for happy hour. My party of 3 was famished so we went to town on the happy hour menu; available everyday 3pm-6pm and again at 10pm-12:45am) - the HH menu isn't huge, but it had a good variety so we stuck to it. 

They only offer complimentary side dishes (banchan) with a minimum of 2 BBQ dishes per person, but we had no problem meeting that quota. All of the sides offered were fresh and flavorful - we also enjoyed extra rounds. Also, they offered 3 dipping sauces light, medium, and a dark one. They were all tasty but my favorite was definitely the darkest one - it was salty, sweet and a bit spicy. 

HH items we tried:
Cream cheese wontons - 4/5
Sweet corn - 5/5 (very sweet and buttery but tiny)
Mushroom medley with butter - 4/5
Garlic in butter - 5/5
Jalapeno poppers - 5/5 (delicious)
Korean chicken cheese fondue - 3/5
Spicy pork - 4/5
Pork belly - 5/5 (we loved this the most!)
Bulgogi - 3/5

When dining outside of happy hour, the regular menu is massive so I'm sure you will be able to find something, even for the the pickiest of eaters. Also, pricing seemed fairly competitive with Gyu-Kaku (their direct competitor.) The grill tops and ventilation setup at each table worked very well; they conveniently changed out our charred grill per our request and the restaurant wasn't smokey or smelly.

The atmosphere is very cute and adorable with a bright-lit room and well-placed decoration around the room.  There are about 5 small round tables that can seat between 2-4 people while a large tall wooden bench table can seat about another 12-14.

it's not uncommon to practice patience when coming here for there souffle and baked Alaska desserts but on this night, they were backed up with souffle orders and were informed we would have to wait about 1 hour.  You have to make souffles to order but to ask customers to wait an 1 hour is unappealing.  I wonder how often this happens as I think they are the only dessert place I have visited that offers souffles made-to-order.  

We decided that we couldn't wait that long so we just got a mix of lattes, sparking teas, and molten lava cakes.

The one niggle I had with my experience was that the baked Alaska we ordered came a full 20 minutes after the drinks and molten lava dessert was consumed.

One interesting tid-bit is that they have shades covering their kitchen area with a sign that says ""NO PHONE OR VIDEO RECORDING BEYOND THIS POINT"" which peaked my interest.  Maybe it is to keep the secret of how they make their unique milk desserts.

Buca was on my Restaurant Resolutions list (check my blog) and it was the last restaurant on the list. I was going to save it for my birthday but I'm glad I didn't because I'll probably come back here for my birthday. 

Down the secluded alley, you definitely feel like this place is a special one and it is. Once you get down the stairs, all you want to do is look up at the high ceilings and chandeliers. These guys take ""exposed brick"" to a whole other level. It's simple but it's gorgeous. 

Gents, if you're looking for a special place to propose, have an anniversary dinner or take her on the third date, this is the spot. 

The leather banquettes are super comfortable as well. They've recently expanded and I hear they're getting 2 more locations. I'm not sure how this will affect the quality and the service but the quality of the food was great.

Service: there's definitely some Italian waitstaff in the house (speaking of the waitstaff: holy eye-candy in the leather aprons). My friend actually didn't believe that our waiter was truly Italian! Maybe he was just a bit too strong on the accent. I don't know. He was a bit ""off."" I can't really explain it. It's not that he wasn't doing his job but there was something weird. Oh, and he didn't pair my wine with my dish very well at ALL. If I say I'm having ""X"" dishes, as a waiter in a high-end restaurant I expect that he would know which wine should go with which dish. Especially if a glass of wine is minimum $13. 

One thing I HATE: put your menu on your website! PLEASE. It's 2012. At least put the staple items you're not changing up there. 

WE ATE
There's so many options (as explained in other posts) but we decided to do a mix of traditional with adventurous. 

We started out with the Gnoccho  Frito, which is essentially house cured pork fat (or lardo di collonatta as they call it). It's served with "" fried dumplings"" which are hallowed pieces of dough, sprinkled with some sort of sugar because they were sweet. It sounds like the biggest rip off of life but it was so mo-fo delicious. The pork melts onto the dumpling and its the best taste bud tease. 

This was also where the waiter was off: he kept on insisting we get  the nodini (warm bread knots), two times after we asked him to explain what ""Italian dumplings"" were and that we wanted that dish. 

We moved onto the buratta, melon and prosciutto salad. This was great but it wasn't my favourite dish. Maybe it's because I shared it but I didn't feel like there was enough buratta. Yes, first world problems. I think Campagnolo's heated buratta with grapes is my all-time favourite buratta dish. The other paradox of this that I was practically licking the plate. It could have been because we waiting for the pasta. 

From there, we decided to split between the pastas. The Cavatelli Al Pomodoro is a safe choice; very traditional - ripe roma tomato finished with pecorino crotonese cheese. This is some of the freshest pasta and tomato sauce I have ever had. 
At $22, the quality is there. I just wish the portion was (but maybe this was because we were sharing). I swear they must have some secret Nonna mafia in the back hand-rolling pasta. It's that good. 

We also got the Gnocchi Alla Crema Di Zuca. These hand rolled ricotta dumplings with pumpkin cream, parmigiano, and pecornio cheese are topped with crisp, maple glazed prosciutto. The presentation of this dish was immaculate. And the taste was incredible. It's one of those Rachel Ray ""MMMM"" moments. I also like the seasonality of this dish. Bravo. 

From there, we moved on to dessert. Dining Companion had the gelato. She seemed quite satisfied with it. I had the Tiramasu. It was a good portion and all components just worked together. There really are no words for this dish. It's that good. Don't share. You'll want it all to yourself! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Overall, yes, it's expensive, especially for the portion sizes. I was satisfied but I wasn't full. The waiters need to know which wine to pair with particular dishes and not be ""off"" or push certain dishes for whatever reason. 

The pasta is some of the best I've ever had. 

Buca reservation (see that?). This one isn't really for a casual walk in (but super score if you do). Can be slightly intimidating but the food here is worth it. Now I know what people meant when they say that this is one of best Italian restaurants in the city. I'm curious as to how the other outlets do. That said, I really like the original decor in here. It's perfect for a photo shoot and it's worth coming back here for a special occasion.",2012-10-22 07:16:56

It had dulled to the point where it couldnt cut flank steak to prepare Beef Stroganoff, yet she couldnt bear to replace it.  It reminded her of him. 

So, my 78 yr old mom asked me to see if I could get it sharpened somewhere. You'd laugh if you saw the knife. It isnt high end and the handle is worn and gray, like cracked driftwood.  Yelpers liked PKH service, so off I went with Dad's knife and one El Cheapo of my own.  Honestly, I was hesitant approaching the door. This place is run by a chef, and the website drips with Japanese specialty knives costing hundreds of dollars. I took a breath, ""steeled"" myself, unsure what to expect. 

Well, this guy, Eytan I guess, couldnt have been nicer.  Nice isnt even the word.  He examined my crummy knives intently, handled them like they were Faberge eggs, kindly educated me on the makers and explained in detail what he could and couldnt do to hone these particular blades. Turns out, the Italian maker of Dad's knife was pretty good. ""These always come back"", Eytan said, and he was right. 

For less than ten dollars, this bona fide expert took what could've been a mundane, or  preoccupied or even sneering transaction and instead made me feel like Chris Bianco or someone, and more importantly, made an old lady very happy.

Food:
I had the pork broth with pork belly. The broth was insanely unflavorful, and the housemade sriracha did not help ( i honestly would have preferred green lid sriracha. Just because it's house made does not mean that it's good.) The noodles were decent, but without a good broth, it had me reminiscing about the days I liked to eat spaghetti with just butter and salt--- and a little bit of nostalgia is not always a good thing. The pork belly was fried which was unusual to me, and they over cooked it so much it was embarrassing for me to eat (I gnawed on it when i took the first bite because I didn't realize how chewy it would be). Not even my fork and knife could salvage it.

Service:
The service was average. The servers were apathetic and we had 3 or 4 waiters that all seemed lost and confused.

Plenty of options for whatever or however you are craving your chicken.

We had the blazing fire chicken with cheese, original fried chicken and boneless chicken with green onion. My personal favorite was the boneless chicken with green onion. The chicken served piping hot with a dry crispy batter on the outside (not greasy) and moist tender chicken inside. The generous heap of green onions on top provided a fresh counterbalance, and the side of pickled radish is a great palette reset button. The blazing fire chicken with cheese came was also good.

The crowd here is 40+ and people come in groups. We only observed from afar, as we were considering joining them, but felt intimidated a little even though we are dancers! I guess because the dance floor was so small, and tables with seated folks all around, it just didn't have the vibe we were hoping for. 

I think this would the perfect place to come with a bunch of friends that like to dance, have dinner and dance the night away. The crowd wouldn't matter at that point. As stragglers who don't really fit in with crowd (and it started raining) we turned away.

Cocktails. Pricey but exceptionally well made. We enjoyed both the 1806 Old Fashioned and the Knob Creek Manhattan. Both changed my life, meaning I replicate their formula on a regular basis at home. A life-changing change.

Apps enjoyed included deviled eggs, mixed greens salad and the tomato salad. These, plus the exceptional bread and butter were a good start to an already good evening.

Entrees enjoyed included the swordfish, steak frites, gnocchi, and poulet (chicken). Each was seemingly simple but prepared in exceptional manner and presented accordingly. No complaints... and all dishes were wiped clean with a second round of bread. Rather impolite of us, but why not... we recommend enjoying every bite offered.

I know most people would love it but that's my preference. The main reason for a not perfect rating was because they did not offer nachos for kids and we had to order an appetizer with the beans on the side (my daughter won't eat it).

The reason these waffles are so good isn't the fact that you can put pretty much anything under the sun on your waffle, it's the actual waffle itself. It's thick and soft but crunchy (? I don't know if that's the right word) on the outside.... and it is more like a cake than a waffle.

Particularly from a not-so-great recent experience at Famous Dave's, the latest round goes to Smokey Bones.

I started with the Brunswick Stew, which I do not recommend.  It was watery and light on the meat.  It had a some spice to it but more resembled chili than actual brunswick stew.  On the other hand, the Baby Back Ribs were pretty good and were better than the tough and not-so-meaty ribs I had the last time I was at Famous Dave's.  The ribs have decent flavoring on their own without additional barbecue sauce.  When I did add sauce, I preferred the KC BBQ sauce which was pretty decent.  The cole slaw and broccoli sides were pretty standard.  Ended the meal with a Bag of Donuts, which are really good, if only because they are brought out incredibly hot.  I'm surprised the waiters don't have blisters from handling those bags.  Served with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces, they are like a poor man's version of the Fresh-N-Hot Doughnut Holes at Red Steakhouse.  (Probably a stretch, but the comparison isn't totally off base.)

So how do you choose between Smokey Bones and Famous Dave's?  If you're in a really carnivorous mood, go to Famous Dave's--the ribs may not be quite as good, but they offer a better variety meats (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, sausage, and wings) than Smokey Bones with the additional flexibility to build a combo of those choices to your liking.

It wasn't too busy when we came in but after we were seated, more people started to come in. We settled in a booth, super clean, comfy seats and a nice view of the lake. 

I ordered the beef teriyaki bento box and my friend ordered the chicken bento box. Aside from the protein, the box came with 5 pieces of different tempura. 2 shrimps and other veggies. There was edamame, a bowl of rice, three pieces of yam maki sushi, a fried eggplant in one corner and the teriyaki. On the side with the bento box, there was a small noodle soup, traditional garden salad and the miso soup. All for 12.00! 

I love this place and the food, you can really tell that everything was made fresh and that the tempura was made to order and haven't been sitting around in oil or on the side. The beef teriyaki was so delicious, next time I will get the salmon. I wasn't able to finish the bento box, there was just way too much food and I was pretty stuffed eating half of it.

District one is the old Cravin Cajun.  They fixed up the restaurant really nice.  Plenty of room if you have a big party.  Ono (delicious) to the grinds.

We had oysters, squid, chicken wings, papaya salad, quail...and that is just to name a few.  Of course, I still managed to get Oxtail Pho.  I still like another Pho place because their Pho broth is bomb, but the price they charge here would actually bring me back because of that.  It wasn't bad pho broth.  They actually gave HUGE oxtails.  By the way, if you still want your crawfish/crab/shrimp boil fix, you can still get it from District One.  Think I will have to try that they next time.   And the pork belly seems to be a hit so I better try that too.  

My hubs liked it because they had a lot of his favorite Asian Whiskeys.  See Jesse N :)

We were seated right away up a small flight of stairs near the back. The lighting and ambiance is dark with a beautiful mural painted wall close to where I was seated. My friends and I weren't too hungry (we'd had a full meal and lots of beer at the Trinity Brewery a few hours earlier) so we opted for one tapas and the seafood paella to share among the 3 of us at the horror of the server - he suggested that the paella and 2 tapas each would have been better for 3 (hungry) people. The paella would also take 45 mins to come according to our server - which we were okay with. I'm glad he warned us ahead of time! We also ordered a bottle of Cava to keep us satiated while we waited for the main course. 

For the tapas, we got the octopus marinated in sherry vinegar. It was delicious, although a tad too sour as the vinegar overpowered the taste of the octopus. The octopus itself, however, was very tender. The paella was absolutely wonderful. You can really tell it was made fresh and that the basil leaves were just tossed on and it wasn't sitting around. I'm not Spanish nor do I eat much Spanish food so I can't say if it was authentic or not but it sure tasted scrumptious to me!! The flavours melded together nicely from the seafood to the rice and that last crunch and burst of flavor from the fresh Italian basil leaves. It was an entrée to really savour. 

When we left, I noticed nearly every table had some sort of paella ordered so I could tell it's definitely a winner. I will be back to get more of the menu!!

In the evening in order to get to the elevators you had to show your room key to a security officer to pass.  The breakfast buffet was as expected, and I liked that I could see a kitchen manager going through checking & recording temperatures of food that had been sitting out.  

Our room was non-smoking & had 2 queen beds, the sink was separate from the shower & toilet, and the room was comfortable.  For the price we really couldn't complain!  There is enough going on here that you don't ever have to leave the hotel for the strip :)",2014-06-20 13:36:23

The interior is beautifully done with an awesome open space where you really have that sense of free mobility.

I enjoy their incorporation of air plants and trees that make it feel like you're walking right into a giant green house. Lighting inside is nice and bright and doesn't rob you of feeling any sort of overheating since they keep it pleasantly cool and comfortably air conditioned.

Each seating spot has its own personality as well where you can choose either a more intimate table, lazy couch spot, long wooden table, or the cool book shelf looking stair case thing in the rear of the place.

The desserts and drinks are where the place falls short for me though, I tried the ginger and lychee tea, tiramisu, green tea red bean cake, matcha latte, rainbow cake, charcoal bun, and tofu cheese cake. In all honesty I didn't like any of it.

Both the ginger tea and lychee tea had a very artificial sweetened flavor that I just didn't enjoy at all, the charcoal bun was very plain, the matcha red bean cake was dry and a little lacking to me, the rainbow cake was very dry and plain, and the tofu cheese cake was interesting but a little more funk or cheesy tasting imo. 

The tofu cake was the most interesting of the bunch since the tofu added a bit more of this enjoyable creamy/silk texture but I didn't really like the stronger taste it seemed to have. The matcha latte was not really to my preference since it's more of a bitter or stronger matcha taste, but I'm sure hardcore matcha lovers might appreciate it more than me.

The tiramisu was well, tiramisu; I didn't see anything negative nor special about this one. You can't really mess up tiramisu, or at least I don't think you can?

I think over all between the desserts seeming a bit plain and dry to me and most of the teas having this strange sweetened taste I didn't really enjoy the food and drinks as much as I enjoyed snapping the inside of gabi and waiting for friends to ask me where this place was.

I guess it felt more like a tinder date to me: everything looked good, but was lacking everywhere else where it mattered.",2018-04-23 05:55:23

Having been fortunate enough to travel far and wide to sample some of the best dining our country has to offer it was after great deliberation that I decided to schedule a joint birthday celebration for my mother and aunt at Michael Mina's STRIPSTEAK; a friendly relationship with one of the restaurateur's managers allowing me to arrange a special five course tasting menu nearly a week in advance that should have been perfect but in execution was anything but.  Surely one of the more trendy Mina properties, lodged in Mandalay Bay with high ceilings, slick design, and plenty of polish to compliment the thumping music it was just moments before our 7:00pm reservation that we presented to the hostess stand and quickly whisked to a table along the back wall it was with ample pleasantries that we were greeted, a trio of $15 cocktails to compliment the duck fat fries soon in hand but something immediately awry as the area's temperature trumped eighty degrees - a trend to continue for the next two hours despite repeated complaints and the apparent efforts of restaurant manager Ashley to contact maintenance as beads of sweat rolled down our brows.  Suffering largely in silence so as not to disrupt the celebration but clearly uncomfortable it would not be long after seating that our five-course menu would commence and wanting for a truly grand experience each round of food arrived as a trio, items including the ""Instant Bacon,"" Bone Marrow, Spinach Souffle, and Wagyu vs. Wagyu truly exemplary while the foie gras, chicken, and halibut were inexplicably overcooked to the point where the first two were nearly inedible while the later - a gift from the kitchen - was saved only by its aromatic sauce.  Eventually moved to a table in the front dining room for a breath of fresh air mid-way into a main course where veal was presented instead of the pork that I'd ordered it was at last in the finale that STRIPSTEAK would prove most impressive with a trio of world class desserts followed by the restaurant's signature beignets but with both managers avoiding our table as the $500 tab for Chef Gerald Chin's uneven cooking arrived I could only shake my head wondering when Chef Mina last stopped by Mandalay Bay, a stunning departure from memorable experiences at Bourbon Steak, Wit and Wisdom, American Fish, or Arcadia.",2014-04-30 01:01:35
tbH1lXexIVsQb3xe8ItN0w,mYPrgw_nm_HpMi9LcPYg6Q,8nP8ghEpT6WFcM6tfqAaGA,2,0,0,0,"This is an ice cream parlor that's been in this location for almost 60 years now.  The ice cream is good, and the interior has a nostalgic feel.  It's not a very expensive place, nor is the food remarkable or a good value.

We've eaten here for over 20 years, but seldom.  The food used to be pretty good, now it's just decent.

My wife and I had the Reuben.  I love Reubens and so does she.  Commendably they ask if you want mustard (yellow) or thousand island (an abomination).  I make a very good authentic one myself.  The one I was served today had four thin slices of nearly tasteless corned beef, topped with some cole-slaw (why???) a bit of sauerkraut and a little bit of relatively bland white cheese (a Reuben is supposed to have Swiss cheese).  It was made with a bland rye bread with oatmeal crust.  My first bite was gristle such that the first half of my sandwich fell apart and the ingredients fell out (except for the cheese).  My second bite was similar and so was the third, I had managed to chew and swallow about half the first sandwich half, a quarter of it (no easy feat) before I got to a decent bite, and thankfully I managed to easily masticate the rest of my sandwich.

My wife's sandwich wasn't tough at all, but she was similarly unimpressed.  The chips were fine though mine were made soggy by falling slaw and kraut.  The dill pickles were nearly inedible- they were tough, though they did taste like dill.  Lest you think that we should be gumming our food at some cafeteria for retirees who never had a dental plan- we aren't retired, and we have good dental insurance coverage.

I will say- they have painted the place since we were last there.  It's due for a good upholstery cleaning though.  The men's and women's rooms are on opposite ends of the dining area.  I can only comment on the men's room: It was clean but they have a narrow door about three feet from a second one.  They open inward so you will have to grab at least one handle after you wash your hands and discard the automatically dispensed paper towel.

I think we've had enough of the food.  But if we ever need a malt, we'll be back.",2017-06-02 08:13:04

But it turns out somewhat like a fast food restaurant but not quite really a fast food restaurant. Its basically a café with other options that are not café style food. So not just burger and sandwiches here. They do have some interesting things like the sushi burger made out of sushi (only issue is the salmon is not raw).

I got their bento box with the miso katsu. The katsu (fried pork) was not bad. I liked it. The portion was very big for $10.99. Box itself looks small but don't be food. I was really full from eating here. On top of it, I got a Japa Doughnut (matcha flavor). I liked it. it was freshly made (I can tell). Limited supplies on those doughnuts. The doughnuts are $1. 

Décor of this place is kind of dark. Not romantic seating though. So you walk in and you order right away. Its pretty much self serve here. You get your own food and seat yourself.

We decided to meet friends here while waiting for a table across the street at Bitter and Twisted. It would be an hour wait they said to get a table at Bitter and Twisted so I thought that should be more than enough time to pre-drink at Blue Hound. 
45 minutes after waiting, someone finally takes our drink order. Then, about 20 minutes later we get our drinks just in time for our table to be ready across the street. So, our group of 5 had to chug our cocktails, which were mostly beers and a whiskey diet for me and a vodka tonic for a friend (so easy cocktails), and pay right away to make it in time. 

My 2nd time there was before a concert. My hubs and I decided to get dinner with drinks beforehand. Food was delicious. We really enjoyed the pork belly. Deviled eggs also a treat. BUT... After ordering my first drink, I asked if I could keep the cocktail menu a bit longer. The waiter looked stressed and said, ""We only have a few of these cocktail menus"" wanting to take it from me. I didn't know how to respond. I just looked at him. He then left the menu with me anyway, and when he came back, I gave the menu back to him and said that I had taken pics of the drink menu so he could have the menu back. 
Awkward, right? Perhaps I was out of line just to keep the drink menu longer but I was excited to see what to order next since the cocktails are good here. 

That first time here? Oh, we didn't have reservations so we didn't get a table. Understandable on a Sunday night.. We ended up seating at a table thinking that it was part of the bar area and not the restaurant. It looks like a family size round table but ""outside"" of the regular restaurant side.

I had such a disappointing time tonight at Adega, I was actually disgusted by how poorly my party was treated. First, to be fair, our party of 3 arrived at 7pm, 1hr before Game 7 of the NBA Finals. We thought we would grab a drink and a bite to eat at a place we had been before and liked, and soak up some of the atmosphere on E.9th street. We should have know that nothing was going to go right, when we were told that we were the last people being allowed in to the near empty restaurant. Besides maybe a dozen or so people at the bar, there were only 2 tables of people seated inside, so there wasn't exactly a crowd. We were warned that it would take 15 minutes to get a drink, but it ended up being over 45. So fine, we were told we could only order beer or wine as the bar was overwhelmed, but after asking for 3 Angry Orchard ciders, the server's response was to mock our drink choice. We should have just left then, but instead this was the beginning of the truly deplorable service we were subjected to. I've never had to sit there and be belittled by an ""overwhelmed"" waiter. To be told that the restaurant was being closed so ""outsiders"" wouldn't come in and that they didn't want the undesirable crowd of ""people from the street"". Excuse me? We had come in after walking down the street from another bar. What exactly is the wait staff trying to say? And then to openly mock my sister for asking for her salad to come without tomatoes. And to be told that Adega is a ""Mediterranean restaurant and if you don't like these ingredients you shouldn't eat here."" Not to mention the fact that when I mentioned that I have Celiac's, the waiter asked me ""do you really have a gluten allergy?"" Yes, really, but thank you for implying that I'm a liar. To add insult to injury to be told that people with a gluten allergy are a pain in the ass to deal with. Wow. Thank you for making us feel welcome. For a waiter to tell me point blank that ""I better not see a poor review on Yelp tonight"" amongst other comments was extremely unprofessional. But the straw that broke the camels back was when we were told that they would rather we didn't watch the game, which they had on the Tv in the bar area. Adega came very close to ruining what was going to be a memorable night. So after tracking down a manager, we cancelled our food and paid in cash for our 3 ciders. Good riddance.

My company was hosting its annual holiday Vegas vacation, so I knew I wanted to dine somewhere nice as I rarely ever get the chance to when in Sin City with friends (typical meals include McDonald's, Earl's, and a buffet). I made reservations easily on the phone a month in advance and inquired about the complimentary limo service. I was told to call back 7-days before my dinner reservation to reserve. I called back 6-days before and was told there was no availability and was put on a waiting list. So when they say to call a week in advance, you better call a week in advance.

Our party of four didn't end up getting limo service or The Mansion tour, but Joël Robuchon is truly a beautiful restaurant and amazing enough on its own. Our jaws dropped in awe from the opulent décor, grandiose chandelier, and elegant royal purple theme. The ambiance is lovely, romantic, and simply stunning.

Mignardises
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#BtWcKw5jrQKx8nNcMLUfjA
The mignardises cart was equally as impressive and stunning as the bread cart. There were over 20 selections of different sweet treats to choose from; it was pretty overwhelming. I wish I could've tried everything but I really didn't want to look like a fatty. My favorites from the cart were the canelés and macarons.

Everything was delicious. The appetizers, the mains, the desserts, everything. I've been to 1- and 2-Michelin-star restaurants before, and now I finally know that that one extra star truly does make a difference. Le Homard (spiced lobster) was my favorite appetizer, followed by Le Navet Rouge (scallops). For my main, I ordered Le Bar (grilled sea bass), which was good but lost the round to La Langouste (spiny lobster) and Le Bœuf (braised beef cheeks). If I were to go back again, I'd definitely get the the beef cheeks; they were so tender and flavorful. Dessert was amazing -- if you're ordering any, you must get La Sphère, a bubble sugar sphere filled with blueberries, yogurt sorbet, candied lemon, and violet cream. It was so pretty and made my sweet tooth very happy. Le Soufflé is also a must! Not too sweet, not too bitter, it went terrifically well with the vanilla ice cream it was served with. Perfect ending to a fantastic dinner. I would have to say however, both the amuse-bouche and mignardises were fairly mediocre when compared to the rest.

Service was good. Our water glasses were constantly refilled (explains how we ended up with a $40 tab on water alone), timing between courses was perfect (though there was a little hiccup between our last dessert course and mignardises), and while the staff was supremely attentive, they were also generally unobtrusive.

After our meal ended, the ladies in our group were each presented with a giant loaf of bread in a purple gift bag. If your meal doesn't fill you up, this bread definitely will.

I've been frequenting this bar off and on for over ten years, and I love going each time.  It has changed ownership several times, but the place has soul baked right into the walls.  

Good service?  Who cares.  You may be lucky to get a beer when it is packed if you don't know what you're doing, but that is your problem.

There is one pool table, and you have to win to keep the table, so if you like competitive pool, this may be the place for you.

I dig the young blue collar vibe the place can have at times.  In the early afternoon, sitting around with young tattooed motorcycle mechanics with their pin up bettys just makes me happy to be American.

Drinks are stiff, and there is an excellent selection of beers on tap and otherwise.  If you like Pilsner Urquell, I believe they still have it on tap (one of the few places in town).

I used to go on motorcycle rallies out of this bar in the late 1990s or early 2000s, a great bunch of guys with all kinds of motorcycles, especially Triumphs, BMWs, BSAs, MotoGuzzis, Nortons, and a bunch of other classics.

loved the hangar beef sliders! delicious blend of flavors that harmoniously melt in your mouth! smoked gouda cheese with a sweet and smokey onion marmalade, tomatoes, and garnish greens! comes in 3 so it is easily shareable. 

we also tried the spanish ham dish with an interesting story. can't say it was amazing, but for the high price point, it was interesting to say the least. texture was similar to a ham jerky, but with a little gamey edge.. 

braised chicken & mash were great. texture of mash was smooth and you can definitely tell it was butter blended. complimented the chicken quite well! 

not a huge fan of the braised beef & rice because it was super salty. neither of us could take more than a single bite because the flavor was not that great overall and the beef was dry. 

selection of drinks were great since it is a cute wine bar restaurant. tried the hennessy mojito which was good. not too sweet and had a nice blend of ginger and mint. we tried the salmon cream cheese dip and the shrimp ceviche with a small bread basket as well! both were good & the bread was all fresh baked from a local vendor bakery!

The cake and whipped topping is light while the mango is perfectly sweet, however all the other products I think are inferior to Goldilocks. In addition, the portion sizes here are more for like a family of 4 rather than Goldilocks which has bigger options. The bigger options are more ideal since these cakes and rolls are usually brought to Filipino parties. IMO even the ensaymada at Golidlocks is better because I prefer the texture of the pastry itself. Lastly Goldilocks puts together amazing children's cakes, I'm not to sure if Red Ribbon can compete with them there since they have significantly less displays.

I enjoy coming here during the Summer months and can usually get on the course easily mid-week.  On the weekends it tends to get crowded because their green fees are lower than most courses in town.  Here's my breakdown of the course:

PROS
- Nice practice facility.  Mats & Grass options, which are nice.

- It's a nice course for a mid to high level handicap player (15+)....because it's a short course (see CONS).

- There are a few challenging holes, (#14, 292 yds, par 4) has water on the right side of the fairway and is a slight dogleg right....if you hit the ball long enough, you could cut the water and come close to driving the hole.

CONS
- Short course.  6,781 yds from the tips, 6,269 from the black tees, ladies tees are at 5,647.

- No lights on the practice facility and the range is pretty small.....can get crowded when it's busy.

- The greens are slow.  They're not too challenging.

I've been coming to this golf course for over 17 yrs, since I moved here in '93.....it's like an old friend.  It's a great course to sharpen up your wedge play and 3 wood (off the tee instead of driver).  Or if you're a beginner, it's pretty forgiving.

Fajitas for 2 is the usual order. The steak was tender and flavorful. The chicken can be a bit dry. I like the bbq shrimp minus the bbq sauce as I think it has an off taste. 

It was a great decision to bring back endless guac refills for the fajitas.  But, don't be a jerk and abuse that offer!

For me. The fajitas are the best. I'm not all that into Tex Mex otherwise. And, make no mistake, Abuelo's is straight up Tex Mex. Don't come here if you are expecting a different style cuisine like Sonoran or Baja California or Oaxaca.

A co-worker and I decided that today (every Tuesday is $1 hot dog day) is the day we would go. Unfortunately, the Veggie Hot Dog is not a part of the $1/dog promo, but I thought it was still worth it. For a Veggie HDOS, plus large lemonade and fries, it was about $9. I thought this was a bit pricey, but being it was my first time, I was okay with paying it. The veggie dog was good. First veggie dog I've ever eaten. The flavor was similar to a regular hot dog, and the texture was actually pretty firm. The lemonade was freaking amazing, maybe the best I've had that I didn't make myself, and the fries were pretty decent. My co-worker had 3 regular HDOS. He said they were very good, though his stomach hurt a bit after devouring them. 
The batter is not corn dog batter, so don't just expect a regular corndog. The batter has a different flavor, and is pretty decent.

It was about 6pm and the place was pretty empty.  We grabbed a table and were greeted by a friendly bartender who brought menu's & glasses of water without even asking (Nice touch- too many places have moved away from this practice).  We checked out the menu and I spied the Spinach Artichoke Dip with warm Pita's.  I ordered that right away.  Then we decided on entrees.  I ordered the 'I Don't Care Whatever' burger and a basket of Cajun Fries and my wife ordered the Basic/Plain pizza with pepperoni.  

The Spinach Artichoke dip came out first (Like it's supposed to- some restaurants just want to load your table with food all at once).  THIS WAS DELICIOUS!  The warm pita's were the perfect vessel to swipe up the bright green dip.  I don't know what they add to the spinach & artichokes to make it a bright green but the blended flavors were delicious.  This isn't the spinach artichoke dip that has cheese in it- this had cream cheese and maybe some sour cream.  I would rate this right up there with some of the best Spin/Art dips I've had with Smokin Joe's being our favorite.  

After finishing every drop of dip, I was MORE than ready for a good burger.  Here's when the meal went down hill.  If you check my pics- my burger just didn't have the WOW factor that a $12.50 burger should.  If you've ever been to Fat Heads, you know what I mean.  This burger looked good but it was small, with no garnish or anything else on the plate.  I mean- if that's all that's going to go on the plate- at least leave the burger 'open' with the top bun next to it so it takes up a little real estate.  Something like a piece of lettuce & a slice of tomato would have gone a long way (since we taste with our eyes first).  The flavor of the burger was good for it's 'smallish' size, def not worth $12.50 though.  The basket of 'Fresh cut' fries were really greasy.  This was due to one of 2 things- either they were 'fresh cut' that afternoon & pre-fried OR because they weren't that busy- they were cooked in oil that wasn't hot enough.  Either way- they absorbed WAY TOO MUCH grease.  The pizza came out flat & greasy as well (see picture).  I was also confused as it looked like it had cheddar cheese on it (it was yellow!).  The bartender came over to check on us & he could see that my wife wasn't happy so he took the pizza away & said he'd take it off the bill.  He offered to make something else but she wasn't having it as it probably would have taken another 20 minutes and my burger would have been either gone or cold by then.  

Overall- we left disappointed...",2016-01-11 14:48:48

I was able to make and order our pizza via the Yelp app, which was very convenient except for the warning I received that the restaurant was busy and may take longer on our meal. Since we were already really close, we decided to kill time while waiting for the order to be finished and came in about ten minutes before it should be up.

When we came inside, the place was empty except for one table. The restaurant smelled wonderful, you could actually smell the wood burning which was a lovely addition to the smell of cooking pizza. Our order was already finished and it was obvious that it had been finished for at least a few minutes, which was a bit of a let down since we still had a long drive ahead of us before we got home. 

And I was surprised at just how small their large pizza is. We ordered a four topping 14 inch pizza for 22 dollars. At least I can say that their ingredients are good, if the Boar's Head sticker on the door meant anything. The restaurant itself was modeled after a street bistro setting with fake frescos on the walls and only a tiny window of a counter for service. 

They cut the pizza into 10 small slices but at least don't scimp on the toppings, they werent anything special but it was tasty and simple. Their sauce is very light and not too sweet which is really enjoyed. 

I would definitely suggest this place to couples looking for a wood fired pizza, or for groups if you're buying a few pies. Otherwise you'll go hungry but won't have any other regrets.",2018-05-23 01:48:33

Located in a busy strip I saw others going into the Salon and Yoga place this morning while looking for parking.  At peak morning times it can be a challenge to find a parking spot.  The inside is laid out well.  Light pastel colors on the walls with decor.  Bright colored plates on tables.  It's warm and welcoming.

This morning I ordered the Westgate skillet.  The description reads ""Spicy chorizo sausage, jalapenos, green chiles, onions, homemade salsa and a blend of Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses.""  Anything that has cheese in it here comes loaded with cheese.  I swear I ordered this once and it easily had a pound of cheese on it.  No joke.  So I ordered it with light cheese.  That was perfect.

The chorizo has the consistency of Taco Bell ground beef.  The jalapeño, green chiles and onions with salsa taste like it came out of a can.  I ordered 2 over medium eggs that come on top.  Underneath the chorizo mixture are home cooked potatoes.  Those taste like the frozen bag variety.  

Water and coffee are served in a pitcher and carafe.  Service is quick and friendly.  Everything arrived promptly and hot.  No issues there.

I was able to check in with no problem early in the afternoon and the ladies at the front desk were very pleasant. One thing I noticed was that the lobby was eerily quiet. Some nice ambient music wouldn't have hurt - it made it feel like I should be whispering. 

The room is your standard modern hotel, but I can tell they're making an effort to be a bit unique and funky. I like the big green painted mural and the random explanation of what a haiku is on the back of the room service menu. I'm also currently using their cool stereo alarm clock contraption, which easily hooks up to your iPod or iPhone. 

I did notice the furniture was a bit bumped and scratched. Nothing major, but not the most immaculate room I've ever come across. Luckily for me, this room's being paid for by my work so I can't speak to what a good value it is compared to the price, but looking at the other reviews it looks like they're pretty affordable. So I guess, then, it's ok that the shower tiles are not absolutely spotless. Especially since they have Aveda products in there!

The other thing is the free wifi - was very excited to see that it's free and unlimited. But after a couple of hours it didn't work anymore. I hope it's back up and running soon!

Well i was wrong they were pretty good cookies...(though i don't like to mention it too often). the coffee was great too. It helps when you have friendly fun baristas working. 

No snobs here. just people who love their jobs. (unless you are the jerk who comes i and tries to start something)",2012-11-02 01:08:22

I still shop at the supermarkets for household goods, junk food, and other staples.  Where Sunflower has me hooked is their bakery-bread in particular.  I love bread, but have never been a sandwich eater because I'm not a white, wheat, or rye fan.  Sunflower has a huge selection of unique breads (kalamata olive, rosemary and olive oil, asiago cheese, jalapeno & cheddar, my favorite cranberry & walnut, to name only a few!).  They'll even slice it for you if you ask.

They also have a great frozen fruit & veggie section with options not always available in your average supermarket (sweet potato fries, baby asparagus, and mango for example).  Their meat department is great, too, and soooo much cheaper than you pay at a supermarket.

The only complaint I have is that the produce is not always the best in my opinion.  On more than one occasion,  I had to stop at Fry's across the street because what I needed didn't look so good.  I also can't seem to get a decent lime-they're always dry.  Maybe it's just me??",2008-04-02 01:16:05

For something that markets itself as a premium dive bar the service is pretty spot on too. I am especially pleased with the music selection at Warehouse. But last night I had my first taste of true disappoint with the place.

So we ordered water and other non-alcoholic drinks. They took 15 mins to get to us. Then we ordered the food. That took over half an hour to get to us. Was not overly enthused about our service. 

We asked to pay and I realized I had been charged extra for getting onion rings as my side (never having ordered them before I did not realize they were a substitution) AND charged for the dipping sauce (and I was not made aware by the server that these items had additional costs)!! I was pretty ticked off, not that it was more expensive but that she made the assumption we all knew that certain things had additional costs to them. Then there was a mistake when they separated the bills and then some miscommunication occurred and THEN there was a preset tip of 19%?!!! What? I'm pretty generous with my tips, even if it's not deserving service but I was super bummed about the whole thing and then seeing a preset of 19% was just insane. Not sure if this is a new thing they've put in, or just at this location because I don't recall seeing this at the other location. Maybe it's a ploy to make money off the obnoxious drunks that visit this location (many ear splitting whistles last night) but that's just ridiculous.

And to top it off, we were sort of hinted at to leave when the server came back later and took our water glasses away. Despite there being no one waiting to be seated. I sure it was just a ridiculously off night in terms of service but I thought I would mention it... Just in case it wasn't.

Btw, I have decided that the Mac n Cheese is the thing NOT to order here. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger last night and it was good but not as excellent as the Pulled Chicken!",2015-04-07 17:22:18
RZk_XdjqQeRxItImUaz1RQ,dccateTjyakPfsWd5U0wsQ,Kr1ANk9o4NrLu87xoWB80A,3,2,0,0,"From the outside in the middle of a street of contrived food and chain businesses that blanket suburbia including Parma, stands a large windowed cabin with a patio out in front. On the outside, the PT (as my sisters calls it) looks a bit nicer than a typical Parma Bar. A smooth parking lot, newer paint, and some small, appropriately trimmed bushes surrounding the outdoor patio. 

The inside, which really matters, is a bit different. Cleveland sports and televisions memorabilia decorate the hunter green walls. 
For those wondering they also have 2-3 arcade games including Golden Tee. 

For those who have not experienced them, let's go down the checklist for a typical Parma Bar:

- Beer Selection limited to popular national brands with limited or no microbrews ? Nope.
PT's beer selection was a very pleasant surprise to me. About 5-6 Beers on tap, plus bottles. They even had Magic Hat (#9) on tap ! For a Parma Bar to have Magic Hat on tap ($4 for a pint) (And even multiple great Lakes bottles) means they have topped the (low) Parma standards. 

- Clientele of Parma people: white, working and middle class, 35-60, only collars on shirts are on the occasional polos ? Inconclusive. 
The crowd has bit younger (late 20s, 30s) some of the times that I've been there. 

- A menu consisting of fried food, wings, burgers. Vegetarian options limited to a couple house salads, some of the fried food, and a veggie burger. A 'Parma' Menu often has a slight Eastern European (I use 'Eastern' very broadly) influence including sauerkraut, sausage, kilbasa, gyros, etc ?  -Check- 

Although the PT's menu fits the Parma archetype, it is better than its counterparts and tastes homemade. The mashed potatoes contain potato peels and taste rich, but the richness that you had Grandma's house, not the richness of MSG. Their stuffed cabbage was not bad either (it's been a couple years since I last had it). 

The service was solid although the males' bathrooms had graffiti and although somewhat clean, had been through a lot of abuse. 

On a warm summer night, there's cornhole (free) out on the patio. 
The patio was nice (surprisingly, Broadview Rd. traffic was not too loud) although smokers were everywhere. 

All in all, its beer selection, food, and location (a short drive if you have people coming from Old Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights, Seven Hills, and Independence) is above the Parma average.
Parma Tavern would make my short (and so far, very short) Parma shortlist.",2009-09-09 18:33:19

We sold wristbands at the door for $25 and people could get unlimited draft beer, well drinks, house wine, and a selection of 3 appetizers for a 2 hour time period. We were able to keep half of the ticket price for our charity, and the staff were nice enough to also donate their tip to charity! Thank you!!!!

They had a good selection of draft beers, with rotating selections from different breweries. I was also surprised at how good their appetizers were. The pizza has a super crispy bottom of the crust, which I really enjoyed. Chicken tenders were also crispy and moist. Didn't really like the cheese pretzel balls, but that's how I expected all the food to be, so I was definitely pleasantly surprised!

Overall, barley house did a great job at handling our fundraiser. I would definitely recommend them for that! After the fundraiser was over, it did start to get super crowded, and turned into a bit of dancing (well, they had a DJ, but not many people were actually dancing), it was hard to get a drink since there were so many people.

We wanted some sushi :) Bonsai's interior design was actually very nice. It was very modern with pretty blue lighting by the bar. It was just very empty when we went. I think we were like the only table there that night. There were two tables when we got there but they had already left by the time we ordered. 

My boyfriend and I decided to share three rolls. We got their Alaskan roll, which was a salmon and avocado roll. Then we got two special rolls: the Sakura roll, which was spicy salmon crunch with shrimp avocado and tobiko on top and the Godzilla roll, which was spicy king crab topped with salmon, eel, avocado with tobiko. Two special rolls for $16.95! Really decent pricing. 

Bonsai puts a lot of effort in their plating. The special rolls were put on a nice plate and they even put a fake plant on the corner to make it extra special. 

As for the sushi, it was pretty decent. There is nothing to write home about and their rolls aren't out of the ordinary. They're pretty standard. I mean, for the price, it's good if you want some sushi and don't want to pay up the yin yang. And the rolls definitely fill you up. Plus, they have a really nice variety of rolls. 

The only problem that we had is that on their menu, they have a Rainbow roll and a S. Rainbow roll. My friend ordered a Rainbow roll but they gave her the S. Rainbow roll instead. Perhaps they should rename the S. Rainbow roll cause it was the chef that got confused on that. And you certainly don't want to confuse the chef. 

Overall, decent place. If you're in the area and you want some rolls, could definitely visit Bonsai. I personally prefer SoHo but I understand that SoHo doesn't have a lot of rolls for you to choose from.",2016-11-30 04:07:17

m3kVvbJc0droQmjrXYaD6Q,h4cduDwCH8K9LJrowoJraA,Mrqk1ydkvgKtlxrExCv6gQ,5,0,0,0,"I have been buying seafood at Diana's for years now, which is the best spot in Scarborough, by the way, and we finally decided to eat at the restaurant.

The décor is nice, modern, clean, comfortable, but not very high end. Still, it has some nice features such as clean bathrooms, music that is not too loud, and comfortable seating.

As is was our first visit we opted for the cold appetizer platter, the hot sampler, and a selection of fresh oysters. The cold platter came with some jumbo shrimp cocktail, a squid and octopus salad, smoked salmon, smoked trout, and tuna tartare. The hot sampler came with some grilled shrimp, grilled scallops, and a piece of grilled salmon atop a bed of mixed grains.

You know how you find that little place on the coast that serves up some perfect seafood  - fresh, perfectly cooked, and redolent of the locale? Well, Diana's is one of those places. The seafood was perfectly cooked, not just well done, but to the nanosecond of perfection.

The shrimp cocktail offered some truly large shrimp that were full of flavor, served with a cocktail sauce made with real horseradish. The tuna tartare was a revelation - high quality diced tuna, marinated in sesame oil and topped with a tomato and pepper garnish that served as an erstwhile ceviche, I wish I could have this every day. The squid and octopus salad was fantastic - served with seaweed and high quality kalamata olives, the octopus and squid were as tender and flavourful as I have ever had. The smoked salmon and smoked trout were wonderful, with the capers, red onion and sour cream they were perfect on the fresh bread and mode a wonderful side by side comparison of fish and smoking techniques.

The large, fresh sea scallops were perfectly grilled to maximize the flavor yet retain the juiciness and soft texture scallop should have. Ditto for the grilled shrimp - simple, pure flavours enhanced by grilling without burning or drying them out. And the salmon fillet? After 15 years of living on the west coast and having salmon as a daily staple, I didn't expect to find perfectly cooked salmon in Toronto, but there it was.  As my wife said, it is hard to cook salmon that perfectly - it flaked apart, with perfect grill marks and no drying, burns or inconsistency - perfect.

The selection of oysters were top notch. My server provided a selection of East coast and West coast oysters for comparison and flavour journey. Regardless of which ones you personally prefer or dislike, they were all incredibly fresh and expertly shucked with almost no irritating shell fragments. Served on a bed of ice with the appropriate garnishes, they were the equal of that other great Toronto oyster bar, Starfish. 

My one pet peeve with Diana's would be the wine list - while well thought out and with very good value, it isn't very extensive, and there's only one bubbly.

I highly recommend that you make a reservation as the place fills up regularly - those in the know know that the food here is definitely worth the price.

We attended this location last night and it was the 2nd time in a row we walked up to the hostess stand and all hostesses had there backs toward us gossiping, my fiancé had to interrupt them to get there attention and seat us. 
The first thing a customer does is walk threw the doors and be greeted, and if that cant be done right the rest of the experience will be negative. 
So uncomfortable feeling like we were interrupting there chat session.
After we sat down and ordered we watched our onion rings, along with the tables behind us, and another short stack sit under the heat lamp for a honest 15 minutes.
After being under the heat lamp for so long there were finally brought to our tables. 
Cant speak for the table behind us but they received their appetizer 1 minute before there entrée. Which I would have complained on right then and there. Our appetizers were under the heat lamps for way too long for people not to recognize to run them to their tables so we could have enjoyed our apps in a timely manner.

I really don't appreciate you attacking me personally and using my name in your review! I am not a degenerate and I don't care for your roid rage comment. You see I recognize your picture and I realize that customers get jealous of the way I look and feel the need to knock me with their roid rage comments, but I understand. Maybe the next time we run into each other you can explain the roid rage and degenerate comment! Look forward to seeing you.

WOW talk about customer service at its finest! Now I definitely will not EVER return. And I will make sure I let all of my friends/yelp followers of this experience. 



PREVIOUS REVIEW:It literally pains me to give a 2 star review but our service the past 4ish times have been utterly unacceptable. We tend to stay clear from the bar because the bartender Rob is such a degenerate mess. He is constantly gambling, slamming the machines, and going on a full roid rage. He's even broken machines before by slamming his fists on them after losing. All while bartending mind you. 

So we choose to sit in the restaurant area. I'm not sure why the waitresses just can't get it together,  but waiting 20+ minutes for a side of BBQ sauce, then another 20+ minutes for our bill is rediculous. Don't even get me started on how long the drinks take.. tonight was an utter disaster. The ending was the cherry on top to a horrible experience  when the waitress disappeared with our credit card. When we couldn't find her I went to a tall blonde waitress and asked if she could possibly locate our credit card so we could leave. Before I even got the chance to finish my sentence she cut me off and said ""do you just want to talk to a manager?"" I said no, I just wanted to pay our bill. She stormed off and we never saw her again. Our waitress eventually came back but this turned into an almost 30 minute ordeal. 

Like I said it pains me to give such a bad review, the food is amazing (especially the fish n chips) and they have a great beer selection and we've been going to this bar for years.

At least that trailer looked professional - I'm not sure how Wok n Roll made it past inspection...that one was a roach coach. One truck in the corner was serving two items, another was only ice cream and a burger truck was also on hand and empty. Nobody cleans the tables, so when I sat down, I had to toss aside the disgusting table cloth littered with food particles and eat just on the table.

The baked Alaska is an ice cream cake, with browned meringue on the outside. Sweetnote has chosen to use a sesame ice cream witch gives in an asian touch. The dessert wasn't a large portion and was perfect for 1, or to share if you're getting 2+ desserts, which I do recommend doing.

We started with 2 martinis which were on special for $5. Mine was alright but hers was better. I forget the names of them, I think one was a Dragon_____? Not bad, but I probably would not want to pay full price for them.

We each had a sushi roll. I had the fusion and she had the torched salmon. I also ordered two pieces of the nigiri which were on special, one was a red tuna and the other a yellowtail. They were both good but the red was the  better of the two. Not bad for only $2 each, but they weren't the biggest pieces of nigiri I've had.

The fusion roll was delicious. It had a nice crispy potato crunch on the outside and it was well-rolled and I could taste most of the ingredients quite well. My date said she like the torched salmon. I was a little disappointed to see that Ko Fusion does not include pickled ginger with their sushi rolls like most other sushi places do.

I think our server's name was Sarah. She was nice and very helpful. Service was good!

My only gripe with Ko Fusion was the price. After tax and tip, our meal and discounted drinks were over $50. I know sushi is not usually a huge portion, but my roll was only 8 pieces or so, I definitely wasn't full after it. The quality of the food was good, but I just thought the portion size was especially small to spend $50 between two people.

Cloister is a local company that not only sells honey, but has a bee farm. If you are so inclined to start your own bee hive, you can purchase a starter kit from them. Yes, there was another recent article about the decline of honeybees and I was seriously considering getting some until I learned that I'd probably be stung...a lot.

All reading aside...their honey is delicious! They also give you tips on how to use honey besides on bread...it's so fantastic on popcorn!

It's located in an unglamorous, partially deserted stripmall (like most delicious LV restaurants).  And then you walk in....and...okay, not glamorous inside either.  Don't even go into the bathroom, trust me, you will be frightened.

But the food, the food.  I always order the vegetarian combo (some habits die hard) and at least one meat option.  The vegetarian combo has a great selection of dishes that includes cabbage, pureed vegetables, lentils and a salad.

My favorite meat dishes are the lamb tibs, gored gored,  and Kitfo. The lamb tibs and gored gored (cubed, cooked beef) are all marinated and served in delicious sauces. Do try the house Kitfo, the raw ground beef.  It may sound scary but it's really just ethiopian steak tartare (I told you i'm a really dirty carnivore now). 

Between two people, two entrees is wayyy more than enough to order.  All the entrees average from $8-$10 and everything is served on injera(the big, bread pancake).  Also, if you don't know, eat with your right hand and use the extra injera bread as your utensils.

Although the menu is fairly large with tacos, burritos, tostadas, etc., frybread is something we don't get a lot of where we're from and that was what we came for. We both enjoyed our meals but you have to make sure that the bread isn't hidden like how I ordered.

I had the open faced supreme with beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato with red sauce beef. The bread was fried perfectly with a crunchy but light exterior, yet more dense than a sopapilla. But there was an absurd amount of lettuce and cheese hiding the frybread. I think the way to go is a taco like my wife or maybe open faced with just beans and cheese. Or maybe just the plain frybread with honey, sugar, or cinnamon.

I also had a cup of the menudo. It's been a while since I've had it, but Angelina's is just as funky as I remember all menudos and tripe fans will be happy too as half of the cup was filled with the stomach tissue. I think I'll save having this soup for only when I'm hung over.

The location was quite small - much smaller than I envisioned. It was clean, bright, welcoming and there was a nice patio that I wouldn't mind trying out in the fall.

The waitress was at my table within a couple of minutes so +1 there.

The music was a little loud and people seemed to be striving to talk over it; the bartender (?) sang along with a song or two which made it even louder. At least she had a good voice. But for those of us who cherish a good book, it was not conducive to that type of relaxation.

I ordered the traditional (""Trad"") benedict. I asked for the eggs to be poached medium well; not a huge fan of the runny egg, but still a huge fan of the benedict. Over Easy nailed it on cooking the egg, so another +1.

There was a scant smattering of Hollandaise on the plate - barely enough to cover each benedict. Mind you, I don't like my bene's drowned in Hollandaise - I know what the stuff is made out of - but there was really not enough there to judge how good it was. As we all know - the sauce makes or breaks a benedict. Since there was so little there, it broke it - regardless of how well the egg was cooked to my specifications.

The hash browns were disappointing. Nothing inherently ""wrong"" with them, but nothing right either. They were barely browned and only my own addition of a touch of salt and a lot of pepper gave them any flavor. 

In and out of there in a great amount of time so you know they understand and appreciate the business luncher. Thanks OE for that.",2013-09-24 19:59:11

I was mistakenly given Mojgan's name.  If Mojgan ever reads this I profusely apologize!!  I've heard that Mojgan is nothing but sweet and helpful.  I don't know the name of the awful S.A. at this store but I know that she is tall with short dark hair and some kind of European accent who has a sour expression on her face.*

*Edit 2/28/12:
Veronica has moved and no longer works for the company :(  The other sales associate I like is Linda if she is still there.  Very nice woman and always encourages people to try on their shoes.

The people who work at this location (and most of the CL boutiques come to think about it) are not the friendliest yet there is one particular person who brings this store down to one star.  Her name is Mojgan (not sure if it's spelled correctly but she's the one with the accent), and she is one of the worst sales associates that I have ever encountered in my life and made my last trip to the store such a disappointment.  Even walking out empty-handed you should leave with that kid in a candy store feeling after being surrounded by all those beautiful shoes, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth instead.

Mojgan was not very helpful and seemed unwilling to answer questions and find availability of requested styles.  When she did answer a question, she was very short and often did not answer the question correctly, as if she were answering a totally different question than what was actually asked.  She came off as not very knowledgeable on product and product availability which is unacceptable when your customers are more informed and knowledgeable than the sales associates.  And I've heard that she's the manager of this store.  If so, unbelievable!  I asked for a particular shoe which she said they didn't have only to see minutes later someone trying them on in the store!  She could have at least told me that they had the shoe, just not in my size.  She made it seem like she did not care for my business or the other person I was with (who happens to own countless pairs of ""Loubs""), which is fine because I do not plan on ever giving them any of my business.  I'm turned off to the whole brand now, but it's okay because I have discovered other brands that are sexier, edgier, and less expensive than Louboutins.  Not to mention more comfortable!  

Never again, Las Vegas boutique!  However, if you are after some Loubs and must go to this location, go see the young, blonde sales associate who works there.  I believe her name is Veronica.  She is the most pleasant and helpful sales associate at the store.",2010-04-11 19:57:12

We got the Lemongrass Pork with Noodle soup, Baked Chicken On Rice with Tomato Sauce, Beef Brisket on Rice and Assorted Seafood and Mushroom Soup with Puff Pastry and Garlic Bread. 

Their items are quite pricey at $8.99 for Beef Brisket on Rice, and another $1.00 extra for a cold drink, but it comes with your choice of Cream Soup or Borscht. Both soups were okay, nothing special. 
The Baked Chicken on the Rice tasted funky and did not taste pleasant at all. The Lemongrass Pork was pretty good and flavourful. The HK Milk tea was pretty bland and had no significant tea flavour and was highly diluted by the large amount of ice they had put in it.

Everyone had gotten their dishes except for me, who ordered the Puff Pastry Soup. I know it requires time to make, and after 30 mins we asked the waitress about it. She said it takes time, and so we waited another 20 minutes, with everyone finishing up their meals and drinks, and still nothing. We inquired once more, and she went into the kitchen to check which took another 10 minutes and she came out saying the kitchen forgot our order. We decided to cancel it as we didn't want to wait any longer and everyone had finished their food.

Quality vs. Character? In the case of the Sugar Bowl Ice Cream Parlor, it's a little combo of both. This Old Town location is a a part of visiting Scottsdale and you have to stop by before you leave. It's been around forever. I remember going to the Sugar Bowl with my parents when I visited Phoenix as a child. Old Town, Scottsdale didn't have much else going on besides the Sugar Bowl and some western wear shops. From the ice cream bowls to the bar stools, it's straight out of a 1950's musical. 

Food: To be honest, this isn't the restaurant you visit for the best food in town and most people who visit know this...hence the title ""Ice Cream Parlor."" However, if you're looking for a quick sandwich, it's not bad. Think: a little better than the food you'd make in your own kitchen. 

Ice Cream: I'm an ice cream snob and love a good ice cream cone when visiting a new city or on a hot Phoenix day. Sugar Bowl ice cream hits the spot. It's exactly what you expect. Creamy, tasty and cools you down instantly. They have great combinations too; two pages full of them to be exact. I'm a chocoholic and the Buster Brownie is my go-to treat. From ice cream sodas, to specialty sundaes, to a scoop on a cone; you'll be able to find some frozen treat you like. 

Atmosphere: They have an arcade. Do I even need to say anything else? It's a great family-fun atmosphere for a special treat or a perfect dessert stop at the end of a date.

Anyway to cut the long story short. We did not have a very good dinner. The overall rating is low.

The good thing is that the place is clean, very nicely decorated. 

The menu is only in Chinese. There are two menu, one is a la carte, the other one is set menu. There was no clear indication that we cannot order two set per table but the waiter kept on saying we can only order one set.  We had total of 4 adults and 2 young kids, so we ordered a 4 people set plus one extra dish.  The set comes with sashimi, but it's 3 pieces per fish, what the hell, how are we going to divide them among 4 people?? 

Anyway. They brought the big lobster fresh to let us see before cooking. The menu says it's a 6lb, the one we got is slightly over so we're told that we will be charged a bit more due to the weight.

The food is just ok for the price.

Another thing I did not like is they only accept cash, interac, or unionpay. Come on, this is Canada!! I understand everyone wants to earn money from rich mainland Chinese people but how can a restaurant in Canada that has set menu priced at few hundred bucks not accepting credit card??

I came here with the International Supper Club, which meant that I was part of a giant party on an already busy night. I can't be sure that this didn't affect the quality of our food. The husband and I split the beef combo plate (salad, beef cabbage roll, and 6 potato and cheese pierogis) and an order of blueberry pierogis. We were so excited for the blueberry pierogis since we hadn't seen them since we were last in Poland.The salad was a bit odd, it tasted like pickles, but good in its oddness. The cabbage roll was totally delicious, full of flavor and served with the perfect tomato sauce. The part we didn't love? The pierogis! The pierogis were somewhat doughy and chewy.... like they had been sitting out or something. Maybe it's because we got them fried, but they just didn't have a great texture. The potato ones were somewhat gluey inside and the blueberry ones exploded when you cut into them, leaving almost no filling inside the pierogi. Additionally, the blueberry pierogis were nothing like they were in Poland, but that could be due to the type of blueberry used. Anyway, I'll have to come back with a smaller party to see if it gets better. 


PS the pricing structure was a bit odd, you could add 3 pierogis to our existing order for a small amount of money, but they couldn't be sweet pierogis because they had to cook them all together or something... this made no sense to me. Because of this, we had to order a separate plate for the blueberry pierogis which cost 11$.... not even close to worth it.

Our server offered us drinks and a bread course. The drinks were fine, and the bread was fine. Nothing extraordinary.  

We ordered the meatballs, muscles, and shrimp pasta (sorta tapas style). Salty. Everything was extremely salty. Not to the point of inedible, but salty nonetheless. 

I didn't complain (that's not my style) and I am certain the staff would have addressed any concerns the best they could (they were all very friendly). But every single dish was salty. Did I mention how much salt they used? 

After dinner, the desert menu indicated that we should inquire of our server about the chocolate cake, so we did. They didn't have any. Apparently there had been a wedding party there the night before so no cake. 

Lastly, the decor was... Well mauve and carpet. You be the judge.

It's a little off the beaten path which can be a breath of fresh air from the places to eat lunch or dinner down Tryon Street.  It looks to be built from one of the renovated homes there in the neighborhood with a 'dollhouse' style exterior in my opinion.  Cool character for a restaurant.

One thing to note is that it's a bit dark in there because there isn't any overhead lighting or if there is, it's very minimal.  So if you sit back towards the back prepare to eat by candlelight (even at lunch).  The only windows are towards the front so that's why.",2011-07-21 17:34:07

Coming from Chicago, I'm a bit of a pizza snob. Chicago deep dish pizza is THE only way to go. It's a meal, you eat pizza with a fork and a knife. Not that paper plate crap. It's about the crust. That buttery flaky tasty goodness... mmm... I can feel my arteries clogging as I write. 

The reviews that I read, led me to believe that Nello's would be the place I've been searching for, since moving to AZ over 6 years ago. As their motto states, ""In crust, we trust"", so I took it as gold and I trusted their crust. Boy, was I disappointed. We got the heart shaped ""Valentines Special"", with their signature crust, half cheese and half pepperoni. 

Let me reiterate, I am a pizza snob and I have high expectations for great pizza. Sadly, this was just mediocre. It was pizza that I would get if I only had $5, was pulling an all nighter and needed a quick pizza. The crust was dried out. Not buttery. Not flakey. Not tasty. In fact, my kids and I didn't even finish the crust; which is my favorite part of a pizza.

The ambiance was great. The decor, lighting, bar and even the seating was comfy and inviting. The staff was excellent as well. So, as for what might bring me back, it's the staff.

Portions were smaller than most other local establishments we have tried.  Our non-asian server was not 100% familiar with the menu and didn't know the answer to most questions.

Today however, is the straw that broke the camels back. Horrible. After about 5 years of strictly gel polish my nails are now thin so I asked to have the gel removed and opted to go with regular polish to let my babies breathe.

Indoor greenhouse was already closed - at 4pm on a Saturday!  And there weren't many animals at their ""petting zoo""...in which there are ""No Petting"" signs all over the place.  They're more like a few goats, donkeys, a coupla pigs, Chinese Silkie chickens, a few small horses/calves, and peacocks that are behind wired fences that you admire from a distance.  So families with kids, please take note.

I believe you can pay for pony rides and such.  Other than that, there's little-to-no interaction between animals/humans.

It's a newer park, not as established as High or even Erindale, so no extraordinary vegetation.

The menu offered innovative choices with unique ingredients (foodie approved). We started with The Enabler to drink. YUM. Then we ordered pig face and rabbit dumplings, and BBQ jackfruit steam buns for dinner. It was sooo good. I drooled all my lipstick off real quick.

So this time around I came here with Adam and his co-workers. They all felt like Sake Bombs. 
I didn't know what a Sake bomb was before this trip.
After trying them, I can indeed concur that they are awesome! 
It's so cool to slam the table and see all the cups of alcohol slip into each other. 

Our waitress the first time around was Ashely and she's the best. She knew I didn't like beer so she gave me a ""pikachu"" bomb instead which is a fruit juice base but still a sake shot at the top. Less alcohol and tastes a bit better. Ashley was really friendly. She served us quickly and drank a bit with us. 

The second time we had jimmy serve us and he was great too! He drank with us, gave us some free shots, the whole works. 

I thought that buying food in order to be able to drink was going to be an inconvenience but not that much. You can't order any of the under 5$ stuff but everything above works. 

Some options of 5$ meals that you can get to start drinking are: egg rolls with cheese and ham, vegetable dumplings, and ice cream (yes! Ice cream counts). 

The food is pretty good. I've had the ramen, chicken skewers, calamari, tempura shrimp, asparagus and bacon skewers, vanilla ice cream, and the vegetable dumplings. 
The only thing I didn't like was the calamari. They are very rubbery. Don't get those.

That all changed yesterday when my wife and I finally gave it a try.  Oh my God-- absolutely delicious!  I'll get the bad out of the way first-- the restaurant was fairly crowded for 4:00 in the afternoon and only one waiter was working-- there were a lot of tables that hadn't been cleared and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  One of our water glasses was also less than clean.  But I don't even care because the food was A-MA-ZING.  I've been craving a decent hot and sour soup ever since I moved to Madison and they delivered.  The chicken with garlic sauce was perfect.  The waiter (who was extremely nice) warned me about how spicy the fried beef in chili sauce would be and he was right.  It was also delicious.   We've eaten there two days in a row now and will definitely be back.

Two main problems: 1) Consistency: Some things are really, really good and a great value.  Some things are less good (mongolian beef was tough, hunan beef didn't have much beef).  Some things that are often good are sometimes not good (hot and sour soup).  2) Service: Everyone is very nice, but the place just doesn't run well.

The dinning room is decorated with a lot of wood. Tables, chairs, bench seats and paneling. While this does give a homey feel, it feels like a bit much some days. 

The biggest problem is the service. Even during slower times of the day it can take a little too long until orders are taken. They seem to be working on this issue, as the last two times I went for lunch service was fairly quick.

Central Park burger $13.95 (Served With Sautéed Mushrooms, Peppercorn Sauce, Crumbled Blue Cheese & An Onion Ring). Sounds good on paper but I would avoid this burger at all cost. Blue cheese literally tasted like vomit. Maybe it was a bad batch or that's what blue cheese naturally taste like?

Holli Guacamole burger $15.95 (Served With Mozzarella Cheese, Liberty Signature Sauce, Lots Of Guacamole & Two Strips Of Bacon). No complaints. A very solid burger. Both burgers were really large and filling. Added $0.95 for Cajun seasoning for the fries which is totally worth it.

Peking duck with scallion pancake - MUST ORDER! Ok the duck already has taste to it so DO NOT dip it in to the sauce, it gets a weird taste. Eat the duck and the scallion pancakes by itself.

Curry crab dumplings - interesting, but not memorable. I can't even remember the taste of it.

Pepper glazed chicken wings - just the right amount of glazness! Three pieces of chicken. Good amount.

Price - lower than most hotels nearby 
Food - good variety. Pizza place by the flamingo habitat was SO good.

He ordered:  the brisket sandwich, steak and cheese sandwich, baked beans and coleslaw.

The brisket was tender, good quantity, but surprisingly the real winner was the steak and cheese sandwich.  The steak was tender with nice grilled vegetables and tasty cheese.  Both sandwiches were served on great buns - usually an afterthought, or worse wonder bread, these buns were soft, fresh and tasty.

Baked beans were excellent, rich and dark, perfectly cooked, not hard or mushy.  Just great.

Hubby had chosen the coleslaw as a side because he liked vinegar based coleslaw but there wasn't much to it - just vinegar and cabbage, and given it was the same size container as the beans, not great value.  Next time more beans.

We were glad we got takeout because the latest Cirque de Soleil show  across the street created parking nightmares in the area, so plan accordingly!

It's a similar concept to Moe's or Chipotle, fresh ingredients and toppings over you choice meat with rice and beans!

One thing I really like bout Qdoba is the Craft 2 deal. It's smaller portion options of some of their most popular dishes.

I chose to go with the two tacos and three cheese nachos. The tacos were good, I had one with chicken and one with steak. You can add any toppings you like including sour cream and guacamole for no extra charge. The steak was a little tough but the chicken was very well seasoned.

The nachos were a bit disappointing, they were layered with a heavy cheese sauce and it left most of my chips soft and wet...not how I like my nachos! I wanted and missed the crunch! 

Overall, I like the Craft 2 concept, the staff here were all very nice and the tacos were really good. Was it better than some of the other local Mexican joints around town...no but for quick Mexican it hit the spot.",2013-05-04 23:13:24

We found so much great stuff for our cats. We only picked up some treats to give to the cats, but I plan to go back and try out some more items. 

Some of their products can be a tad pricey, but I'm sure worth it as most products I looked at were all organic, SLS free, hand made, locally made... and look, I'm a frugal person, so I'm always looking to save a few pennies, but for the health of my cats I will spend the extra bucks on the products at Oliver and Annie.

I found so much I wanted to buy for my cats, but was kind of on a budget, so I'll have to go back and stock up on shampoo and toys for my feline friends.

The menu is tiny and simple: beef, shrimp wonton or fish ball or two or all three of those in soup, in soup with choice of noodles, or on choice of noodles. Side of vegetables, pop, extra sauce. That's it.
And because the menu is so incredibly simple, the order arrives within mere seconds of placing it. You read that right.
My dining buddy went to visit the washroom (which he said was adequate) right after placing the order, and I was well into my bowl before he returned.

The soup does have the ability to grow on you- it may taste watery at first, but the subtle flavour does manage to come through. The wontons and fish balls are massive and frankly not bad, meeting the expectations one can have given how gourmet the place appears. This is definitely the authentic experience.

The walls of the place are lined with large copies of the menu, printed signs indicating that tea and water are available self-serve at the back, and articles reviewing the restaurant, including one that suggested that a bowl of soup for lunch isn't exactly filling, and with how inexpensive the meal is (we paid $13 for the two of us, including tax and tip) that one could venture to any of the other restaurants in the area to fill up on other food. I'd say just have another bowl if you're desperate.

Another (or was it the same?) review suggested that if a diner indicated they're in a rush, they could be in and out in under 5 minutes- which seemed entirely possible. I think we were in and out in about 20 minutes, and we took our good time.

They had a free taco giveway if you did the Yelp check in as one of their offers. I used it on top of buying 4 more tacos. Some mix ups here... walking in no one was at the register. I was the only one here. The cook came out and acknowledged me then yelled at the cashier to come out. She intially thought I wanted just the free taco and rang me up. I had to tell her I wanted 4 more tacos with it. Both of them looked like they were still really young so maybe that had something to do with the mix ups. The food itself was alright (there's better Mexican street tacos in my hometown of San Diego). They have a banner claiming it's a Yelp top 100 eatery.  Most of their business probably comes from late night eaters as they are open 24 hours. My tab was around $12 pre tip for 4 street tacos plus one free taco from the Yelp check in offer. The one thing I thought was off putting was a side of guac was $4. Pretty steep. That cost more then the street tacos individually.,2017-12-08 02:54:53

I decided to give Caribbean Queen a shot, given that I've had relatively good experiences at the other locations.

I ordered a plate containing three items: Chow Mein noodles, Calypso Chicken, and Mixed Vegetables. (I actually asked for the Green Beans instead of that last item, but I guess Green Beans sounds similar to Mixed Vegetables? I guess?)

My first bite was of the Calypso Chicken and I immediately bit into an inedible piece of cartilage. Not the best start to my meal.

The rest of the chicken was fine, thankfully. It's slathered in this sweet yet somewhat spicy sauce and it's about on the same level with similar offerings at Manchu Wok. The noodles were tasteless and a little too al dente, while the veggies were steamed and bland. Luckily I had the foresight to request a couple packets of hot sauce. That helped.

I should also mention that unlike ordering a similar platter at Manchu Wok, this came out to less than $8.00 with tax. At least if I'm going to eat mediocre food, I'm happy that I don't have to pay too much for it.",2017-11-22 17:35:43

The rep. tells me that if my Apple Watch had extended Apple Care, they will fix it at no cost to me. I explained it was a gift and I there was no extended Apple Care purchased. I further informed the rep. that Apple, the company he works for put out a notice that they were aware of the battery defect and extended coverage for three years. I guess this is Apple's way of not having to do a recall. He said ""oh yeah I've heard of this, but I don't know if this applies to your watch"". I asked if he could check, he said his system wasn't working right and he was unable to check. However, he invited me to travel 20 plus miles to an Apple Store and they would certainly assist me.

I eventually talk to the manager who explains that the stores don't even repair watches and me driving here was a waste and the wrong instructions given by Apple Care. He said my best option is to recontact Apple Care when I drive back home 20 plus miles and have them ship me a box to have it repaired. I asked the manager if he could at least advise if my Apple Watch battery defect was covered. He tried the whole one year coverage speech on me and I explained to him that I was aware of the extended coverage for their defective battery's. He then offers to take my watch back to one of his guys in the back for an assessment of coverage. He comes back and says I am right. It is a defect covered and to get Apple Care to ship me a box so I can mail it in for repair at no cost. Not really feeling the trust in what any Apple reps say, I get his card so I can refer to his name as someone who said my Apple Watch is covered under their battery defect extended Apple Care.

Some animated, some edible.  Both of those worlds combine into one of the cuter restaurants I've been to.  Anime Ramen happily provides what you would expect from their name.

The walls are decorated with art from different anime, the TV shows anime, and the waitresses wear colorful wigs that would not look out of place in an anime.  I didn't see any giant robots or guys with spike hair and huge swords, but I guess that would have taken away from the cute factor.

Soups offered here are interesting in that you first choose your broth, followed by the type of noodles.  Broths include your shoyu, tonkotsu and miso ramens, but also include other varieties such as tom yum.  Noodles can either be ramen or udon.  Based on ramen being part of the restaurant name, I've tried the shoyu ramen and tonkotsu ramen.

The ramen here is good, though the meal is a bit of a rollercoaster ride for me.  There are no add-ons available for your ramen (aw), but all the bowls do include a boiled egg and seaweed (yay!).  Instead of getting only two slices of chashu pork you're treated to three (yay!), but I think that it could have used a bit more boiling and flavor (aw).  The broths are flavorful and not salty, so its easy to find yourself slurping up every last drop.  The tables don't have garlic and ginger for you to add to your soup, but you can ask for some ginger from the kitchen.

I think your experience here will depend on what you like the most abouta bowl of ramen.  For me, it all averaged out to a decent bowl that I will enjoy every now and then in the future.",2011-11-14 03:26:20

Driving home from the grocery store, we decided to swing on in and have dinner at the old Olive Garden.  

Parking was packed.  And, we were about 8 couples behind on the wait list.  After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were finally seated.  I love the way the O-Garden is laid out - very spacious, wall colors are calm, and lighting is perfect.

Our waiter - despite being really busy, spent the necessary time with us.  Took our drink, appetizers, and meal orders promptly.

Once he brought us our drinks, he also brought our yummy garlic bread sticks and chilled salad.  Now, I love the Bread Sticks here.  They seemed to be soaked in Garlic (yum yum yum) and are warm.  By the way, because of the ""heavy"" garlic, you might experience some uncomfortable gas feeling at night... lol... pop in some GAS X before you head to bed.  Your partner would appreciate it... hee hee.  back to dinner... I must say the O-Garden have the bread delivery right.  I hate restaurants where the bread are HARD and difficult to bite into... Soft warm bread is the way to go.  As for the salad, it was perfect.  Dressing was light and ideal.

We ordered the Mussels as an appetizers.  Since we were hungry, the mussels were consumed within minutes.  Very good.  By the way, we took our Breadsticks and dipped it in the mussel butter sauce.   All I can say is ""Ummm Ummmm Ummm!!""  Honestly, if we had to do it over again, we probably cut back on the bread... we kinda finished two basket full before our meal.  So, we were about 70% full before our entrees were even served.  Note to self, save some bread to take home (by the way, our waiter still got us some extra bread for our drive home too!  yeh yeh yeh!)

For our entrees, my wife ordered the Seafood Mari (can't remember the exact name) and I ordered the Chianti Braise Ribs.  Both dishes were truly good.  Her Mari was perfectly seasoned and had the right mixture of seafood.  And, the red orange sauce was not too tangy and did not overpower the dish.

As for my meal, my ribs were very tender.  I could cut it with a spoon.  My pet peeve with the meat was that the Chianti was a bit too strong and sweet.  They should have used a less potent Ruby Port wine or Chianti.  I did not really like the ""wet"" brown rice that they served with string beans on top.  It looked kinda dirty and unorganized.  It looked like it was ""slopped"" on.  I would prefer instead a clean pasta center piece with a mixture of color veggies (bell peppers, string beans, potatoes, etc..).  Needless to say, I did not care too much for the rice.

For two, drinks, with one appetizer, two entrees, salad, and ""complimentary"" break sticks, the bill comes to about $55 bucks.  Not bad.  Add in the 20% tip, and it runs up to $65 or so for two people.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.  It is a nice change-up from all the Asian restaurants that my wife always want to go to.

When we walked up the patio had just a couple tables going.  When we glanced inside we could see it was filled nearly to capacity.  Havana Cafe is not a very big place but they have really worked it to fit every possible table.

We started with a special-three appetizers for about $9.50.  I would tell you the names of all the appetizers but I can only find one of them on the menu I brought home.  It came with some meatballs in a brown gravy.  The meatballs looked like Swedish meatballs and the gravy looked like standard brown gravy.  Looks can be deceiving.  The meatballs had a nice texture and the gravy was surprisingly complex in it's flavor notes.  The appetizer trio also came with a pastry kind of similar to spanakopita but crispier and thicker.  The last appetizer was papa rellena-large croquettes filled with beef picadillo.  They were smothered in a creamy cilantro-lime sauce.

The entree we shared...Pescado Al Hinojo - fish fillet & jumbo shrimp pan seared and topped with a flavorful and creamy sauce with nice notes of lime, fennel and white wine.  It came with a white rice.  All delicious.

I finished off with a cafe cubano.  Perfect capper to the meal.

As I was strolling along in downtown chandler enjoying the weather I had stopped at each restaurant to look at the menus they had posted outside hoping to scope out my next lunch spot.

I stopped to read the menu here and a friendly girl approached and asked if I would like to be seated, unfortunately I had already ate but went instead to grab and iced tea anyway.

I was greeted with a friendly face from behind the bar who offered to whip me up some suga! Sounds good to me.

As she whipped, I browsed the wall of tea ,two of the most helpful girls were telling me all I need to know about loose leaf tea and so on.

Suga's ready, Jasmine citrus tea with pureed strawberries shaken up with club soda on the rocks and on the house!....I'm in Tea Heaven! 

Then I'm offered a sample of tea leaves in bag to take home and make myself.

Well, we have taken many visitors to Georges and they still talk about their experience to this day. I say that warrants an upgrade to 5 star!

We have been to Georges many times since the discovery from my initial review. Bottomless mussels on Tuesday for $15, check. Steak dinner out, check. We have not made it to the brunch and that is super sad and needs to be added to our bucket list. 

The firery mussels deserve a paragraph on their own. We came to Georges last night for a mid-week date and literally just got the fiery mussels. It was enough for two. I am not sure if I am embarrassed or proud to say we also killed 3 baskets of bread with the mussels....I mean that sauce is so amazing that is HAS to be soaked up with something. If you go to Georges and do not order the Fiery Mussels, you are doing it wrong. 

I also enjoy the oysters here. Also so fresh with a nice presentation. They are $1 on Fridays! Last night I had one east coast and one west coast. Both absolutely fantastic. In a previous visit, I tried the steak, which was excellently cooked. 

Wine selection is excellent! Service has always been spot on for us as well!",2017-03-01 15:05:36

The Foods we got, from the burgers to the Brunch Items, were tasty and well made, with great service and a nice view outside. Parking is a bit sparse, but there is parking out front and around the area, which may force you to walk around and check out some of the neat shops nearby.

Inside though, there are 3 floors: not too many seats on the ground floor, but plenty on the 2nd and 3rd. The 2nd floor features a very good view of the kitchen, which is pretty cool, but can be pretty noisy and hot. The music seemed very loud on the ground floor, but on the 3rd floor, it was much quieter and easier to hold a conversation up there. They have an extensive drink list and a far smaller food menu. Their bread comes with pesto oil which is pretty neat. The soup of the day was a cream of asparagus and I do believe that in their stations, each one has bread, Parmesan cheese, pesto oil, salt and pepper, as well as the daily soup. Considering there are 3 floors to the establishment, I guess this is a way to speed things up. Our seat was wonderful, by the window, so that there was a breeze and some natural light streaming in. Service was okay, our server came by to check on us once and was fairly polite. Prices are relatively reasonable given that this area is slightly touristy. Even when we left at around 8:30pm, there were still plenty of tables, so I wouldn't say they get completely filled to capacity, given that they do have 3 floors of seating.",2016-06-07 02:10:22

I like how the menu designated the vegetarian selections with a tiny green leaf.  I was disappointed to learn that the collard greens are not vegetarian. I had the Greek salad, which was not the best one that I ever had, but it wasn't because they didn't try.  The highlights of the salad included pepperoncini, beets, feta, and tomatoes.  The menu stated that the salad came with dolmades, but actually, only one dolmade showed up.  It was so good that I wished for more.  The Greek dressing was so-so.

I was contacted by Capitano's and was asked to give them another shot. So several months later, I brought 6 friends with me to see if maybe I am the one with the issue-maybe my expectations really are unreasonable.

The Good:

1. They take reservations.

2. Most menu items are under $10.

3. Some of the gelatos are tasty.

4. The gelato sandwich is actually quite good. I did not think the bread would work, but it did (I generally only have ice cream sandwiches on a brioche bun).

5. Most of my guests were okay with their burgers.

6. Good service in that they contacted me and offered me a free meal just to give them another chance.

The Bad:

1. I still don't care for the burgers.

2. We were the first customers of the day, yet they only had 4 gelatos to choose from. It was so embarrassing on my end since I hyped the gelato options to my friends. The poor girl at the counter kept apologizing, ""I am so sorry about this. We normally have many options!""

3. Though I liked that the bread for the ice cream sandwich was warm, I was stuck with eating a gooey melted mess. And because the bread is not a brioche (thick), the bread provided could not absorb the ice cream (bread was too thin).

I've been here when it's busy and slow. The one thing that is always consistent is the food. Yes, the wait can be brutally long when there's a full house but the food quality never suffers. Because of its size, the kitchen can get easily overwhelmed. With that said, I would recommend coming before or after the dinner rush (before 6:30pm or after 8pm) especially if you don't have a lot of time to spare. 

As for specific dishes, I usually order one of the stir frys but the soups are pretty awesome as well. One of the great things about the menu is they have something for everyone. Not feeling adventurous? Order the BBQ platter or Ginger stir fry. Up for something new? Try the Prahok (fish paste). Either way, you won't be disappointed.

The basic stuff (fish + salad/burrito/rice/sandwich) will come out around $10 each. They have more expensive fish like seabass or black cod.

My hygienist, Jennifer, was fantastic; she asked me if I had any problem areas or concerns and she obviously listened because she was more than attentive to my sensitive areas.  Dr. Tran was super friendly and described what he was going to do to my teeth based on my x-rays pics and suggested a timeline for keeping my pearly whites, er, white.  

Perhaps the best and most surprising aspect about my visit here was the office's punctuality.  My appointment was for 10am and after filling out the requisite ""new patient"" forms, I was escorted to my dental chair at 10:05am.  Had I been quicker to fill out the forms, I'm sure I would have started my appointment even sooner.  It is a sad state of affairs when I list ""punctuality"" as a standout trait for a dentist's office, but as most of us know too well, promptness and swiftness are not adjectives often used to describe medical appointments.

The braised beef was incredibly soft and pulled apart with the greatest of ease. What we loved most about this dish was the combination of bold colors on the plate and the the balance of fresh veggies with the braised short ribs.

The couple sitting next to us was so intrigued with all of the photos I had been taking of our food that they offered their food up for the photo spotlight. I never got a chance to taste their dish (Vieiras Chilindron Sautéed scallops topped with fresh tomatoes and peppers sauce, served with seasoned white rice) but it looked gorgeous. Unfortunately (for me) I just cant bring myself to like seafood and if these were the best scallops in the world... they would be wasted on my palate.

Miro Spanish Grille was absolutely delicious and an easy recommendation for South Charlotte.

Ironically, the grilled chicken with the house sauce is better despite being much cheaper. Also, a mixed review for customer service. 

The NY Strip Steak was $11 online. The owner charged me $14. When I told him it was $11 online, he said, ""We'll have to change that."" He didn't offer the balance back. Then I looked at the paper menu right there on the counter. The NY Strip Steak was once again $11. I pointed this out to him, and he said, ""Yeah, we'll have to update that."" No $3 refund offered. 

I waited and debated if I should say anything. It was only $3, but it was more about the customer service at this point. When he returned to the counter, I asked, ""So, you're just going to leave me at $14?"" He said, ""No"" and then gave me $4 cash back. He did give me an extra dollar for the mess up. This was kind, but I'm not sure he would have offered anything unless I brought it up.

On a more positive note, the mother was super friendly and kind. I could tell she very much appreciated each and every customer, and she's part of the reason I will return.",2016-03-15 12:08:56

YzhImTT5hdtfGEi0dEFwmQ,YG7wJFUzrNdGtvYzS9SeqA,7M3nL-1LlDVcZBrw5cmi7A,2,6,0,0,"I really hate writing long reviews, but it would be a disservice to give 2 stars and not give the entire story. If you had asked me 2 months ago how I felt about this gym, I would have said good things, but now I am not a fan! 5 stars for childcare staff, 1 star for management, so I'll settle for a 2 star review. 

First off let me just rate the gym itself. Lot's of cardio machines and weight machines. Sometimes you have to wait for the free weights or other equipment. I think it would be nice if the trainers had their own equipment, but we just try to modify our workouts until the trainers are done with what we need. It's a small gym and not intimidating so it is an okay place to work out. Unfortunately, management is not the greatest and I've lost my motivation to work out in a place where I feel targeted and picked on. 

We decided to sign up for this gym after getting advertisements in the mail every month for their $10 membership. The girl who helped us suggested that we get the $20 membership which included unlimited classes and the ability to bring in a guest every time you come in. Since I mentioned that I was not interested in going to the gym without my husband, she suggested that would be the best plan for us. $20 membership plus $10/month for child care, we started paying $30 month to month. 

About a month ago when I went to sign in as a guest, a man at the desk (he was dressed like a manager) questioned me as I signed in. As I'm writing my name he looks at it and asks ""you're a guest?"" I said ""um, yes"". He asks "" Who are you a guest of"". I said ""I'm a guest of my husband's, I come in with him"". Then he asks me again and throws out a name and asks if I'm with him. I'm like what? I said I'm with my husband. I don't know if he was not listening or thought I was lying but he then asks ""are you a member?"" WTF man! Why the interrogation? I finally point at my husband and said ""I'm here with him, is that okay??"" 

The next time I came into the gym, I notice that the guest sign in is no longer on the table and I get a weird vibe from the girl when I ask to sign in. Fast forward 2 weeks later, my husband gets a call from Smart Gym informing him that our membership is no longer valid and that I will need to sign up for my own membership. We go into the gym to talk to them and apparently the reason why our membership is not valid is due to the changes in their insurance so guests will not be covered if they get hurt. They were also not willing to accommodate us for the inconvenience, so we'd have to pay another $40 yearly maintenance fee, making it $80 for both of us. We were told we had a month to make a decision. We were in a pretty sour mood, so 30 minutes into our workout, the guy comes back up to us and tells us we now have 9 months to make a decision. That made us feel better and I figured we'd suck it up and just pay for another membership instead of looking for another gym. 

So fast forward another week, my husband is talking to a guy he works with that goes to Smart Gym and turns out this guy has the exact same membership as us and never received a call about his membership being invalid. The only difference between him and us is that his guest doesn't come with him every time he works out. After hearing about our situation, my husband's co worker asked someone at Smart Gym if he would be forced to change his membership if there were any changes to anything and he was told, ""no, you would be grandfathered in"". UM, what????

After hearing about this, I no longer feel like setting foot in that gym. I love working out, but I'm willing to sit out the gym until we find another one. I just feel like we're being picked on and targeted, and I don't like being treated differently from other members just because we actually use the facility. One warning sign that Smart Gym was all BS was when we were told that the only way the child care door could be opened was with your fingerprint. Turns out the fingerprint thing is BS, anyone can open that door. You've been warned.

(sidenote: I wrote this review 5/9/14 and it never posted until today 7/10/16 so maybe the childcare door has changed, but I'd double check!)",2016-07-10 17:42:03

But I like the look of the natural bluffs and rock outcrops around the edge of the grass field. The rest of the park we saw was clean and looked nice.
The parking lot off of Decatur is the spot you'll find the dog runs and children play area with splash pads. There are 3 separate dog areas, they are not very big and have low fencing, so dogs that like to jump may be able to escape. The trees are new and small so there wasn't a lot of shady areas. Water fountains and poo bag dispensers are installed around the park.

- creamed corn side: sweet and creamy
- mushroom side: very earthy and well cooked. i liked that it was a variety of mushrooms
- banana coconut pie: seriously one of the best i've had in a really long time. the crust was nice and coconuty, like a coconut cookie. perfect dessert. BUT this slice was huge! perfect to share with two other people. or just the right size for you when you need some sweets

pros:
- service: perfection, as always
- food was awesome! everyone loves it when the cart comes around, cause it's eatin time!
- able to make a rez right before we walked in
- didn't rush us. we had a very late dinner, and were probably the last patrons there, but no one rushed our meal and let use enjoy every bite
- huge dining room! plenty of seats for small or large parties

cons:
- it's a bit stuffy. when i go to the beverly hills location, it's the type of place older rich people go. but, regardless, it's nice to treat yourself, especially after winning some money at the roulette table!
- no meatballs! maybe we came too late, maybe they don't do it at this location, but i really missed the mini meatballs the beverly hills location usually has in their bar as an appetizer for people who are waiting. oh well

I put on my big girl pants and went to get a smog here. (My husband usually takes care of that kind of stuff). This Jiffy Smog is tucked in between a gas station and a Domino's and Starbucks. It gets really crowded and there's no semblance of order. I got cut in front of since it's so disorganized here! You can't tell who's in line waiting or who's getting gas. 

The attendant was a total jerk. He didn't say a word until he finished up with what he was doing. It's not that hard to smile and say ""hi"" or ""I'll be right with you"". He was gruff and unfriendly when he did decide to open his mouth. I pulled up a coupon from Jiffy Smog but he said he could only accept a printed version. Wtf? This policy should definitely be changed. And, there was not one but two signs posted up encouraging customers to tip. Yeah, right. Since when do you tip when you get a smog? 

You can pay for registration here too, but there's a $10 fee and you have to have your tags mailed to you. Better to just go to a kiosk at Albertsons!

We were acknowledged and greeted promptly as we walked through the door.  The restaurant was loud, lively,  and was about at 50% capacity for a dinner time. Not too bad. We informed the hostess there was three in our party and lead quickly to a 4-top. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and came back to my party with only place settings and menus for two..  I corrected it myself by grabbing from the table next to us. Aside from that little hiccup,  service was quick and they were attentive. I never had to ask for a refill on my beverages. 

Pricing was good for an AYCE. $24.99. But very confusing. Why put on Yelp! that to check in the price is $24.99 when the price is already that to begin with? I thought the draw for businesses using Yelp! was to for an incentive for visiting their establishment?

My qualifications for an AYCE restaurant are very minimal: 
- fresh ingredients, mainly their uni and amaebi
- is their salmon skin hand roll actually crispy and mostly salmon skin?
- do they have natto?
- do they carry fresh wasabi?

Their uni was very fresh. Firm and no bad aftertaste. Same with amaebi. The downside to their amaebi is the puny size and no tempura heads to accompany the nigiri. 

Their salmon skin hand roll should really be considered a salmon handroll as there was more salmon than fried skin. Taste was fine and as always I forget to ask no eel sauce. I'm very picky to menu items; don't list something if it's not what you are presenting the guest. While we are on this topic, please don't say that you have soft shell crab on the menu and only give half of the soft shell crab. I understand it is only 1 per guest on AYCE, but at least specify it's half of the soft shell. I'll gladly pay for a full crab.

Natto was not on the menu from what I saw, but they did carry it. Down side, they were out! I get that it is a Tuesday and they were closed Monday, but it's a Tuesday... deliveries should have been made to compensate for a busy weekend if they were running low, so that was a let down.

Seeing as they were not up to par with my necessities for sushi, I opted to not inquire about fresh wasabi.

Dessert menu offered the nornal sushi staple: tempura ice cream and mochi ice cream. Nothing made the desserts stand out or scream out.

But definitely willing to give them a chance again.",2018-01-04 05:05:41

Arrived around noon- booths were full, bar was almost full, so we ended up sitting at the awkward bar to the right. I guess not really awkward for us, more for the people at the booth you end up staring down into. the decor is awesome, the staff was super nice, and all the food people were eating around us looked fantastic.

I'd been dying to make it to diamond to try the pig wings, ever since that preview menu was posted it's been on my list, so obviously we ordered those. they (along with the hushpuppies) arrived within minutes of ordering, better than I had imagined. I love them. I will go back for some pork shanks in honey mustard any day of the week... but when it came to the second round of food there was an awkward lag. 

Don't know exactly where it went wrong, but people who sat down ten and fifteen minutes after us got their plates as we were awkwardly trying to balance fending off starvation and wanting to save a bit of the first round to eat with the rest of our food...eventually it did come. (our server was attentive during the whole time we waited, checking in constantly, just without food) When my burger (oh, how nice it was to be able to order a small block again, not that I mind ordering pterodactyls, but it felt good) finally arrived my friend's sloppy joe came out piping hot, at a ridiculously unsafe temperature. She took the bun off after her painful first bite and steam billowed up. I mean I like my food on the hotter side than the colder, but come on.

Location: In a sparsely populated part of town, but just a couple blocks from tons of bars and clubs.  Great location for partying.  It's also a close walk to Scottsdale Stadium (for spring training), Old Scottsdale, the mall, etc.  It's actually just about three blocks from the W, so the real estate guys of the two hotels had the same thing in mind.

Atmosphere: Trendy, swanky interior with lots of color, pergo floors, and full wall photos in the rooms.  

Rooms: Good sized rooms with a couch, desk, and comfortable bed.  The set up isn't that good for people doing hard-core business work, but otherwise is fine.  On my first trip my bathroom was enormous (must've had an upgraded room) but this time it was pretty standard.  My room did look a little worn this time with some scuffs and scratches to the furniture, but nothing major.  Do note that the walls are a bit thin.  The room wasn't loud enough to hear conversations next door, but I could hear the whoosh of the toilet next door flushing.  I asked for an upper floor and got a room on the top floor overlooking the pool and with a view of the distant mountains.

Room-service: Had room service breakfast on my first trip.  The food arrived quickly and was pretty good.  They have a thing where you can order your food via phone and then pick it up if you want to save on room service fees.

First of all - the fact that they have garlic sauce on the menu is INCREDIBLE - it's rarely found on restaurant menus so be sure and order extra. If you haven't had garlic sauce, do yourself a favor and get your booty over to Khoury's. It has the consistency of mayo, but there are no eggs in it. The only ingredients are garlic and olive oil, so if you're planning to make out with anyone, make sure they have some too. (Also, I have tried and failed to make this at home more times than I can count. Garlic sauce is a thing of beauty when it's done right.)

I've had many of the dishes here and they're all fab. 

There are only two things I don't love, so let's get to it, shall we?

1.) It's a little over-priced. I mean, look - it is the BEST middle eastern food in Vegas, I know...but like, also...Middle Eastern food is home cooking, not gourmet eating. Maybe I was spoiled growing up in Michigan where you couldn't swing a cat without hitting great hole-in-the-wall Arabic food, but the entree pricing seems about $4-6 too high.
2.) If you try and order on Postmates, there are only like 5 or 6 things available in the app. I don't know if this is because that's how they set it up on purpose, or if it's an accident, but I can say for CERTAIN that I would order delivery from them more often if the full menu was available.

I recommend using Postmates or just picking it up yourself.)",2017-09-18 20:04:03

I like the setup of the restaurant; it's very tumblr-inspired. And most importantly, it's a bonus to have the waiter, after seating us down, give a quick rundown of the menu, which isn't common in non-high end restaurants.

My most to least favourite: 
Mango Pudding - This. was. so refreshing. The chunks of mango really brought together all the sweetness of the flavours
Chocolate Souffle & Raspberry Sauce - I'm pretty sure I would've appreciated this more had I seen the entire half hour process which is required to prepare this. It's made fresh every time so they warned us ahead of time with our compliance. The souffle was dry, as it was supposed to be with a dark chocolate premise. The raspberry jam was puckery and sour; and I""m quite sure they made this in house because it tasted very unique and fresh as well.
Creme Caramel - This was more fun to prepare to eat than the actual process. A hole in the centre of the jar is recommended to have the syrup from the bottom mix well with the rest of the top portion (which resembled egg flan)

Being a steak lover, I ordered the 10 oz prime sirloin ($30.95) with mashed potatoes. The steak was great; good quality meat, lots of juice, grilled as I asked for it, crispy exterior, melt in your mouth texture, but just slightly not hot enough. The mashed potatoes were good, but I think some gravy would have been great since it did get a bit dry halfway through the meal. Onion crisps and the accompanying greens brought a good balance to the steak and potatoes; really wished there was more of the salad.

Also ordered some parmesan truffle fries ($5) to share. They were light and crispy and tasted good, but I didn't really taste parmesan or truffle, just some rosemary. The complimentary bread at the beginning of the meal was a bit bland but toasted perfectly and came with butter that more resembled buttercream (like on cakes) more than normal butter.

All in all, a satisfactory meal at a satisfactory price (we came up to just under $60 for 2 people). Most of the sides were good, not mind blowingly great, but the steak is what I came for and it was solid. Prices seem to be slightly lower than at other similar establishments, which doesn't hurt. The atmosphere in the part of the restaurant where we sat was dimly lit and very private - perfect for dates or for chatting, though it was not so well suited for taking pictures.

The aunt and her boyfriend had actually already been to Hussong's and wanted us to try the place out. They're out-of-towners - taking us locals to a place! Ha!

The place is in Mandalay Shoppes next to one of my faves - Burger Bar. The place itself is small and narrow (also kind of like Burger Bar). And the tables are kind of close together, plus the place is a little cramped. More than a few times I felt like I needed to duck or scooch out of the way of servers trying to get food to other tables.

We started with chips (two salsas - red, which is a very tomato-based salsa, and a green tomatillo salsa which had a bit of a kick, but not much). Thank goodness we opted to get a side of guac to dip the chips in. It saved the day! It had nice, big chunks of avocado in it, which made happy. 

I had the Enchilada Suizas. Chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce, sour cream, and (I think) basil leaves topped on them. Also comes with a side of beans and rice. Strangely enough, I was a fan of the beans. Usually I am not at Mexican places, but these beans I actually liked. They had more texture and chunks of beans than others I have had. The rice was pretty bland - nothing special. The enchiladas were quite refreshing because they were much different than others I have had. With the addition of the topping of basil leaves, it made this dish much more complex and the chicken was not shredded, it was more like large, moist pieces of chicken in the enchiladas.

My husband had the carnitas platter, which comes with tortillas, peppers, onions, pickled onions, and a few other things. I tried some of the carnita and it was delish. They put a nice char on the meat and it actually comes out in CHUNKS, not shredded like so many other Mexican places. 

We ended the meal with sopapillas. They come with a small dollop of caramel ice cream and chipotle honey dipping sauce. You only get TWO sopapillas in the order. They were okay, but Lindo Michocan has better sopapillas.

The following review is what happens when you say you're gonna wait and not eat any junk until Super Bowl Sunday, and then you...don't. So out of total boredom, on my iPad I play this game called Jelly Splash. Now to get extra coins you have to sit through come type of Ad for like 30 seconds. One day, up pops a Jack in the Box commercial on there advertising that $4.99 Chipotle Chicken Club Combo.

Heading home on a Saturday I say ""Hey, let me try that new Chipotle Chicken Club."" Pull up to place my order and the $4.99 CCC combo is displayed right above the speaker.  I tell the girl what i wanted and proceeded to the window. Now I knew it was going to be a mess when it took a while for someone to come to the window. Saw some guy fooling around with the soda machine. I pay for my stuff, and then the drive-thru girl waits a good 3 minutes for the guy to finish messing with the machine.  After the 3 minutes, she's like ""Well, our machine is broken would you like some orange juice or apple juice?"" I'm thinking who in the hell-o, is going to drink some dang apple or orange juice with a chicken sandwich? I kindly just say ""No"".  She sits there a sec like she's stunned that I declined the orange juice. She says ""Ok, one second.""  Another girl comes to the window and says, ""Our soda machine isn't working at the moment, would you like an orange juice or apple juice?"" I say ""Nooooo"" all the while thinking, if I didn't want any juice when the 1st girl asked me, why would I want it from you? She then says, ""Or you can just get a refund."" *sigh* I say ""I'll just take the refund."" Right after I said that, the machine starts working. While one girl gets my soda, I look at my receipt and ask the other girl, ""Why does your ad say $4.99 for the CCC combo, but I got charged $5.29?"" The girl says ""You were charged $5.29."" I'm thinking, WELL DUH DUMMY! Anyway, I just take my stuff and drive off b/c I'm not about to get mad over that extra bit of change, but when you advertise something and then there's a picture stating the price, you'd think they'd charge you, I don't know, the PRICE ADVERTISED.

Get home to eat my food. I'll never understand why people put warm food on a cold bun. The sandwhich was blah and had to warm it up in the microwave when i got to my apt (which is 2mins away), the fries were borderline cool.  That JITB doesn't have to worrying going there again.

We came on a Sunday night, relatively late for dinner between 8pm and 8:30pm and the place was still packed surprisingly. We waited for about 20mins and were finally seated. My friend recommended the Malaysian curry, but I opted for the baked rice/spaghetti. The bf got the Hainanese chicken rice and it definitely comparable to the one at Phoenix. I liked the one here slightly more as the chicken was a lil more tasty and 'fresh.' I tried my friend's curry and it pretty good- not too spicy and had a sweetness to it. Next time I will be ordering that for sure. I had the baked chicken with 'ying yang' sauce and their tomato sauce was pretty good- not too sweet or sour. Their baked dish portion was pretty big, good thing I was hungry but this is definitely shareable.

All our meals came with a soup and drink and were approximately $10 which is a pretty common price for dinner at the HK cafes in the area. They have many dishes to choose from so if the above items aren't your fancy- try something else...they even have ramen lol. 

The last item to mention is their Milk Tea- man oh man...this was pretty good, smooth and freshly made. Now I have another Tea spot in Markham! Be prepared to wait and give this place a try.

The chicken kaarage wasn't that cripy but was good, and the gyoza was just mediocre.

My mom's pho soup was HOT. like it was on point, and flavor wasn't bad compared the pricing. The price is generally lower than average Vietnamese restaurants.

Jesse could tell you I was not a fan of burgers, that was until I was introduced to Smash Burger. Nom nom nom is all you will hear from me.  Seriously, like hulk, I SMASH these burgers.

My go to would be either the Sin City or the Truffle mushroom swiss, burger or chicken, they are both delicious!

I like mixing it up with the sides, but when you want to save a bit of calories and get your veggie on, have the veggie frites.  BUT I save my calories for the shakes, hahaha!!

We were told crayons and paper would be brought, it never came, we tried to ask but there was only 1 server on duty and at least 6 other tables besides ours. By the time we got our pizza the kids and us were starving. Must've been at least 45 minutes - because I was able to attend a 35 minute conference on my phone which was over long before pizza came. We asked the server why she was only one on duty and she said there is only ever 1 person during the day. The only reason I give 3 stars is because the pizza was delicious! Hubby got philly steak, I got Margarita, and the kids got cheese. The server was very nice but it should not take 2 hours to eat pizza. With 1-1/2!total waiting time.

We got there about 20 minutes before the game started and scored the last table! Our server was very nice and attentive at first but, as the game extended passed regular closing time, her attitude became slightly less pleasant but, enough to tell that she didn't want to be there. But, I get that. Drink specials that night included 2.75 bud light bottles, the bf indulged in those, while I tried SA Oktoberfest for the first time ever.. I know, I'm lame. We also started off with the $5 pretzels with beer cheese, it pretty good. 

What really irked me was that we were not given warning that the kitchen closed at 10... it was a late game and we were waiting for half time to order food. At half time, we were told that only apps and fried food were available. :/ I think its in the best interest of the server to warn your table that kitchen is closing so order up while you can. Since we couldn't order actual entrees, we opted to just share a fried pickle basket and eat when we got home. The pickles came out pretty quick and were much thicker than we had hoped. Still good though, the light breading had a nice crunch. 

We returned this week to order takeout, the bf and I ordered a Kickstand burger with shells n cheese as a side with an upcharge of $1.25. The shells-n-cheese was very bland, I wouldn't recommend it if you are a mac n cheese connoisseur like me. I was disappointed to find all the seasonings like garlic and basil were actually in the beef patty and not in the actual burger as toppings.. we missed out since we switched out for chicken. The bf wasn't fond of the melted brie but, I thought it was ok. They were very generous with the caramelized onions. 

I'd come back to try a burger, just be on top of ordering food when you stop by to watch a game.",2016-09-13 15:27:42

Went with a ham and turkey on croissant.  Croissant was flaky and buttery.  Would have liked more choices in spreads, besides mayo and yellow mustard.  Not a fan of either.

The sauce was pleasant and creamy and had to be sopped up with some bread, chicken was cooked right and I like the mushrooms were a mix of beech and oyster. The salad with it was a nice mix of greens with a hint of orange in the vinaigrette. 

I don't know why I haven't gone here sooner, but probably because my ego is bruised that I don't get to walk her from my backyard to brunch at the lake. I most definitely will be back as it's prime outdoor dining weather and the food was solid.

I went to the Markham location hoping for a familiar experience downtown. 

I came here wanting to binge on aburi (blowtorched) sushi, and the restaurant delivered. Compared with my last visit to the Markham location, I can say that objectively, the quality of the food is better.  The sashimi came in nice large chunks and they didn't skimp on ingredients for the sushi.  However, keep in mind that the menus are a bit different and there are fewer items available downtown. 

The service is where things felt glitchy: some of our ordered were duplicated, they were missing some items from the menu, we asked for tea and received hot water instead, and some orders took a long time. Surprisingly, it was the aburi sushi that came out the quickest.

This is the closest grocery store to my house and I try to never shop there if I can help it. The reason? There are NEVER enough cashiers. I have never ever ever ever ever ever gone in and seen more than 2 cashiers working. Why do they even have 10 checkout lines if they're only going to use ONE most of the time? This is one of the only groceries downtown so I don't understand why they would close early(...10pm I think), and have one lonely cashier working during BUSY times. I once came here in the evening around 9 and stood in line for 40 minutes to pay for the one or two things I had bought. I couldn't believe it. That was over 2 years ago, and nothing has changed here, and you KNOW they get complaints about it, but they're obviously not changing anything.

The primary reason to shop here are the extremely low prices on surprisingly high quality food staples - including imported items.  Imported Italian pasta is regularly on sale for 99cents for 500g.  A kilo of Italian cous cous for $2.49, etc. etc.

As far as amenities - well duh - no frills means pretty darn spartan.  The overall place is clean enough although the shopping carts kind of skeev me out and could use a good few days in a bleach bath before they donated them and purchased new ones.  

The biggest negative of the place is the layout.  Inexplicably awful would be the best description.  Since no marketing or merchandising theory from this or any adjacent planet adequately explains the layout, I would like to offer some plausible explanations:

A) Designed by someone who had never shopped in a supermarket.

B) Designed by someone who never ate food

C) 3rd place in local elementary school ""Design a Grocery Store"" contest.

D) ""Now if we told you where stuff was then it wouldn't be a game""

Bottom line is it pretty much lives up to messaging - low prices and no frills.  I'm never particularly looking forward to going there, not too happy to be in there when I am, the checkout process is unnecessarily laborious and yet - I shop there regularly.

Don't get me wrong, I love it, but I just don't sit around craving it or ever really have it in my freezer. So, when I do go for ice cream, I want it to be absolutely fantastic and delicious and, most importantly, unique. Good ol' chocolate and mint chocolate chip are always great, but these new craft ice creams are like craft beers. I can't resist myself and I find myself disliking very few.  

The first time we came to Churned, it was an afterthought after a nice dinner. I had room for more, so we stopped here and met the most wonderful ice cream master. She was friendly, let us sample whatever we desired and chit chatted just enough. I was immediately sold on the wasabi, so I didn't get too much further. It was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. Such a strange experience! 

My second visit, however, I tried a few more flavors and settled on the roasted grape and rosemary. HOLY COW that is the best sweet and savory treat I've ever had. I also ended up coming home with a pint of the pumpkin without even trying it. I just knew. And I was right. But I do know that next time, I'll be heading home with that crazy rosemary and grape concoction because I've been having mouth dreams about it for a month or so now.

Went with the fam jam as I would never have picked this myself. Honestly, I didn't even realize we had stepped foot into L'académie until it was too late. At least it's BYOB so grab a bottle of wine from the SAQ across the street and enjoy the nice breeze coming through the sliding windows.

Front part of the menu is starters and pasta. At least the pastas are cheap here ($12.95) from Sunday to Wednesday evenings and lunch time everyday. Gotta get people in somehow right?

There's also mussels & fries, poutines and chicken. Mussels and fries are on special for $13.95. Table d'hôte if you want a starter (soup or salad) and drink (tea or coffee). Back part is broken into veal, land, sea and desserts. Lastly, a separate dessert menu in case their massive portions weren't enough for you.

- Deinhard - my uncle grabbed this from the SAQ and it was really delicious. Light, crisp white wine that didn't break the bank. That's a win in my books.
- Buns - obviously, these are just filler but went well with dipping in the soup.
- Leek and potato soup - the potato and leek soup came with the table d'hôte. Not bad actually.

- Lasagna pasticciata ($12.95)
- Tortellini rose ($12.95)

Good points include:

I enjoyed the live singer and his older songs from the 60s,70s and 80s were perfect for me.

The place had a decent,modern look.

I ordered a Thai Iced tea which I enjoyed.

The service was good.

The food quality seemed adequate.But I'm not real knowledgeable  about Thai food,so I can't say for sure.


Bad points include:

The place is very dimly lit.It was tough to read the menu,plus there was a transparent plastic sheet on the menu which tended to distort the menu.

The prices are slightly higher than I am comfortable paying.

The portions could have been a bit larger.

The last Thai restaurant I went to was Thai place in Target Shopping Center on Flamingo and Maryland.While it is not a fancy place by any stretch of the imagination  (most people would consider it a ""hole in the wall"") ,the quality
and quantity of the food seemed much better.(I'm talking about a simple
Pad Thai dish in both cases.) The price was lower there,too.

One of the biggest turn offs that both my friend and I experienced was when the
food server brought the check while I was still eating and asked if we could pay it right away.That seemed to us like a combination of being rushed and being distrusted.While we all know that feelings are very subjective and that might not have been the servers intent,that's how we took it.It definitely rubbed us the wrong way.

I might come back here again,but I won't go out of my way.If you feel like eating
here,by all means try it.You'll probably like it.In this review,I was just attempting
to share with you what my experience was like.I've had better and I've had worse.

Well how is that a problem you might ask since that is normal everywhere else...the problem is that they order their meal, are half-way through it and then move to their tables when called upon instead of finishing their meal at the bar. That's a problem because those of us waiting for tables can't get drinks at the bar since the bartenders ignore you unless you are seated at the bar. We waited nearly 45 minutes for a table standing around. The bartenders ignored you and it was impossible getting a drink. 

The food was good but overrated. I ordered the por ribs and the meat fell off the bone. The fries were terrible and burnt little crisps..think of it like stale pringles... The service was polite and friendly yet not outstanding.

A good restaurant for the Phoenix area but a lot of hype. This restaurant caters to the 40-60 year old White local Scottsdale crowd.

The reason for the low star rating is for the poor customer service. This was my first time eating here and honestly I don't know much about Mediterranean food.

Instead of telling me some of their popular items, he began to read off the menu (which I don't understand why since I can read it myself). When it was time to pay, another older gentleman was working the register. I showed him my check in (since they had a Yelp check in offer for free baklava) and he asked me for my name to confirm my check in. After I told him, he said he didn't see it on his register. I even showed him my Yelp check in and he kept on saying he couldn't see it even though it was right there on my phone. After awhile he just seem annoyed at the entire situation, which left me feeling confused. He ended the conversation with an attitude like as if he was doing me a favor by giving me a baklava. As I was dining in, the same worker went around and chatted with all the customers (asking how their food was, removing trash/taking their tray). He went to all the table except mine.

Anyway, the restaurant is fairly dark, makes you feel a little bit more secluded from the other tables in the restaurant.

Service was decent. Our server did a really good job when he was around, but he was not around enough. When our food got served, he would come and ask us how the food was and how we are doing before we could barely swallow our first mouthful. But after that, he would disappear for quite some time.

I ordered the chicken enchiladas. I really liked it. I enjoy mexican styled food so it's hard to mess it up. you get 3 enchiladas, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. If the entree was able to remain heated enough to keep the cheese nice and stringy then i would've loved it even more.",2015-06-13 15:17:52

For an appetizer we had the curry puffs. The puffs were tasty; the sauce was delicious! Now sure what is in the sauce but I can tell you there wasn't a drop left when we were done. 

The main courses are quite large. Both my boyfriend and I said we should have split one meal. He has the green curry with chicken; I had the mango curry with tofu. We got medium spice on both. His meal seemed a bit too hot, while mine was just right.

Pisces is right across the shopping center containing Marshall's Best Buy and Trader Joe's so you'll have to deal with the gnarly parking garage. I suggest driving up to a higher level, less congestion and speed racers.

The night of my birthday was half-price cocktails (*praise hands emoji*) so I ordered a martini that had pomegranate in it. Forgive me, I completely forget the official name of the drink but it was delicious and smooth. My best friend ordered the cucumber sake martini that was also delicious with a nice cucumber finish.

I ordered the taurus veg and panthers rolls. Not only were they both colorful and pretty to look at, they were so fresh and delicious. No joke, I inhaled both rolls.

The waitstaff was incredibly patient and kind. The manager even came by to check in our meal and wished me a happy birthday! The interior is smaller than I was expecting but creates a nice intimate feel and there is a funky jellyfish tank that you can stare at for hours.

I just had lunch with Sam. Literally. When I asked where he got his delicious dolmas (grape leaves stuffed with rice and herbs) and he said his wife makes them, the skepticism was on my face. They were perfectly formed and the flavor was intense. He backed it up by showing me his personal lunch from home and sharing it with me to the detriment of the fries in my combo which I was unable to finish after gorging on meat-filled dolmas, stuffed cabbage and squash (none of which are on the menu). And, for the record, his wife's cabbage rolls are AMAZING and should be added, at least , as a special! 

So, while dining with Sam he explained that he hails from Chicago where he owned and operated a similar establishment and has come to the Valley to join his sisters, one of which owns King Gyros (http://www.yelp.com/biz/king-gyros-phoenix#hrid:66ywkbFKsg_1IA03dK_JSg/src:search/query:king%20gyro) which boasts its own 4 star Yelp rating after 16 reviews. 

Besides the dolmas ($3.95 for 6) and some of Sam's lunch from home, I enjoyed a falafel pita combo ($5.99). A lot of times falafel, similar to meatballs but made from ground chickpeas, is dry and demands the accompanying tahini sauce and then tastes of nothing but sesame paste (blech!), but this falafel is moist and flavorful. Sam serves it with tzatziki sauce instead of tahini and since I can't stand tahini anyway, this is a bonus for me! 

I also tasted my friend's gyros which was ginormous! He ate half, if that, and was bringing the rest home -- the pita was overflowing with moist, well seasoned meat. 

I'm not a hot dog girl, as I've mentioned before, but Sam is very proud of his all beef Chicago dog ($1.99) which he cooks on the grill; still, an Italian sausage ($3.25) is more my speed. 

Without a doubt, I'll be back to Sam's!

I chose Paris 66 based on the fact I had never been there before and a few friends said they had good meals there.  The meals and the ambience of the restaurant were fine but the service was absolutely atrocious.  While we were seated promptly, it took forever for a waitress to come over and take our drink order, which didn't mind us too much because my friend and I were too busy catching up.  We asked our hostess several questions in order to make a decision and it took nearly 10 minutes for her to come back and take our order.  In addition, we were unable to get any speciality drinks (latte, espressos) since their machine was broken.  I ordered an omelette; however, I was told I could not get egg whites since the chef didn't make subsitutions but I could get it without cheese.  My omelette was delicous and my friend had a salty crepe which was also as good.  Since our waitress was MIA (you think she would have been more attentive since her salary comes from tips) we flagged down the hostess, who stated she didn't service tables and didn't answer our questions, or other servers walking by.  During our meal I got an email from OpenTable saying the restaurant cancelled my reservation.  Um well that's hard to do since I was there and stated when I checked in that it was made using OpenTable.  I spoke back with the waitress when we left and she barely acknowledged me.  I even called to talk to someone from management about the issue with the reservation; they said they couldn't fix it.  I also told them about the poor service we received which was followed up with an ""I'm sorry"".

Anyway, I had their artisan bread that came with hummus which is a better alternative than butter.  It was good but would pass on it the next time since it wasn't anything too special.  I had the roast duck poutine pizza. Whoa.  It's definitely for sharing as it is really too much for one person to handle.  It gets too savoury and there's too much gravy (yes, there could be ""too much"" gravy) to really enjoy the duck that's on it.  I love duck so while there's a lot on it, the amount of cheese and gravy takes over so you can't taste much of it and it made the pizza soggy.

Kudos to them for transforming the former Yoshi's fast food into a very small, but quaint, little restaurant.  Dimly lit, cramped, but nicely done interior, with AMAZING FOOD!  We ordered a slew of items...

Our FAVES:
Chicken karange, a soy ginger infused chicken morsels deep fried and covered in a curried egg salad. 

The lamb!! For $5, you get a mouthwatering, juicy, melt-in-your mouth slice of lamb served with some crispy shaved vegetables. I forget what the server told us they were, but they were very good.  Lamb was perfectly cooked, and had an insanely rich flavor. 

All the sushi is fresh and delectable. We had ours with the fresh wasabi which just puts it over the top for me. 

Corn flake shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops were just okay.  There was a lot of great reviews on them both, so we ordered them and were not overtly impressed.  The shrimps were plump and juicy, but were definitely overpowered by the giant chunks of greasy cornflakes that violated the roof of your mouth when biting into them.  These also came with an egg salad on the side which made the dish heavier than i would have hoped for. I would have liked to see a lighter dipping sauce? Spicy mango? Something slightly sweet or tangy?  Scallops were cooked perfectly, but the surrounding bacon was not as crisp as I would assume it would be. So the whole texture was just soft scallop and chewy half cooked bacon...Not my thing I guess. 

We also ordered the teriyaki chicken, which by then, we were SO full, we barely touched it, even though it was delicious. It was an all dark meat chicken, not my fiance's favorite, but it was still good.  We took it home and ate it the next day.  I made a nice chicken fried rice out of it.  

As a side note, I thought the portions were going to be micro after reading all the reviews.  Those people must be used to eating at buffets or maybe they frequent Claim Jumper? We ordered way too much food and taking an entire entree home, AND it was less than $100 AND we ate a ton of SASHIMI.  Of course we did only have tea and not alcohol.  They have a great $5 dollar menu that has a lot of little goodies on it as well.  It's really not expensive at all. 

I do agree that the service is a little lacking.  We were unfortunate and got stuck with a 'fresh' one that had someone following to make sure he didn't royally screw things up too much.  He was a scared little puppy and we tried not to be annoyed with him because he was nice after all.  It may as well been his first day.

I have had many a winter sour here and I hope they bring it back this winter.  You can't go wrong with any of the cocktails on the board and I highly recommend them. 
The burrata is the stand-out here. It's roasted and the grapes add a nice sour punch.  The prosciutto is made in-house and served with olives, it tides you over before the main courses. Plus, those items are all-time faves so it kind of brought me back to my trip in Europe.  The fig salad adorned with blue cheese was a nice starter.  We had pappardalle with braised rabbit. Give. Me. More. It's so good!  They even made a vegetarian version for our friend (in a party of 12!) on request.  Given it was a busy Saturday night, that was really nice for them to do.

Overall entry ambiance is pretty neat - you walk down a narrow brick corridor, which opens up to the actual room at the end.

i would say however, the service was a bit lower than LA. the hostess has a tough job managing the long waits, but she does a great job.  

the servers though, while being efficient and team players, have these earpieces stuck deeply in their ears. someone from the kitchen speaks into their minds, like queen bee and their hive worker aliens if you ask any questions or have requests, they almost always have to ask you to repeat it and take their secret service ear pieces out.  i would not say it was the friendliest, most customer focused service--but it was efficient.

My wife and I had the 5 course Carte Blanche tasting menu, where the chef picks 5 courses (mostly off the menus) to create our meal.  Like others have said, the 5 course tasting is $50 and the 7 course is $70.  If you're not super hungry, 5 courses should be sufficient, but the food was so good I could have easily done 7.  

Honestly, every dish was fantastic.  I can't recall all the deets since it was several weeks back, but I really would just leave it to the chef to pick what he wants to cook and you will not be disappointed!  I can't quite remember all the dishes, but there wasn't one that made me pause.  I wasn't blown away by the dessert - a rum cake - but it's cuz I'm seriously biased towards chocolate!

Drinks were also excellent.  I also had a couple glasses of red and my wife had some house-made Wild Ginger soda.  All the drinks were very tasty!

Service was excellent.  It's casual and homey.  Tobey, one of the owners, runs the resto and was super friendly.  Somehow our table was skipped for one of the courses, so they gave us a replacement course and then also cooked us the course we originally missed, which was served to us by Michael, the chef, with his personal apologies.

I can't say the same for the artist lineup...it caters to a more conservative, older crowd (I guess). But this review isn't about the booking.

Over the years, I have seen a few concerts here. I have sat in both the pavilion and lawn. It's basically a mini-blossom, but way more relaxed. The place is small, so any seat in the pavilion is a good seat. The lawn is very small as well, so you are still in a good spot there. I recently saw Fiona Apple in the lawn and we were happy with our location. It's not like Blossom, where the lawn is a gazillion miles away and you can't hear anything. It was also very comfortable due to a steep slope. We were fine without chairs.

What I really noticed as far as differences between Cain Park and other larger venues was the RULES. OMG, you can actually bring a blanket if you are sitting on the lawn! And I didn't get a full body cavity search on the way in. You are allowed to bring in a cooler and beverages. I'm guessing you can't bring in alcohol because they sell it, but it was nice to be able to bring water and things.

You can add a scoop of durian to your drink for 50 cents (used to be free by no longer) but this can sometimes overpower the other flavors of the drink because, well, it's durian.

Tip: Asking for easy ice doesn't increase the amount of good stuff in the drink (unlike at Starbucks where it does) because the ice is piled on at the top so just order it the way it is or risk a warm drink.

Tip #2: Parking sucks because of the crawfish place right next to it so park in the residential street right beside the place. Even if their parking lot looks empty it can fill up fast and backing out is a huge pain.

I'm not joking when I say I'd rather have Quiznos (preferably Togo's, but I have only had Togo's in California).

They are never consistent. When you order a sandwich on Tuesday it'll taste different from the one you order next Saturday. Guaranteed. They kill everything with peppers, even when I ask for NO peppers.

I'd rather have a toasted Italian from Subway. Or ANYTHING from Quizno's. And I haven't tried much other than the Italian from most places (just my preference - I know what I like).

One time I went here with my mom and my brother to pick up lunch and they closed the store without locking the front door because they RAN OUT OF BREAD.

We opened the door, stood there waiting and heard people in the back, and they laughed and came out and said, ""Oh, sorry...we ran out of bread a while ago. We should get some tomorrow.""

The beef carpaccio is also amazing. The truffle oil and peanuts on top provide a nice dressing and it's light and fresh. It's a must order. 
The other favorite is the grilled whole squid. The dipping sauce is a spicy aioli which is cool and sharp. 
The garlic noodles are also good but I would always say remind them more al dente as sometimes it is too mushy for my taste. 
I know a lot of other reviewers like the pork belly buns but I didn't like the sauce and would pass. I am more of a purist where I don't like sauce but that is personal preference. 
My hubs loves their lobster pho with egg noodles. The lobster comes pre cracked so you can eat it easily without being messy. It is his favorite cheat meal. 
The only disappointment is the big bone broth. We have called to reserve but have shown up and it is not available. Or called to see if they even have it available and were told yes of course and shown up and our waitress has said they were already out for the day. 
Today, on our honeymoon in Vegas there was no bone broth. Instead we settled for the oxtail pho with no noodles.

Access
Hidden in the middle of nowhere we find ourselves in a tiny section of Markham. There really is nothing around this restaurant but I guess that's good because it's not too busy/loud. Plenty of parking space so don't fret. The only problem with this area is that the Banquet Hall looks shady as hell from the outside. It is like some brick building with no fantastic aura beaming around it. The interior is like a 180 spin - it does look quite good.

Service
Shangri-La did an awesome job with entertaining the guests.  I mean with all that money going into the planning and booking I doubt staff would be assholes. Anyhow, this place has servers bringing out the food trays like it was the opening of an epic Chinese film. They would be roaming around the different tables and eventually gather in the middle while martial arts-like Asian music is playing. At the height of this, the servers give everyone a bow like everyone is the boss. I found this performance quite surprising and always wanted to eat right after. Cause really, I am queen lols. Just so you know, the prep rooms for the bride and bridal party is shit. It looks like an abandoned bathroom from some high school with a make-do couch and a mirror. Generally everything works but it doesn't look gorgeous at all. Talk about being locked up in that little room right before your big night lols.

Food
This is traditional Chinese food we are talking about, so it's no 3 course meal...this is the 10 course meal lols. I wasn't able to take pictures of everything but you can expect to be super filled. Everything tasted fine in my standards - not terrific - but satisfactory. I was really disappointed with the noodle or rice dish that usually comes near the end, it just didn't taste like anything. The dessert was pretty good if you still have room for it - most people did not. Everything else came out when they were hot and ready so no complaints. In general the bridal party gets food placed on fancier dishes but heck, I had no time to eat when I was a bridesmaid.

Overall
Shangri-La is pretty good for your average-sized wedding. The hall we were in houses 10-20 tables from what I remember which is like 100-200 guests. I really adore the backdrop behind the bridal party because it is filled with gigantic roses or petals. Depending on your colour theme, the room can accommodate special lighting effects. It is too bad that Toronto does not have too many Chinese banquet halls to choose from though Shangri-La proves to be pretty good for this type of cuisine. Contrary to my restaurant reviews, this one won't receive any grading. I feel that weddings are held on a different level and the banquet hall alone doesn't determine the experience.",2015-01-26 23:18:58

Until recently, when they began the process of revamping the store, I would have given it 1.5 stars. This is a typical grocery store, where you can find much of what you need and with the improvements, they are now offering a MUCH better variety than before. Think, things like offering low fat half and half in addition to fat free and regular. Seems like a trivial thing, but it isn't. I am impressed with the effort to include more variety as well as some more natural/specialty items (e.g. a variety of nut butters instead of just JIF and Skippy). The quality of the produce has also gone up significantly. Before, I would get a seemingly fresh-looking item home and have it spoil quickly. I am crazy with picking my produce too--I'm that lady standing by the apples for 20 minutes making sure I get just the right four apples! 

Meat is hit or miss at the SS GE, but more often than not, their beef looks super questionable. Chicken is very up and the air. Turkey is generally okay. The seafood is extremely expensive and not fresh at this store, which is sad. 

The main reason that this store gets such a low rating is because of the horrible employees and rude customers. I know the store can't decide who shops there, but they can certainly hire more security to help control shoppers better. More than once, I have been *this close* to getting run over by people on the scooter carts who were clearly on drugs. There are lots of people with multiple carts and screaming children who block the aisles and purposely do not let other shoppers through. I have even had two other customers cut me in line once and then found out they were friends with the cashier. Normally I would stand up for myself, but I was pretty sure they had weapons on them, so I just let it slide.  Most of the time, I drive to another store across town to avoid the clientele at this GE. 

I can honestly say I have NEVER had a positive checkout experience at this Giant Eagle. Not once, and I have shopped there probably 40+ times since moving to the neighborhood. I even had a cashier recently ask me ""Do you really need all this sh*t? I'm about to go on my break."" On another occasion, after pointing out that an item was rung up improperly (we are talking a several dollar difference), the cashier called me cheap. She said it jokingly, but I found it inappropriate. Even when nothing like the two cases above has happened, I have felt that the cashiers were extremely hostile. Similarly, when I have asked for help from someone on the floor, they are not nice about helping or ignore me. The exception is one man with a military look who I suspect is the store manager. He is super helpful and even goes out of his way to ask if customers need assistance. 

Despite all the bad things I mentioned above, I do appreciate the upgrades to the checkout lanes, layout of the store and entrance (no longer a weird entrance/exit that is opposite what it is intuitive). If Giant Eagle can take steps to friendlier employees and hire additional security to keep things in order, I think it has the potential to be a quality grocery store now that they are offering more variety. They are still super overpriced on everything, but do offer good sales each week.",2016-06-29 20:01:46

To be honest I had no idea anything was here before even though I drove past it hundreds of times. But when Naked City put its name on it, and their pizza in it, it was worth investigating.

The door opens to one big room, with a huge U-ish shaped gaming bar to the right. This bar stretches from one end of the large room to the other, I'm guessing 40 places? One of the larger bars I've seen. On this Sunday night around 5pm, it was packed with all the people checking it out. The rest of the room has a variety of booths and open 4 top tables. I didn't really wander around too much to check out all the stuff. Its a bar, same as most any other bar.

Service was good and friendly. They have a nice variety of beers on tap, and wine and hard liquor. It almost seems as if the bar itself isn't finished, there is seemingly plenty of room for storage and displays but they aren't used effectively. This is not one of those flashy upscale places, its a neighborhood bar. They have a nice set of large screen TV's for viewing sports. 

Now for the pizza. You can order by the slice, or by the size. Pizza's are square in shape. I had just a slice with ham and pineapple and it came out to about $5 and the slice was huge. I mean Huuuuuge. I barely finished it. And it was really tasty, a thicker crust that was crunchy, and lots and lots of cheese. Really great slice of pizza!

Stop by, check it out. I will be back for the pizza. Caution, it does get a little smoky in there, especially at the bar.",2016-07-21 01:16:45

I purchased some items online back on Black Friday for Christmas Gifts and had to return. It clearly says on my shipping form for easy returns that I could return/exchange at the store or through shipping. So of course I chose through store. 

All I wanted to do was exchange the jeans we had purchased for a smaller size. But I was told that I cannot exchange the jeans, that I needed to do a refund. Of course, because the jeans were not on sale for the price I purchased. I don't want to argue with everyone so fine give me my refund. Which btw, I am still waiting for to be returned to my bank account. SO SLOW.

and this store was a hot mess on my visit. I have never seen it this way. And the way it was, it clearly did not happen over night or in one day. Trying to search through jeans was almost impossible because they were literally strewn all over the place.

We parked in the garage in the back and walked across the pool area {once we got permission from the walky talky guy b/c we didn't have hotel room keys}. Mission.

We had to make our reservation with the Hotel's VIP services because apparently the spa was so busy, extremely understaffed, that they dont' answer their phones.  My friend wanted a female massage therapist, she of course was with a male, so we had to swap. No Biggie Handled.

Checking in was slow, checkout was even slower, lady before me was complaining about her 80 minute massage saying it wasn't very good...and she was getting it comped.  Also, bring warm clothes, no kidding, this place hikes the air down to like 60 degrees. It was even too cold in the gym after a 3 mile jog.

Waiting areas before and after massages need to be revamped. There was absolutely no music on, no water sounds, no water features, and it was way too bright in there.  Where you keep your stuff is fine enough and the one amazing feature is they had all the water, juice, tea, and fruit one could possibly want.

I ordered a pork belly ramen - thinking mistakenly that this meant tonkatsu. Nope, no tonkatsu ramen. The pork ramen comes out with roasted palm hearts, kimchi, roasted pork belly, green onions and a soft boiled egg garnished with Togarashi. The egg yolk was already broken on mine which is usually not a big deal. But my problem was the broth.

Totally utterly flavorless broth. My partner noticeably saw my face go from yay I'm gonna get some ramen to sad face in record time. It needed salt too which for a pork ramen is kind of ludicrous. I liked the consistency of the noodles though, so yay for that. The pork in the ramen was ok, though it could've been a bit more tender. My partner's lemon grass chicken ramen was also weak in the broth area though the other flavors came together a bit better overall in that one.

Still tasty and we didn't really care that the meat was different since we like to try new things. The wait staff doesn't fawn all over you, but they are perfectly fine and I haven't had trouble flagging a waiter down.

They are open when other Indian restaurants are closed. I would love to try more Indian in the area, but this place seems the most convenient for us. The menu is very substantial and much clearer than other Indian menus, so you get to intelligently experiment. 

I have had the Murg Tikka Masala (what you get if you don't know what to order because you know it'll be great), the Murg Vindaloo (spicy but has more flavor variety and some potato), the Murg Lajwab (a mango ginger dish). Murg means Chicken, ya'll. All were great and I had enough to bring home leftovers. An entree is about 11-15 dollars. We always get the Garlic Naan, and it's only a couple bucks. 

Usually when I order something spiced ""hot"" the restaurant assumes I don't know what I want and they serve it much milder than I want (....this happens at every wings place I ever go to). Maharani will serve it HOT. So hot, that I may need to order it medium-hot next time. I just ordered a side of Raita (yogurt-cucumber condiment) to stop the burn.

They have a buffet 12-3 on Sundays that I intend to check out since I can't make their weekday lunch buffet. Nothing like an Indian buffet. Yum!",2017-08-03 05:35:59

I can blame my mom, growing up on meat and potatoes, I have no desire for it. With that being said, I had one of the most incredible dinners here to date. Starting with cocktails, I had to try the cucumber martini as this is one of my favorite drinks, but I'm very picky about the preparation, has to made with Hendrick's Gin, I'm not much of a vodka drinker, so I was hesitant to try this, but our server encouraged me to try it, made with Square One Cucumber Vodka, cucumber essence, lime, cane nectar, this was actually pretty good, but the next cocktail I tried is still haunting me in my dreams to this day, Heat of The Moment, made with Patron Silver, fresh lime and passion fruit, smoking hot fresno chiles and smoking peppers. Hands down best cocktail I've ever had. Ever. When you take a sip, the passion fruit comes together with the chiles to create a magnificent spicy and sweet drink. They have an amazing mixologist behind that bar. 

We started out with The Big Wedge Salad, I have a soft spot for this kind of salad, and it came out on separate plates without us even having to ask to split. I needed help ordering as I honestly have no idea about cuts of steak and what not. I went with the Tomahawk Ribeye only because it looked like so much fun. My date had the Brooklyn Filet, I had a bite and I liked this WAY better than my steak. Dang I hate when that happens. I learned that I prefer a filet over a ribeye (less fat and more clean tasting). Both were cooked to perfection. We shared a couple sides and the Baked Mac & Cheese stood out the most.

The atmosphere is fun, the restaurant is open to the casino, so you have a birds eye view of the tables, and we even got to see the Blue Man Group Parade come through. Service was impecable, our server Christie was very attentive. Will very well come back, and would send friends here on recommendation.",2013-03-08 04:10:49

This time, ordered the mushrooms, chili garlic chicken wings and regular poutine for the appetizers. Mushrooms were tiny for 13$. My boyfriend joked that the waiter maybe dropped 4/5 of the dish because there was like maybe 2 small mushrooms per person on the plate. Not worth 13$. Regular poutine is way smaller than the animal poutine. Would recommend animal style poutine over regular poutine. The chicken wings were the highlight and the redeeming aspect of the night. Love the limey-ness of the chicken wings. Bf was not a fan but then again he doesn't like sour stuff too much. 

Entree - ordered the flinstone shortrib for the four of us to share. Dry. Pig face I had last time was too oily but the ribs were too dry :(. Also wish they brought the free bread out earlier. Waiter tried to upsell us by saying we didn't order enough for the four of us. But in reality the ribs enough was way too much. 

Dessert - cream pot - I thought there was supposed to be popcorn with this. My friend loved this. I enjoyed the salty caramel on top.

General Tso was typical General Tso... neon colored, sweet chunks of chicken to tame the Chinese takeout desire. Again, at $10.50, it was on the high side. Not the best I've had, but not the worst.

Whoever does their casino marketing really needs to be fired ! There really is no reason to gamble your hard earned money away anymore , other than to get comped at their crappy restaurants & as it is , if you do wander  into their restaurants for whatever reason the prices are pretty cheap to begin with, so dropping some cash into their machines is kind of a moot point !  Before there were point multipliers during the week which you really didn't mind dropping a 100$ or so , because you were earning part of your money back in free play , points or could use them to buy beer , cigarettes or crap in the sorry ass gift shop ! But now the only point multipliers are on weekends , which as any local knows , you just stay away from the strip area if you can on fri, sat sun !! I play here out of habit , but like so many others I'm over it !! there are no familiar faces of my fellow locals anymore , it's basically just a rest stop for hookers and other malcontents during the week with the occasional tourist that got rooked into booking a room there!!

Every time I told them they missed something, they would go back over it and clean it properly.  The last time I took my car there, I was less than happy with the service I received.  Cleaning wheels thoroughly is a standard practice at any car wash or detail shop and being confrontational with a customer when confronted with the fact that the wheels were poorly cleaned does not sit well with me.  The other thing that does not sit well with me is the upselling of services I do not need.  I don't need you to replace my windshield, redo my tint, change my oil, or any maintenance service.  If I pay for a car wash, I expect just that and expect my wheels to be cleaned thoroughly!!!

Fast forward to last Thursday.  I went there because I needed to clean my car and it was the closest.  The first thing that set me off was the glass man trying to get me to replace my windshield by saying there was pitting on it.  He actually kept pressuring me to the point that I was one millimeter from letting him have it with both barrels.  I kept my composure and went inside to tend to the payment.  Lenora was a bright spot after nearly wanting to strangle the glass man.  She illustrated professionalism and customer service.  They did manage to get my car done fast but.........

When I got back home, I saw that my chrome wheels had a dull finish to them.  Upon closer inspection, one of the attendants dried my wheels with the same towel used to apply protectant.  The next morning, I went back and explained the issue (after taking pictures).  They agreed to rewash my car.

After the rewash, I checked my wheels and saw they were normal.  However, after an attendant got through, I saw the same protectant issue.  I immediately asked for the supervisor on duty.  This guy was the polar opposite of customer service.  When I relayed my concerns to him, he attributed it to the car not being dried off.  When he wiped, it still did not look right.   I went in and told Lenora about it and she got Mario, the manager on duty.  He went outside to look and verified my concerns.  Mario made sure that the wheels were cleaned thoroughly and told me to look him up when I am back.

I would have changed my review based on that, but thinking about the glass man is forcing me to keep it where it is.  My stance did not change.  Do not upsell me on windshields or oil changes.  Just wash my car and make sure my wheels/tires are done to my satisfaction!!!",2012-06-06 23:31:53

My loyal Yelping companion, the Samsung Fascinate was dying. Without warning I had to find a new Yelping companion. Best Buy was nearby.

  I am giving this Best Buy 2 stars because for smart phones Best Buy seems to be Worst Buy. This is a change from the Best Buy of nearly 2 years past, where smart phones were a good deal. Now back in Las Vegas, here are some comparisons I have made between Best Buy and Walmart. The Galaxy III is $148 at Walmart and $200 at Best Buy. The Motorola Droid X is $79 at Walmart and $148 at Best Buy. Buying the phone is $100 cheaper at Walmart. Screen protectors are approximately $8 at Walmart where they are approximately $20 at Best Buy. Best Buy is not the best buy.

  As far as purchasing the phone, sales Associate Michael was friendly. He did not overdo it with the Best Buy card. There was sufficient sales help on the floor. Best Buy could also improve the smart phone shopping experience with demos. 

  I give Best Buy an additional star for their 14 day warranty program. Believe me I will be using it when I exchange my new Yelping companion for one at Walmart pricing. Stay tuned for a future Best Buy review.",2012-11-05 20:00:18

We were greeted at the front door by a member of the staff who welcomed us and handed us a menu. We stood in line for about 10 minutes. 

As we stood in line we had the opportunity to review the menu. It has a lot of options for biscuit sandwiches, salads, grit bowls, and coffee. 

Once you get closer to the front you see a display with items that they are selling tshirts, mugs, dog treats. 

They had agua Fresca in a carafe for purchase right between the registers. They had two open cashiers which helped with the lines. Given that it's done through an iPad it wouldn't hurt if they added a third (at the beginning while this place is hot and wildly popular). They carried local kombucha and had cold brew on tap. 

I ordered the shaved Brussels sprouts salad (shaved Brussels, dried cranberries, apples, and pecorino cheese. I asked them to hold the cheese and add roasted chicken (it's an extra charge to add the protein). 

I also ordered a side biscuit. You get a choice of raspberry or blackberry jam. 

My husband ordered the smokin turkey club. It looked great. 

We ordered a little unconventional here - but we wanted to try the restaurant and still eat healthy. I love that it was possible here! 

The salad was good! I thought they went a little light on extra protein. Especially considering you have to pay extra for it. Also, I wish there as an extra crunch in the salad, like a toasted pecan or almond. Just a thought! 

The biscuit... was great!!! Large and fluffy with layers --- my favorite! 

There is a major focus on locally sourced ingredients. Everything tastes fresh. 

I liked that there was a decent sized seating area. The booths for up to 6 people which is really nice. 

There is a little bit of outdoor seating - but it was too cold to sit in it when we went. 

The decor is really sweet ... lots of sunshine yellow, white and wood. I felt bright and even though you were eating biscuits and fried chicken there was something fresh and happy about the space. Is that weird? Maybe -- but it really had a fresh new feel!!

It may have also been due to the fact that when you are in Vegas, with so many great places to eat, the curve works against you - it is like my freshman college bio class where 94% was a B+.

The highlight of our dinner was the trout almondine.  I am not a big fan of trout, but this one in particular was so tender and delicate that it was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had.  The sliced almonds provided a nice mellow nutty contrast to the trout.  It was one of those dishes that shine without having loud flavors but yet provide a soothing feel to the palate,

Saffron mussels were also decent, with nice creamy mussels.  We found the gnocchi was very doughy and bland - a definite pass.

Choose the meat- chicken, steak, barbacoa (naturally raised beef), carnitas (pork) or vegetarian. Choose the burrito, burrrito bowl, tacos or salad. I really liked my chicken salad. Romaine greens, topped with medium roasted chili-corn salsa, mild- pico de gallo, chipotle chicken, peppers & onions, corn, and shredded cheese and the side of chipotle-honey vinaigrette. There was so much flavor from both salsas and the peppers & onions, that I really didn't put too much additional salad dressing.

My husband got the carnitas burrito- he called it a two fister- it's huge, I would probably only eat half. He really enjoyed it. (He got steak the first time, but it was dry so he didn't like it.)

I recently reviewed Baja Fresh as possibly being my favorite Mexican chain restaurant, but I think that I like Chipotle better.

It was a really fun atmosphere. It was also cool to be able to see the chefs working in the kitchen, I always think that's fun. Our servers were awesome as well; our plates were always cleared super fast, and we never had a chance to finish our water before they brought more!

For an appetizer, we ordered the Confit Wings (#1). These were delicious! You could taste the duck fat, which I haven't had before, but I thought it was really good, and I loved the siracha sauce. For dinner my fiancé ordered the Spicy Seafood Hot Pot, which he really liked, but thought was hard to eat lol. Neither of us know what we're doing with chopsticks. I got the House Pad Thai with tofu, and that was really good as well! 

If I'm being honest, while we thought the food was really good, we didn't love it, but that's just because we haven't had a ton of authentic Asian food (even though they say they're Asian-inspired I felt like it was really authentic), so maybe it's just not our thing!

As recommended by other Yelpers, I tried their laksa (I chose the one with beef), a corned beef and egg sandwich, and their French toast cubes.

Laksa with beef - 3.5/5
Obviously you can't expect an authentic laksa dish, but it is a fairly tasty curry noodle soup. It was a bit strange how they mixed vermicelli and another kind of thick noodle. The curry soup was flavourful and I found it to have a bit of a spicy kick but still fairly mild. It also came with a few fried tofu puffs. Overall, a satisfying dish if you're craving a more flavourful soup noodle.

Corned beef and egg sandwich - 4/5
This is a pretty standard menu item at a cha Chan tang and they did a good job, but there's nothing outstanding about it. There was a good amount of egg and corned beef.

French toast cubes - 3/5
I was less impressed by this dish than other Yelpers. While it's a nice shareable dish, I thought there could have been a bit more condensed milk. I also like peanut butter in my Chinese style French, which these don't have.

SO GOOOOD. WE ordered their burger, it was ginormous but juicy in every bite. Also tried their meat platter, their salamis were yummy and i don't usually eat pickles, but i ate their pickles - also made in house. if you're ever in this neighbourhood it is definitely worth checking out! we had dessert there as well ans it's as good as it is described.

The fries was my first time trying them and I have to say they were pretty tasty. Loved the mayo dressing fries and the other one I cannot remember the name of the fries was pretty good as well. The pasta dish I had got was smoked salmon with Vodka. And I thought it tasted pretty good as well. 

A couple of concerns that I didn't really like about this place was where we sat. We sat in the booth where it simulated as if we were sitting on the floor. Also we needed to take off our shoes too. And even though there was pillows it still made sitting very uncomfortable, since the the space in there is small and its difficult to move in and out if someone is sitting on the inside.. Also it was right next to the entrance door so everytime when someone leaves or enters there is a huge gust of cold air coming in and you can really feel it against your feet.. 

Price for the pasta was a bit pricey in my opinion. Even though it tasted good, the portion is not worth the price. I devoured my dish in 5 mins when everyone else was still eating theirs and I had to pay $13 for mine.. I wish they would have given more pasta or something because for $13 its not really worth it.. And I was still hungry after that. 

Service was alright but I believe when you sit in those private booths alot of the times the waitress tend to forget that people and only remember you when the food is coming. It took 2-3 times to simply get hot water. Refills for water was a mission to do.. It got a bit annoying because they say they would come back and after a good 20 mins they still didn't return with the water... 

Overall, not a bad place, its quite hidden from Steeles. I would come back but for lunch instead of dinner. And plus it's CHEAPER for lunch and they give you a SOUP!! =D",2014-01-26 19:49:49

I had a house salad; great combination of greens. The salad itself is good but requires a request of extra dressing for me. In addition, I had the Pork Goyza and the two together were an ample meal.

They have two bar areas inside to enjoy your meal at as well and the establishment is first class from a decor aspect.

I would give it 4 stars but I take issue with the menu pricing; it is just noodles and rice in reality. I dine at many sushi bars and pay attention to pricing.

Overall, I had a great experience and would recommend this place to others visiting the Scottsdale Quarter. However, this is not a destination for me.  However, I will invibe if I am in the area.

I had already placed my order.  My plate of hummus and my yogurt soda was just arriving when I noticed the place was now packed, and a line of people was waiting for a table.

Two obviously out-of-town ladies sat at the table nearest me.  They used loud, awed, slightly bemused voices that hinted they were from the Midwest and had never been ""out West"" before.

""... couldn't BELIEVE the TRAFFIC!"" one was saying as they sat down.  ""We waited fifteen minutes on the street before we could even turn into the campus!""  ASU was having their Student Load-In week; traffic was hellish anywhere near the university.
""It was no better when we unloaded Nicole's things,"" the other woman said.  ""We were right in the middle of carrying in everything, and a security guard stopped us an told us we couldn't --""
""Would you like something to drink?"" the waiter asked, surprising them both.
They gave him their orders, after asking ""what kind of pop"" they had.  Definitely Midwestern.  The waiter walked away, and they continued staring at the menus as they assumed looks of deep confusion.
""What is ... shum ... shoe-marmy?""
""Shoe-arma?  Shuh, warma?""
""What IS that?""
""I have no idea.  But it comes in a sandwich.""
""Like, on bread?""
""It says on a pita.""
""Oh .... But isn't a pita a cracker?""
""What about ... baba gub .... Bana gaboosh?""
""Where?""  The friend pointed at the other's menu.  ""Oh my.  Bagga boo ... goosh?  Excuse me?  Sir?""  I realized she was talking to me.  ""Do you know what this is?""  She pointed at her menu.
""Baba gannouj,"" I said.  I kind of enjoyed the look of fear that crossed their faces, as though I were uttering a phrase that would summon a lesser demon.  ""It's eggplant dip, kind of lemony.  Kind of like hummus.  You dip pita into it.  It's great.""  As I spoke, I watched her eyes grow huge as she saw my glass of fizzy, thick white yogurt soda.
""I've never even HEARD of that!"" the other woman said.  ""What's this fluffoofal?""  
""Felafel,"" I said, and the fact that I avoided laughing then should earn me some kind of award.  ""They're fantastic here, lots of great spices ... have you had felafal before?""  
They hadn't, of course, and I was at a loss to explain it.  I decided the shwarma or the gyros were probably too ""exotic,"" so I recommended the chicken kebab pitas.  My koobideh plate arrived then, prompting another couple of baffled, wide-eyed stares.  I told them to be sure and get a couple pieces of baklava for dessert, since it's better, fresher, and half the price of anywhere else nearby.  They agreed, but I got the impression it was more due to the fact that they had heard of baklava before than my recommendation.

Judging by the yummy noises coming from their table as they ate, they enjoyed their kebabs.

I had to withhold a star, as much as I love Haji Baba, because it does not have the best shwarma I've found.  It's very, very good ... but not the best.",2009-08-25 19:32:04

There were open seats just that no one was in charge of cleaning things up. Weird. No utensils, no water, no one to take order after we were seated for 10 minutes. 

The service is terrible. Slow. Understaffed. Uncoordinated. Obviously they were overwhelmed by dim sum lovers on a weekend. I could see the waitresses felt awkward, too.  Seriously, someone needs to fix the system here.

Finally came the dims sum carts. We chose five different items. They were all pretty good. However, many dishes were not warm enough because being on the cart for too long. They also have pan-fried noodles on the cart, which is not typical, at least that is the first time I've seen noodles on a cart in my life. I would guess they are too cold for anyone to enjoy. 

Fear of kept waiting for even longer, we rushed to check out after having the first round of food. The owner explained to us that the slowness is due to the unexpected good business. I thought you should always be prepared when you run a restaurant. 

Overall, the dim sum was actually pretty good, but the dining experience is so underwhelming. I would give Viet Bistro another chance when it is not as busy, hope it will not let me down again. 

* on my first visit, I tried pho. It was okay, not as good as Saigon's. But if you crave for a noodle soup in central Madison, it is a passable place.

Food allergy reaction! Even with food being labeled as GF! They are not at all!
All food is contaminated with soy, gluten or wheat! Nothing is monitored or observed. The deep fryers are not maintained or treated safely. Anything goes.
Even with the GF options on the menu! They serve a person with allergies gluten and wheat!!! All wing sauces are not safe and we're only mentioned and checked properly after consumption and reaction!

After being rejected fries with gravy due to possible contamination, hot wings due to the hot sauce having soy, thr honey garlic sauce having wheat, the caeser salad which is labelled GF the croutons are not GF and we're not substituted, when requested half a toasted GF bun on the side to sub- was rejected! Claiming the kitchen was busy! (Mind you the bar was half filled) 
The very few options which should be gluten friendly are actually not. When finally settling for wings with honey garlic sauce, half way through i started to second guess the sauce, and had the server double check... guess what!?!? The sauce has WHEAT IN IT!!!  Long story short, after a lame apology from the manager, and taking of my wings and our friends which does nothing for me or my health...I sent back all my food and requested they take it off, since I felt sick and was no longer able to eat, my barely touched salad was still charged to the bill and had to be argued to have it removed...
If you have GF (gluten friendly)food on the menu then cater to it properly! TRAIN YOUR SERVERS, train your KITCHEN!   Have proper compensation! Food cannot make contact! And cannot share fryers with breaded items...

The only reason I left any stars for this place is because it's nice looking and we generally liked the atmosphere! But the food quality and their soggy salad was more then just disappointing!!!
The owners daughter tried accommodating in the beginning and later in the evening just seemed annoyed along with the servers and no longer seemed to care!
When a regular well paying client is unhappy and had a food reaction, no matter the severity mild
Or severe, you'd expect a little more then 'well what do you want us to do!?' We should not have had to argue and negotiate uneaten food to be removed.

People stand around with trays of food, searching for a table and once it's open, there are several folks waiting to grab your spot.

Well, I do anyway. And when I want that delicious meat, I go here. Not only do I get to eat a large variety of different meats, but they ALL taste delicious. Juicy, flavourful, melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

It is very important, although hard to remember sometimes, to leave a little bit of room for the cheese buns and a LARGE amount of room for the grilled pineapple. They come around a little later in the dinner and are just magnificent. If you are here on the weekends you will also get to try the fried banana's (also an important must-have) and see the live performances.

It's rather sad since we tend to have pretty decent weather, but oh well. I've been going to the District for years. I like it, but definitely don't love it. It's one of those places I go to ever so often, but somewhat forget about on most days.

(1) Shopping - The shopping is ok and they have one of the only two REI's in the city even though it is TINY compared to most that I've been to in other places. There are a few shops that are sort of nice, but mostly seems over priced and too wanna-be-pretentious. If I need to go to Ann Taylor or William Sonoma, I go here.

(2) Restaurants - For the most part the restaurants are half crap and half decent. You are stuck with crappy chains like Elephant Bar and PF Chang's, but then you have Balboa Pizza and King's Fish House. There are a few other options so anyone should be able to find SOMETHING to eat. I will say that if you go to the side with Whole Foods, Settebello is a hidden gem that I do frequent if I need something at Whole Foods or am just in the mood for a really good pizza.

(3) Parking - Luckily there is almost always parking.

(4) Casino - Like most cheesy Las Vegas places there is a casino. You'd think locals would get tired of them, but nope. Green Valley is ok if you like casinos, but I don't so I steer clear. It is a little nicer than others, but it's still a casino.

Sounds good to me but hope it will become like some of the large farmers' markets in CA with ""real"" choices of produce, meats and breads and less so for non edible items.  Isn't the objective of a farmers'  market embedded in the name? Where does it imply jewelry and tourist trinkets?

Spicy Beef-  Pretty spicy for my taste, doesn't come with enough beef but fiance loved it.

Seafood pot- was my favorite comes with a lot of clams, shrimp, crab, and some pork. 

Kimchi pot- comes with kim chi of course, hot dogs (asian hot pot staple, weird I know), and pork.  

I am usually a beef lover but their pork cooks better than their beef does.

Then, although this was probably enough food to provide a full meal for most diners, in order to be able to pen a more robust restaurant review I nevertheless moved on to an Orleans Clubhouse Sandwich.

The Orleans Clubhouse Sandwich here needs to be distinguished from its close cousin, the Chicken Clubhouse Sandwich, which is also on the menu.  My Orleans Club, packed with both ham and bacon, Smoked Gouda Cheese, lettuce, tomato, and some mayo, on lightly toasted bread, almost did me in.  Fresh and tasty as it was, it was comprised of four very large, toothpicked together sandwich sections.  At first I removed a toothpick to eat what I thought was a section, only to learn that I had not drilled down low enough, leaving a crucial part behind on the plate.  Once properly holding a complete sandwich section in my hand and after aiming it upward to bite down on with my teeth, I was barely able to get my mouth around the whole length.  It took awhile, but eventually I finished the entire sandwich, although I hardly needed to.  And it was very satisfying, served with good skin-on Fries and fresh strands of cabbage that joined together to fashion a cool Slaw.

A bowl of Oxtail Soup overflowing with big clumps of oxtail meat was ordered by my poker-playing friend visiting from Texas, and he pronounced it to be very tasty.  It quickly became clear to me that, even more than the Gumbo, the Oxtail Soup here is designed to furnish a complete solo meal.  I will keep this in mind when giving it a try myself in the future.

The brightened room has a nice new look, and faux leather seating was comfortable.  Service was good, except for slow bringing of food to the table after production of the Gumbo.  But, in fairness to the cooks and waitstaff, we were dining during the 12 o'clock lunch hour, and just about every seat in the room was occupied.

The house-baked sourdough bread and luscious local butter to start, followed by an organic Scottish salmon filet on a bed of the tastiest prepared kale I've ever had and a substance unknown to me called ""goat quark"" among other things were most pleasing.  On this, my third dining experience here, we finally saved room to split a dessert, and the light and creamy goat-cheese cheesecake, described by my friend as ""orgasmic"", made us glad we did - except maybe about the ""split"" part.  After the first bite I think we were coveting a full serving.  It was utterly, wonderfully different in texture and density, and a smooth delight in taste.  It would have been worth the journey in itself.
  The polished concrete floors and a several large dining parties made for a noisy dining room but not to the extent of being unpleasant. Service was good, as always.

I love their mango cooler drink (I'm pregnant and crave it-they make it with ginger ale for me due to a citrus allergy). I like that you can order smaller portions. The food is always consistent and the service good. If I have to eat at a chain I like this restaurant. 

Here's the thing though-My husband and I ate at this location approximately 3 weeks ago and what happened is still bugging me so I need to write a review. We were about 3/4 into our meal and I was watching the kitchen. I enjoy watching the kitchen, being a former server you see things other's miss. So here goes, I see a food runner pick up a pizza. She's older mid 40's probably with short grey hair and black glasses. As she is walking she looks at the pizza and picks something off of the pizza. I see a cheese string stretch from the item to its origins on the pizza (I did not know what it was I assumed it was paper or something). She takes a couple of steps and puts the item IN HER MOUTH. At this point I cannot see the woman's mouth but assume she swallowed it, I am watching her back like a hawk. She drops the pizza in front of a man on the other side of the restaurant. After a couple of sentences exchanged between the two I see her head toward us and i'm just staring at her slack jawed. She headed back into the kitchen and I see her grab a napkin and wipe the cheese grease off her offending food stealing hand. 

My husband looks at me concerned, he obviously believed I was going into early labor or something. I informed him of what happened and he just looked disgusted. We sign our check and leave. I WAS TRAUMATIZED, I had no idea what to do. I thought I had hallucinated.

It's located on the third floor of a building on Yonge Street (covered in scaffolding as of July 2016) between Dundas and Queen.  It's definitely not designed to get a ton of foot traffic.  However, its reputation must precede itself because there were a TON of garments waiting to be hemmed, taken in, and repaired both times that I visited.  Despite the seemingly insurmountable amount of work, my bridesmaids dress for my sisters upcoming wedding was done with time to spare.

This is my second time as a bridesmaid.  The first time I was in a wedding party, I had such a bad experience at another tailor that I was absolutely dreading the experience this time around and procrastinated dropping off my dress until the last minute.  The less-than magical tailor that I saw previously was an utter nightmare - the change area was tiny and awkward, and the service cost me almost as much as the dress did (well into the $100's).  When I showed up to pick up this first dress from this different tailor, they hadn't completed it, and told me to come back that evening with promises it would be complete (which didn't work into my schedule).  When I moved my life around to accommodate them, the dress didn't fit and they accused me of gaining weight.  WHAT?

Magic Tailor was basically the EXACT opposite of that experience.  As soon as I arrived, I was able to tuck into a sizeable change room, and was quickly pinned properly into my gown.  I was given a quote a promise of completion within slightly over a week.  When I showed up, there was my dress, waiting for me.  No wasted trips, no schedules to rearrange.  Despite being a considerably more complicated alteration than my first bridesmaid dress, the cost was a mere $65 and the dress fits perfectly!  I know the bride is supposed to be the most stunning person at a wedding, but I can't help but appreciate how stunning I feel in a well-fitted gown.

The place has a modern, bright decor with a touch of old world- similar to his other restaurants.  It's a nice meshing of both styles. Their booths are pretty comfy too! 

The service was slightly slow for lunch hour with plenty of bread to fill the time between ordering and receiving our food.  But, not as bad as some other places on East 4th. The olive oil that they serve is ridiculously fragrant and tasty with the seasoning salt! 

One of the best pasta dishes, I have ever tasted is the col boco with shredded pork in a tomato broth.  Pasta was perfectly al dente and absorbed the flavors of the tomato sauce.  The pork was tender and scrumptious, adding to the dynamics of the col boco.  The tomato sauce is a bit more liquid and thin, like a nice warm tomato soup, but 1000x times tastier.  I can't wait to have another trip there to get the col boco!! The light grating of fresh Parmesan just pushes the dish over the top and it's a wonderful explosion of deliciousness.  It reminds me of warm comfort food that you would want to eat on a chilly Fall day or when you don't feel well.

The only downfall to the dish is that it's slightly pricey for the portion that you get.  It's definitely filling, but you can spend a good chunk of change just for lunch.",2012-06-10 17:15:19

We were in the Link with my family and some relatives from out of town. We normally go to Margaritaville, but decided to do something different. Flour & Barley looked like a cool place and it had no wait. We went in sat down, our server seemed to be new, he did not know everything and seemed very unsure of himself. As this was our first visit, we asked a lot of questions and he answered them but very nervously. We ordered and when my mother-in-law ordered her meal she ordered their meatball app AND a pizza. She was on the opposite end of the table and it was louder inside. So I even repeated her order to him to make sure he got it. When all the food came out her pizza did not come out. We told him and proceeded to argue with us and even showed me his pad to prove he did not write it down. He did rush another one out, but was pretty steadfast that it was our mistake and he could not have possibly messed up because he did not write it down. When all the food finally came out the pizza was largely disappointing. We had actually had pizza earlier in the week from another place off strip, and it was worlds better. I got their farm pizza (which comes with egg), but I am super anti-runny eggs so I asked him to cook it on the side to make sure it was not runny. They did, but they cooked it over medium (guess what) it was RUNNY!. I know that is a particular request and is different than they normally serve, but when I specifically ask for not runny eggs and they bring them to me totally runny, I have a serious issue. With all of that said, when walking through The Link and thinking hey I want good pizza, I would recommend you not visit this place, unless it is the only one with out a long wait. The service was not that great, and neither was the food. I know we won't be back.",2016-10-19 21:07:55

I was a little monster.  I there was no such thing as video games, TV was a privilege and the outdoors was my toy.  That was a long time ago (but not THAT long) in a land far, far away.  Here in Vegas, my kids have to deal with possibly melting in the summer heat or getting blown away in a winter wind storm.  So what do you do when your kids are bouncing off walls and you'd rather stick nine inch nails through each one of your eyelids than deal with them?  Bring them to Run Plus Fun.

I first heard of this place sometime last year and finally gave it a shot in March of 2011.  Honestly, it was the negative Yelp reviews that really held me back.  That is just unfortunate because my kids absolutely LOVE this place and have been back about 4 times for open play.  At $8 a kid, it's not as cheap as the park, but it sure beats a movie.  

The slides are ridiculously fun.  There are three big ones and another two in the main play area.  Just be careful because they are FAST; though I think the adults are more afraid than the kids are.  

I love that, in addition to the main play area, there is a little kids' area, boxed in by some comfy sofas, where parents can hang out.  Why any parent would rather sit than romp around is beyond me.  I love climbing up and crawling through the obstacles just as much as my 2 yr old does.  

After a handful of visits, I thought it would be a great idea to have my kid's birthday party here.  For a fee, you get an hour of play time and an hour of eating.  Some reviewers mentioned that they didn't like the policy of kids not being able to re-enter the play area after their allotted time.  If you want to see what half-digested food looks like, have your kid run, tumble and go down some slides after eating cake and snacks.  Yum-o!  As it is in life, you've got to pay to play.  I booked two slots back-to-back to avoid that very situation and to make sure that all the kids had a lot of time to play.  The owners were very accommodating, giving us all the invitations and envelopes, having a bouncy house put up, gave us access to both party rooms, helped us set up and break down, and even helped entertain some of the children.  It party went flawlessly and all the kids were so hungry and tired after 2 hours of playing, very few of them wanted to go back to play.  

When I was five, I was a monster.  I needed to get out of the house to expend my energy.  My kids are angels (sometimes), but they still need an outlet.  Run Plus Fun has my vote and my money for a good time to be had for angels and monsters, alike.",2011-06-16 17:17:29

I guess the owners extended the restaurant to the adjacent space as the establishment appears to be bigger than the last time I was here.  I like the addition of long dining tables because it makes it easier to cook and eat at the same time for those with large groups.  Don't get me wrong, I prefer the old setting with circular grills but they're relatively uncomfortable for bigger parties.

Used to frequent at this joint for their AYCE deal.  Since we came a little after 0600 in the morning, we had to order a la carte as AYCE is only served till 2200.  They do, however, offer a large selection of combinations that'll easily serve 3-4 people so it was like we were actually having AYCE.  We opted for the mushroom and beef bulgogi hotpot which was quite delicious but found it rather sweet due to the marinade.  At least our server brought out few condiments to make it spicier: jalapeños, chili sauce and ground red pepper.  First time having ground pepper and I have to say, it certainly brings the dish to a different level.  In fact, I can probably add it to everything and it'll make it better.

Contrary to what everyone claims, customer service was superb!  Perhaps, it could have been just Becky as I've had other incidents in the past when service was lackluster.  I like how she kept refilling our banchans without us even asking for more.  I also appreciate her effort to hold conversations with us despite of the language barrier.

We quickly looked over the menu and figured out what to order, though we got some help from our server. We decided to order a pizza and scodellinas to share as we weren't too famished. The server helped us what to pick for our scodellinas (we decided to get 5) and explained to us how it worked as well. Essentially, they were spreads that we ate on crispy bread (crostini?).

We got: White gold ricotta, Gorgonzola dolce, Prosciutto di parma, Salt roasted golden beets, and roasted eggplant. All of the spreads seemed so delicious that we had some trouble choosing - we ended up getting some recommendations from our server as well to make life easier.

All of the spreads were really delicious and I personally thought that scodellinis were a great idea! I wished more restaurants offered them as a menu. Each spread was unique and creative, and they were all very flavourful. With the crispy bread, it was the perfect dish. I highly recommend you try them - it would be great to share among friends and family, or even enjoy them all on your own depending on your preferences!

As for our pizza, we decided to try the prosciutto pizza which doesn't seem like it's on the current menu anymore, though you can add prosciutto as an extra topping to your pizza. Hubby and I both love having arugula on our pizza (our love for it starts here) and paired with prosciutto, it was just lovely. The pizza dough itself wasn't too thick or thin to our liking, and overall it was a great pizza that we would love to order again when we visit Cibo next time.
Verdict

Overall, our light dinner at Cibo was very delightful. We sat by the window and had lots of help from our server who constantly checked on us. As we had our dinner quite early, the restaurant was still rather empty but I would imagine Cibo getting very busy in the evenings! It seems pretty popular Opentable as well, as it tells me that it's been booked 40 times today at time of my search.

The casual restaurant definitely is a great place for lunch or dinner, or even for happy hour. They have a great bar as well which is great for those who love to enjoy some sports TV or a drink or two.

I highly recommend the restaurant for a casual night out with your family, friends, significant other, or even by yourself if you're in the mood.",2016-07-21 06:54:27

I looked at their website and it seemed like they had a good selection in my price range.  I decided to call and talk with someone about the order.  I was placed on hold for nearly 10 minutes and finally hung up.  This should have been my first clue.  I received a call back a few minutes later and spoke with a young woman (owner's daughter?) who seemed quite unsure.  She eventually put me on hold and then speakerphone to talk with the owner about my order.  I explained I was ordering on behalf of a group with a budget and our desire was for a full bouquet of fresh flowers.  She assured me she would be able to provide a nice arrangement.  The young woman then completed the order and told me I would receive a copy of my invoice by email with a few days (it never arrived).

I was present for the viewing and was shocked that the flowers had not been delivered.  They finally arrived just minutes before the funeral service started.

The facility is huge and includes a 5000 square foot main trampoline, separate jump areas based on age, 2 dodgeball courts, party areas, a snack bar, a foam pit, and a ton more... Luckily, there were a handful of staff members working, but none of them were supervising the kids, so make sure you have a 1:1 adult to kid ratio if your kid(s) are at the age where they need supervision.  

While the party had our own area blocked off, there was another party going on in the same area, so it was a tad bit chaotic, but a blast for the kids.  They brought in NYPD Pizza and I'm pretty sure the hostess brought in her own fruit, veggies, cake and goodie bags.

Shoyu Ramen - Noodles were right texture and taste. Very enjoyable. Lots of pork egg, and other bits combined with the right quantity and not too much fat at all on the pork.  The egg must have been cooked in shoyu as it was a bit dark colored. Nice presentation.  The broth was a bit simple, not too many flavors at all, however, for my kids, this is the preferred method.  We asked for smaller bowls to share so i spiced mine up a bit.

Chicken Wings - Really not wings, but seemed to be more like chicken kara-age. The waitress told us it was boneless, and it was, however, perhaps it should be just marketed as fried chicken instead. Overall, nice taste, light, crispy and with two sauces.

Sliders - Small little burgers that seemed to be lightly marinated in teriyaki.  The patty is about size of a flattened golf ball with tomato, lettuce on what looks to be a toasted King's Hawaiian Sweet Roll. It is about 3 inches round and about 4 inches tall, nicely kept together with a bamboo type of skewer.  Excellent taste, very light and very cool presentation.  WE had four sliders which was perfect for our family of four. I do not know if it always comes to four per plate or not, so you may want to check.

Chicken Teriyaki - We also shared a plate of Chicken Teriyaki and rice. Comes with a heaping scoop of macaroni salad, nice portion of lean chicken lightly covered in teriyaki sauce, two sushi rolls, and rice.  I did not get to notice the type of sushi roll it was, as one of my kids was quick to abscond with them and scarf them down. it was perhaps a california roll with the sesame seed on outside?

California Roll - Comes 6 to an order and was very nice. Not too strong on the vinegar taste of the rice. It was pretty good. I am not a huge Western Sushi eater, meaning I eat it when we have it, but will generally order typical Nigiri, Chirashi, or Inari Sushi.  Everyone liked it and it was devoured quickly!

Honey Toast Ice Cream - We were not really ready to order any dessert, however, the waitress mentioned it was a real popular dish. This is like french toast with ice Cream drizzled in Honey. It was an odd thing tio think about, yet the presentation was awesome and the taste subtle and flavorful

Overall - To me, in a way, coming here is like a guilty pleasure.  While not the best in any one thing, it is very good in presentation. I believe that Monta has more traditional and flavorful Ramen, however, when you combine pretty good food, with great service, and wonderful decor, it all combines to be a really fun experience.  When I was here, there was a strong overwhelming amount of single men coming here vs. family and couples. Perhaps anime waitresses is the key?  Hmmmm......

No, its not your typical style fare that comes with beans and rice (only two breakfast plates do). The food here is good and full of flavor, but not the same flavor you're used to if you were brought up eating Mexican food. For example the huevos rancheros come with two small quesadillas, usually a treat, but the problem lies in that they used small flour tortillas for the quesadillas instead if crispy thin toasted corn tortillas. What you get is two think flour patties with melted cheese.  Where they get it right is with their chorizo and beans.

We ordered kimchi fried rice, kimchi omelette, avacado and tofu salad. The prices are a little higher than I expected, but still within reasonable grounds. I personally liked the kimchi fried rice the best, served in a hot skillet, and the kimchi omelette would come second. The portions are very fair. The sauce on the avacado/tofu salad was a little to sour for me or overwhelming for that matter, and it had too much cabbage for my liking, but then again... that's personal preference, right? But would I order the salad again? Probably not...

Service was fairly prompt, though we had a bit of trouble understanding our waitress. Didn't have to wait considering we visited here around 1PM. I would say seating is fairly comfortable, and the restaurant is neatly decorated. 

The only complaint I have about this place is paying with credit card, you'll ONLY have the option of paying 15%-20%, nothing less. At first I thought I had missed the option, but nope.. there is no ""other option"" for you to select.  So if you plan on paying anything less than 15% or more than 20%, be prepared to bring cash.

So I thought I would send my review into Sundance and rather than just be apologetic, they sent me a rude email.  I am tired of chain businesses thinking they can do anything they want.  I am not asking for anything, please see excerpts below:

Bathrooms: We do try our best to keep them nice and tidy. Ushers are required to check them as often as possible. When you were attending our theatre our 11 am shows were letting out (300 attendees) and our 2 pm shows were letting in (700 attendees). With that many bodies moving through it sounds like we did not do our job to keep them clean. I have contacted my ENTIRE staff about this reminding them how important it is to keep them clean. I also plan on scheduling more ushers earlier in the day on weekends to avoid this situation in the future.

Seating Issues: The usher who you contacted did not handle the situation correctly. They should have moved the offending party out of your assigned seats. I have again contacted my staff reminding them that this is THEIR JOB to handle, not yours. Our reserved seating only works when people don't cheat and sit in someone else's seats. It is our job to police this so that you can enjoy your film. 

This was there response.  OH WELL!  Our usher messed up and the bathrooms are messy.  It is what it is.  What is the service fee for if the bathrooms were disgusting?  If you know you are offering  movies where 1000 people will be at your theater, then please make sure the bathrooms are clean.  Merijoy was the person who responded to me.  She said she took this seriously but blamed everyone else.  She never once apologized for my terrible experience.  The review has FALLEN to ONE star.

_____________________________________________

This was my first time at Sundance Cinemas and I could not be more disappointed.  I will admit that I tend to go to matinee movies to save money.  I chose Sundance because of the movie time and it was only $7.50 to see the Hobbit.  However, when you get there it is a COMPLETE bait and switch!  They charge you an additional service fee making your ticket $9!  Wow.  So much for a deal!

After paying $9, I walked in and was impressed by the look of the theater.  Cozy, warm, inviting.  I would have loved to sample the food but the line was well beyond the ropes and completely unacceptable.  I get there are lines, but there was only ONE food counter that I could see.  

I did run to the bathroom before the movie started.  I went to a 2:20 movie.  You would think the bathrooms would not be that dirty.  The day just started a few hours ago.  Wet paper towels all over the floor, water soaked every surface, clogged toilets.  They are lucky I did not bring my phone.  Pictures would be attached to this review.  

A unique feature of this theater is the ability to reserve seats.  Our seat was printed on our ticket.  Apparently, that kind of does not matter.  Someone was in our seat, we asked the usher what to do.  There were not many other places to sit and we did not want to disturb people as previews had started.  She explained it did not make that big of a deal.  So we found some seats near our other assigned seats.  After the movie started a group came in asking us to move.  I explained to them our situation.  So instead of finding other seats, they sent the usher in to speak to us.  The same usher we spoke to.  I explained it again.  They did not ask us to move but we did miss the first five minutes of The Hobbit.  Have you seen that movie?  Apparently the first five minutes sets the whole tone.  The usher did not handle the situation and the group stood and TALKED through the next ten minutes of the movie.  If you are going to have a reserved seating situation, please adhere to it.  It could be a good thing, especially for midnight movies.

I do not think Sundance is worthy of any special notice.",2013-01-13 01:40:37

It just seemed odd to me because Target, Walmart and other stores just credit the purchase back to the c.c. without the c.c. having to be present.

We started with the poutine to share - fries, curds and chicken gravy.  It was piping hot and satisfying.  For mains, I had considered the Lobster Roll ($16) but ordered the Chicken Pot Pie ($16) after seeing it arrive to several tables around us.  We also ordered the Flatiron Steak ($23), Whitefish and Shrimp Cake ($15), and the Boneless Back Rib Burger ($15).  

Food arrived hot and fresh.  The pot pie was a soothing warm entree with a lovely flakey top.  The steak was grilled to perfection and the rib burger had a nice smokey flavour.  The whitefish cake was a bit on the saltier side and possibly the weakest of the entree choices.  We also ordered a few glasses of wine all priced between $10-$14.

And then came dessert - butter tart, s'mores pie and sour cream doughnuts ($8/each).  The s'mores pie was amazing with the butter tart coming in at a close second.  I wasn't too keen about the sour cream doughnuts but that didn't stop me from shoving it down my gullet too.  This gave me a serious case of the dessert sweats.

Service was friendly and attentive.  We loved the decor of the room but it was a bit loud in there with tables placed quite closely together.

The portions were rather large so it was still worth the money. 

The BF and I started off with their hummus appetizer. Their bowl of hummus is the biggest serving I've ordered and decent, but needed a little bit more salt/seasoning. The pita served with is was alright, you need to eat it fast as cold it was a tad chewy.

The flavor was nice on this dish, it was a bit sweet and savory and the chicken was tender. They had other Persian stews that looked good as well, something you don't really see on many menus so worth trying and checking out if you like to try something new.

Koobideh (Lula/ Luleh, I believe about $12) Kebab here was really great here! Very juicy and deliciously spiced. I haven't had a good koobideh in a while so I tore into this.

I've been really impressed with the great deals the still-trendy (despite being open about 4 years) restaurant and bar offers. Not to mention, the space boasts private karaoke rooms, which makes it stand out that much more.

Every day, from 4-7 p.m., all appetizers, house maki, sake bombers, specialty drinks, seasonal wine and sake infusions are half-off. That's a TON of menu items!

Definitely check out the specialty drinks. There are so many to choose from, and they all tend to be very strong. The last time I went there, I started off with the cutely named Kinky Kooler (usually $9, at happy hour $4.50). It was sooo strong, with Bacardi Dragonberry mixed with fresh kiwi and lime juices and garnished with kiwi, my favorite fruit. It was too strong for me (I'm sort of a wimp when it comes to alcohol), but if you like kiwi, it's an obvious choice.

I tried my friend's Turning Japanese (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which I liked a lot more. It had a very refreshing taste to it, with Stoli Gala Applik, Peach Schnapps and organic apple, pear and lime juices and was garnished with pear slices. I'm sure it was still strong, but the sweetness balanced it out perfectly.

I also had the Hello Kitty (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which you just can't go wrong with. It's a pretty pink cocktail with Skyy Citrus and Japanese strawberry soda and fruit-infused sake, garnished with a strawberry. It tastes delicious, and how could you not order something with as cool a name as that?

I've also had Geisha's sushi before, which I thought was delicious. And you can enjoy all the cheap eats and drinks in a vibrant atmosphere, both for the high-energy ambiance and people who go there. It's your typical Old Town Scottsdale, pretty people crowd, and the bar is bright green with giant pictures of musical icons, connected to a cool patio.

Started off in the young kids area. The girls all enjoyed the small- to mid-sized slides and 2-ft pool.  Always have some kids who misbehave and whose parents aren't around.  They were not common though, so won't hold Big surf responsible for a few bad eggs.  

We did inherit a little girl who jumped on one of our rafts, followed by her grandma yelling ""It's okay"" to our group. Chose not to tell her that would be our call as she seemed like a nice (albeit bored) kid.  We sent her back after about 30 minutes of playing as it was pizza time. 

Staff was very attentive at the birthday party.  Afterward, the girls worked their way up to the taller slides.  Despite some fear, the kiddos all got in rafts and did at least one tall ride. Lifeguards and other visitors were very nice with the girls showing some trepidation.  They helped make the day a success.

Then, it was on to the wave pool, which is a congested cluster of people waiting for occasional big waves.  We hung out near the ""shore"" as so many people were bouncing into each other and because our six year-olds are only okay swimmers.  Saw a concussion. Had two people with rafts ride waves into us.  And had to tell some kids not to be so rough around little ones.  Still, the girls all had a blast and didn't want to leave when the whistle blew. 

Yay!  We'll have to go, again.",2014-07-20 01:35:31

There is a huge problem though with this place, it tries to be both a vegetarian and 'American' restaurant at the same time. What i mean by that, is that they try to be vegetarian and 'American', by trying to serve meat dishes. I really don't think this works well.

This is probably one of the few places you can get authentic Indian desserts that are freshly prepared. I guess that makes this place pretty cool in my books. Nothing beats the stuff you can get in LA (Artesia, on Pioneer Blvd). However, for Phoenix, this is probably the best stuff.

The veggie and meat dishes? Well, they aren't too bad, its a little pricey but still good value. I tried one dish, and it was just TOO spicy, even for my Indian mouth, and it was just FULL of jalapenos.

The service is also weird. I've gotten desserts from them a few times, and they charge by the pound. Sketchy stuff going on during the weighing and stuff, I'll leave it at that. Don't fall for the owners trick of 'remembering' you.

Cleanliness wasn't up to par though, our seat had ketchup splattered all over the seat cushions, against the wall and on the carpet. Thank god I didn't sit down or else I'd have ketchup all over. When I brought this to our servers attention they wiped down the seat cushions and the wall using plain napkins but they didnt wipe the ketchup under our table on the carpet. So I placed plain napkins on the carpet for them so we don't ruin our shoes. 
I'd expect the server to seat us at a different table instead of wiping the ketchup off leaving sticky residue behind for us to sit on. Plus I never got the Caeser salad that I paid for...
Sadly I doubt we'll return to this location based on staff judgment and training protocol.
The 3 stars are for the chef and sous chefs in the kitchen who cooked a fantastic meal! 
We ordered the Boston peach ice tea(way too sweet), shrimp potstickers were tangy, sweet chilli shrimp (tasted like Cajun), the dragon shrimp was flavourful, the ultimate feast is well worth it (loved the crab legs!

Dessert: key lime pie wasn't good, strawberry cheesecake was your regular cheesecake.

Didn't know there was a BBQ skewer restaurant place in Mississauga - this place is pretty good and it satisfied my skewer cravings! The place is tucked in a corner beside the LA boil in the China Town in Mississauga. 

The skewers were very flavourful - the sauce/spice used to cook all of the skewers is very cumin heavy and they use the spice for everything even the vegetables. I really liked the sauce/spice so I didn't mind. I liked how the skewers weren't the wooden kind - they were stainless steel I believe. Just be really careful when eating and be sure not to poke anyone with the skewers.. the ends can do some damage. I HIGHLY recommend the grilled squid and the beef skewers - they have two spice options for the beef - both are amazing! My friends and I kept ordering these.

One word to describe Vosges Haut-Chocolat: ""EXOTIC""

The place was so bright, beautiful and organized.  I was a little intimidated when I walked in.  The price wasn't too bad.  $7.50 for each of the 3 oz candy bar. Buy 5 and you get 1 free.  I took advantage of the offer and bought the followings: dark bacon bar, milk bacon bar, dominican dark, black salt caramel, habana and blood orange.  The chocolate itself was good but I wasn't too fond of the flavors.

I asked if they had the samples for black pearl exotic candy bar since it had wasabi in it.  The girl said that was actually one of the samples for the day.  I sampled all 3 available samples and decided not to get any of them.  The naga (sweet indian curry, coconut & milk chocolate) had a very strong curry taste.  I eat my curry with rice, not with my chocolate.  Black pearl tasted very different.  I guess Iike my wasabi with sushi.  The last sample was toffee (weird tasting) and I didn't like that one either.

Katrina, the owner of Vosges, loves to travel and she reflects that in her chocolates.  She is obsessed with bacon!!  I saw bacon candy bar, pig shape bacon chocolate and even bacon pancake mix.  Yum!!

The girl also offered us individual truffle samples after we bought 6 candy bars.  She asked if I was willing to try the exotic flavor and I said yes.  I kinda regretting saying yes when she said the sample was balsamic vinegar.  Yuck!!  I was wrong..I didn't know I would enjoy balsamic vinegar chocolate.

Balsamic Vinegar chocolate: My first reaction was ok...this is weird.  It's sour and tasted like vinegar but wait it's actually kinda yummy after I chewed the whole thing.  I wanted more.  4 stars!!

I got the catalog and kicking myself for not getting the rose truffle and champagne truffle.  Oh well, maybe next time.

On the one side is an old school british pub with varied seating, lots of chairs and friendly servers. A small corridor connects to the Bamboo Tiki Lounge, which is a lounge/dance bar. 

Two bars, two atmospheres, two layouts, the works. Throw in a beautiful, young, trendy crowd at night and it seems like the ideal place to be. There's a little bit of everything, so you don't have to decide and can entice your whole group into coming.

But the music is really loud, which makes it hard to listen. It gets super busy on Tuesdays for dub at the pub, and you have to pay cover to listen to a DJ at a bar. The sound system is so-so, but the food is good. The drink specials are great and much appreciated.

The thing is, while much of the youthful and trendy crowd is friendly and fresh, they're also really young. The night-time crowd often seems to be under-20 (during the day and evening there are plenty of business people and locals, just at night). They're also super trendy. It is really see and be seen.

This is a nice light app to start with. 

For my main I got the Fettuccini carbonara. As all the pastas do, it came in a small and dinner portion size. I got the dinner size and found it to be a proper portion - not overwhelming.

Really cool ambiance with communal seating and casual style service. Definitely worth checking out for the experience, however I wasn't particularly blown away by the food, and that's a little disappointing considering I do love sausages! 

Just a heads up - Wvrst ONLY has sausages and fries. 

We all ordered our sausages in a bun. They've got GREAT fresh buns!

Oktoberfest - nothing special
Duck foie gras - tasty but nothing spectacular, lacks that nice chewy bite you look for in sausage texture 
Kangaroo - had to try this unique offering. It was a very lean meat for a sausage, and therefore not as juicy, and texture more chewy than an average sausage. Seasoning was subtle and the meat's flavour came through a little gamey.  It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again. 
Wild boar and mushroom - hands down the best sausage. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Super flavourful and juicy. 

AMAZING fries with the dips they have available. However, I do NOT recommend the dirty fries. They're smothered in A LOT of sweet sauce. They have way too much flavour and fries were way too soggy because of the sauce. If sweet and soggy is your flavour, then by all means! 

Wvrst also has an enormous selection of beers and an interest offering of ice-cream for dessert with duck fat bits that I did not get to try.

Props to my friend for booking a 6pm reservation well in advance. This location is in D.C. Ranch, and it was easiest to find parking behind the restaurant in the Safeway parking lot. As I walked up, there was a cute photo booth set up, and a table with a quick bar that served margaritas for the happy hour crowd. Our party made it a point to get there a little earlier to be seated to take advantage of ordering drinks at happy hour prices. We also ordered queso, and guacamole for the entire table to share. Both the queso and guac with chips were very tasty. I ordered the Strawberry Coladarita, and although it looked amazing, it tasted more like a smoothie to me, with very little alcohol :( I ordered a two combo plate of a cheese enchilada and a beef enchilada- they got my order wrong and initially brought out two beef enchiladas first. After I corrected them, they brought out my correct order 5 minutes later. The red enchilada sauce unfortunately tasted very much like what you'd get straight out of a can. My friend who ordered the mahi street tacos requested to have her tacos heated up again because she mentioned they were cold. Another friend who ordered the shrimp tacos raved about her plate- there was a generous amount of shrimp in the tortillas. The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual and great for a small crowd. There was an acoustic musician who sang live, although his music choices were interesting for Cinco de Mayo (would have thought they would have played mariachi music to be more festive)  There is also outdoor seating under misters along the patio.

My experience at Nuit Social was very pleasant. I came in to celebrate my best friend's birthday and we were not disappointed. We thoroughly enjoyed the meats, olives and cheese that we chose for our charcuterie board. The cheese that we chose was the Vermeer. It was light and delicate in taste which was perfect for us, considering how we are not fans of strong cheeses. We also enjoyed the smoky flavours of the Fire olives. As for other dishes, we ordered the risotto gnocchi and crispy calamari. We loved the risotto gnocchi - it was perfectly deep fried and was quite filling. As for the crispy calamari, I would say that it is the best fried calamari that I've had so far, hands down. The crispy calamari was more generous that we expected. It had a nice lightly deep fried texture on the outside and was a soft and flavourful on the inside. For me, the one thing that makes or breaks calamari is whether or not it is the perfect texture (i.e. not rubbery) and the calamari that I had was perfection. 

Service was friendly and attentive. The food came out really fast and I appreciate the fact that the servers whisked away your dish relatively quickly and replace it with a new dish almost immediately.

Service was also very attentive and friendly, so no complaints here.  Just remember that this isn't Bar Marco, so the bartender isn't going to concoct a different cocktail each time.  They're more than happy to provide suggestions, but they do have the menu of cocktails for a reason.",2014-06-18 21:05:38

location 4/5  located at a very busy corner or the PATH system, where richmond st tunnel/path meets with the york st tunnel/path.hopefully paves way for lots of visitors..

the place 3.5/5 It is a coffee shop with a modern attempt to incorporate some rustic pieces, such as the steel/iron bar chairs as well as barn board/beam wood pieces throughout. there are places to sit, although it feels a little too spacious to be cozy inside, and there is definitely not enough inside to keep your eyes occupied, and you end up staring at the disgusting rundown path hallway.

price 3/5 The coffee is definitely at the higher midpoint of the coffee chain hierarchy, close to starbucks prices and possibly even dinneen coffee co. 

I got a small latte, and have also tried other latte options, such as almond, and have also ordered americanos and espresso.

 The coffee 3/5.. taste is quite strong, and it seems like the coffee is of good quality, noting the oil in the drink as a sign of fresh and decent coffee. nonetheless, I cannot say that the taste is as complex as at dineen. 

service 4/5 nice servers. 

overall I enjoyed the spirit of the place, as it is a step in the right direction to revitalize that area of the PATH, but the place itself needs so work in terms of its interior and potentially a re-working of its pricing, because that area of the path will not have a high traffic area of the ""bay street"" high earner types that this place is catering too.

Kultura has all the elements that I like in a restaurant - to start it is a beautiful two level space, high ceilings, beautiful backdrop, furniture and layout.  We went for Winterlicious and I was impressed with the service and the food.

So on to the food - it's the food that I aspire to cooking - combining the yummiest elements of different cultures and pushing food forward.  To start we had the truffled Naan bread and chicken samosa with a really yummy sauce.  

The main was the best fusion combination for a flat iron steak I've ever had - miso flavoured with butternut squash musturda, okra tempura and honey glazed rutabaga.  I was blown away by the creativity and how all the flavours really worked.  As for the steak quality we both agreed that it was way too chewy (not in a good way) so probably not the best cut.  (Niagara Street cafe wins for my fav aged flat iron steak)

The dessert was also so creative - espresso brule with white chocolate cream (didnt look like a creme brulee at all but tasted delicious) and an chocolate torte with apple cider ice cream (i devoured the ice cream, but the chocolate cake was way too thick for my liking)

For $35, this was well worth it!  I have my qualms about $9 coors light and $12 house wines at the bar but maybe this is just a toronto price I have to accept.

Hung Fook Tong is definitely one of the many places to change it up if you're getting bored of your standard dessert places.  

My favourite dishes are the coconut-black rice pudding, steamed custard, and steamed egg whites.  From time to time you will find a discrepancy in their custard, i.e. sometime's it is steamed so ""old"" that it's not creamy and you feel like you're spooning into an elderly person's face.  But at other times, it is as smooth as a baby's bottom and it just keeps you wanting more!  Their black sesame glutinous rice balls in taro sweet soup is also a must-try.  I love coming here because Chinese desserts are generally lighter and you don't come out feeling like you've just inhaled 5 lbs. of really heavy whip cream.

Cheap and delicious, with arguably the best curry I've ever tasted (and I've been to Thailand). THIS IS THE BRANCH TO GO TO-- DO NOT GO TO THE ONE ON FORT APACHE. While the one on Fort Apache is the same owner, it's not the same chef and the food DOES NOT taste the same. This is the original branch and the cooking is SUPERIOR.

This is a hole in the wall Thai restaurant that's authentic to the point you can see a Thai grandma in the kitchen whipping up your dishes. Everything is so frigging cheap ($5-7 a plate) so I recommend you come with friends so you can eat family style and try a little bit of everything. 

The interior of the restaurant is ghetto, so ghetto that I have to warn people ahead of time and assure them that the food is worth it. This is a place you come strictly for flavor.

Things to order:
Duck curry - slices of duck in a red curry served with a side of white rice. Delicious. Amazing. This dish makes me so sad I live in Los Angeles. The curry is rich and flavorful, the slices of duck are juicy and tender, and it all just melts so well in your mouth. It's a mouthgasm.

The pineapple fried rice- HUGE chunks of pineapple and whatever meat you choose (I like chicken with this dish). It's prepared correctly in that the rice isn't dry. This dish has nuts in it so if you're allergic, beware.

The pad see ew - It's a bit sweeter here than in other places, but I prefer that. I choose beef. Once again, it's done well.

The pad thai - Delicious.

Get my drift? Parking is plentiful, and the service is just fine (cute thai ladies who can't speak English well)

Well, we originally decided on a different restaurant, but last minute I had a hunch I needed to switch restaurants. So we picked Fran's since we have never been there before. The menu looked great and it looked like an awesome deal for Restaurant Week. I was really happy that all options on their restaurant week menu were on their regular menu. 

We had an 8:15 reservation but were able to seat us when we got there at 8:00. Score! We got a romantic table by the window, which was great. Our waitress was super friendly, but while she said she was not in a rush that night, she definitely talked fast and took our orders quickly. But she was attentive with making sure we had enough water and everything was okay. And when then was an issue with the bill being incorrect, she was super apologetic and took care of it quickly.

We started off our meal with two delicious cocktails: the blackberry mojito and peach mule. Both were incredibly tasty. Not sure they were worth the amount they charged, but they were large enough that they lasted the entire meal...at least mine did!

For the appetizer we split the fig, brie, and goat cheese flatbread. That might have been my favorite thing we ate. It was HUGE and so incredibly cheesy. The sweetness from the fig puree was just perfect. After my boyfriend at his half of it, he said he was afraid to drink his cocktail because he wanted the taste to linger more in his mouth. Well done Fran's!

For our entrees we split the Skirt Steak and the Crab Cakes. Both were excellent. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare), but the portion was small compared to the fries. The fries were soooooo delicious. They were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I could have had a whole meal with those fries! The crab cakes were the perfect mix of crab and filler. They were incredible. I even liked the slaw on it...and I typically hate slaw.

I had chocolate cake for dessert and my boyfriend had the warm bread pudding. He almost licked the plates after we were done eating. I wasn't impressed with the chocolate cake. It was fairly bland and the whipped cream frosting was underwhelming. I wouldn't get that again.

While parking is not always easily obtained without paying, if you work uptown and are in a rush or live uptown - you now have a great version of Amelie's to call your own.

The vegetable dumplings were DELICIOUS, but I think my favorite part was the tofu nuggets. They are little disks of silken tofu, lightly breaded and fried. The outside is nice and crispy & the inside is soft & juicy. Very indulgent. They only have chopsticks & soup spoons to eat with, no forks here, so maybe dont bring someone who has never used them before.

macUlFgt9KW81mIdMrO1Vg,4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,7PRse3yCQbEprAj1DWrEQQ,5,3,0,0,"I ate here this past weekend with my girlfriend and her father for dinner.  We called 2 days prior to our visit in order to try and get reservations at 7 PM.  It didn't exactly work out for us since it was a weekend night and we ultimately decided on the 6:30 PM reservation whenever that or a 9 PM was offered instead.  I can't say that I have ever really noticed Dish before even though I have to have been past it before.  It's a fairly nondescript building on a corner a couple of streets off of Carson.  We arrived right around our dining time and were told that we would have to wait a few minutes for our table.  The restaurant is pretty well divided into two different areas with one side of the restaurant being the bar and the other side a dining room.  Whenever we walked into the dining there was only one other couple inside and so I ended up being confused about our wait other than trying to get us to order drinks.  At least it wasn't a long wait I suppose.  The dining room itself was fairly small and I think that it could maybe seat 30 or so people.  Overall the whole restaurant was pretty unassuming and the only real thing that I noticed about the dining room were some bottles on a shelf on one side of the dining area.

For dinner we all decided to split the Crostini alla Scamorza which was toasted ciabatta bread with smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, mushrooms and fresh basil while my girlfriends father also opted for the pasta e fagioli.  While we were waiting for the soup and appetizers to come out, they provided us with some pieces of bread as well as an small vessel that had some balsamic on the bottom and olive oil on top.  It was good but I was surprised how much of a bite the olive oil had in it.  After a short amount of time both the crostinis and soup were delivered.  The crostini looked like a cheesy bread but ended up tasting more like a cheesy bread on steroids.  While the tops of the crostini were covered in delicious prosciutto and cheese, the mushrooms on top gave it some good earthiness and the basil a good flavor.  Sadly there were only three crostinis as I am sure that I would have liked some more of it.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Tagliatelle ai Funghi which was Fresh tagliatelle with shiitake, portobello, oyster, pioppini and cremini mushrooms in extra virgin and garlic with spinach, basil and Parmiggiano Reggiano while my girlfriend went with the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare.  Whenever they were brought to the table I thought that the portions looked a bit small but the bowls ended up being deceiving as they were deeper than they looked.  My girlfriends dish came covered in many different types of seafood which you would expect and tasted really good.  Mine was also excellent and I loved that the noodles were cooked al dente and were a bit denser than I had been expecting.  It also carried much of the same flavors that I so enjoyed with the crostini and before long there was nothing left on my plate and I was full.  My girlfriend and her father both commented on how much they enjoyed their meals and we all left satisfied.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be heading here again in the future.  I like that almost everything about it is low key and yet it still provides excellent food while also being cheaper than I had originally expected.",2013-03-04 23:10:44
FfaiyIqB1dterRubcOAlGA,TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,WgvJcTe_RdlIfnvxEzn2Mg,4,3,1,2,"I've been to this location a couple times, but I don't normally seek out Roberto's since I rarely visit Mexican fast food joints and if I do, I prefer Faustos. My recent visit was based on convenience and I thought I'd give it a whirl again to compare. 

I have been on an Al Pastor kick for the last couple months, so I immediately began searching for my favorite pork. Since I couldn't find it on the menu, I saw ""marinated pork"" and asked to verify. When I asked the cashier if they offered Al Pastor, she responded, ""Yes"" and directed me to the Adobada. So, I ordered an Adobada burrito for myself and Adobada Nachos to share with my friend.

As it turns out, Al Pastor and Adobada are NOT the same thing. Al Pastor is pork marinated in dried chiles, spices and pineapple, then roasted on the vertical spit. Adobada is generally pork marinated in a ""red"" chilli sauce with vinegar and oregano. Adobada can refer to any type of marinated pork, so people can technically claim it is the same as Al Pastor, however, the vinegar in Adoba sauce and preparation of Al Pastor makes a big difference in flavor. 

Who knows if Faustos serves real Al Pastor when it could just be Adobada (the possible absence of the vertical spit)? Either way, Roberto's Adobada does taste different from other Al Pastor I've had in town. I concluded it was not different in a bad way, but rather just good in its own way. The flavor was great! I really enjoyed it with the nachos (I think I may prefer their nachos to Faustos, slightly). The burrito was good as well, but I was surprised that it was accompanied by just pico de gallo and guacamole. However, I don't order burritos often, so this may well be the norm. Their tortilla was yummy and I loved the crust they put on it from the flattop. 

My verdict is that Roberto's is good in its own way in comparison to Faustos. I like Al Pastor slightly more than Adobada, so that may be the deciding factor of where I choose to go. Oh, I did enjoy the salsa bar here much better because of the additional fresh vegetable choices!",2014-04-12 12:22:59

Brothers, I donate a respectable amount of blood. And, a lot of times as well. A decent amount of blood and as frequent as permitted by the system. Even when the system is incorrectly deferring my donation to a later date (due to a bad pull by a phlebotomist), I go out of my way to get it manually corrected so I can donate earlier. Pro Tip: One must call (800) 318-6039.

In any case, they should have a better system for phone banking once they think they have an arm that is ready to give blood. 

Sample:
Call #1: Thursday.
My thoughts: Oh, this is nice.  
My response: I am working at a music festival in California and I will schedule an appointment myself online when I get back. 

Call #2: Friday. 
My thoughts: Goddammit, I just explained this yesterday.
My response: I am working at a music festival in California and I really am not allowed to be on the phone. I thought this could have been an emergency. When I get back I will take care of it. 

Call #3: Unknown 
My thoughts: Let me call myself to see if Anthrax (the vaccine, not virus itself) will disqualify me. 
Their response: Not Anthrax, but the other stuff yes. Thirty days. 

Call #4: Thursday, 8 p.m. 
My thoughts: What the hell! 
My response: I am at a play and just stepped out to answer. I have been deferred for thirty days due to anthrax (error on my part due to haste in explaining). I will schedule an appointment for June ....

Then, there is the receptionist. The receptionist is the rudest person I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with at any non-profit anywhere. She is rude on the telephone (when one calls in); she is rude in person when one is ready to give what they are incessantly asking for. She is just rude. 

There are two employees here who are five-star all day. Unfortunately, the horrendous phone banking policy, and receptionist, and one phlebotomist who will wiggle that needle until they might have to amputate one's arm in order to get a complete draw bring down the rating at this UBS.

       - 6am - stop seating at 3pm
**Summary**
       - Best of Both Worlds - You get the quality control and pricing of chain restaurants with the taste and feel of a family owned joint. This is the fourth in a string of egg works in town and the first that is actually close to me.
       - Seasoned Center Cut New York Steak - One of the two items I always get when I'm here. They use their own special seasoning that makes the steak simply delicious.
       - Works Potatoes - Seasoned home fried potatoes. Their seasoning is so good they even sell it. Their fries are done the same way.
       - Banana Nut Muffin - Comes with almost every dish. It's sinful how moist and addicting this muffin is. If it's your first time and your entree doesn't come with it, I believe they'll give you one anyway. They know it's like crack and it'll keep you coming back.
       - Works Burger - The other item I always get. Sauteed onions, mushrooms, bacon, and cheese. Need I say more. It tastes just as good as it sounds.
       - Bennies - If you like eggs benedict, they have 5 different kinds. One even is topped with blackend prime rib.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice breakfast or lunch place.",2011-11-28 04:56:03

And the food...cold, how do you cook something at the last minute, but deliver it cold? Our mashed potatoes wouldn't even melt the cheese. The tacos were just...just...there aren't words for how much it sucked.

This shop is smaller and has a more limited selection than a lot of the other comic shops I've been in.  They have a wide variety of comics and graphic novels, but a small selection of anything else, like figures, clothing, posters, etc. 

We came in looking for a birthday t-shirt for my husband's sister, but they actually didn't have any women's shirts, and only about ten men's shirts, that were all haphazardly stacked on one another in one spot.  

On the flip side, we found a great selection of $0.50 comics and since I make paper flowers for my Etsy shop and comic book flower is a big hit for these, I was able to stock up on that for cheap! We also were able to use a check in offer on top of the cheap cost per comic ($5 for $10 worth). 

The staff was friendly and helpful and directed us where we needed to go when we asked, and offered up thoughts on places to search for shirts for our gift - which we ended up just ordering on Amazon after going to four or five shops after this one with no success.

So enough of me gushing about the rice.. but bottom line.. if you're looking for some fresh Greek cooking, come try The Great Greek. You won't be disappointed!",2011-12-16 03:56:49

SUMsIybVVuQCtoZHPIKbcg,Dh4HFUiw9Ip5wFQM_kEbbw,UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ,5,2,0,0,"Woods is not only (obviously) a suitable name given who owns the joint, but it's also a good reflection of the space's rustic Canadiana feel.  And now don't go letting the experiences at other self-proclaimed ""Canadian"" establishments inform the types of things you assume that means. Woods' doesn't communicate it's Canadian theme with folklorish Moose-heads, hung ice-skates or sports-game memorabilia.  Rather, Woods' interpretation is far more elegant and organic while staying true to the naturistic ""woods"" theme. There are dark wooden floors, a gorgeous wooden branch chandelier, beautiful rain-drop shaped lights, a wall resembling white rapids or sand, and booths with a birch tree pattern. They even have taken the time to serve their drinks with custom-made straws that resemble skinny birch-tree straws. With the natural light shining through the massive front and back windows, and the noise never exceeding a gentle buzz, Woods makes me feel comfortable, warm and welcome.  No one's telling me to come back in three hours because they don't take reservations. No one has to scream at anyone else because the music is too loud. No one has to shimmy into a communal table because they've packed us in like commercially raised cattle. Nope. It's clear that Woods has opted out of the current hipster-mecca trend and man, am I ever glad.  
Service is also a pleasure, especially considering they're only one week in. From the moment we arrived, the adorably bubbly hostess greeted us with energy and smiles, starting the evening off on an immediate high.  Likewise, our server for the night was friendly, well prepped on food and drink offerings, and was able to confidently make recommendations. The service staff were also very attentive with water glasses and cutlery, and both drinks and food emerged at a comfortable well-spaced pace- in and out within an hour and 45 minutes. 
Speaking of drinks, Woods' international wines list features about 16 selections by the glass ($10-19) and almost four times that by the bottle ($50-425). They also feature a handful of microbrews by draft or bottle, single malts, rye, grappa and 5 signature cocktails.  Over the course of the evening, we enjoyed a fresh Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand ($12), the Sparkling Ginger (Wise Special Blend Meets Bitter Ginger with Dry Proscecco, $10), and the Woods Caesar (Muddled Tomato, Crispy Onions, Bacon Salt and Deep-Fried Pickle, $10).  Two very different drinks, but both good in their own right. The former, of course, was much sweeter, while the latter was unmistakably savoury. It wasn't as spicy as I normally like my Caesars, but it had tremendous texture and flavour with the umami-packed rimmer and the crispy onions on top. And they must be reading my blog to know I'm obsessed with Deep-Fried Pickles- because the one that garnished my drink was totally spot on.
Foodwise, Woods and Davis have compiled a menu that celebrates sustainable local ingredients without being too explicit with the Canadian theme. That is, you're not going to find maple syrup, bacon and game meat in every menu description.  Rather, the dishes offer a generous range of seasonal ingredients prepared using both Canadian and Mediterranean influences, and are presented in palatable portions with elegance and restraint. It was certainly a tough call to choose, but with a little help from our server, we opted for:

Wild Digby Scallops with Parsnip Puree, Roasted Heirloom Garlic, Green Alder, Corned Beef Cheek ($17)

One of the best scallop dishes I've had in years. They were beautifully seared and buttery  inside with a fresh delicate flavour that was perfectly complemented by the sweet puree and garlic, and the salty chew of the beef cheek. We literally scraped our plate clean.

Venison Carpaccio with Black Trumpets, Wild Leek, Corn Nuts, Seedlings ($16)

The venison was meltingly tender and flawlessly seasoned, with enough pleasant gaminess going on to complement the umami-rich trumpets. And with all of the delicate textures on the plate, I loved the supple pop and crunch of the corn nuts in every bite. Really a nice light starter for sharing.

Roasted Muscovy Duck Breast with Tatsoi, Shallot, Sourdough, Crispy Confit, Dried Cherries, Duck Egg Bernaise ($28)

I always feel like I'm playing with fire when I order duck breast, because so often I'm presented with super chewy overcooked meat. But this one was so tender I hardly needed to use my knife, contrasting nicely with the chewy sweet cherries, and the crunchy buttery sourdough croutons.  I also appreciated that the mild mustard kick of the tatsoi helped offset the richness of the duck egg bernaise. A really well composed dish.

Spaghetti and Meatballs Stuffed with Pecorino Fresco, in Tomato Sauce with Toasted Basil Breadcrumbs ($22)

This is a great, and very non-traditional, brunch for Las Vegas, and Kudos to Mozen for having the guts to do.  This is a brunch that is much more focused on lighter food options, such as fresh sushi and sashimi, fruits, vegetables, and salads.  You also get a choice of a dish off their Sunday menu, which is definitely where you can find your ""heavier"" dishes.

The food set up and presentation is gorgeous, and I can't say enough about the quality of their fish.  The sushi and sashimi were both top notch, and they will prepare the sashimi for you to order, so you can just get what you like.  The selection is not large, but the quality of the fish is superb.  The salmon and the tuna both were great, and just had a great mouth feel, and were fresh enough that there was no fishiness to them.

The bread and fruit selection was wonderful too, with great pastries and a large assortment of fruit.  I truly had fun watching my friend trying to get the lychee open to get at the deliciousness that was inside.  The pastries were good too, but I've had better here in Vegas.

Their main dishes span from a steak and eggs, to Northern Indian curry, to South Korean and Japanese.  I had the Korean seafood stew, and while it was ok, I wouldn't order it again.  I expected it to be somewhat spicier as it was made with kimchee, but the portion and quality was great.  There was a ton of tofu, and it had shrimp, scallops, and calamari as well.  My friends had the curry and paneer, and both were really great.  I could've just dipped the fresh naan they made in both of them and been happy.

Their desert buffet, while limited in selection, was all delicious.  I liked how they had seasonal treats in there as well, and also they did some interesting flavor combinations.

Overall, a great brunch, and while the price might get you, it was truly delicious and well worth every penny,.",2012-11-15 03:57:08

Often with many places, flavours are compromised in an attempt to have a broader appeal. Delicate flavour profiles that balance the sweet, sour, spicy and salty are often much too sweet or terribly bland and unexciting.

Enter Kaffir Lime.

Owner and chef, Junian operates this tiny Indonesian eatery in the atrium of Kingsland Farmers Market making some of the most flavourful, fresh and unforgiving Southeast Asian cuisine in the city. Bold curries with deep and complex flavours, paired with the ethereal and aromatic perfume of the delicate jasmine rice. Add to that, the kiss of lime, lemongrass and fresh cilantro on farm fresh greens and you have yourself a meal to remember.

There is always a regular selection of signature items on the menu, including the satays and the ever famous vegetarian dish, Gado Gado. The specials are always changing and there is always something delicious cooking in Junian's tiny kitchen. The ingredients are always fresh and scratch made. Junian's chili sambal is unbelievably hot and the difference between his version and the jar is like night and day. He also makes his own peanut sauce which captures the essence of the roasted peanuts. Awesome.

Black Pepper Lamb - a slow cooked tender and juicy lamb in a black pepper sauce

What I do remember is that it was crowded, it had long wait times, and they only accepted cash.  Five years later and none of that has changed.  

I am simply not a fan of this place.  Upon walking in I was told the wait would be about ten minutes.  This doesn't seem too long until you realize that you are waiting those ten minutes shoulder to shoulder with people in their extremely small front waiting area with lovely freezing air blowing on you whenever the door opens.  When we finally got a table, I realized that it was sandwiched between another set of diners. I usually don't mind this but for some reason today I just couldn't deal with it. The man must hv noticed this because he saw two open seats at the bar and suggested we sit there instead; at this I gladly obliged.

There aren't individual menus outside of a huge menu on the wall.  I ordered the scramble with corn beef hash and onion; gravy on the side and no cheese.  It was not good.  The hot sauce that I drowned it in gave it all the flavor that the dish lacked; not a good sign.  The man ordered the corn beef and blueberry pancake.

- Go there with the idea in your head of getting it to go. If you go there with the plan of eating it there, you'll probably change your mind before the food is even ready.
- Use the drive-through if nobody else is in it already, otherwise park your car and go inside. They don't take your order until you get to the window (no intercom) and at about 5 minutes/car, you don't want to line up for that.

No one came for some time, except for what we thought was our server who brought us our menus and said that we'll have to wait for a while. Thirsty and hungry, we weren't too pleased by this brush off. I could understand if the server was ending their shift or was the lone person working in the front room but tell us that. Tell us that you're going to finish off your shift but ask us if we wanted drinks to start off with as we're waiting for the next server to relieve you of your shift. 

Finally, our designated and friendly server came over and got our orders in. The food arrived and it is your standard pub fare, though with some exceptions. My friend who's a vegetarian had the fried polenta starter dish, which were delicious. I recommend it. I had the chili-lime chicken, which was rather bland in taste and felt the chilies were supposed to mask the blandness.

Why I Give Mad Props to Lee's Sandwiches:
1. They have outdoor seating with mist-ers to keep customers cool, even at 110 degrees.
2. Add a statuesque actor in trademark John Wayne Gasey white makeup & a gondola canal inside, and you'd have the Venetian.  Then again, maybe not, but there is a mini concave rotunda built into the ceiling, painted with the colors of the wind.
3. They have a baguette factory.  Watch stainless steel machinery crank out French style loaves, while you and your chums enjoy an affordable meal in the dining area.
4. Eighteen different flavors of gelato.
5. They have a Deli Manjoo cream cake counter, with colorful carrying cases for to-go orders.
6. Fresh bread, fresh whole cilantro and thinly sliced fresh jalapenos joined forces to awaken sleepy taste buds.
7. The stylish Lance Armstrong style rubber bracelet which was affixed to each sandwich to keep the wrapper on tight.  Okay, it was just a sixteenth of an inch wide and only came in white.  What do you all want for nothing?  A rubber biscuit?
8. The low low prices.
9. My meal provided me with a front row seat to the putrid-pudding-stampede, at no additional cost.

Why I Put Lee's Sandwiches on Blast:
1. They don't take plastic... but they do have a shifty looking ATM against the wall.
2. The sweetly pickled julienned carrot sticks which were strategically placed on my meatball and bbq pork subs.  I didn't find the extra crunch to be an appealing augmentation.
3.  Some of the aromas emitted from behind the counter were not altogether inviting.

Finally, I found the cashier to be very friendly.  When I walked in with only a Hamilton, and the bill came to $10.11, guess who covered my shortage?  That's right, Nicole the benevolent cashier.

Order the cornbread skillet (last time I ate it was $4 for a 5"" or 6"") and you'll search no more!  I began my ventures here on the recommendation of a coworker after I mentioned eating complimentary cornbread from Z'Tejas and the $2 basket at Redfish Grill and Bar.  I first started having one huge slice (you can substitute a slice for a side that comes with their entrees).  I then graduated to just ordering the skillet and having two slices.  On my next visit I had half of the pan (the server even commented how the meal I was having that night wasn't very nutritious).  I seriously believe that my corn allergy was aggravated with my obsession of Bandera's cornbread skillet :(

I was able to try two entrees on separate occasions before I went stir-crazy on the cornbread.  Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, so do try some.  The salmon is also very good.  For sides, the spinach and glazed carrots are nice.  The enchilada my aunt tried was also quite tasty!  To help keep your wallet padded, have lunches here instead of dinner.

I have to admit we were divided on our overall rating... if I could give 3 1/2 stars, I would.  I cook a lot and, as a rule, my husband and I never want to eat somewhere that serves food we could eat at home.  Strangely enough, I cook traditional Indian food quite a bit.  

From the start, the menu did not wow me.  I usually struggle over what to order but tonight there were really only two main course items that interested me - my husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and I ordered the Lamb Rhogan Curry.  We also ordered samosas (my favorite part of the meal), garlic naan, and a mango lassie (delish - I always have to order a mango lassie!).  

The samosas were absolutely amazing and I loved the spicy sauce drizzled underneath them on the plate.  I was not so impressed with the three side sauces served with the two pieces of naan that accompanied our appetizer order.  Our water glasses remained filled - right up until the point we actually got our meals - and then while eating my slightly spicy lamb, I was forced to chew on a few ice cubes because there was no server or busboy to be seen.  Our main course dishes were not stellar - the quality of the meat was quite good but the overall flavoring was somewhat lackluster.  My husband's tikka masala almost seemed a little too ""tomatoey"" for my taste - he was not impressed at all, he said mine is better.  (Aww, so sweet...)  My lamb had a bit of a kick to it but the sauce was not ""lick the bowl clean"" kind of good - far from it, to be truthful.  

To me, Copper is not the place to go if you are simply looking for a tasty, authentic, Indian meal.  Copper is the place to go for a nice dinner, a date perhaps, if you are in the mood for a  trendy, modern take on Indian cuisine.",2010-10-24 01:51:50

The restaurant's prices are fair for a sushi place and their sashimi selection is better than most. Best of all, they usually have toro (fatty tuna) as one of their choices! If you haven't had toro, try it as a sashimi and you probably won't want to eat any other kind of sashimi. There are three kinds of toro here, you can get the toro (fatty), chu-toro (fatter), or o-toro (fattest). These all literally melts in your mouth! They have good flavor (no fishy taste at all) and a very smooth texture. The only complaint is that its about $7-8 for an order (2 pcs) for the o-toro (toro and chu toro is a bit cheaper). Their sake salmon sashimi is also a safe bet. 

I also enjoy their sushi. Their spider roll is great and can't really go wrong with it. It's served warm and the crab is crispy and often times meaty. The rolls are well made with just the right amount of rice. The ocean roll also gets ordered quite often. It's a sushi roll with deep fried oysters. I don't think I've seen this roll at other sushi places, so its definitely worth it to try it out while you're here.

Too many other things were off about the meal for me to want to return.  Too bad because those desserts sound alluring (pumpkin bread pudding!).

- It took way too long for the waiter (who said he was new) to come back for our order.  Another waitress actually came by to ask how we were doing because she saw us looking around. 
- Long wait for the appetizers.  How long does it take to send over some cheese curds, bacon wrapped dates, and nachos?  The nachos arrived last.  I didn't time it, but the meal was a solid hour and 45 minutes.  I wasn't crazy about the nachos, but the cheese curds were my second fave after the dates.
- My bison burger was extra dry (and I've had juicy bison before), and the bun it came on was too crumbly and dry as well.  I took 2 bites and ditched the rest of the bun.

And the last and final straw:
- My colleague clearly ordered the Carolina pork two ways (the entree is actually like 5 or 6 words on the menu, and he read off every word), but what was served to him was the Carolina wings.  He ended up just eating it because it would've taken forever for the correct entree to come out, based on our experience with the apps and entrees.  Also, rather than bringing out a free dessert or comp'ing the entree off the bill, we were still charged for the incorrect order, and waiter just kept saying thanks for understanding, and ""the wings tasting good?""

I first came here in 1994, when I was a wee student homesick for some local kine grinds.  There was no L & L those days, so we'd have to make the trek all the way up Sahara to get here.  Short story long, no matter strong my craving, it was tough to get here and it was lost to memory.

Fast forward to 2010 and, thanks to Yelp and Misti Y, this place is back on my radar.  It's still a haul from my hood, but I HAD to give it a try.  Walking in the door was, well, strange.  It looked and felt completely different.  Gone was the darkness (not sure if they even turned on the lights back in the day), the drink cooler up front and the booths.  Apparently, three renovations makes a difference.

Anyway, enough with the memories and down to business: the food.  There were four adults and two kids in our party, so we took the big table up close to the counter.  We were readily greeted with boiled peanuts and juices for the kids (it was pretty amazing to watch how an entire can of juice can make kids bounce of walls).  We were also brought never-ending dishes of different types of kim chee, which always seemed to be empty when I looked for it.  The mandoo was especially tasty, definitely not the kind you get from the market.  Our meals were onolicious and no one left hungry or a plate empty.

We were all hungry and everything on the menu sounded delicious.  First off drinks . . . Guinness please!  As they say, ""when in rome,"" or in this case ""when in an Irish Pub.""

Now time to decide on food.  So many choices!  I ended up going with a grilled veggie sandwich called Ploughman's Sandwich.  My friend got the Chicken Pesto Sandwich and the boys both got a boxty; Shepards Pie and Cornned Beef.  Right as the server was leaving, we added an order of the Spicy Potatoes, I had to try them!

While we were waiting to get our food, which didn't take too long, there was plenty of fun stuff on the walls to keep us busy; for our first visit anyway.  When the Spicy Potatoes arrived, we couldn't wait to jump in.  Small, new potatoes, fried and tossed in wing sauce, sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles and served with ranch.  These were by far the star of the meal!  The Dubliner had a perfectly tangy wing sauce that I wanted to put on everything!

Once we finished those off, which did not take long at all, our food arrived and we were all pleased with that as well.  On my veggie sandwich, the ciabata was perfect; very soft, which isn't always the case with ciabata.  The sandwich was great, and also helped to clear my sinuses with all of the horseradish.  I love horseradish, however if you don't, I would suggest asking for it without the sauce.  

The boxtys were good sized, not too big which is a plus when none of us wanted to get tired, we had a hockey game to go to!  They were served almost like a crepe, folded in quarters, with the filling oozing out of the side and scattered on top.  Very tasty!!

I ordered the chicken taco plate with black beans and the fried rice. Unfortunately I did not care much for the meal. The black beans were alright, the rice a little less than that, and the chicken tacos were super dry. The hot sauce was too heavy on the vinegar to lessen the dryness without offense either.

FULL STORY: Had heard about this place being good for sushi in CLE... after a recent visit, I can't say I agree.

It's a tight space -- a central, U-shaped bar with a couple of small tables around.  Would recommend reservations (open table).  I could see it working for a date. The host and servers were nice.  

Our table tried lots of different menu options -- most weren't bad, but I was surprised when nothing stood out in particular as much more fresh or creative than other similar places.  

Something in one of our rolls tasted stale -- kind of like it had been sitting in plastic too long. The eggplant is super sour and a huge, tough piece... not really pleasant to eat, even when you're expecting it to be pickled.

Overall it was an ok experience, but below what you'd expect for the price in Ohio. 

Note: It's downstairs from street level... in a basement.  No cell signal, but they have wifi.",2017-12-22 19:50:18

The crepes were fine (but who wanted to pay so much for crepes when you could get perfectly reasonable ones from Crepes Parisiennes in Shadyside? But, I guess that's no longer an option), brunch was fine, and dinner was fine. I mean, everything was FINE. But nothing was stellar (except for the macaroons. those were out of this world). 

So, I didn't go back for a while. Thankfully I was persuaded to go by some friends, and what a change! I think management is trying really hard to go hard-core French, so the servers all speak French and appear to be legitimate Frenchpersons! The menu has changed and now the dinner entrees are much more traditional French fare. 

When we last went, they unfortunately had run out of everything we wanted to order. And I'm not even exaggerating; I tried to order the duck breast... no go. My husband and another friend tried to order the lamb shank special... no go. They even told us they only had one left, and so my husband and our friend had to decide who would get it, and then they came back to tell us that they actually didn't have ANY left! Despite all this, we really enjoyed the meal and would be happy to go back again. I guess management just has to work on procurement... Excellent desserts, but... wait for it... NO MORE MACAROONS. Gah! This place is too popular for its own good!

Went in Wednesday night (the place is tucked away behind the rainbow Walgreens) - and was blown away. Cute place (tiny, but still seemingly ample seating), great decor, awesome vibe with the music - reminds me of a bar I would visit in beach town Charleston, SC. 

Amazing service on Wednesday. Offered to sample many beers I wasn't familiar with. Ended up doing a beer/food pairing. Van, took great care of me and was very enthusiastic about my food selections. Always a good vibe when they get hyped about how you're eating the food. 

Outstanding food. Seriously. Incredible. And very very fair priced. A side of out-of-this-world pork belly is very generous for $5. I went in alone, and crushed..

-an appetizer of the fried deviled eggs (being from the south - this was a foodgasm) // paired with blueberry wheat
-Mixed greens salad with the garlic chicken and pork belly (omfg. Awesome. And they have chopsticks to enjoy the food slowly as intended) // paired with farmhouse ale
-Nutella Dark Chocolate Almond Bread Pudding (I shared a photo with a friend.. this is a party in your mouth) // paired with cali' creamin. 

The dessert was so damn good I almost ordered a second round. Except by this point I was stuffed. 

SO I CAME BACK ON THURSDAY. I had to try the burgers. Had to. And god, am I glad I did. Also incredible. Perfect bun. 

Only downside? Menu offered grilled or fried onions.. grilled onions gross me out so I asked for fried. They're still grilled.. bartender told me he meant to tell me that. Service tonight was okay, but not as mind blowing as Wednesday - they seemed preoccupied with personal convos. But no biggie. The food made up for it!! And the place is new, so turnover is bound to happen while ironing it out! Besides, once I got my bread pudding, all was forgotten.

We barely got a parking spot. She had never had pho before, so I wanted to take her to a place that got high reviews so she would have a good experience. The restaurant is very cute, it is in an old house, and is very 'trendy' looking. We were seated and given water and then proceeded to wait for a long period of time before the waiter came around to take our order. When he (finally) did, he was nice enough. We ordered the pork spring roll to share and we each ordered pho ga. I have had fresh rolls before (a lot of them), and this one was just not that great. It was mainly comprised of lettuce, with a little bit of chewy pork bits and a few noodles. Other (more hole in the wall type places...aka authentic) places fill the roll with more of a balance of ingredients. Also, the ends of the fresh roll had very thing rice paper, making it hard to chew and swallow and felt like a piece of rubber in my mouth. Not awesome. So our pho comes out and it looks weird because the broth is clear....almost like water. I have never experienced this before(and I have eaten, and made, a lot of pho). All of the toppings were fresh, but they didn't add enough flavor to save the bland broth. Additionally, the noodles used are thicker, more spaghetti-like noodles than the typical thin rice noodles found in pho. The whole thing was just not flavorful. It felt like the broth was not homemade, and if it was, was missing all of the spices that give it such a unique flavor. To top it off, this place is WAY overpriced. We paid 23$ for lunch, and it wasn't good. I would recommend finding a little whole in the wall pho place in which the employees speak little-to-no English and trying their food.

If you're a fan of Greenhouse, you know the story: Jonathan Sawyer, Food & Wine's 2010 ""Best New Chef"", has worked alongside the great Charlie Palmer in NY and Michael Symon here in Cleveland. Chef/Partner of Bar Cento turned restaurateur in his opening of The Greenhouse Tavern; a business based on using local ingredients, sustainable food and environmentally conscious practices. An ambitious project that has seemed to pay off. 

Cleveland Beer Week and a private 6 course tasting brought me and a couple friends to The Greenhouse for a recent indulgence of bliss and excess. What follows is an account of one of the most enjoyable meals and experiences in public dining that I can think of in recent memory....

The tasting was to take place in the basement. A large square table with 12 seats, 4 on each side was prepared for our arrival. Just past the dining table was the kitchen. It ran like a well oiled machine. If you've ever seen Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen TV show, this kitchen was nothing like that. There was no screaming or chastising. Instead, the cooks moved in symphony as the chef conducted them. Pushed against the rear wall were shelves stocked with autumn's seasonal bounty of gourds, pumpkins and squash of many varieties, colors and sizes. On the other wall, a vintage jukebox. The exclusivity of our group and the setting were enough to foreshadow the experience that would surely follow. 

Before each meal, a beer sommelier gave a brief history of each beer we would sample. Next, Johnathan Sawyer himself spoke to us about each dish that was paired with the beer. The same pattern followed throughout the night. What resulted was a memorable night of information, enlightenment, excellent food and exemplary beer. The menu was as follows:

First Course paired with a Reissdorf Kolch:
Heirloom pork & ricotta meatballs, duck devils on horseback, Ohio black walnut soup & tasty bits. 

Second Course paired with La Douze:
Foie gras tourchon w/ endive apricot chutney

Third Course paired with Hitachino White:
Beer Vin Mackeral Crudo w/ coriander barley cake

Forth Course paired with Taquamari:
Duck and Squash Pasta

Palatte Cleanse: 
Red and White Beer Granita

Fifth Course paired with Aventinus:
Veal w/ cherry sauce & polenta

Dessert paired with Sarasola Sagardoa Basque Cider:
Apple tart titan w/ salty carmel ice cream

In recounting the entire meal, a few standouts were the black walnut soup, the foie gras tourchon and the duck squash pasta.  

In memory and context alone, this meal stands among a short list of best I've ever had. The food, drink and accompanying knowledge behind it made it even better. Welcome to my Top 3 in the CLE List Greenhouse Tavern. You deserve it!",2010-11-04 19:27:57

I like their security presence. Each guest is scanned for metal, heaving restrictions on bags and guards everywhere. Food/ beverage is expensive but comparable to all concerts. I had a hot dog from the general built in concession stand and it wasn't anything special or note worthy but it did the job. Also tried a carne asada bowl and churro from the wandering donkey. The bowl was better than chipotle and the churro was delicious and homemade- a must have. Beer was easily accessible and sold in large quantities so you don't have to go back often. Last call was at 10pm- even when the concert didn't end til 11pm. Music sounded great. Parking was easy- no need to pay for the fancy parking.

1st time there was a great experience... we had a good waiter & we were quite impressed with the food. We tried the signature mushroom pan-fry & wow was it amazing! We are big fungus fans anyways, but with the cream sauce, the polenta, and the avocado/cheese topping-DELICIOUS! We also tried the baked mac & cheese.... also delicious! We couldn't wait to go back!

2nd time there was NOT a great experience... I'll start off by saying we did have a Groupon. I'm not sure where the blame lies but we can only go with a deduced theory of... Our Waitress. It was a special occasion for my husbands b-day brunch. We were sooo excited to eat here again. I made reservations and we secured a table with no problem. It was not THAT busy this particular Sunday. We ordered drinks to start, they took forever. We ordered our appetizer & meal all at once but asked that our starter come out first. It did about 20+ minutes & 2 apologies later. It seemed like a rushed serving, soft partially toasted bread for bruschetta, not impressed at all! Then we had to wait for our meal, which took another 20+ minutes. By this time we had noticed that people who had to wait to be seated after us because they didn't have a reservation, got their food before us. One table actually finished their meal before our meal came out & another table was half done. Needless to say our waitress was full of excuses- 1st was being too busy because of the Groupon out, then it was waiting on my eggs, then it was kitchen was behind, then it was just sorry. Well the other ""later"" sat tables had ordered one of the same dishes that we did & they got theirs, and to top it off when my food came - IT WAS COLD! I now had to express my unhappiness & frustration with our service. She took it away & I asked for another dish of the mushroom pan-fry which is what my husband ordered & it was piping hot. She said she was sorry & spit out some more excuses & then said she would take care of it. Well, she did by taking over half the bill off, which was the appropriate thing to do. Nothing she said would have made this better. We kept the Groupon because it wasn't worth it to waste it on a lowered bill & we will go back again, if not just for the spectacular mushroom dish!! So we'll chalk it up to a bad day for our waitress. And if there was any validity to the Groupon problem (doubt it).... then Cowboy Ciao needs to get it together if they decide to offer a special. 

Overall, mostly good food, nice atmosphere, but lacking on consistent service.",2010-09-13 04:07:23

Enterprise gives a pretty fair deal on their cars... we got a Hyundai Elantra for cheaper than it was at most local dealerships for, they have the lowest doc fees in town pretty much, and they gave us $500 over the KBB trade in value for her car.  They also have a 7 day return policy and some other nice perks you won't see elsewhere.

I highly recommend you buy your next car here if they have what you're looking for in stock.  Oh, and you can browse their inventory online, and they can ship down any car from Reno that you like (that's what we did) for  no cost.  Make sure you mention that I referred you! :)",2011-07-27 08:13:28

The crowd (although fun to people watch) is wearing on me. I only ever see cougars lurking around in the dark or pervy old businessmen trying to hit on the hotties. BM used to give you a nice helping of the drink you ordered. They would fill your glass up when serving you and then leave enough in the cocktail shaker for another full glass. That made it worth paying $12/drink but now you barely get any leftovers. The food is cheesy and expensive. Everything tastes pre-packed and/or frozen. The only app I enjoy there is the fruit platter (at least I know the fruit has to be fresh). 

Another gripe- I have to sit outside now because the music is SO loud inside that I can't even have a decent convo with my buddies. Oh and $30 for a hookah that barely smokes for 20-30 minutes....honey please. The worst part? They took my favorite drink off of the menu, the s'mores martini :( BOO!

The only thing that keeps me coming back is my industry card (I get 50% off all drink and apps) and my lady card (which gives me 1 drink for free before 9am). I can use both together so I can usually drink on the cheap. If I am looking for a place to take an out-of-town guest (and I don't feel like hitting up the strip) then we'll normally end up here.

I opted for both flavors of the vegan gelato. The guy working the counter was really nice. He told us they rotate the flavors about once a month, so they always have something different. The flavors I got this day were pistachio and amaretto chocolate. Both were really good. And I have had REAL gelato before. Like the kind in Italy. And these were just as good. I wont say better because nothing beats Italian gelato, but these were definitely the best vegan gelato I have ever had. I went back a couple of days later and they had a third flavor of gelato out, spicy chocolate. It was definitely spicy. There is no way I could ever eat an entire cup of it.

Conveniently located in the downtown financial path with close proximity to the food court in the Richmond Adelaide Centre, this is where urban professional workers come and get their sugar fix. 

Entering their store you'll find glass cases holding arrays of colourful macarons, croissants, entremets and tarts. Shockingly everything here is pricey - individual tarts starts at $8 a piece and croissants for $3.50 and up. 

Based on good reviews, I decided to splurge and bought an entremets called 
""Sweet Harvest"" which is a combination of all things yummy - milk chocolate, carrot cake and cream cheese. If you like chocolate you will love this! The different layers in the cake works well together plus it's not cloyingly sweet.

I also bought 2 Croissants - Almond & Chocolate Almond. Both croissants were perfectly baked on the outside, flaky, light, buttery. 

The almond croissant was covered in just the right amount of toasted almond slivers and a scant dusting of powdered sugar.   The chocolate croissant is not extremely dense and thick which is what normally what other croissants look like - overloaded with dough.

Our main gripe was the godforesakenHEAT. It was like the air was broken. They had set up fans, but that isn't enough. After some time we acclimated and stopped sweating. Our other complaint is the oddly sticky wood tables. You know when they get cleaned but they still feel tacky? Yuck.

Our server (a young lady) was prompt when greeting us, refilling beverages, etc., and she kindly explained the details of the coupon to make sure we were clear on minimums and gratuity (we can read so we knew all that, but it was nice they made the effort).

That's the thing about Christos, their employees stand outside with a menu pressuring people to come in. I'm not sure if this is working hard or just desperate. It could be that Christos is one of many Mediterranean restaurants on 6th Ave and they need to stand out somehow. My husband and I decided to give it a chance and the food was decent: flavorful, comforting and decently priced. He got the Chicken Kebab and I got the Souzoukakia and Spanakopita Combo.

Then one day, the magical doors opened. The interior was beautiful. The smooth wooden tables looked modern and comfortable, and clever details in the decor hinted at the amount of work put into the restaurant. A huge upgrade from their previous workplace! 

A big screen was playing Munchies videos from Vice. We ordered the Honey Boo Boo burger, the Almighty Protein Poutine, and a milkshake each (obviously). Oh, and curly fries. 
Because they are awesome, they gave us complimentary chicken tenders! We took our delicious loot back home, and preceeded to consume everything in no particular order, forgetting all about previous vows of frugality and temperance.

The restaurant is nice and clean, the service was good, and the menu is big enough to satisfy anyone's Chinese food craving. I should point out that this is an American Chinese restaurant in a strip mall on Boulder Highway in Hendertucky, those craving ""authentic"" should head into Chinatown. 

The food was prepared very well, came out very quick, not oily at all and I was happy that my 1 1/2 year old found somethings to enjoy :)

Ordered:
Cashew Chicken - I always order this extra spicy and they delivered as promised. Really enjoyed the flavor and the chicken/veggie ration was excellent. Could of use some more cashews.

Shrimp Mu Shu - If you like fried egg, then this Mu Shu will be right up your alley. Yes, there was plenty of shrimp, but instead of the rest being veggie filler there was a real good amount of stir fried egg.

Beef w/string beans - served in a black bean sauce which was nice and garlicky. Again, good meat/veggie ratio and this was one of the dished my little boy loved.

Hot & Sour soup: More flavor than some of the other places, the only way it could of been better is if it had a bit more seafood in it.

Egg rolls - A free bonus. They call them egg rolls, but if anything they were closer to spring rolls as they didn't seem to contain any meat. A little oily by nature, but they kept their crunch through the night, this was the other item my little boy really enjoyed.

*Drivers description: Bald older gentleman with short mustache and glasses

  The most rudest service I have ever experienced. The beginning of the trip was fine until I got home from the destination. I literally was about to give the driver the amount in cash and I did not give him enough tip to his liking. He literally told me this isn't a water delivery service which I had his car service help me get my water gallons refilled. He proceeded to tell me get Uber next time me this was illegal to do. I'm sorry sweetie but last I checked wouldn't you want me to hire your services opposed to Uber. Uber would of been cheaper but current circumstances made me utilize this horrible grotesque service called a cab service. As I was taking out one of the water gallons for my water dispenser he proceeds to take them out his car and I hear one of them get slammed and it bursts open. He literally burst the 4th container of water in fury because of me not tipping him enough. He proceeded to say ""I'm sorry"" nonchalantly, in the distance and drives off as I'm standing there in shock and outraged by what has occurred. I couldn't even record him for evidence as he literally did it as I was turning around to get the other containers of water. I was appalled that this individual was so triggered that he decided to bash the BPA free water jug which was filled with water which will cost money to replace and refill. This may not be a Uber service, the tip amount may not been enough to your liking enough though I did not have you carry them to the car or ask for them to be touched from the vehicle when back at the original destination. I later proceeded to call the car service and the receptionist was giving all this attitude that I did not ask for. I'm just calling to report distress that your driver has caused me so please don't give me all this attitude that I could really not care for. Obviously I will not be compensated for these damages to my water jug that costs way more then the whole ride to and from the destination. This is why Uber and Lyft are slowly taking over cab services because of this entitlement from drivers from small car service businesses.",2016-12-29 02:48:49

We decided to ""class it up"" a bit since we have relatives in from Hong Kong than taking them to our usual dumpy dim sum places - though if you ask me, the food is just as good in those places, if not better!

The pros of going to a higher end dim sum places usually include:

Better service
Less wait times
Specialty items
Better ambiance/decor/seating

Of the 4 pros, they excelled at 2, and failed in 2. 

We arrived at around 10:30AM before the mad rush of 11AM came around (this is usually the time a dim sum restaurant starts getting busy and you have to start taking a number!)  The smaller tables were getting called much faster (which makes sense because how much can 2 people eat really?)  It seemed they only had 3 larger tables and I noticed that they implemented their sectional to section off part of the restaurant, presumably for a night banquet/function given the red table cloths and special table setting.  I couldn't help but feel a bit irked that they didn't open up that section of the restaurant to accommodate the crowds that were now all tapping their feet in impatience.  Our biggest mistake was not making a reservation - though that counts for little.  You still have to wait, but it just means that if you have a reservation and there are 4 tables of 4 waiting, you get bumped up to the top.  Its not a TRUE reservation in the sense of the word.

At approximately 11:10AM we were finally seated at a table that was meant more for 8 than it was for 10, so we had a very ""intimate"" family dim sum that morning to say the least.

We ordered more than our stomachs could hold (this is what happens when you have multiple people ticking off things on the menu.  When this happens, we only see the items we ticked off, but fail to see the other dozen items that were already pre-selected which results in a WHOLE lotta food that we can't finish being shoved into styrofoam take-out boxes for later and an expensive bill.  Ours fell shy of $120 for a table of 10 with tax and tip, which, by dim sum standards is pretty pricey.)

They had the standard dim sum items but some specialty ones as well: Korean Short Ribs, Papaya/Milk Tarts, Salted Egg Yolk Steamed Custard Buns, Salted Egg Yolk Sesame Balls, Osamanthus-Lychee-Goji Jelly, Deep Fried Sticky Rice to name a few.  

The dim sum is priced according to size (S/M/L/XL).  It is a tick-the-paper system as opposed to the old-school push-cart system here.  Their marketing team really tries to sell you with the ""fancied"" up names they try to give to standard dim sum items.  Golden this, dragon that.  

The service wasn't particularly stellar.  The ladies who bring out your orders could stand to smile a bit more.  I found that they were rather rude.  We had asked if they could cut some of the dim sum items in half with scissors and she grumpily replied ""I don't have any"" and huffed off to the next table.

The dim sum chef could use a lesson or 2 in making a Shrimp/Scallop Dumpling that doesn't fall apart.  Most people would place blame on my amateur chopstick-holding skills, but even my elders who hold it the ""proper"" way had difficulty keeping these babies in one piece.  

The Korean Short Ribs were a bit on the dry side albeit tasty.  The papaya tart was anything but exciting.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.

Alas, another restaurant in ""Rich""mond Hill that has disappointed me.  For me, the lot of them are not worth the trek just for dim sum as there are plenty of options in Scarborough that are just as good, for a fraction of the cost, and a quarter of the gas.",2011-09-09 12:50:41

I ordered some sushi. I had to go up to the bar counter to order because the two waiting bartenders were busy texting and talking to each other. Nevertheless, I finally was able to make my order. Their sushi comes from Kaya, the Korean AYCE sushi house next door. As my suspicion was confirmed, they are both owned by the same owners. 

Sushi was pretty good. I ordered the salmon skin roll, Philadelphia (so I like cream cheese and salmon and no I'm not Jewish) roll, and the spicy tuna roll. I have had KAYA many times, so I knew it would be solid. 

Their yogurt soju was really yummy. It's slightly carbonated as they add 7-Up to liven up your taste buds. 

As I walked to the back for the restroom, I passed by some karaoke rooms and it looks like they have a large selection of Korean and English songs to choose from. The restroom was out of paper towels, so I air dried on my walk back.

Just bought a pair of New Balance, another pair of Sketchers and a pair of Florsheim dress shoes...combined cost with tax was $128.  I have 9 wide, and plenty of options, but hard to find. Every box is clearly marked on the outward facing side with the size, width, list price, and markdown price. It is not well organized, and you have to sort through each one, but hey, lot's of people are shopping there.

The regular Shoe Box is busy, and it may take awhile to find someone to help you. If you do choose to purchase, they bring your box up to the front so you don't have to juggle it while you continue to browse. The prices tend toward the higher side, but it's because they carry quality brands and provide real service. 

It has a huge selection of pretty much anything you can put on your feet.",2016-08-15 21:31:25

They should treat everyone with the same respect. I shop at the Micheal Kors in the Venetian & those sales rep are always friendly & attentive.

But I do crave for a hot bowl of ramen so what the heck I will give this a try. I ordered the miso ramen... and the food comes within 10 minutes. 

The miso ramen is done in pork bone soup with miso of course, also with 2 pieces of pork, soft boiled eggs, corn, cabbage, and cloud ears. The pork is average, ok. The broth is really hot (temperature), which is good for ramen. The soft boil eggs do have a runny yolk, another good. The broth is flavourful with miso and have traces of pork bone flavour, ok. Just a note, the broth is not as strong flavourful as Sansotei but it's still acceptable. The price is $10.50 before tax for this bowl of ramen... Factoring in all these, it's a yummy bowl of ramen and considering it's also in my neighbourhood for easy access, bit above 3 stars in total.

In terms of services, maybe I am the only customer there, so things get done very quickly and prompt. No complaint there.. at least they didn't forget my order this time as other reviewer has pointed out. :)

I so wanted to give a 5 star review (because I love their food overall) but the last time I was here, I was at the register waiting to order for 5 minutes at around 6pm and no one was at the counter, just nobody to take my order...so I waited and waited...and then some girl came out from the back kitchen and another lady (probably the manager) said, ""Hey you have someone at the counter"". Just bizarre to have no one up front for that amount of time and not even be busy.

Anyway, getting back to the food...I usually grab the sin city with the fried egg or the mushroom truffle swiss depending upon if I'm craving those awesome crispy shoestring onions on the Sin City or if I'm feening some truffle mushroom goodness.

My wife ordered the short ribs. She enjoyed them. 

So why the 3 stars? Service! 


One of the worst things a restaurant can do is bring out one persons food much earlier than the others.  My wife waited 10 minutes for her short ribs only to have to send it back because it wasn't well done as she specified. So she waited another 7 minutes.

The food reminded me of some of the excellent Thai restaurants I have ate at in NY, CA, and MI. I highly recommend the braised short ribs in curry sauce and the chicken paneer.  The only complaint our table had was we requested MEDIUM to HOT and received MILD for all our dishes. It was a quick fix because they had a generous portion of Thai chili peppers and Siracha sauce at our table. All 13 dishes came out at once and everyone loved what they ordered.

It was our three-year anniversary (of dating).  I would've loved to sit outside, but their tables weren't shaded and even in the early evening, it would've been too hot to sit along the sidewalk.  So inside we went.

The decor was really cool, and comfortable.  The Caribbean vibe flows throughout the restaurant with the music, the lights, the shape of the chairs, the bar - like a classy tiki lounge?  You'll feel like you're on vacation.

Our server was great - I can't remember his name, unfortunately, but he wore glasses and I think he had a ponytail.  He was friendly and casual, quick with a joke and a recommendation.  We started a carafe of Rum Runners - a carafe will get you three drinks for the price of two, so do it - and the drinks were delicious.  The Rum Runner has two kinds of rum, blackberry brandy, banana liqueur, orange juice, pineapple juice, and grenadine - it tasted and looked just as good as it sounds.  And we were still able to drive afterward.

For the meal, we began with the Jamaican Jerk Wings with Cilantro Cream sauce, and they were fan-tas-tic.  Some of the best wings I've had anywhere, ever.  They are spicy, and the skin is crispy, and they were just luscious.  The cilantro cream sauce provided the perfect balance.  I'd order this again anytime.

We then split the Tropical Paella - they split the entree onto two plates for us - and it was quite good as well.  Less stunning than the wings, less creative perhaps, but well executed, tasty, and satisfying nonetheless.  The seafood in the paella was well-cooked, and the taste of the pineapple was outstanding.

We were still a tiny bit hungry, so we got calamari instead of dessert.  The calamari came with jicama, radicchio, coconut, and peanuts, in a sesame-banana vinaigrette.  The flavors were undeniably tropical, the calamari was crispy, and we picked at it long after we were full, just to get one more sweet, crunchy bite.

There are some pricey options here, and some very moderately priced items.  They also have happy hour on weekdays, so I think you could easily eat here without breaking the bank.

I may have found the best happy hour deal in all of Charlotte. We went on Saturday at 5:45 and everything was half off! Okay not everything just bottles of wine and their whole menu. So for me that translates to everything is half off.

Rooney's has had a bit of an identity crisis since they've opened. First they were a sandwich shop with some convenience market items. Then they started doing dinner with the metal shelving still surrounding the customers. Now they still have some shelving in the back but it is threaded with burlap and completely hides the sandwich bar. Whoever did that - genius. It really adds to the atmosphere. Their new set up is perfect. 

Back to the happy hour deal - the whole menu is half price from when they open for dinner (4pm) until 6pm, every single day. Bottles of wine are half off Tuesday and Saturday. We essentially had a Saturday night out for a steal and I can see us making the most of this deal regularly.

We started off with the charcuterie board which was enormous for just the two of us with several types of meats and cheeses that were all delicious. Then we tried the prosciutto brie crostinis which had warm brie on the bottom and then was layered with prosciutto and standard bruschetta toppings. Though it was a little messy to eat I would definitely get it again! We also tried the bistecca which was okay. The mashed potatoes were well seasoned but I would have liked more flavor from the steak or the sauce (or both). 

The service was excellent and with everything half off (making the bulk of their menu $4-$6) I would be hard pressed to say anyone in the queen city has a better deal.",2017-06-05 13:00:13

We came at 530pm on a sunday and was the first one there as it had just opened. 

We ordered the Carmen paella right away as it takes 45min to make. It wasnt as good as I expect it to be for 50$ a pop. It was bland for me and wasnt exciting. I could have made it at home tbh...

We tried both of the fish ceviche for 20$
- it was good, very zesty. The flavours were very unique. loved the different kind of chips provided. 

Kale salad
- it is exactly what it sounds like. Kale salad with pine nuts and ricotta. Nothing special or different but good nonetheless. 

Breaded green tomatoes
- fav dish of the nighy, love the crispiness and the texture of it all. 

pork tenderloin
- dont get! it was just a thick cut of dried pork. no flavour, did not enjoy at all. 

squid with chorizo
- came out in a skewer, the best paet of it was the chorizo. the squid fell flat of expectation. 

Churros for dessert
- wasnt as crispy as it should be, soggy and doughy.

All in all, would i return? no. Simply because it's out of my budget and for the price, I expected the food to be awesome. Service was great, ambience nice. it cost 4 of us 330$ after tax and 15% tip with a $65 bottle of wine and 3 cocktails.",2016-01-16 19:19:07

For them, Charlotte is considered a ""spoke"" airport so unless you're headed to one of Southwest's focus cities - Baltimore, Chicago/Midway, Houston/Hobby or Orlando - then you're going to be connecting.

At CLT, Southwest is located in the A concourse with the other airlines that aren't US Airways. You'll find Delta, United and American in there as well. But just because it's the A concourse does NOT mean that you have to use the A security checkpoint. The entire airport is completely connected, so use whichever line is the shortest. Once you're in, you can easily walk to A.

The boarding process for Southwest, even though they have only one gate, is exactly the same as every other Southwest flight. They have set up the stands with A1-5, A6-10, A11-15, etc. When it's time to get ready to board, the gate agent will have everyone take their positions and then it's a neat filing process to get on board where there are no assigned seats and you can take whichever one you like.

The finish was not as smooth as its supposed to be a the froth was just ok. A good iteration for a cappuccino but not great and surely not up to Vancouver/Seattle level. I decided to give another try and ordered the house special blend espresso shot and in a word ""awful"" bitter taste and poor finish.

it's the travel department that nearly screwed us for our wedding. way back when, we looked into destination weddings with a AAA AZ branch. our rep always said ""i'm looking into it, i'll call you tomorrow"" and then a week later, i'd call to ask what the hold up was and was met by the same thing. a month passes by and we find out that rep was fired. 

so we've got plenty of time and decide to go to a different AAA AZ branch, the one on Glendale Ave. We were greeted with smiles and elations by their travel rep who said she had a great deal of experience with destination weddings and she would handle EVERYTHING to make our experience hassle free and a joy to remember. said she did the same trip (although not for a wedding) for a group of friends every year, so she ""knew what she was doing"". things went sour from there. 

we hardly EVER received return phone calls on time. all the guests we invited that were to book through this AAA branch never received phone calls back. so every-single-one of our guests did their own booking with the hotel and airlines....not just 1-2 guests, all of them. and when we pressed her about this, it was always ""oh, my system crashed"" or ""oh, my phone wasn't working""....come on!

fast forward to a week before our trip departure...for our wedding and honeymoon. still no word from the AAA rep. Three days before, we FINALLY get confirmation. you want to see stressed? how about a bride and groom having to wait till the last minute to find out if all their rooms and flights were booked after paying everything up front?

but the proverbial icing on the cake? we were advised to have our invitees ""donate"" a wedding gift to our wedding through the AAA travel website. that way, those guest that couldn't attend could still give us something and at the end, we'd get a check. 

unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. at no point were we informed that 10% of ""donations"" would be kept by AAA. furthermore, my now wife has had to make numerous calls to the AAA office to actually get our wedding ""donation"" check. it was always ""they're cutting the check today""...a week later....""they're cutting the check today"", etc. 

to summarize, i'll keep my AAA for cars only. their travel department was probably one of the most unprofessional, unorganized, and untimely departments i've ever had to deal with. we would've saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves.",2011-07-20 03:31:27

I decided to try this place after reading the rave reviews about it and the fact it's in my hood.  It's a small place with a few tables where you can eat in, but more of a takeout place.  Not being familiar with Armenian food I can't say anything regarding the authenticity of the food, but it's good food and that's what matters in my book.

You can get pizzas or smaller jouns here - they make a limited number of jouns and my lunch time some were already sold out.  I got a half and half - cheese on one and then zataar on the other.  You can then have the option of adding toppings (onions, hot peppers, tomatoes, olives...etc..etc).  There is no charge for these toppings but I believe if you want to add chicken pieces it's an extra charge. Jouns are meant to be eaten like a wrap - it's a really thin crust (think thinner than naan bread).   I added some toppings on the cheese side and left the zataar side alone and ate it like pizza slices.  I didn't particularly care for the zataar one only b/c it felt like I was taking big bite of pure spice in my mouth, but I liked the cheese one.  The jouns are pretty cheap - all under $5 which makes a great snack or lunch.  They have bigger pizzas that are still decently priced - I believe depending on the pizza in the $8-10 range.  

The staff are so friendly  and helpful in answering any questions.  Just don't ask them if they know the Kardashians!   They also sell some preserves/pickled items in the front but I didn't really investigate what they were or prices. 

I can't wait to try one of the pizzas they look so mouth watering.  The only con is that I believe they close early - around 7 or 8pm.",2015-11-13 13:14:10

Our house ordered takeout from here: lamb korma, vegetable curry, chicken biryani, and garlic naan. $45 for the set after tax, which ain't bad at all (actually $36 since we used a JustEat coupon for 20% off!). Portions were hefty (except maybe the lamb in the korma) and justified pricing IMO. 

Quality-wise, it won't be the best Indian food you've ever eaten, but it hits the spots that need to be hit when you're hankering for Indian. Chicken biryani was reasonably flavourful and quite plentiful, lamb korma was fairly well made, and vegetable curry had a nice sauce and filled to the brim with veggies (but seemed like they may have used a package of frozen peas/carrots/corn? Hmmm). Nothing was especially impressive (though the vegetable curry sauce was quite decent!), but it fit the bill.

Ambiance is great, dark, romantic, great bar area..I could picture James Bond sipping on a cocktail at this bar and charming a Scottsdale woman back to his suite at the W before flying off to Casablanca to kill another villain..one star for that. That said, it gets packed, and can feel a bit claustrophobic. 

Our server was wonderful. I think the true talent of a great server shows when they can handle big groups and are good with kids. I can't remember her name, but she deserves a shout out, star for that.  

Now that I'm living with a famous health food chef/trainer I am lucky to experience what real quality food can taste like when prepared to perfection. Ill say the food was good, but not life changing here...so one star out of two for taste. 

Why do they lose the other star you ask? Well it's always nice to have management stop by and ask how things are, it is an important part of customer service. We were celebrating a bday..and one of the attendees was in the two year old range. For the most part, behaving very well, but was occasionally letting out a giddy, happy scream, which can happen at this age especially with the excitement of helping open a few gifts for her mother.  

There is the way right way to approach this situation as manager on duty, and a wrong way....The only time we saw management was when she approached the table and straight up told the group, ""If the child screams one more time you are going to have to leave this restaurant""  This was after we had a half dozen appetizers on the table and waiting for our mains..Now I  certainly do not write books on the basic fundamentals of nonviolent communication, but I'm guessing this would not be in the manual. 

Pissing off mamma bear is exactly the last thing you ever want to do.  A better approach may have been to start with  ""Hi guys, Im so happy everyone is having a lovely time at our establishment, happy bday, and I just would like to ask you guys to try and hold, insert name of said child here, happy screams down. The pitch is rather loud and echoing across the other tables thanks again.""  

It certainly soured the evening and I know that it may be a long time before anyone in our group gives this place any business again.",2013-11-27 19:05:06

Because they have upgraded their ""everyday $3 beer"" from Magic Hat #9 to a Black IPA that is just delicious.  The IPA is made specially for Bites and Brews and Buffalo Blues by Penn Brewery.  Try it!

While they still have their simple menu of choosing your own pizza and toppings, salad, or sandwich, they have unfortunately increased their offerings to include overpriced, underwhelming appetizers.  Fried pickle slices or cheesy breadsticks in the shape of a pizza have some potential as good bar snacks, but they're just unappetizing.  

That being said, their original menu is still awesome, and they've expanded their space so finding a place to sit during happy hour isn't as tough.  When the weather is warm, they have tables set up right on Ellsworth.  The beer selection is usually very good, and it's $1 off drafts from 5 - 7pm.",2012-02-21 18:42:49

Being someone who grew up in N.W. Calgary, I was always partial to the YMCA in that area. After moving downtown I was really hesitant on 'switching' Ys. Of course, driving an extra 15-20 minutes just to get to my 'old Y' didn't make sense so I bit the bullet and headed over to the Eau Claire YMCA. Boy am I glad I did!

The staff at this Y is fantastic. They are happy, friendly and super helpful. Plus every morning the good people at this Y set up ALL the lanes in the pool! So instead of having the standard 3 lanes to swim in, there are 6!!!

I love the layout because the gym is spread out on two floors, plus the main floor is where you'll find the pool. There's also a little cafe on premise and on the weekends when you're walking up the stairs to either of the gym floors, all you smell is Belgian Waffles.

First, they pour actual cream on a cold slab. No premade ice cream here. They scrape and mix and add ingredients until the blend is just right. The mixture is then smoothed out and scraped in rows to make all of the rolls. 

My group had the Purple Mace (taro), Bonfire (vanilla, graham crackers, chocolate, and a toasted marshmallow), and the Thai Ice (sold cream Thai tea). They were all tasty. At $5.95 each, it's a not too pricey way to treat yo self to something sweet.

Will still go here for dinner though - I think their care and freshness are still A+ after the lunch crowd leaves.

Been a loyal customer of NCIX since the days of being a contributing member of Redflagdeals forums.  Was a huge computer geek back in the days, building computers for friends and family.  Before NCIX, my usual places for computer parts would be purchased from Canada Computers, PC Village, Infonec, CTY, etc.  Often I would import from outside of Canada just because none of the Canadian stores carry the latest and greatest computer parts that I wanted for my perfect set up.

NCIX has a large selection of sale items weekly, and the website checkout features the price matching option which allows you to match the competitor's price if they are offering the exact same item at a lower price (even if the competitor is in another city and charges shipping!)  I'm surprised the other small guys are still around given the competitive prices and huge selection at NCIX.  

Overall, NCIX is highly recommended for all your computer needs.  Why shop at Future Shop/Best Buy for inferior, overpriced, no name parts when you can get everything you need at NCIX.",2012-02-18 04:49:22

Being brought up in an immigrant household, eating ""traditional Canadian food"" was a big treat from our daily rice and noodles that we grew up with and having hot dogs was one of them.

Walking down Queen Street West we saw Fancy Frank's and decided to try some fancy franks out:). 

They had a variety of gourmet dogs but we settled on a Frank's Coney Island Dog and Franco Y Huevos to try out.  The Coney Dog was good with chili, cheese and onions over the hot dog.  The Franco Y Huevos was a chopped dog with jalapeño, tomatoes onions and eggs mixed all in onto the bun.  It was good but as a traditionalist I love my dogs whole so I can get that snap that an important part of all great hot dogs.

The entrance to the restaurant feels a bit cramped when you first get inside but it is also unique as you are able to see their bakery.  Once we made it to the hostess we were greeted almost immediately and given the selection between sitting inside and sitting outside in the heated patio.  We chose the patio and were able to see almost all of the restaurant on the walk out.  There were a lot of trinkets and items that would make you think of France and the tables were covered in white table clothes.

We decided to get the Feuillete D' Asperges which was described as blanched green asparagus in puff pastry with a Hollandaise sauce.  Whenever it came it was immediately apparent that it was not as it was described as the asparagus was draped over the puff pastry.  My dining companion also mentioned this so I know that it was not my thoughts alone. Regardless of that it still tasted very good and we enjoyed it.  For dinner I decided to have the Steak-Frites.  The presentation of the dish was nice with the fries in a cute little basket.  However I was disappointed with how mushy the fries were.  Whenever I think of frites I think of crunchy fries and these fries not at all.  They did have a good taste to them.  The best part of the entree though was the steak which was juicy and cooked and cooked to a perfect medium.  Whenever it came time for dessert we were presented with both a dessert menu and a list of 2 dozen or so macaroons that they make on the premise.  My dining companion and I decided to split the dessert of the day which ended up being a layered cake with fresh berries.   This was easily the best part of the whole dinner as the cake was moist, the frosting separating the layers cool and the tart of the lemon matched well with the sweetness of the berries.  We also decided to indulge ourselves and each got a macaroon, myself the lavender and my dining companion a basil and lemon or lime.  I enjoyed trying both of them and would like to try some more of their flavors in the future as it is not something that you normally see in Pittsburgh.

The bottom line for me is that I would come back here in the future.  The dessert was easily the best part of the meal although the entree and appetizer was solid too.",2012-04-18 02:56:01

The chicken furikake is battered, deep fried and then glazed in this teriyaki-like sauce.  The batter has a good crunch despite the glaze and it's an addictive dish.  Knowing it's deep fried, I tend to shy away from these types of food, but I can never come to Island Flavor and not order this dish.  

The pulehu ribs has a dry rub versus the kalbi ribs more of a saucy seasoning are both salted heavy.  I always have to order my dish light on the sauce and the chef is more than happy to obliged.  I get an option to have brown rice instead of white rice, and then I replace my mac salad with sautéed vegetables.  This place offers a good medium for me.

It's a great place to spend those gorgeous Las Vegas spring or fall days when the temperature is 70-80 and everyone is out walking around, browsing the stores and making the most of an open air mall.

Unfortunately there are a lot of empty stores, most of the restaurants are mediocre at best and can be easily topped by the already cooked/cooked to order Whole Foods department. Yes, there are a few gems like Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana, Rachel's, and even Balboa Pizza, and I think Ben and Jerry's could be located in a much more visible spot.

I love how the lights on the trees are lit year round, but I was really bummed that they took out the carousel (although I understand it was probably a financial drain) and I'm not looking forward to the increased traffic coming home from the town homes they are building behind Whole Foods.

When the District first open the street was open to traffic, but they nixed that and made it an open walk way. For some reason the new owners think it's a good idea to make it driveable again. It may work for Town Center, but the District isn't that big and all it will lead to is someone getting run over and and barrel load of teenagers and other clowns thinking that cruising through the center of the mall in their beat up Hondas blaring music makes them coolest thing since ice cream.

My friends and I ordered the crab/artichoke dip, hummus dip, guacamole and salsa, and their chicken flat bread from their happy hour menu.  The food was excellent, everything morsel delicious.
The manager came over several times to see if everything was fine which was great.  What fell short was the service provided by the waiter.
He appeared to be completely overwhelmed by a party of twenty, showing up at various times.  
I was there at 5pm and left around 6:30pm, in that span of time I had one drink.  I saw a drink floating by that looked interesting and managed to flag down the waiter.  He told me the Vig did not serve a drink that I was describing which I saw less than 10 mins prior to speaking to him . . . okay- but he did not ask me if I wanted another drink instead.  In the 1 1/2 hours that I was there, pretty much everyone had one order of drink even though quite a few of my fellow Yelpers were saying they would like another of their scrumpious alcoholic beverage.  I was there to eat and to drink- I probably would have had 3 drinks, for sure 2 if the waiter had been more on his toes.

I got the brussel sprouts, beet/quinoa, and spiced chickpeas.

The patio did not disappoint - it's fairly large so it can accommodate a lot of people and they had heat towers too, presumably for when it starts to cool down at night.

The food was pretty average though. I will rave about the queso - they give you so much and unlike most places it doesn't congeal after 15min. The tacos on the other hand weren't that great. The flavors were okay but the steak in one of mine was very dry and the mahi mahi taco was very lack-luster. Definitely not $4-5 tacos in my opinion.

And I don't mean it in a good way. We had such an unbelievably bad experience that I can't even begin to comprehend how things could have been this ridiculous. It was so terrible that we never even made it to a room and thus this review is based purely on our attempted check-in experience.

We arrived at the Trump around 12:45 a.m. on a Friday night. After sitting in two hours of barely moving traffic en route from San Diego, making our five hour drive a seven hour drive, we were exhausted. All I wanted was to relax in a nice, comfortable bed and regroup for the next day. Instead, we end up sitting in the lobby for not one, not two, but THREE hours! Here's the story:

We check in at 12:45 and the front desk says it will be 15 to 30 minutes until our room is ready. This in itself seems ridiculous. In a hotel with over a thousand rooms, how do they not have a single room ready for check in? Plus, we had booked our room in advance. Check in is around 4 p.m. It should have been ready hours ago! But we decide to take it all in stride and go to the bar for a drink. 

An hour goes by. We go back to talk to the man at front desk. He apologizes and assures us that our room will be ready shortly. He says that we are fourth in line and the cleaner was in our room at the moment. He offers us $25 to use at the bar and an additional $50 on our room key once we receive it. He also says that he would upgrade our room to a suite at no charge.

At this point, it's closing in on 2 a.m. By the time we get to the bar, it was closing (didn't realize bars closed in Vegas) and the bartender offered us free beer for all the hassle. We continue to sit in the lobby, along with several other groups of people, and time continues to tick by. 

Around 3 a.m. we go to the front desk again. The line takes about 30 minutes, as there are already several complaints in front of ours. We finally find out that there was a ""situation"" and our room is still not ready. They can't tell us what the ""situation"" is or explain how a single ""situation"" could cause us to wait for a room for three hours. We finally were offered a room at the Palazzo. The Trump arranged for a car to drive us to the hotel, which is a couple long Vegas blocks away. But before we could leave, we had to reclaim our baggage, which had been loaded on a cart to take to our room. When we asked for our baggage, the girl instead brought our car, which we were going to pick up the next day. 

Eventually, after 4 a.m., we were dropped off at the Palazzo and were able to check in and be in bed by 4:30 a.m.

I have no idea how a hotel can be so incredibly disorganized and deceitful. We didn't appreciate being lied to on several occasions about when our room would be ready and it was absolutely ridiculous how they didn't have a single room ready. 

Needless to say, we won't be returning to the Trump Hotel.",2012-09-26 00:18:34

Well, I think I was more into the historic meaning and longest running Mexican restaurant. I set the bar too high. I did however give a try to this mom & pop establishment. The woman who said she was the owner (theresa) was actually rude. She made comments I couldn't believe. A little girl was calling her name to tell her good by and to thank her for the food and she ignored her only finally to tell her ""I'm busy not now"". I was heartbroken for the little girl. 

The place is very small inside. They have booths along the walls and tables in the middle. I would recommend calling before heading down because they aren't open every night. In fact, they are open nights on Friday and Saturday and it is just until 9 pm. 

We started with a ""Cheese Quesadilla"". So simple yet so overpriced.
She also brought us some chips and 2 kinds of salsas. I have to admit, the salsa wasn't the best. I ordered a combo platter that had a ""Cheese Enchilada with Onions"" and a ""Guacamole Tostada"" which also came with the normal beans and rice. These beans weren't normal though they are thick not runny and I would like that if they just had so,e flavor. I asked for my Enchilada to be made with a flour tortilla and it was big and very yummy. The guacamole was not fresh and frozen. I don't know if that is a regular thing or if she was out of avocados. Gross. The other 2 in my group enjoyed there meals too but, agreed the salsa and rice could use some help. The rice seemed like it was leftover and re-heated. Very dry.

We capped the night off with some ""Sopapillas and Honey"". This by far was the best part of the night. 

Meals range from $10 and up. They have a Beer and Wine liquor license so if you order a margarita it will be made with wine.

I don't plan on visiting here again anytime soon. This is noted as the oldest Mexican restaurant in Vegas. There are certain tables that have ""reserved"" on them for local lawyers such as Richard Harris and a few others who escape up to 3 times a week from their downtown office to have some lunch or even conduct a business meeting.",2012-10-23 14:45:34
Q9xejpSgHob2NAY2yI0JHA,XPG7ps_Q9iSlxc-fi8py9w,zcFP7ObRK5vVUoLol8anng,4,2,0,4,"The STM is a superb subway system.  It is quiet, clean, well run, well staffed, efficient and cost effective.  Although it stacks up favourably to most of the worlds transit systems, for the purposes of this review, I'd like to compare it to the Toronto system - The TTC.

Coverage:  The STM casts a wide net over Montreal.  Considerably wider than that of the TTC.  

The Trains: Although the cars are somewhat smaller they are invariably cleaner, better lit and offer a much smoother ride.  They also manage NOT to damage your eardrums every time they stop in a station.

The Stations: Even the rattiest STM station is still pretty OK and they are mostly kind of well, grand.  Pretty much the opposite of the whole Soviet surplus vibe going on in the TTC


Fares: $3 a fare for a one shot deal for both systems - However, the day pass on the STM is $8 compared to $10 for the TTC.  The STM shines a bit brighter in terms of offering a 3 day pass for $16 and a prepaid card system for both regular riders and frequent visitors. 

So - pretty much across the board - advantage STM",2011-09-12 03:19:32

I like how the rooms were cleaned and there was ample amount of seating available. The pole in the room was a nice added touch, too. It has been a while since I've gone out for karaoke with friends so I was excited to sing my heart out and down shots of soju.

They had a large selection of songs to choose from and we had a hard time deciding since our time was limited and there was quite a few of us. We had a blast singing and dancing along while sippin' on some flavored sake. I usually enjoy soju (or sochu) at karaoke joints which they didn't have, but flavored sake is just as good and sure hit the spot. We had several carafes of the Mango, Cucumber and Pomegranate. Mango was my favorite since I'm a sucker for Mango but the Cucumber was refreshing and the Pomegranate wasn't bad either. 

I thought the rooms were outrageously pricy,though. $150 an hour for a large room. But given that there aren't really any private room karaoke spots available out here I can see how they can charge such price and have people actually pay it. I think there are two others private room karaoke places but one caters to a chinese clientele with very limited english songs and the other is a brand new one in chandler that I have not explored yet so i don't know too much details on it. So for now, I guess it's pretty much the only private room karaoke spot I know of here. I hope more spots open up around here cause I had a blast and would love to do it again but I wouldn't wanna pay $150 an hour for a room.

I got to try:

-crab royale (crab cake was AMAZING, one of the best I've had)
-some bourbon barbecue ribs (cooked well, smoky, falling off the bone, ribs could have been warmer and sauce could have been a smidge hotter but was very flavorful)
-the eggs/cornbread/brisket Benedict (5/5 entree, loved the slightly fatty brisket and sweet cornbread)
-calamari (pretty standard but good sauce)
-savory chive biscuit (honestly so good, didn't need the butter and a good-sized biscuit)
-praline brownie (very moist and great topping - gluten-free, by the way)

So at Rice Paper the apps are $6, highly recommend the Fire Cracker shrimp (especially if you like something with a spicy kick to it). The calamari with the dipping sauce is delicious as well! The rolls are $1 off and we ate the Spicy Asian, Surf n Turf and the Salmon roll which were all delicious!

I think maybe my only complaint is that some works seem out of place.  I'm not a big fan of putting paintings exhibiting armor in the room with the armor.  I don't care to look at things like armor, so then I'm going to miss that painting.  Small complaint though, I'm sure that doesn't bother most people.

My friend went with a grilled onion cheeseburger. It was enormous!! She said it was very tasty. It looked great! It was a little greasy and started falling apart at the end so she was eating it with a fork. A burger isn't a good burger if it isn't a little greasy, amiright?

I'll start by saying Australia does have Tommy Bahamas, but to tell the truth you would never really know they were there. Most are located in very high volume tourist areas that locals never swing by. So my general experiences have been from this location.

Strolling through the retail section I would say that maybe some of the gear isn't in my age bracket just yet. That's not to say older fashion beach and boating wear isn't cool. ""Bow ties are cool"" so who am I to judge.

Now for the few happy hours that I been to here. Id like to say I was impressed with the menu and range they had. Sitting out on the patio we grabbed the sliders, seafood tacos
And a Mai Tai.

All were great, the sliders had a great tasting  bun which I was informed was Hawaiian bread. The tacos had a slight spice kick to them with half decent Mai tai that to be honest didn't really hit the mark.

The service wasn't too bad, seating and the server both were prompt delivering dishes and clearing tables with smile. High chairs and a kids menu are also provided but the menu is full of deep fried stuff which I'm not a huge fan of..

It has very mixed reviews on Yelp - like the chef hasn't quite trained his staff to be spot on if he takes a day off, and the guests with bad reviews were going in on his day off...   And mixed reviews on service, too.  I'm happy to report, we had a spot on server - and the owners were circulating throughout service.  Although, they didn't come to our table -- and they should have actually visited everyone...had it been my restaurant.

For food, my friend mentioned their soups were dynamite - and that jived with Yelp's general consensus - so we both ordered the daily: today's was lobster corn and it was terrific.  Would have been better with a few chopped chives and a dash of paprika.  And wine.   I would have loved a nice chardonnay with it. (but that's not an oversight of the kitchen...) 

For lunch we shared - I got the puffy tacos, one of each - and she got the tomato/mozz flatbread.  

The pork puffy was by far the best - but for what it's worth, the steak taco, was filet.  I was surprised.  The chicken was pulled roast chicken which I'd normally have been thrilled about - but relative to the pork and beef, it was bland.  As an appetizer, it would be too big - as lunch, it's plenty - even better to share, if you're having their soup. 

The flatbread was frankly awful.  Bad, storebought (or horrible dough recipe crust), overly thick tomato sauce, a slice of underripe out of season tomato topped with a perfectly lovely, but inexpensive fresh mozzarella melted over it.  It was something a teenager could have pulled off as an afterschool snack - not a $10+ lunch entree. The rectangle was pre cut into 6 pieces - and then run under the salamander to melt the cheese.  Mediocre ingredients do not get better with a trip under the salamander.  They just became a hot mess.   I want to throttle restaurants who think customers don't know better...

That said, it's not enough to to keep me away.  I'd go back -- but definitely stay away from their flatbreads - and explore a few other things that seemed interesting.  

From what my friend says, the bar is packed and fun on the weekends.  It really is the only place off strip that I've been to that  has a real urban vibe - and I'm thrilled about that -- also, no horrible poker machines, no stinky cigarette smell.  It's a real restaurant.  Light bright, airy and open.  Finally.  Somebody's trying to get it right.

Check for lunch - no wine for 2 was $40 including tip.   Pricey.  Hopefully they'll keep tweaking their menu and knock off the dishes that sully a first visit... because they definitely have some dishes that look like they're 'knocked out of the park' winners.",2011-01-20 23:07:26

Unfortunately, every time I call to get an appointment they claim she's not there and they don't tell me when she'll be back and therefore I'm forced to see someone else. Now those other folks are pretty good don't get me wrong but they aren't Annie good! She takes her time and makes sure my gel manis look amazing and even! 
I was very disappointed in my last visit because of a couple reasons. The quality of my manicure was horrible the last time I went. It started to peel three days after I got them done. The color didn't match what was on the nail samples. I chose a blood red and it came out fuchsia. The lady claimed it was because of the lighting. The edges were super uneven and my nail shape was not what I asked for. My nails were left extremely thin because of all the filing she kept doing instead of soaking the previous gel polish off. I did ask her plenty of times to fix the issues I didn't like. Which she would then start speaking a different language and would get rough on my nails. At that point I was just over the entire visit and was ready to go. 
I ended up going elsewhere to fix the issues with that manicure. Unless I'm able to get Annie I don't think I'll ever be back.",2016-09-12 14:36:48

Also on aside note there are a few religious references including in the name of this joint so if religious references irritate you that is a heads up. I'm cool with all religious stuff so whatever. The service was great and one of the highlights for me is no cork fees, whhhaaat??? That is a first for me . As  far as the food went I'm not sure if it was anything was all that special. Our table tried just about every appetizer and those were by far the stand out dishes, they were  nice portions and very flavorful. Now the main courses aren't for people avoiding carbs as the only options are the pasta dishes. I mean the place is in a pasta factory so what would you expect, right?? The pasta dish that I thought stood out among all the options was the rabbit dish it was very savory and recommend that to anybody who isn't adverse to chowing down on bugs bunny. all the other dishes were actually quite bland and was disappointed that there wasn't options as far as  ordering a dish with a different style of pasta.

I had been eagerly awaiting their opening for months, and last night the time finally came to sample their food. 

I ordered their classic cheeseburger for $6 which came with lettuce, pickle, tomato and burger sauce. The ingredients were fresh and of excellent quality, and it was reassuring to see that their burger patties were homemade and not frozen.

The burger tasted amazing, was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Their other items include double cheeseburgers ($8) and hand cut fries ($3). They also have a family combo (four burgers and fries) for $30 which is pretty hard to beat. 

Inside is pretty basic with a diner-inspired decor. There are a couple of seats for those who wish to eat in, but it's really a no-frills kind of place which I can definitely appreciate.

While my waistline might not agree, I'm really glad they've finally opened and can't wait to try the other items on the menu.

I visited this place with a couple of friends. I ordered the chicken schnitzel with cucumber salad (special request for salad because it wasn't an option in the menu). Normally it comes with spaetzle or mashed potatoes.  My friend ordered the veal schnitzel and another friend ordered the meat perogies.  The food was definitely ""a-ok"" but I didn't like that the schnitzel was sitting on top of a wet cucumber salad which made the schnitzel soggy.  They gave a lot of cucumber salad which was very tasty and included a lot of dill.  The portions were large as well.

The atmosphere was family-style. My friend who had come when it was ""Schnitzeland"" had mentioned that the atmosphere was better before as it seemed more ""cool"" and modern...but I supposed they probably wanted to make the restaurant more family-friendly. Majority of the clientele who come here seems to be Eastern European as well, so it must be authentic...?

Service was good. They pour water for you when you run out and are generally attentive.

Pricing is comparable to other restaurants that sell schnitzel, but I found it to be a tad on the pricier side.

All in all, I'd return here again.",2014-12-11 20:54:06

The side includes garden salad, seaweed salad and glass noodle salad.

However, when I later in the day went to the Nissan Pinnacle store I had a poorer experience. I was assisted by Noel who was good, told me as I dropped off my tire for review that it would take a few hours as everyone was on lunch and he'd call me. After a few hours back home, heard nothing to say whether it was repairable or needed replacement. I called and was told it needed replacement and they didn't have any tires available. I was disappointed to hear this as they are Nissan dealership and I have a Rogue, probably their most common car. I said I needed it today and would come pick up my car (driving on my spare). When I arrived I noted in the boot of my car that the damaged tire had just been thrown in the back on top off my items in the boot and also on top of the plastic cover which sits on top of the spare tire, all damaged and warped. It was clear they were unimpressed that I had said I would take it elsewhere I needed it resolved on the day as I am driving interstate tomorrow. I was shocked at the care and they asked me if they could wash it for me and never did. I then went to Discount Tires around the corner after a colleague recommended, they fixed the tire in less than an hour after Nissan told me it was un-repairable. I have to say extremely disappointed at the lack of care of Nissan Pinnacle and considering I purchased the car new from them with the top of the line car protection through Nissan to be told it was un-repairable was a lie and clearly they were unwilling to even put the tire back in its place instead just throwing it in the boot on top of everything. I will not go back here, if I have tire issues, strongly recommend Discount Tyres on Frank Lloyd. They were excellent and Free to repair.",2018-08-31 16:20:27

Custom pizzas are approx 9"" and for $8.95 and you can choose unlimited toppings!!! They have an excellent selection of high quality fresh toppings. Some of my favorites FRESH mozzarella, roasted garlic, bacon, sliced meatballs, chorizo, caramelized onions, and fresh basil to name just a few!!! That's only about 1/3 of their vast selection. 

You start by choosing your dough original, wheat, or gluten free. FYI, they use double zero flour which is pretty much the best flour that $ can buy for thin crust pizzas. After you choose your dough it is hand stretched and shaped in front of you on a marble slab. You then choose from 4 different sauces (spicy diavolo is really good IMO). Then choose your cheese(s) from fresh mozz, asiago, gorgonzola, and parmesan. Now on to the bounty of toppings! The pizzas cook very fast in the 700 degree oven. You'll be biting into your custom built creation within a couple of minutes after paying. 

I really LOVE the high quality ingredients, large selection of toppings, but above all the CRUST!!! Their crust is a thin Neapolitan that is slightly charred and crispy on the bottom and chewy in the middle. Awesome! A bit more bite than a NY style crust, but still thin enough to really let the toppings do their thing. Anyone who's eaten at settebello or due forni (unless you chose the roman crust at d.forni) has had this kind of crust. I think their pizza is better than due forni by leaps and bounds (other than the originality of pizza toppings and flavors). Settebello is great in its own right, but I would give custom built just a slight edge. I think the crust is slightly better and a better selection of toppings.",2012-06-11 22:48:39

I should probably say that my husband grew up on a ranch, and I have been to many, so I am coming from that viewpoint. Were parts dirty and smelly? Yes. Is that every single ranch on the planet? Yes!

We got the $10 wristbands and headed in to the show in the saloon. It was silly and hokey, but fun, and not too long with lots of audience participation. I will admit, my husband and I enjoyed it more than the kids,  so maybe adults who didn't grow up in the techie age will appreciate old time silly entertainment like that.

Next we headed to the petting zoo. Lots of people have commented on the animals in cages, and yes, it does tug at the heart a little, but I choose to think those are not kidnapped from the wild type animals, but instead wouldn't make it in the wild, being cared for there, animals. My kids loved the variety of animals they had, and especially loved petting the deer. 

After that we walked through the various buildings that housed wild west type stuff which was interesting to look at, the mine, which was pretty neat, and the wax museum which was kind of hokey, but still cool, and for some reason, super dark, which actually made walking through more fun :)

To finish up, we headed to the pond, which had tons of ducks and turtles, which the kids loved and past it to where there were more peacocks and peahens then I have ever seen anywhere. The kids were in heaven with that!

So, for those that don't know, this is probably one of the best breakfast specials in town.  For $1.99 you get two eggs however you want, two slices of toast (or an English muffin), two slices of bacon (or sausage) and home fries.

And it is ALL delicious.  I've ordered a couple of different combinations and I have some custom requests (eggs fried over hard, bacon extra crispy, home fries extra crispy) and it always comes out correct.

So, why 4 out of 5?  Sometimes the service can be godawful slow in the mornings... and I don't mean the chef.  When you're trying to get in and get out, that can prove to be a challenge.

5 for $5.95 deal offers a 1/3 lb burger+fries, chicken Caesar salad, a mini pizza and two other things that I can't remember.  I got the burger and honestly, from the other reviews, I didn't really expect too much.

Finally, grab a bite to eat or a drink at AZ88 or Distrito, both of which border the mall. All in all, you can't go wrong at the Civic Center Mall!",2012-11-04 15:02:22

We settled with JaJangmyun (black bean noodles), Ddeokbokki (spicy rice cake) combo and Bimbimbap. 

During our wait, we were served with some tasty sides and warm corn tea. 
The combo tastes good but I prefer a spicier version of spicy rice cake in personal. Maybe I will let the waiter know my preferences when I make my order. 

The meal is decent and the only drawback is the quality of the rice. The rice is not fresh and tend to be way too ""soft"". I am referring to the Bimbimbap I ordered.

Hosted my son's 6th bday in the cosmic bowling area for 25 - kids & adults. The kids bowled first, since we had to get them shoe'd up, bumpers & smaller-sized bowling balls; we ordered drinks & started snacking, leaving time for the kids to eat after they bowled w/ the adults settled in. The timeline worked out perfect for us. 

For food, we went with: 
- Fresh Fruit Tray -very fresh pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries & blackberries; this is a huge colorful tray & loved it

-Caesar Salad - Crisp with dressing on the side- loved the dressing, was surprisingly tasty as I didn't know what to expect

-Baked Ziti -  this was also really surprisingly pleasing & a crowd favorite

-Pizzas - I didn't try personally, but the first order was gobbled up so we ordered a second round that was also destroyed

Overall, our hosts were super accommodating, worked with us within our budget & even helped us extend our party so that we could open gifts with family after everyone bowled/played in the arcade. A+ service!

We added on the 2 hour game cards. If you rent the bowling area, I'd skip the games. First of all, it's a madhouse & hard to keep track of the little ones. We could have just bowled w/ everyone (disclaimer: because we had so many adults, it was fun for the kids to clear out for awhile so adults had some space to bowl). The timed game cards are confusing- they don't work on many games & no tickets. The solution would be to get the paid game cards that play for tickets. I heard the cocktails were light but wines & beers appeased - I would stick with the mid-level bar tickets over the premium & next time - also comes w/ a variety of soft drinks in the package, refills included.

Let me start with these pulled pork nachos; this is not something you will regret except maybe being really full after. They use a white cheese and it is absolutely delicious. The giant dollop of guacamole on top does not disappoint, but the pulled pork is a little bit dry. The nachos could use a bit more of a kick perhaps in the queso, but they are a little pieces of jalapeno sprinkled throughout, although a bottle of Cholula at the table wouldn't be a bad idea. 

Secondly, these sweet potato fries are some of the best around the downtown area in that they are thick cut, but crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. A giant plate of them came with some kind of mayonnaise based sauce with a little bit of a spice, and it complimented the fries well.

LOVE, LOVE their coconut shrimp.  Not bready at all.  Big juicy shrimp, butterflyed and coated with coconut shreds... lightly fried ....NOT greasy at all.

They have a number of grea fish entrees so if you would like a nice fish dinner... head here.  (However, it's NOT cheap... so plan on paying a few bucks.)

Ambiance is tropically but not ""beachy""... it feels like a nice resort.
They do have patio seating so if it's nice outside definitely try to get an outside seat so you can people watch.

Also, if you are looking for a place to host a party like birthday, retirement, baby shower, bridal shower, etc.... ask about their back room.  It's behind the bar and totally private.  TB does a really nice job with private parties so I recommend it.  (Just attended a baby shower there and it was beautiful!)

The service deteriorated fist, but food caught up with it over some time. It happened a lot when our orders were not prepared and other people's orders got delivered to our table. The waiters mostly look like they are doing you a huge favor by pouring some tea after the 100's request.
Food used to be alright for the AUCE* place, now it averaged to the lower end of the all-you-can-eat spectrum. There actually is a difference between dishes made for AUCE customers and for a la cart. In the latest you get a little bit more fish and it is executed somewhat more accurate. The last few times I have noticed that the fish is no longer the freshest and I can only imagine what goes into their  maki and temaki. One of our friends actually complained once about having a food poisoning after going to dinner.
So, why 2 stars then? First, I still can navigate my way around the menu and compose a decent order(though mostly for take out these days) and second, they are still rather on a cheap side, given my appetite I manage to fit into 20-25$ bill for 2. 
Also the decor is interesting though it starts to show some wear the tear and  yes, they do deliver around Thornhill. 

Anyway, if you are used to eating sushi at the mall kiosks and other AUCEs this place is ok with lunch at 12.99(till 4:30) and dinner at 18.99, but if you know better my advise would be to go somewhere else.

We ordered a team lunch here for pick-up and everyone enjoyed the food It seemed to have made it all accurately. 

THE BAD:
The reason I took off three stars is because not only was the staff was cold and standoffish, the manager was SO rude! I went up to the counter to pick up the order and a couple team members (who were standing around doing nothing) just stared over at me like, ""Uhh what do you want?"" No, ""Can I help you with something?"" or ""Are you here for a pick-up order?"" Just stares. 

I was picking up the order for someone else from my team so I wasn't sure what name it was under. I tried our business name first and they asked annoyed, ""You mean (NAME)?"" Sidebar: I'm guessing ours was the only group order. They could have just asked, ""Is it possibly under (NAME) instead?""

Then, the manager walked by with a black crate, which I actually didn't realize it was for me because she passed right by me at the counter without looking over or acknowledging me at all. She set down the crate on a table behind me and it was then that I realized she wasn't restocking something or bringing a random crate to the trash. (How would I know? She didn't even make eye contact with me.) I turned around and asked, ""Is that my order?"" She just stared at me, annoyed, like ""Obviously, you idiot,"" and didn't say a word. I walked up to her and she repeated over and over how many times she checked the order, so basically, ""It's all there. Don't double-check my work, just leave.""

Here is the basic process.  You go to coolers and get little foam containers which each contain small portions of various raw foods.  You bring those back and cook them on a wok full of liquid what has flavor added to it.   You have two halves so you can decide to have half spicy half regular.  You add the raw items and wait for the water to boil and then you guess if it's cooked long enough.  Most of it cooks very fast because it's mostly seafood.    There is also a really wide selection of sauces you can select while your first food is boiling.  This place is not for people who have trouble with basic cooking just from a food safety perspective.  There is risk of cross contamination from mixing utensils and raw ingredients.

The selection of food is actually quite impressive as is the possible combinations of sauces.  I was there for lunch which is about $16.  I understand they do some different things on a different station at night,   Lunch section included various vegetables, tofu, dumplings, noodles, pork, beef, liver, raw eggs, crab leg clusters, clams, squid, octopus, salmon, salmon belly, white fish could be tilapia, mussels, and probably a few more I forgot.

In all it's a good meal.  I can see this could take forever if 4 people were sharing one cooker.

What makes Mantra Masala stand out from other Indian restaurants is the fact that the food you are served is not coated in oil/ghee. 

Lunch specials here are less than $10 (from $6-$10). I get the lunch for the hungry vegetarian (I think). 

It comes with a bowl of tomato soup....a touch of cream and spice in a rich broth. Very nice start to the meal. 

The entree itself is :

1. naan - very soft, fluffy, warm and tasty. No oily residue or butter on it so I don't feel too bad having all that carb

2. Rice - the rice is basmati but this is the part of the meal I dislike...it masquerades as pulau/briyani but it tasted to bland. I usually leave most of the rice

3. Eggplant Dish - Ok...this is THE BEST ever. It's soooo good...slightly spicy, creamy and yet still keeping a texture....the right combination of flavors. I can eat this curry bu itself

4. Spinach and Potato Dish - This is a nice and simple dish that tastes good. 

I have ordered another vegetarian set lunch that was supposed to come with garbanzo beans (channa) curry. However, apparently they don't ever serve it. Instead it comes with a vegetable dish that I remember as being pretty bad.

I've ordered gulab jamun here once and it tasted very good. 

I have never been here for dinner so I can't speak to the prices and dishes in the evening but this is an ideal place to have a good, inexpensive Indian lunch that doesn't feel like you just gorged on 2 sticks of butter.",2010-06-15 21:58:50

Upon visiting CPWM today, now I found out that they also carry Bundaberg Ginger Beer. I only discovered Bundaberg on my recent trip to Australia. My cousin actually works for them.

I'm just saying my personal thought on my experience.  Went here for the first time ever after seeing they just opened.  I got a single steakburger while the hubby got a original double, no fries, and a plain chocolate double scoop dish.  Total price just under $12.  

Let me say that now I've tried Freddy's I'll just go across the street for McDonald's McDouble and drive back across the other way for a Wendy's frosty for less than half the price.  I only say this because the food tasted exactly like these or worse.

Not very original tasting.  I would go to Smashburger, Culver's, In-n-Out, and Five Guys before going here again.

I saw someone also got no lettuce on their burger.  I also don't know if I missed something, but our burgers came with pickle, onion, and mustard.  It tasted.....boring.  The custard really, really, really just tasted like a thicker Wendy's frosty.

I gave an extra star because the food seemed to be of fresh ingredients which is a good thing.  But I have had better.  This just didn't stick out as WOW to me.

Also, don't park around the drive thru.  We went through the drive through and the line blocks several cars from trying to get out.  People had to wait a long time.

Went here on a Saturday night.  it's located in the University district, not the easiest to find.  It's open late which I guess is a bonus. Parking is hard to find on the street.

Upon entering, staff were very friendly, telling us which pizza came out of the oven recently.  Most of the slices looked like they had been sitting there for awhile.  We ordered a couple of freshly made slices ($4 each) which were the Canadian with bacon, mushrooms, and pepperoni.  Slices are pretty big in size.  They threw slices in he oven for 5 minutes.  Upon them coming out, I took a bite of one and was not impressed.  Crust was too crispy on the bottom (it's thin to begin with anyway).  All I could taste was garlic in the sauce--gross.  As if they just sprinkled cheap garlic powder in the sauce, it totally ruined the pizza.  Toppings didn't seem of any good quality and did not taste fresh.

Largely influence by South American flavors and the concept of shared plates, I was super excited to finally try them.

Love how the change the place by just adding to the basic of the previous Keriwa Café (compare to here) just by changing the color of the bar and light fixtures.
Love the old crates used as the bar shelves, love it with the lighting.

 We decided to go ahead with their 8 course tasting menu plus a Caipirinha cocktail at $45pp, but there wasn't a menu for it and the chef will serve you what he felt like (on and off menu).

Caipirinha
~ Cachaca, Lime, Simple Syrup, Sugar Cane
~ We got the classic lime and passion fruit flavors, I usually like anything passion fruit flavor but this was obviously not the real fruit so it was rather sweet and we both prefer the classic lime version a lot better.
~ Also love how it came with an actual piece of sugar cane that you get to chew on.

Cheese Bread (Pao De Queijo)
~ Requejao Cheese Sauce
~ Love Brazilian cheese bread, I can probably munch on this all day long.

Croquettes
~ Cumari Pepper Aioli

 Ceviche
~ Crispy Leeks, Sweet Corn, Taro Chips

House Green Salad
~ Pomegranate, Coalho Cheese, Molasses
~ Love the freid cheese, the pomegranate and even the dressing but wish there was a little bit less of it since it was a tad too sweet but love the use of molasses here which goes so well with the cheese.

Espumante Coconut Caiparinha $12

~ Cachaca, Egg White, Coconut Water, Simple Syrup, Lime, Muddled Malaguetta Pepper, Toasted Coconut Flakes
~ This was the only item we added to the tasting menu, this is a fancier version of our first cocktail and love every part of it. Love the texture and flavor from the added toasted coconuts and the spice from the Malaguetta pepper was just the perfect balance.

Tapioca Cubes
~ Love love love love this, I can much on these everyday. I have a love for grilled/fried rice (like the Yakionigiri here) and this one was even better with it's chewy texture which was almost like a fried mochi.

Beef Pastel
~ Love the flakiness of the pastry and it was perfect with the hot sauces

Quinoa Risotto
~ Wild Mushrooms, White Truffle Oil
~ OMG, this is probably the dish that everyone keeps talking about after eating here and it was amazing given that there's not even cream in it.
 ~ Love the intense mushroom flavors and the creamy ""no-cream"" goodness. Being a big fan of quinoa and mushroom, I couldn't have ask for more and this dish definitely made my day.

Picanha Sliders
~ Malagueta Aioli, Catupiry Cheese, Caramelized Onion
~ Thought the beef was slightly too well done for my taste but the aioli, onion and cheese made up for everything.
~ By now, we were really full and was glad that it was a slider so that we have room for dessert,.

Tapioca Crème Caramel
~ The Tapioca Creme Caramel was so good with the shredded coconut on top.

Avocado Crème Brulée
~ While I was excited about the avocado creme brulée, it was a bit weird tasting to me.
~ There was too much lemon in the avocado which didn't really go well with the sweet caramel top crust, but that's really my personal opinion.

Cumari, Bode and Malgueta Hot Sauces
~ Love the first 2 a lot, spicy goodness that goes with most of their dishes.

Verdict :
~ Love everything we had and would love to go back to try the rest of the menu, maybe for brunch too.
~ The decor and service is just as amazing.
~ If you haven't been, I highly recommend you to try the tasting menu which is an amazing deal

Beef short rib stew green chiles, fried egg, cornbread 14. It was a lengthy decision but I had to hurry up because the lunch rush was starting up and the house soon was going to be hopping.

If you read Phoenix Magazine, my lunch was featured on the cover.

I started with the corn bread. This bread was the bomb. Moist, golden brown and would spring back just a bit upon the touch. I could taste a little jalapeño heat. It was wonderful. I easily could have had another piece of bread.

Now the hearty beef bowl. Even tho I would have preferred to have this dish on a cool crisp day, that just ain't happening for a while longer. The gravy was just right. The brown meat was perfect. There was other stuff in there but I didn't pick at it to study, I just ate. There was a little time for the different flavors to mingle & marry as they rocked the palate. Loved the egg over easy.

Thank you Jason for taking care of me.",2011-09-08 01:22:22

I've been to Mickie's a few times now, trying to give it a few chances to redeem itself in my eyes. Unfortunately, I find the food too greasy and just not that flavorful. I also think the portion sizes are ridiculously large. Normally I like big portions, but I really don't think eggs reheat or keep well as leftovers, so in this case it is a downside.

The atmosphere is a bit crazy, as it's always super busy, and the food simply doesn't impress me. The scrambles and omelets are way too heavy, with what seems like 3-4 eggs, tons of cheese, and a whole ton of grease. Not the way I like to start my day. Everything is oozing cheese and gravy and oil, but none of it really tastes like much. I always have to add black pepper and hot sauce, and it still often tastes like it could use more flavor. The food also in general seems like it's not fresh at all, either coming out of a box or a can and reheated or mixed in with eggs.

We all remember playing dogdeball during elementry school, if you don't, it's probably b/c you got hit too many times in the head playing the game. This place takes dodgeball to the next level by adding a trampoline. 

You're either thinking two things before you start, hella great time or hell of alot of injuries just waiting to happen. Fortunately no one got seriously injured but I will tell you that you can easily roll an ankle on the trampoline b/c I did. 

I came to this place for a birthday party, there was 20 ppl which came out to $20 per person for 1 hour of fun. It is best to make a reservation that way you and your crew have the one area to yourself and don't have to worry about randoms joining in. 

The dodgeball court consists of 12 trampolines on the ground and then trampolines and nets on the side to bounce off of or to catch you from falling off. Jumping on those trampolines is an absolute workout and then when you add the dodgeball aspect to it, it is just insanely exhausting. Besides the dodgeball arena there are foam pits you can jump into via trampoline to practice all your flips and gymnastic abilities.

When I first heard about this place, the first thing I though of was slamball, trampoline basketball. The guy there said that they are unsure if they are going to add it to their facility but if enough people ask for it it will most likely happen.

I will definitely be back here to play dodgeball and hopefully slamball will be added to the mix.",2012-04-12 03:44:49

Update 4-11-14:

Wow I am seriously pissed now.

My mid-2010 Macbook Pro, as it turns out, was built with a manufacturing defect regarding the wiring to the battery damaging the top case that holds my keyboard. I found out that my old and what was supposed to be a RELIABLE laptop intermittantly has issues with the keyboard and trackpad. It just randomly stops working!

Let me repeat that... both my keyboard and trackpad RANDOMLY STOPS WORKING! As in, not responding at all. The keys are still backlit with that trendy white lighting underneath the keys, and my Logitech mouse that I have owned for two years still responds, but I cannot type shit now. Tried moving my trackpad, nothing works. Only my aftermarket mouse does anything. 

I noticed that a quick fix would be to close and reopen the lid, but so far I only managed to try this once because I am in the middle of a assignment at school. It happened before weeks ago, and back then I did a hard-restart by holding down the power button. 

Searching Google on the topic, I was appalled to learn that this issue has been prevalent for SIX YEARS! In fact, according to a lengthy TWENTY FIVE PAGE technical support thread on the Apple Discussion Board, the most recent posting was on April 10th, 2014, and the EARLIEST post regarding similar issues was in January 27th, 2008!

Here is the link: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1365569?start=0&tstart=0

That would be (according to a date-calculator), 6 years, 2 months, and 14 days that this issue has been prominent and UNRESOLVED as a manufacturing defect! In other words, 2,265 days have passed and the manufacturing issue has still NOT BEEN CORRECTED!

Skimming through each page of the 6+ year forum post, the majority of the culprits points towards the shoddy manufacturing of the Top Case, Battery Wiring as well as the Battery itself. Over use, the battery has a tendency to expand, pressing and damaging the wiring against the bottom of the Top Case (it's what goes over your keys on your laptop). 

Average price for the repair, which is NOT A GUARANTEED FIX?!? $310 to $400.

Are you fucking kidding me?!? A design flaw like this is worthy of a RECALL, something along the priority of General Motors and faulty ignition switches. 

My laptop is 4 years old, I have no intention of buying a new MacBook Pro because recent posts in the forum discussion shows that even brand new post 2013 models with Retina Display also suffers from the keyboard/trackpad shutdown issues. 

I have invested $1,100 of my student loan money in the year of 2010 to purchase this laptop, that I expect to be streamlined with what I thought was going to be SUPERIOR engineering and design. A additional $200 for AppleCare that has already expired roughly 1 or 2 years ago. 

I am not spending a additional more-than-a-third of the original value of the laptop just to fix a design flaw that gets in the way of my studies (I take online classes as well, which often have TIMED EXAMS, I need every minute to ensure that I achieve grades that are reflective of the effort I put into my studies, ""disconnections"" caused by me closing and reopening the lid to make sure my laptop keyboard works again IS NOT A ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE for a lower grade according to my Accounting syllabus). 

I will not tolerate faulty design anymore. You can read my older reviews of Apple Stores and Apple Inc. to learn of my frustrations with dealing with this company. 

Instead of spending $400 to make my keys work reliably, I am going to spend that money on a netbook that is not made by Apple.

Shortly from the time I post this review, I will upload photos of similar frustrations reflected by other MBP users from the forum post.",2014-04-12 01:46:26

The sound quality is pretty good and you can pretty much be guaranteed a decent show at this venue. 

One thing I really like about this venue is that there are 3 bars serving alcohol so you can get a drink fairly easily. The one thing I dislike about this venue is the location, it is not completely out of the way but I would prefer if it were a little more central, also the area is a little bit seedy (sketchy strip-club across the street).

I love teppanyaki probably more than I should and definitely more than anyone in my family so I don't get to go as often as I would like.  I mean it's dinner AND a show!  How can it NOT be awesome with fancy food tricks, fried rice, shrimp, and steak?  Mix in some saki bombers and you can't go wrong.

For the Master Chef Experience you are trained at the fine art of teppanyaki then are able to bring your friends/family in for dinner that you cook.  Training is held Monday through Thursday at 1:00ish which I guess is understandable because they don't want you messing around with knives and hot food in the midst of the lunch or dinner rush.  It still pisses me off though because I work during normal business hours.  I guess it is a small price to pay to hopefully make a fire volcano and fling some shrimp at my wife.

The training was awesome.  My personal teppanyaki chef/teacher (Hideo) and I pretty much had the place to ourselves so I would not be embarrassed if I sprayed rice everywhere.  The training took about 30 minutes and my teacher pretty much went over everything.  He taught me some tricks, some jokes and of course some safety stuff that went in one ear and out the other.  The whole thing was a blast.

On the day of the big even where I would cook for my family they gave me an apron and chefs hat so I looked pretty legit.  Everything went off without a hitch and I made some awesome teppanayaki.  My technique still needs some work but I did excellent for my first time.

Anyway, the whole experience was a blast and I would recommend it to anyone.  The manager (I don't have his name) and Hideo were awesome and really did make the whole thing special throughout my training and main event.",2013-04-03 19:59:10

Great selection of reasonably (sorta kinda ok not really) priced ($10-$16+) wines, and not surprisingly, emphasis on French labels. Highly recommend the Chenin Blanc!

Stripsteak had the potential of 5 stars as you can tell the food is super fresh.  TOO SALTY among a few other things lost points for me.  
First, when entree' items are over $50 I expect an elegant decor and atmosphere.  I felt like we were in a cafe' and not in a first class restaurant. 
For starters we had their fries and a hamachi appetizer.  Both had excellent flavors but TOO MUCH SALT.  I called the waiter over and said. ""I can tell by the starters, that your chef is a little heavy handed with the salt.  Please tell him no added salt on my chicken""  Unfortunately the chicken was salty too.   
The cardinal rule in chicken is don't overcook to dryness.  In an effort to not cross that line,  the chicken was just a FRACTION undercooked.  Slightly PINK meat. A little less salt and 2 more minutes cooking and this flavorful chicken would have been PERFECT. 
the sides of truffle mac n' cheese, mushrooms and cream corn were all good, but not spectacular. 
Rick had the Kansas steak.  cooked nicely and fresh and flavorful.  However I overheard both parties on either side of us complaining that their steak was overcooked to their order.  
The Desert was the saving grace for me,  PERFECT petite creme' brulee' and good beignets .
The service was good, even though they changed my fork settings 3 times.  Poor dishwasher to have to wash 7 forks per customer!
Overall it was enjoyable, and and like I said, could have easily got to 5 stars with just a little more care salt and preparation.",2011-09-07 05:54:41

We had the zucchini spears with parmesan as an appetizer- it was flash fried, so not greasy, and the veggies kept their texture. 

Hubby was well pleased with his strawberry lemonade (it was quite tart and yummy) and with his French Dip with cheese, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. It was not as rare as we are used to from Houston's French Dip (the planet's best, we are convinced), but still moist and quite generously portioned. 

I made the horrible mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak. I'm not sure what that was on my plate, but it was rubbery and tasted vaguely of fish. The sauce was tasteless and had a nasty been-sittin'-around- too-long film. The waitress came by quickly to check on us and took away the badness (I was very nice about it to her face, of course) and brought me the BLT I should have ordered in the first place. It was delicious and had I don't know how many rashers of bacon goodness on it.

That said, however, it was only a decent experience here at best:

- PIRATE ROLL: 8-piece roll with uni, sriracha mayo, tuna(?). you don't often see uni offered in rolls, so we were really looking forward to this one. rather tasty overall but unfortunately the uni itself was really negligible -- we think it might have been mixed in with the mayo on top 
- CHIRASHI DON: the fish roe was a nice touch and lots of it too; sizeable pieces of fish.
- MISO BLACK COD: i've had a mind blowing miso black cod once before and haven't come across this dish since, so this was my first pick off the menu. ultimately the minimalist plating couldn't justify the fish -- i had expected something much more flavourful and buttery, both of which didn't come through here. the lemon zest ontop brought a nice fragrance, however.
- the NIGIRI was beautifully plated
- i didn't try the OSHIZUSHI but from across the table I was disappointed to see that two of the eight pieces were served with just avocado (and sauce) ontop. I'd much rather have seen something of more value, even if they need to justify with a slightly higher price tag

The last time I ate at one of these Caramba's someone there highly recommended getting the Salpicon Salad saying that it was delicious and tasty and he thought it was the best dish they make. It's listed as a salad so I was expecting a salad.

I did ask them to leave off the cheese and sour cream to lighten it up a little for me. But all this salad appeared to be a fried flour tortilla smeared with beans topped with a small amount of lettuce with a very small amount of fresh made plastic tub like chunks of chicken and topped with a big glob of guacamole. To me it looked like a tostada. It was a $6.25 tostada. I read on a sign that the chicken and a bunch of other stuff is made fresh every day and is never from frozen. I also didn't eat the fried tortilla the food seemed fresh but it was a small amount of food.

 TWO STARS for the Chicken Salpicon Salad 

I also had a Margarita and it was so strong I thought I tasted AntiFreeze in it and I also thought it might make me grow hair on my chest.

My husband liked the Carnitas Plate. He said it was nicely seasoned and the meat was moist. It came with rice and beans and a giant flour tortilla that could hold a small body.

I'll leave them at three stars because my husband liked the carnitas here.

I'm rather surprised to see so many people complaining about price, but there does seem to be a common theme.  Yes, some of their beers are pricy... but I can only assume it's because they're offering boring choices like PBR, Beau's and Stiegl* at higher price points to subsidise the reasonably priced microbrews and rare-ish imports they have on tap.  If you are ordering PBR, guess what:  you deserve to be charged entirely too much money for your ridiculous hipster affectation.  

(*  I actually quite like Beau's, but it's a very safe choice amongst quite a few inspired, lesser-known beers that you should be trying instead.)

As for the sausages being overpriced, c'mon, really?  $6 is too much for a gourmet sausage?  When McDonald's is charging what now, $7 for a horrible not-burger with a side of nasty-fries?  A street-meat dog is what, $4? I am flabbergasted that I can get sausage of this quality in Toronto for a mere $6.  

Anyway, enough of that, here's some thoughts:

*  Boerwors is good, wild boar is very good, and Bison is out-of-this-world good.  The spicing and flavour is well layered through the meat, with little bursts of awesome laced throughout.

*  The kangaroo I had was a dude -- it tasted of that powdered Italian seasoning your grandma uses... I can't help but wonder if it was a mistake, so I'm not judging them on the misfire.  This time.

*  French fries, as many have said, are excellent.  We had 'em ""dirty"".  Only complaint would be that the jalapeno was cut too chunky for our liking.

*  The cafeteria style ordering and table delivery is refreshing and fun.  The runners are incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, fast and, as a consequence, well deserving of your tips despite what Bryan G. absurdly suggests.

*  The bartenders are the best I've experienced thus far in Toronto.  Seamlessly efficient, on the ball, personable, genuine, generous and, in turn, appreciative.  

*  The handshakes.  Yep.  The handshakes.  I received handshakes from a runner, both bartenders, the door man, and three random, friendly patrons.  I mistook the door man for a helpful patron, at first, and suspect he's likely much more than the title I've given him (I hope I am not doing him a disservice -- he was a true gentleman).  In an era of hands off, disaffected douche bags and barely-there service, I cannot express how much I appreciate the hands-on approach of Wvrst.

To say I loved Wvrst is an understatement.  They've provided one of the best experiences I've had out in this city.  Great sausage, amazing beer list (subsidised by the masses!), top-tier service, and genuine class.  I'll be back.",2011-12-17 16:44:56

Just the other day my friend and I were deciding  where to go to eat. Lately I'm trying to watch the food I eat... Lol ok I'm lying but I'm trying to make a better effort to find healthier options. Anyway my friend decided to come here since he's been here before. When I arrived I noticed a sign ""vegetarian restaurant""... I was a little let down because I really wanted some chicken lol. As I walked in, it was quiet and clean. The atmosphere felt very inviting with the light granite/ dark wood furniture. I decided to go use the washroom and I came across a sign saying ""how to flush the toilet""... Little things like this, should be fixed.. I don't want to be paranoid using the washroom so I skipped out and decided to wash my hands instead (there was also a sign, ""How to wash hands"".. Like really!?) When I came back to my seat, we were ready to order and decided to grab the miso soup, sweet & sour fritters, BBQ saiten & the california rolls. The waitresses were really nice, soft spoken and +10 points for refilling my water every 10 minutes ... Lately I feel many restaurants are slacking on that h2 the IzzO... It's a big deal for me lol. The food arrived very quickly. First was the miso soup.. Man I feel that I like the vegetarian option over the original because it was less salty. They were not stingy on the tofu pieces either... It was the perfect texture for the soup. As soon as we were half way through the soup, the sweet and sour fritter and the BBQ saiten came out. It was visually appealing, love the little details on the presentation. The fritters were delicious, crunchy and perfectly tossed in the sauce. The BBQ saiten actually looked like meat and I was hella confused but it was so damn good I was actually considering going Vegan... I'm serious! Moments after our California rolls came out and the first one I put in my mouth (sounds so wrong.. I'm not starting this again lol) I was like woah! Very few times I have had sushi melt in my mouth... This place is killing it, in a good way! For dessert we got the magic bar. If you are a fan of brownies, nanaimo bars, then you will love this!

The place is pretty neato looking....exposed ceiling, concrete floors and those cool pull-down exhausts.  Although there's no wait, it did take a few minutes to get seated because they prefer to set up the table with banchan and water before the seat the guest.

We were starvin' Marvin so we got the small beef combo. I went to restroom while hubby ordered and the server asked if we were very hungry, hubby said always so we were recommended the ribeye and marinated short rib.  I know some Yelpers really recommended the skirt steak but oh well!

Food came...brisket and rib-eye were amaaaazing.  The short rib was incredibly tender (""How is this beef?""), likely because it had been aged and tenderized by the marinade. Hubby and I didn't much care for the marinade but it was still delicious beef.

Other cool stuff:
- Bean sprout banchan 
- Pancake
- Disposable toothbrushes in restrooms
- Delicious bibimbap lunch box, shaken tableside like at Kang Ho Dong Baekjong
- Most amazing yet simple dessert of green tea ice cream with red bean paste and peanut powder on rice crackers.
- Service was great.  There was a slight communication error simply because they were eager to serve.  We told one guy to hold off cooking our meat for 10 minutes but right after he left, a lady came by and started throwing the meat on the grill.

Other notes:  Rice is not included in the meal but THEY DO NOT CHARGE FOR IT.  They just don't automatically give it to you but it is cheerfully offered.

Final note:  If you have a large appetite, the small meal was juuuuuuust right.  Hubby and I felt like if we hadn't each had a bowl of rice as well as the extra bibimbap lunchbox, we probably could have had another meal afterwards.  For those with smaller appetites, I would say, this may feed 2.5 people.

My friends and I are broke college kids so this place was a given. There's always a line which takes 5-20 minutes. Not too bad I guess. 

For $5 the food is not bad. A burger + splitting nachos with a friend will fill you up and will only cost you $10 with tax and tip. If you want a drink it'll get pricey quick which is how I assume this place makes most of its money. 

The wait for the food is way too long. For just a couple burgers we waited for about 25 minutes. At least there was entertainment. You'll be able to see a few drunk hipsters awkwardly dancing to hip hop at their tables. 

Overall I have to give this place 3.5/5. With that price you really can't complain too much. If this was regularly priced at maybe $10-15 a meal then this place would be a 1 or 2/5 for sure.",2016-10-19 18:04:04

It's located about 5 or so miles south of the Mandalay Bay so if you're going to the strip, you should have a car. They do offer a shuttle that runs every 40 minutes as well. 

They have reasonably priced beers ($4.50 for an import) with lots of bars sprinkled around the Casino and attentive bar tenders. They also comp beers for video poker players. 

We ate at the Cafe and it was cheap and very good. We also at at the Mexican restaurant up stairs and it was excellent. We left so full!

One thing we like about this place is that it has 60+ lanes of bowling. My wife loves to bowl and it's just something fun and different to do in Vegas. They also have a movie theater. 

The rooms are very spacious and pretty nice. For $50 during the week you just cannot beat the value. Heck, I've stayed in far less comfortable rooms in vegas for three times the price. 

My only complaint during this stay was that they have horse shows here and some of the horse smell would waft into the casino if you were close to the doors to the Equestrian center, and that happens to be right near the cafe. So that's kind of a downer. Even though it didn't ruin our meals or anything, if you're a city dweller and have never visited the country that might be a problem for you if there's an event taking place.

We were greeted with a friendly and warm welcome by the hostess.  However, it took awhile for our server to greet us.  When he did, he wasn't very personable at all.  We started off with the honey hot wings.  It felt like forever for these to come out.  The sauce was good, but the wings came out in these 2 little buckets.  That was kind of weird, because it makes grabbing the wings more difficult.  Then I ordered the Margherita Flatbread and my husband ordered the Steakhouse Burger.  He got to choose which cheese he wanted and the server wasn't even sure what cheeses they had so he asked a nearby server.  Our entrees were actually out pretty quickly.  However, my husband's burger had the wrong cheese and apparently the burger comes with chips as its side, not fries, which was a little weird.  I did enjoy the Margherita Flatbread.  

The restrooms were really nice and clean.  I liked the atmosphere of the whole restaurant.  We went on a Thursday night and it was pretty dead.  A couple people in the dining area and the rest in the bar section, which is where we sat.  They have a huge patio, which looks ideal for large groups. The menu had very few options.  It was pricey.  We were pretty surprised about the prices.  They do have happy hour though from 3pm-7pm, Monday thru Friday (I believe).

They serve up juicy and fresh (not frozen) chicken tenders; Texas toast, which is the best side ever; crinkle cut french fries, which just hit the spot sometimes, you know?  I did think the french fry portion was a little modest, so-to-speak.  But I chose the 3-finger meal and was full afterwards.  The dipping sauce is the real deal - so good.  My husband raved about the crushed iced.  I was all, ""really?  The crushed ice, babe??""  But I admit, there's just something about it lol.  I do think it's strange that lemonade is 10 cents extra but no biggie, it's good.  

This location feels like it should be UNLV's student center lol.  Just has that college feel.  It's cool though.  I remember those days and would have been there almost every day!

Chipotle uses naturally raised meats, hormone free dairy, no eggs or nuts, organic beans, seasonal produce, and promote recycling within the restaurants. This means that they care what you are putting into your body and what it is doing to the environment!! (score!)

Their simple menu makes ordering easy, but still allows you variety (Burrito, Salad, Tacos, Bowls) and caters to a carnivore, vegetarian, or vegan. In fact, they are pretty ""food-allergy"" safe in general. (Believe me, I have experience)

As if the food wasn't enough, they have two amazing ordering systems: Iphone App and Online Ordering. Let's talk about this online ordering system here for a minute, because it is what I think really sets the bar high for their competitors and other restaurants in general:

I run a medium sized business and when lunch comes around, my Operations staff of ten has the WORST time executing something as simple as a lunch order. I know this sounds ridiculous, but believe me, it is as true as the day is long. This all changed when I discovered Chipotle Online Ordering. 

Anyway, I go online, login, and tell the system I want a group order. It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order, the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures, places for memos, etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.

Once everyone has ordered, I hit submit, pay by credit card, and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle, give them a jingle, and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the ""valet"" service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!

Chipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process. (Well, delivery would be nice... but that is what I have a receptionist for)

I want to take a second to recognize this particular location, on 54th Street. Let me start by saying, I believe that you can taste the love in food... as in, if someone is cranky as shit, making your food, it is not as good as if they are smiling, enjoying their lives. I know this probably sounds crazy, but I swear on my right hand it is true. EVERY time I have ever eaten here (we are talking dozens of times) my food has been fabulous! I can taste the LOVE! 

Oh, and about two hours after pickup, someone calls to ask how everything was and to let you know that they took special care to pack it up and make sure everything was right. If there is a Best Chipotle award, this location deserves it!

My final note: I get the salad with black beans, rice, tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, and guacamole. 100% vegan, 100% delicious. Under 500 calories, 17g of fat, and 14g of protein. And I am full. REAL full.

The place has a rustic feel to it with exposed brick, high ceilings and meat lockers.

The menu changes occasionally and the current ones are date stampped
My friend and I shared the lamb brain app (2 pieces fried in a thick batter for $7), porchetta pizza ($19) and black squid ink pasta with a duck yolk ($24). 

The lamb brain was good. I don't have it often at all so it was different so it was nice to try it in a different form (I previously had it in ravioli). 

The porchetta pizza was delicious with wide strips of porchetta all over (amazing) with fried rosemary. The crust was crisp and didn't end up being soggy at all in the centre of the pizza. It comes with large sewing scissors for you to cut in strips. I like things a bit spicy so they provided some homemade chili sauce (they don't have chili flakes). Delicious. 

The black squid in pasta was really savoury which was perfect for sharing, otherwise  I think it would be too much for one person. The waiter mixed it at the table (to incorporate the duck yolk) and served us both.

They have tons of steaks to choose from, lamb, vanilla fried lobster, scallops, and tons of fish. My only confusion came from how the fish was actually prepared b/c there wasn't really on the menu explaining how you can get your fish cooked.

Here's what we ate:
1) Sashimi tower -white fish, Tuna, lobster rolls all very good [see pix]
2) Heirloom tomatoes and burrata salad-very tasty and tons to share
3) Escargot-my favorite very very good [see pix]
4) Creamed Corn-typically not a fan but I did enjoy this very much
5) Brussels Sprouts-eh they are good for you
6) Mac n blue cheese-yes for sure
7) Halibut Oreganata - almost $50, but was a huge piece of fish, definitely could share this
8) the fried lobster was another one of my favorites
9) tuna tostadas again very good [see pix]

The service has always been great! The employees all greet you with a smile, and seem to have a good attitude. Also, don't be afraid of the lines...the service is quick, even when there's only two people behind the counter!

A huge freezer room and huge place full of gifts and flowers. It's very nice to see some local family owned business doing well and still giving back to the local community. 

Support local businesses is one thing, offering quality products and services is another. They put those two together very well. I would not have second thought when I order the flower from local shop. They even have online store that you can place order from pretty much anywhere in Arizona or even out of state. They will take care of you! I have never heard about flower happy hour and free flower on Fridays. They have coupon for that at http://www.smartlocalshoppers.com/store/view/promotions/1055/

After all, they really know how to communicate with local community. Many local businesses I met are already their customers. It's a small world, but Bobbie's flowers and gift shop makes it a wonderful world.

I usually end up doing take out but have dined in as well.   I've tried many items from the lunch specials to the entrees and have never had anything I disliked.   My favorite item, the Baby Spinach Curry  happens to reside on the lunch special menu so bonus for me.    With that you get a healthy serving of rice that you can smother with the tangy tomato curry sauce the baby spinach will be drenched in.  GET IT SPICY.  I find it most enjoyable when you get the perfect mix of curry and sweat dripping from one's brow.  I also order a side of Regular Naan and substitute the ghee butter for EVOO.   Dip that right into the curry or make a little pita out of it and go to town on it like I do (unless there are people watching).

Also a fan of their veggie samosas (if you put it in the name of your restaurant, it better be good), and their chicken curry is good as well.   Oh and Veggie Kofta Curry.  I have no idea what exactly that is, but it was delicious.  Kinda like little vegetarian meatballs or falafel but in a delicious curry sauce.

Rick is always great and I've never had an issue with the service, though on days where it's packed he can sometimes be stretched a little thin and it can take a little longer that way.

I just wished they had more items to choose from, that weren't so much seafood based. 

Today I tried a handful of items:

1) clam chowder: this was pretty darn tasty. After squeezing lemon juice and mixed it within, I was satisfied. 

2) shrimp ceviche: another goodie! Looks like a small serving, but now this comes with a lot of shrimp, if totally order this again.

Our server for the evening was French through and through and quite witty, and not a hint of snobbery- not to mention exceedingly skilled at his job. 

The Escargot, though recommended with bread by our server, was delicious alone, rich and soft with just the right amount of garlic to enhance its taste.

Excellent at any time of day, sitting outside is really a treat- And when it gets darker opt for the upper level patio as the lighting is optimal.

They have wonderful meat and cheese platters and some of the best Bread Pudding I have ever tasted- I literally order it in advance because it does take some time to make and I always want it.

What a cool restaurant!  It has a huge fish tank in the middle of it!  

Obviously, they specialize in seafood but also serve up some good land lovers food.  An assortment of breads were served immediately after we were seated (no reservations needed on the Thursday night we dined there).  Shortly, afterwards we were presented our bottle of wine.

Everything is al a carte at Chart House, so be careful not to over-order like us!  We start off our hunger excursion with two salads.  My fiance ordered a caesar* which was average tasting, and I devoured a spinach salad* (YUMMO)!  The salads were both quite large, so you may want to split some of your dishes up.  

And because my fiance's eyes are larger than his stomach, he ordered a bowl of clam chowder*.  This too was quite large.  He said it was one of the best clam chowders he's ever had!

(*Pictures of items)

As most of you Yelpers know, I am a steak lover!  More to the point, a filet mignon lover.  Chart House served a decent filet for a seafood place, though defintely NOT the best I've ever had.  It was large, plump, and cooked near perfectly.  For sides, we ordered the asparagus and fried mac and cheese.  I didn't try the asparagus but did try the fried mac.  It was good but way too big and heavy.  It could've been a meal in itself.

I guess we were hungrier than we thought that night because we had to take a doggy bag home...

I started with a Green Candy juice, which comes in a cool lil jug. I find their juices very reasonably priced, so props for that! This juice in particular was slightly on the sweet side (very sweet for me, but I tend to only add a little bit of green apple to my green juice), thanks to the pineapple. I think it's the perfect green juice for people just getting started on a green journey because it's really delicious and less... green tasting. It's a gentle juice. Next time I'll be sure the try the Pure Green and see how that is.

Vegan poutine. I've never had the ""real"" thing, but I was assured that this version is pretty close (though the cheese is more liquid than curds). I'm a weirdo who prefers her fries virgin with tons of salt, so it's not really for me, but I'm glad I tried it. The fries are really damn good on their own, here! 

Next up: the Energy Bowl. Unless you're looking to take home lunch for the next two days, get the baby size. Hell, I couldn't even finish half of *that.* It's plentiful and not chock full o' filling rice, either. Oh my god, is this thing delicious. I'm a lover of healthy bowls brimming over with veggies and plant protein and Fresh has an entire menu of these. I love the Energy Bowl because there's a lot of flavor with the coconut curry sauce, chickpea stew and tahini. I added tons of hot sauce and was in pure heaven. I also added steamed broccoli because you can never have too much of a good thing.

The salesman was able to come back and negotiate a little more until he met me in the middle (more on my end, but that's what I'm expecting)! 

They were also able to get me the truck from a different location by the end of the night. Overall, I spent about 5 hours here and then had to come back for my truck. I wish they were able to throw a little something in there for drawing out this whole process, but I jut got a stock truck, no tint, alarms, bells and whistle. If I went somewhere else, I KNOW I could've gotten more for the price I paid, we only came here because it's close and convenient for us. 

Chris was my salesman helping me out. He knew what he was talking about and didn't hassle me like most other guys do. Jeff was knowledgeable in the finance field and was quick and efficient as well.

I went in there again to cancel my extras (maintenance, warranty, and GAP) and I was kinda treated like poop. They literally gave me a paper to sign and shooed me out. I expected them to at least negotiate or work something out, but no. The attitude I got was ""Oh you don't want this, but you already bought the vehicle? Ok, bye."" I had another experience like this at another dealership and they actually took time to listen to my concerns and met me in the middle to sell me something, which I wish these people would have done. 

At the end of the day, I felt like they did what they could to sell me the car, but didn't take care of me after that.",2017-03-21 19:46:31

The venue is nice and the staff is nice, this is purely food based review.

We came to try some Ramen. We ordered the Obon and Tonkotsu. Of the two I think the Tonkotsu was better. It had more of that ""ramen"" taste that we wanted. I thought the pork belly was good and the shoulder was new to me and pretty good.

The reason it just came out a-ok was really the broth. It doesn't have that same deep Ramen flavor. It's not as savory and rich, this also had a more ""chicken"" based flavor to me. The noodles were also pretty forgettable. I can't say the bamboo shoots did much for me either.

It wasn't bad but it just didn't really hit the mark for me. I would say if you've never had Ramen before - keep searching.

I have no opinion on any other food or drink they serve, hopefully they are better.",2018-07-02 04:40:47

Not your ordinary tamales.  These are large moist and fresh.  I first encountered them at the Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and occasionally on First Fridays, with steamers full of a variety of tamale flavors to please the Vegan, Vegeterian and meat lover alike.  

With fillings from traditional Pork Red Chile and Beef Red Chile to Spinach Mushroom, Shrimp, Chicken (red or green)  or my favorite Green Chile, Corn with Cream cheese.  You have to check out their menu of choices they always seem to have something new or seasonal.  They have them warm in steamers or frozen to take home for later.  [They defrost and reheat very well.  Reheat in the wrap or wrap a moist paper towel over the wrapped tamale to ensure it won't dry out.]

A fan of their moist delicious fluffy masa, I am not a fan of the shrimp tamale I had and the tamale traditionalist part of me found that the Pork Red Chile had too much cumin for my flavor.  I can always count on the goodness of the Green Corn Tamale (Corn, green chile and cream cheese).

When I forget to pick up a few on Saturday I can always find them in the freezer at Phoenix Public Market.",2011-01-28 19:50:38

Second time, a server told me the complete opposite, that their curry is already pre-made, and cannot be made vegan. The inconsistency is very off-putting.

Now...  not so much.  Well, during HH, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  Selection by the glass is limited.  

As for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  

Oh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16).

Prices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it.

P.S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try!

Update 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch.  What a great deal!  For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!

They have a great happy hour 7 days a week (available in the bar only). I went twice last week because I just couldn't get enough. On the first visit, I had a selection of sushi and seaweed salad, and on the second, I had a kitchen entree in the dining area (not hibachi station).

The Y2K roll is just divine. It has tempura shrimp (the shrimp was fresh, crunchy, and still warm when the roll arrived to me), minced spicy tuna on top, and it's drizzled in eel sauce. It is just so so good. 

The spicy California roll is the freshest tasting sushi roll I've ever had, and the spicy sauce on top is out of this world.

The seaweed salad is also the freshest-tasting seaweed salad I have had, and it is not completely drenched in sesame oil as some can be.  I got a rather large portion of it (about the portion of a standard side salad). 

The Shogun Chicken meal comes with clear soup AND a side salad with awesome ginger dressing, with a side of white rice as well. The chicken is supposed to mimic general tso's chicken; it was a bit different and not as spicy, but delicious nonetheless and a very large portion size. I decided to upcharge my rice to fried rice, whose portion is also a bit larger, and I ate the entire dish of rice, forgetting about the chicken entirely. Whoops. :)

Don't write this restaurant off just because it's in a shopping mall. The decor is beautiful, the happy hour is great, the employees are very friendly and very much on top of things, and the price is not bad for how much food and freshness you get in your meal. Also, no need to visit the hibachi; I think it's a bit weird unless it's a special occasion, as all items are available in the dining room and taste just as hot and fresh off the flat-top.",2017-11-27 18:22:02

They have several locations, but this is the one I like best.  The atmosphere is Mediterranean-casual. It's the kind of atmosphere I love that reminds me of past adventures in remote corners of Athens, or or little hole in the wall places on the Spanish coast.  For those who don't travel, that means the tables are Formica topped and too close to a noisy kitchen, the aisles are small to non-existent, and the the lighting is an inconsistent no-frills kinda thing that leaves people in one room struggling to read the menu while those in the other room are wishing for sunglasses.  I've seen bigger bathrooms in motor homes.  The only thing missing is the European coffee that no one seems to be able to imitate here. Or maybe they just don't want to.

The menu is big enough for anyone to find a favorite.

First off, be warned--they don't have a sign you can easily see from the street currently, so it's easy to miss if you don't know where you're going.

The place is HUGE so there wasn't a wait for us, and the wait staff was very nice and attentive.  It was pretty noisy where we were sitting even though the place wasn't full; it seems noise bounces around pretty well inside, so it can be hard to hear the person you're eating with.  Service was fast, though, and our waitress was prompt and accommodating. 

We started with the deviled eggs, which were incredibly tasty but pricy ($1 per half-egg).  I had the Brewmaster's pizza, which was huge and delicious, with melty gouda, buttery onions, and lots of meat for only $11.  The house salad had a nice peppery dressing on it, and the tomatoes and croutons were tasty.  

Unfortunately, my dad has a garlic allergy, and this place tosses garlic into EVERYTHING so that made most of the menu inedible for him.  He was unimpressed with the steak he ended up ordering (out of the 3-4 menu items he could have gotten)--ordered it medium well, asked the waitress for it to be pink but not bloody, and got a well-done, completely brown steak that tasted like liver.  He was disappointed.

Desserts were great--the bread pudding got demolished, and the chocolate stout ice cream sandwiches were more than I could handle.  The ice cream really does taste like a dark chocolate stout, so if you're not a stout lover DO NOT get these--I loved them but they're incredibly rich and not sweet at all, so if you're expecting a typical ice cream sandwich you'll be disappointed.

Overall a good experience, although I won't take my Dad back, and I'd be very specific if you're getting meat cooked to order--it's not worth $20 for a steak that isn't cooked the way you've asked for it.",2011-05-11 02:42:28

I ordered the Ham & Cheese Omelette ($13.99/14.99 w/o TR Card)  combo which consisted of the following:
the omelette
toast
roasted potatoes

The Omelette (2 stars): I don't think this was made with real eggs. The texture had a very slimy consistency. Even the portion size was ample, Paying $15 for an omelette not made with real eggs is not on my Vegas to-do list.

Toast: (1 star): It's really a giant piece of bread, not even cut. I tried to take one bite into the toast...inedible. It was impossible to eat because the toast was too dry and hard to bite into.

Roasted Potatoes ( 3 stars): Sadly, the best part of the menu. It's pretty hard to mess up cooking potatos, right?

So much food and so fantastic. They might need to speed up the service a little bit but I'm not going to complain about everything being cooked to order. If it gets busy, expect a wait as we were the only ones here and it took a good 15 minutes to get our food. Again, not a complaint. But if they're going for the Hawaii Korean bbq experience, they need that speed too!  Dinner was awesome!!  Food was delicious. Cucumber kimchi, cabbage kimchi and bean sprouts were all great!

After looking at the menu, I decided on the Gianna which had fennel sausage, mushrooms, pine nuts, and mozzarella. Also ordered a pint of the Big Squirrel. 

The pie was really terrific with a perfectly cooked crust and a slightly sweet tomato sauce. I found the nutty-ness of the pine nuts to pair amazingly well with the fennel sausage. Yummy. It was so good in fact, I ate the whole pizza myself. 

My only gripe was the $16.50 price for a 12"" pizza, which I thought was high, but when you consider the location well...

The happy hour drink specials: $5 glasses of wine, $3 beers, and $5 house cocktails from 5-7.  Not bad.

What I didn't like:

The pizza: The pizza tasted OK, but averaging around $15 per pie - which one hungry adult could easily finish -  was a bit outlandish. The quality was nowhere near that of The Parlor, LGO, or Grimaldi's. At those prices for ""personal"" pizzas, I'd expect to be wow'd.

The service: We were surprised to see only one vegetarian pizza on the menu (not including the standard cheese pizza).  When we asked the server if we could substitute veggies for meat on any of the pizzas, he acted like he's never heard this request before -- and he had to ask the chef.  His sanctimonious attitude about substituting artichoke for prosciutto was just odd. And when he finally allowed us to make the substitution, the pizza came out wrong.

We gave it a shot, but most likely won't be going back.",2009-12-21 16:17:55

Prices are average for a billiard hall. $10/hour and it's not bad of a price if you split the bill between a group of 3 or 4. The hourly rate is cheaper when you go before 5. I believe it's about $8 instead of $10. 
It's usually a younger crowd, mainly post secondary students since its close by Ryerson. They do have specials for every day of the week. Such as a pitcher of beer with a 1lb pound for about $25. 

The food looks appetizing and it certainly is.  I've tried their nachos there with my girlfriends and we couldn't stop eating it! 

The place does look sketchy at first but when you make your way down the stairs and get pass that horrible smell from the entrance, you'll see a really dimmed and comfortable pool hall.

Lastly, for the ladies beware that the washrooms are quite dirty.. I've seen wastes not fully flushed down and toliet paper on the ground in the stalls. This is because some ladies don't care to hold the flush a bit longer until everything goes down..

It's been a fun ritual and I've been enjoying the pedicures. I think the best way I can describe/review this place is to do a pros/cons list.

Pros
- 20 dollar Spa Pedicure
- Usually not too busy during early lunchtimes or mid-afternoons. They get real busy at lunch and from 330 onwards
- Family-owned business so that's always nice
- They sanitize their instruments in some sort of UV warming thing
- The nail technicians are good at what they do. The best of them all is the older gentleman who works there. He takes time massaging your feet and legs and has even been able to deal with one of my co-worker's ingrown toenail effectively

Cons
- They could have more colors of nail polish. They have a passable selection but it's definitely lacking. I don't see some of the OPI colors I like in this selection
- The older gentleman is amazing (as mentioned above) but the other nail technicians just don't measure up. I was there yesterday for a pedicure and got one of the other women technicians. She worked really fast on my pedicure (the man was massaging and working on the woman who was seated next to me and I was so jealous as he took a longer time and she seemed like she was in bliss). The woman working on me decided to hurry on my pedicure since there was a crowd of people coming in. 

All in all, this place is nice enough and reasonable. I'd give it a 4.5 star if the man was doing my pedicure all the time but since it's seldom that I'm lucky like that, I end up with the ""not-so-dedicated"" technicians so it's probably a 3 star experience.",2010-09-10 21:29:21

There's seating inside and outside on the shaded patio to enjoy your libations while at Tivoli Village. A nice touch is by the sweeteners and creamers they keep a water vase with ice, cucumbers and lemon. I wonder how long that'll last before they take it away for all the people who will run in for a ""free"" drink and run out. 

They have the usual coffee drinks hot/ice, a bit of tea drinks and smoothies. I was hot and just needed something fresh so I got a basic iced tea (large $3). It was good, but standard tea, no special flavor to it.  

Other than drinks, they have some pastries, pretty desserts, sandwiches, quiches and salad. We saw a sole almond croissant ($4) so we grabbed that as our goal is to try it everywhere in the city. The BFs mom has a obsession to find this particular kind of croissant that doesn't exist but we will try anyways. It was good, but for $4 I wouldn't go for it again as there's a better croissant down the street at Manon. 

The asked for my name and everyone gets Jade wrong as ""Jane"" or ""Jay"" so I always spell it out and as I do it, point to my credit cards name as I'm handing it to them. I was standing there for a while as apparently I am ""Jean/Gene"" and took a while to sort out that was me.  When the girl hands my my tea, she just walks away....where's my croissant? I ask for it so she tells a girl near the desserts to box it up for us to-go. Later they flag me down because she ""couldn't find it"".

The 1 star rating is for the situation that occurred yesterday. It was HOT out there, HOT, like 104.  The bar to the is naturally connected to the building, meaning, that the entrance to the bar is an open door to the rest of restaurant, well inside the dining room there were only 2 other tables when we sat down. We opted to sit at a table that was NOT year an a/c vent as one my friends was elderly and did not like the a/c blowing on her.

So here is the MAJOR PROBLEM I have and why I rated this 1 star.  So the flies that were INSIDE the restaurant were RIDICULOUS, I mean it ruined the whole dinner!! We were constantly killing flies, swatting flies, off us, off our food, out of our drinks.   HERE is my beef: when we told the restaurant staff, hostess and waitress, we were told that the Ecolab guy was supposed to show up there earlier in the day but cancelled and was going the next day.  MY PROBLEM IS THIS: they KNEW the flies were bad, they KNEW the Ecolab person was not coming for another day, THERE IS AN ACE HARDWARE less than 1/2 mile down the road, WHY DIDN'T THEY GO TO ACE AND GET SOME FLY TRAPS/FLY STRIPS......SOMETHING  TO CONTROL THE FLIES????  It was  utterly ridiculous.  I LOVE this place, the food is amazing, but to knowingly sit people in a room full of flies and be ok with it??? WRONG ANSWER! 

I know this place is under new ownership as of some time last year, because when I took my then bf there one of the owners was there and actually came to our table to ask how we were and how our service and food was. He was pretty young, and I hope that he will read this review and school his employees on this.

As we were leaving a group of about 10 people came in to sit in the dining room, we thought, 'oh great, something to draw the flies away rom us"" lol, but as quickly as they sat down they left to sit out side, when I asked if they were leaving because of the flies, they said YES !!!",2018-05-07 15:38:15

While I wouldn't classify this as a ""french restaurant"" as they do, it was still a good (*cough* ITALIAN) meal, at a reasonable price, with good service. 

We did make reservations for dinner, but realistically at 5:30 on a Monday, we could have had the entire restaurant. That being said, by the time we left (7:45 - 8) it was definitely filling up - mostly with couples or small groups of friends, which this place has the perfect atmosphere for. 

For dinner, I had the special pizza of the day off of their monstrous menu (I just stopped looking when I found something good, otherwise I would have looked forever!) which was sun dried tomato, caramelized onion, and smoked duck. I have to admit I had pretty high expectations for this pizza, and while it was a bit salty, it fit the bill. I had also ordered the lobster cakes for an appetizer, but ALAS they were out! I'm not sure how it's possible that they were out at 5:30pm, but they were. For dessert, I indulged in the New York style cheesecake, which was delicious but nothing special. Also important to note, the dessert portions are HUGE and should definitely be split! 

My colleagues all enjoyed their meals as well, except for one who had ordered the escargot appetizer, which was far too garlicy, to the point that she had to send it back. Even people on the other side of the table could tell how intense it was - you could smell garlic everywhere. So if you're not a huge garlic fan, perhaps avoid it. 

The service was really great - our waitress was quite helpful, and even recognized one person as she had been their the previous week. The server gave us plenty of suggestions, and was very attentive - at least until the restaurant really started to fill up, at which point she seemed stretched a little thin.

My only big negative about this place was their inability to split the bill - they did eventually, but only after complaining a bit that we hadn't told her prior to ordering. They also couldn't split items, which  I find so annoying!

I thought, ""Fair enough, surely this filling is gonna be amazing.""  Heaven help me, the peaches had the texture and flavor of canned peaches.  The crumb topping had a nice flavor, and the texture was nice, but that was all we could eat on this pie.

I opted for the mango pancake and 2 pancakes were packaged nicely in 1 small container with their signature Full House sticker. The cost was 8.99 +tax which totalled 10.15. This cost was a bit pricier than most Asian desserts and a splurge for our tummies and wallets. 

Taste wise, each bite of pancake had a more than sufficient amount of mango, and the best part of it all - the skin was so thin and accompanied the mango and whipped cream extremely well. I will be back to try the durian pancake (maybe without the SO in tow)

We came for our 11th anniversary, I guess I told them the occasion when I was making the reservation. From the host to the Sommelier to the waiters all wished us not only a Happy Anniversary, but Happy 11th Anniversary!

I always liked the ambiance of this restaurant.  There is glass fire places, several chandeliers, views of steel and glass wine cellar, swanky sofa-like booths as well as tables with nice big chairs for each person. 

For a special touch, they seated us at a booth made actually for 4 people so that we could sit side by side. 

Service was incredibly attentive and comfortable, yet formal. However, I like a Sommelier that tells you about the wine you just ordered,  this one was silent and very stiff when presenting the wine.   Last time I was here, our Sommerlier was awesome and gave us info about the wine we were about to enjoy!  Anyway, Hank's has a beautiful and extensive wine collection.  Take advantage.

One thing that was interesting and I liked was they ask if you want a bread basket or if you want to ""save room"" for your meal.
My husband order the lobster chowder.  I took a bite, it was creamy yet still had nice size chunks of seafood and vegetables.  While excellent it was not extraordinary...I make a corn chowder that has a similar flavor profile. 

While meant to compliment the steak, I asked for the foie gras as my appetizer.  They happily obliged my request, without looking at me strangely.  OMG a nice 3 inch slice of heaven that I rarely get to eat anymore.  

We shared a steakhouse salad and each got our own 22 oz bone-in ribeye.  Beautifully cooked to medium-rare, as requested. Sad thing was we were looking forward to a Tomahawk Steak for two, which they no longer offer.  Nonetheless, some of the best steak in the Vegas area. 

So stuffed and gathering that we don't eat grains they brought us two tuxedo dressed chocolate covered strawberries as a complimentary dessert. Very nice, and that was in addition to the little sweets they bring with your check.

I visited their previous office locations more times than I can count (Yelp tracked 43 official check-ins of mine on their previous biz listing).

It's rare to find someone like Debbie who has 30+ years of diverse nursing experience and is still super passionate about what she does.

All of the times i've been here, i've noticed two trends: Bland entrees, and slow service.

With regard to the entrees: Some reviews on here are claiming that some of the dishes are great, so maybe i'm just ordering the wrong things. But, I got a mushroom dish, and an assortment of veggie dishes, and all of those left a lot to be desired. The mushroom dish had some spice, but the mushroom texture was inconsistent, so it wasn't too great. The veggies were often just the veggie in question with some rice, sometimes in a tasteless sauce. It didn't feel like anything that I couldn't have made at home easily.

As for the service, it's just often really slow. Slow for them to seat you, slow to take your order, slow for them to fill up your water (which really sucks if you get a spicy dish and you're a spice wimp like myself), and slow for them to get your bill. I went at times that were only semi-crowded, but regardless it didn't seem like it should have been taking so long. They could benefit from adding another wait staff to take orders at peak hours.

My experience as Fugu hasn't been all bad, though. Note that I only mentioned the entrees being bland. I've had some pretty excellent appetizers, such as the Sesame cakes, which came with a very awesome savory sauce. I'd definitely be willing to try Fugu again, but only if I had a lot of free time that night, and a very good tip from someone on what to order.",2014-03-23 16:28:51

If your in Vegas, definitely have to try out this trendy cool restaurant.  My recommendation is to do the group sharing menu which is their signature menu.  It is like a prix fix menu by person and like this you get to try different items.  We ordered a couple of signature menu, menu 1 and 2, which is $88 and $118 a person.  So with it.  My favourites within the menu were:  Hakka steamed dim sum platter!  I usually stay away from dim sum but this platter was excellent!! So fresh and tasty!!  Spicy lamp lupin wrap was delish.  Pan seared shanghai dumpling so good!  Too many dishes to name.  The all time favourite was the Crispy Chilean Sea Bass.  This was the star of the meal.  Ive never had Sea bass like this....it was to die for!!  Great service as well, love the decor, and food out of this world.  If I'm ever back in Vegas will definitely be back.",2018-03-07 18:52:56

His favorite is red velvet anything so I knew he must finally try one of these treats!

Of course he loved the moist cake and flavorful generous frosting!

I have had Nothing Bundt Cakes before when a vendor brought them in for one of my Company meetings and I was impressed and hooked after that!

We will be back for more red velvet I am sure!",2013-03-26 00:16:23

The wait to get into this place on the weekends is nuts.  I've gone during the week and while there isn't a line out the door, the staff inside always seems a bit disorganized.  Folks coming in are left standing between the register and the door while diners are trying to pay and get around you to leave.  That's logistical based on the layout of the place, so that's forgivable.

The food is my real issue here.  The portions are ridiculously huge and I feel like they opt for size rather than taste.  On this last visit, I ordered eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast.  The hashbrowns tasted as though they'd been sprinkled with onion powder and then over cooked, which made the onion powder taste burnt.  Other than that, the only thing on my order with any flavor was the jelly I put on the toast.

My hubs ordered the mixed grill (again, ridiculously large) and a coffee.  The grill comes with a pound of veggies, and the hubs said the flavor was good.  However, he sat with an empty coffee cup for quite a while.

The service was sparse and the servers all looked like they'd rather be someplace else.  Which is understandable because about halfway through the meal, I wished the same.

I'm not planning on giving Deluca's another shot.  2 times is enough for me.  There are several other great breakfast places in the Strip (Kellly's and Pamela's to name a couple) and I think I'll stick to those spots.",2018-09-20 22:07:38

Apparently now they're open until 9 so I can make the trip! It's my favorite Mediterranean fast casual restaurant by far. It's similar to Chipotle in process. The meats are cooked on a rotisserie and shaved off, and the chicken I've had is thinly sliced and delicious. Most recently I had their falafel which is deep fried to order and not too dried out. Their wraps use gigantic pieces of pita and get stuffed full of goodies such as lettuce, carrots, onions, cabbage, hummus, hot or mild sauce, and tahini or tzatziki sauce. Seriously this thing will feed you for two meals. I've had the bowl too which comes with all of the above minus hummus plus rice. They have extras like olives but they are kind of spendy at $1.00 a piece and can add up quickly. You really don't need any. The customer service is friendly and they're always hustlin to get you through the line quick. Definitely recommend Parsley for anyone looking for a huge, healthy, and delicious meal.",2018-08-23 19:13:48

Individually everything I'm sure tastes great but with that many ingredients honestly it becomes one big mixture of food and you no longer taste individual taste of each item in the bowl. He first couple bites you can taste things but after a while it all tastes the same which is disappointing considering each topping probably tasted good on it's own. I'm probably just not a fan of this all you can top it with type of food. There are so many great choices here to add to your bowl. I absolutely love the concept and this is my favorite type of food as well so I thought what could go wrong? Customer service was great and he even asked how I liked the food afterwards. 

Well what went wrong then? I was stuck in the bathroom for hours afterwards. I'm not sure if it was food poisoning or just ate something bad there, but either way I did not enjoy the feeling after eating there. Not good at all. 

The 2 stars are for the concept and the customer service but minus a few stars for the toilet issue and the mixture of food.",2018-01-04 22:46:46

I was tired of the shitty customer service at Glendale Powder Coating, who had done 3 frames for me previously, so I made an even worse decision by letting the hacks at Universal Powder Coat give it a go. After I saved my frame from any more of their incompetent shenanigans, I wised up and took it to Arizona Powder Coat.

They have TONS of colors on steel cards and fandecks in their office. Some with different sheen topcoats, which is pretty cool. Found the exact color I wanted, fluorescent lime green. 

Their turn around time was long (a month), but that's a good thing. If they're busy, there's a reason for it, because if you suck, you aren't busy. 

Office staff returned calls and let me know when my frame was finally ready for pickup.

Price was great (under $90 for strip and coating), and the frame was PERFECT. All the threaded holes were totally free of powder, the head tube was carefully masked, which was awesome as this is an integrated headset frame, rear caliper mount was flat and level, as were the faces of the bottom bracket. Really shows how much prep they put into their work. I didn't have to do any additional work when reassembling the bike, what a time saver. The finish itself is great. Nice and consistent. Wish I would have sprung for the flat clearcoat, maybe next time when I change colors. They even wrapped it nicely in foam sheets for transport. 

I'll never go anywhere else. Staff is professional and courteous, the prices are competitive, if not the best, and they do solid work. What more could you ask for?",2017-05-12 18:04:04

Though I love Malaysian cuisine for it's mix of great curry dishes and noodles, I went with sushi here. Not exactly sure why, but I was rather satisfied with the selection. 

We started with the roti telur which is one of our favorite Malaysian dishes. Theirs was a little more spicy than others we've had, and the curry was housed the typical potatoes swimming in a delicious curry sauce. The pancake was great and cut into larger pieces than usual. As always, eating this with chopsticks is the way to go!

I ended up ordering a specialty sushi roll -- spicy tuna, avocado on top, a spicy mayo, and veggies. It was pretty standard and exactly what I expected. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was filling, but we all know the problem with sushi....Give yourself 30 minutes and you're hungry again! Blast! I should have ordered more to go! Service was a little sluggish and our food was brought out in oddly spaced waves. Not a deal-breaker, but it was a little inconvenient. 

I can't wait to go back and try one of the chef's specialties. I love the feel of this place as it is rather open with plenty of seating. 

A drawback is the odd placement and parking. There are like....4 entrances and only one of them is unlocked/functional as an entrance. Kind of weird, but who cares. Very much looking forward to my next visit.",2013-01-22 16:32:09

The restaurant itself is quite nice. It has an industrial type look and has a good amount of seating (combination of stools, chairs and benches). The servers were very friendly. As I had attended as apart of a yelp event I had the opportunity sample a wide variety of their items all of which were delicious - especially the pizza. I would come back if I was in the area.

Feedback: To make the restaurant easier to find it may be helpful to have a sign on King street directing customers to the store. I have seen many other restaurants do this effectively.",2016-01-25 20:44:04

I picked up a sushi set from here to go. It was one of their bigger sets (california roll, spicy crab roll(?), salmon sushi), and after tax it was about $11, which I guess is pretty typical for a grab-and-go sushi place. The sushi tasted fine, but I was frustrated because literally every single piece of maki fell apart the second I tried to pick it up. So damn annoying to eat. My friend had the same complaint about the sushi falling apart (he was last here like a year ago, so clearly this is an ongoing problem.) The couple who works here seems very sweet and friendly though, so I really wanted to give this place a good review. It sounds like most people like the salmon and avocado roll, so perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing. But honestly, from my experience it's just average sushi that's hard to eat, so I can't say I will be coming back.",2015-04-09 04:42:50

I wasn't sure whether to go sweet or savory, but the savory was a good choice.  I was able to try some other dishes at the table that were sweet and that wouldn't have been bad choice either.

I am not familiar with French cuisine, but this makes me want to explore more.  Some of the staff was speaking French, which added to the authenticity. It was a good way to start the day before we say Cirque du Soleil in the Strip Distruct.

I waited. I waited some more... Then the female loaded her stuff up and walked away, leaving the male to handle all of us. Really??

WE went for the biscuits and gravy but when we saw these beautiful gems sitting in the case, beckoning us, it was all over.  We had a cinnamon donut.  So fresh, and springy and delightful.  It has been one of the only things I have craved but had been unable to satisfy since transitioning to vegan.  But now, finally, a fabulous solution.  

We also enjoyed the biscuits and gravy  and the mcbagel sandwich.  Both were extraordinary.  The B/G was huge.  Next time we will share.  Potatoes were cooked to a beautiful brown perfection.  The Tofu scramble is some of the best I have encountered but the star of the show, by far was the gravy.  Creamy and satisfying with large chunks of ""chorizo"".

The McBagel sandwich was also a thing of outstanding craftsmanship.  The bagel soft and delicious.  The tofu egg and veggie ham had perfect spice and flavoring.  I'm not sure how they make the ""cheese"" but it is AMAZING.  This little gem came with a side of fruit.  Boring and expected one may think.  However, this fruit was clearly freshly cut and perfectly ripe.  NO soft grapes, hard cantaloupe or honeydew here my friends.  This was beautiful, bite size chunks of granny smith apple, perfectly ripened strawberries and sweet pineapple.

We ordered the Sunday Special which consisted of a poached egg deep fried in panko, on top of 2 slices of american cheese and sausage in between two toasted buns and a side of their potatoes, and we also ordered the Big Jambon which has ham, baked beans, swiss cheese and maple fried eggs on top of a big buttermilk waffle.

Pros: Convenient location if downtown. All the food we had on 3 separate visits was very good. Salads, apps, snacks, mixed drinks, all very good. Service was okay, certainly not blown away with personality or speed, but not bad. Great alcohol selection. TV's everywhere but no sound.

Cons: Extremely busy at all times, especially lunch. Prices were fair, maybe a touch overpriced but considering all the food was great I'd say prices were fair. No happy hour or specials to speak of.

They have a surprising large bottled beer selection including a lot of microbrews. This past Sunday they had a beer of the day for only $2, not sure if that is an every day event, but it was a great deal. When the cashier told me she was out of the beer of the day, she said I could substitute for any other beer for the same price - sweet!

Service was very friendly, so whatever problems they may have had in the past they seem to have fixed (or fired!) The seating is cosy, albeit limited. The patio is a nice touch when the weather cooperates. There is artwork for sale on the walls, but struggling artists won't be struggling for long if they sell them at those prices! The problem is, they probably won't sell because of the prices, so the artists will remain struggling.

The menu leans to the healthy side, but not to the extent of chickpea and cardboard burgers at Pita Jungle (thank god!). I think they call the sandwiches ""Artisan"" which is apt. The portions are big and the prices reasonable. I had the Smokey Joe on my last visit and a Reuben the previous time. I think the Reuben was the sandwich of the day, didn't see it on the regular menu this time. Both sandwiches were great. 

The only negative is the parking. There is a little parking lot behind Hob Nobs, but because 3rd Ave is a one way street going the opposite way from McDowell, you will have to navigate around the neighbourhood a little before you find it. Then you'll find it to be full and you will curse Phoenix's one way streets and drive around the neighbourhood one more time to try and find street parking.

We came for brunch but unfortunately missed it by 2 minutes due to the line in front of us. Instead, we opted for lunch. We ordered the Kale Caesar salad, herbivore burger and matcha latte. While the matcha latte was not to our liking, the Kale Caesar and burger were right up our alley. 

I really enjoyed the Spicy Kale Caesar ($12.5) topped with crispy chickpea, garlic chips, parmesan fricos, homemade croutons and smoked coconut ""bacon"" with sriracha and creamy caesar dressing. The various ingredients in the dish created a very unique textural experience. 

My partner devoured the herbivore burger ($12) within seconds.  The pattie consists of organic quinoa. bulgur wheat, lentils, almonds, beets and carrots. The burger is completed with cucumber, tomato, avocado mash, swiss cheese, alfalfa sprouts and cilantro lime aioli. He raved about the aioli.

Overall, we both really enjoyed our venture to Riverdale Perk Cafe. We will definitely be back for brunch!",2017-04-25 14:18:53

Given this, my expectations weren't exactly high. Turns out I underestimated Phoenix creatives. Every act was entertaining at worst, most were good and a couple made me laugh until my sides hurt. Most notably a comedian known simply as Seymour.

CdxKDyh13weNNm9wvWbquA,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q,5,24,14,20,"Recently, a near-monsoon and the flooding that resulted from it had threatened to strand Kay and I in the East End one evening upon quitting time, giving us a perfect excuse to wait out the storms by sampling one of the shooting stars in Pittsburgh's culinary scene: Everyday Noodles. 

Shimmering interiors, a lovely hostess, communal seating arrangements, and ringside-seat kitchen action immediately lifted the gloom from our weary, weeknight shoulders. 

Our laid-back, long-locked server, one who reminded us of a musician friend of ours in appearance and comportment, took our orders via a pencil-and-paper order form system much like Burgatory does. Once our choices were circled and confirmed, the circus of taste, smell, and sight began. 

Having researched the menu days before after a featured Yelp review arrested my interest, I knew I had to begin with something quite alien, new, and therefore immensely intriguing to me: The Taiwanese Pork Belly Slider. 

The gelatinous bun that contained the uncannily unctuous, meaty, and flavorsome pork was quite simply not of this earth. Possessing the texture of marshmallow, a meringue, raw dough, and a hamburger roll all at once, it seemingly absorbed the taste of the hog in the same way a tofu would. The possibilities of what to place inside this futuristic bread are infinite. Chipped ham? Mozzarella? Mortadella? Nutella? Whaddya say, fella?

Next in line was an octet of something I've only seen Bourdain relish reverentially on television: Soup Dumplings of the pork and crab variety. 

While not as large as those I've seen in the media, the pouches of painstakingly housemade dough that arrived to our table in a steam basket had me convulsing rhapsodically as Long Tall Tony has done whenever eating something favorable for your entertainment (envy? vicarious pleasures?). Eschewing the traditional method of biting a piece from the top and vampirically slurping the internal fluids out of each defenseless, quivering packet, I merely allowed them to cool, lifted them towards my mouth with the spoon provided, and consumed them with one bite, the broth flooding my palate with warm ambrosia as my teeth lacerated the exterior, the meats barely requiring manducation.

Served at precisely the same time was my Oxtail Noodle Soup Consomme, complete with an ornate, occult-looking wooden ladle. My father has long sworn never to eat oxtail again in his days for reasons that remain unclear. For that reason, oxtail has been one of those animal parts that has always held a forbidden mystique to me. Just what does it taste like? Why does dad revile it?

As every stock-soaked beef morsel fell from their shamrock-shaped bones and withered into sweet nothingness onto my tongue, I thought amiably only of one thing: Corned Beef. Oh what a Beef on Weck or French Dip one could make with oxtail. In this context, however, I had to settle for having my oxtail chased down with a sea of dark and darkly savory Oriental bouillon in which tender, lovingly scratch-prepared noodles bobbed and drifted.

Dessert was a doublet of delight. The Crispy Creamy Mini Buns were just that. Ideal in their glazed glory, they immediately brought to mind donuts, particularly those from a wildly popular chain that expanded too quickly for its own good. The Sweet Egg Yolk Steamed Buns, though, were where horizons were expanded. Built from the same, surreal substance as the buns involved in the aforementioned pork belly sliders, the three orbs with canary irises were filled with a neon yellow custard that was an exercise in saline vs. saccharine alchemy. One bite had me dreaming of eggs on Sunday morning. Another would take me to dessert that same evening. 

Everyday Noodles is somewhat of a misnomer in that this isn't ""everyday"" Chinese. Rather, what's being served up here is exactly the manner of Chinese cuisine I'd been craving for all too many moons; the dishes I'd never heard of before and never knew existed. While I'll continue to enjoy General Tso's Chicken and Crab Rangoon as much as my fellow countrymen, Everyday Noodles has certainly broadened the local landscape of Asian fare by simply elevating and introducing to Pittsburgh palates those (well-executed) dishes that were formerly obscure to us. For that I thank its staff and ownership. 

P.S. Speaking of ownership, the restaurant's co-founder Mike Chen came to our table to chat briefly with us as we dined. Until he told me, I had no idea that Mr. Chen also owns Tamari. Ironically, while EN's pork belly was superb, Tamari's wasn't quite as good (read: dry. look up my review. it was one of only two gaffes). 

P.P.S. All of our dishes were affordable, easily shareable, and conducive to varying levels of hunger. Be it a quick bite or a grand feast you're searching for, EN has a meal for you. 

P.P.P.S. The service and atmosphere were both stellar all around. Break out of the box of Americanized Chinese food and make time for Everyday Noodles.",2013-07-24 03:39:23

We had an hour to kill before heading to the airport on the Sunday of our trip, and found ourselves close enough to Four Peaks Grill & Tap that we decided to check it out.

I wasn't in love with the place. It was a sports bar in a giant ugly strip mall next to a Party City. There were a lot of people there to watch football on a Sunday afternoon, so it was a bit loud, and otherwise pretty bland. We sat on an enclosed patio next to a draped tarp that dripped water. Service was good, though, and we did enjoy ourselves.

We had a round of beers and an order of Bavarian pretzels, a solid mid-afternoon snack. We had the Hop Knot IPA and the 8th Street Pale Ale, and I remember liking one and not the other, but not which was which. (Feel free to mash the Useful button right there.) The pretzels were great--big, soft, and chewy, studded with salt. They came with a spicy mustard sauce and an optional chile cheese dip. Don't skip on that cheese--it was delicious.

I didn't like this place enough to come back on another vacation, but the beer and pretzels were tasty, and our time was better spent here than it would've been at the airport. I wouldn't recommend this bar unless you're a local or a major sports fan on a game day, but I'll definitely keep drinking Four Peaks beer when I'm in Phoenix.",2015-11-12 19:52:48

Since most of the marketing in town depicts naked or semi-naked female bodies, we're just used to commerce and sex being entwined.  Why should our art be any different?

In this way, the Onyx Theatre is the most Vegas of all theaters.  The theater is located in the back of a gay/leather/fetish sex shop (really).  Once you navigate past the sex shop register where tickets are sold to the hallway, you step out into a rather large off-strip theater house that hosts some of the freshest, most innovative shows in Vegas.  

Many of the performers from shows on the strip test their material out at the Onyx.  In my few visits to variety shows at the theater, I have seen a man swallow swords and then run a spiral drill bit up his nostril with an electric drill, a comedian in the guise of a Mexican wrestler, a disturbingly-flexible contortionist, and a comedian with a whip.  And Rocky Horror Picture fans can get their fix at the theater twice a month.

One of Vegas' best entertainment spots that sadly doesn't get enough attention.",2010-07-23 16:40:55

It's upbeat, modern, comfortable and clean. The staff is very friendly and they have a good mix of brews, wines, cocktails and milkshakes. 

Two of my favorite things about ZB is the shareable dishes (zucchini sticks and different kinds of fries) and the burger of the moment! If the menu wasn't exciting enough, there is a different burger every time I visit and I love the creativity every time! 

I have two favorite burgers on the menu: The Bruce Lee and the SamBurger. The Bruce Lee has unique flavors that include, crisp napa cabbage slaw and cucumbers with some spice from the jalapeños and sriracha mayo. It literally karate kicks with flavor! Super cheesy but absolutely necessary! It is a little messy so make sure you have your napkin on you and you're not wearing white! Although this burger is delicious you cannot go wrong with the good ol' SamBurger. Also make sure to add an egg for extra credit to make it taste 110% delicious!

To be honest, the only real problem with Zinburger is that they have so many intriguing options that you may take a while to decide...or you'll just end up ordering two burgers instead of one! Come hungry cause you will eat it all and not be disappointed!",2018-04-08 21:56:08

We've been there 3-4 times, always trying something different. Despite the changes in what we ordered - one thing was notably stable: the high quality of the food and drinks. I've never ventured into making my own creation, but believe this will be my next experience there. So far, our favorite burger was the Steakhouse burger, which literally is like eating a great steak at a great steak restaurant... hell, it's better! I'd also recommend their ""Meat your maker"" burger which is a little pricey, but well worth the dough and calories.

The shakes area phenomenal, and the sweet potato chips are delicious. We tried an order of gorgonzola fries as well, and really liked them. They have a great beer list, and the overall ambience is completely appropriate for a burger joint. It can get a little noisy, but when they open the place up, it's really quite awesome.

The only 'bad' thing is the wait here - they have even figured out how to make it the least painful wait as possible - with text paging when your table is ready! That way, you can walk around the Waterworks Mall, and come back when they buzz your phone.",2013-03-30 01:19:59

I'll admit I was a bit nervous with some of the mixed ratings on here about portion size, but my fiance and I each had the 5 course carte blanche menu and were more than stuffed by the end. There are no neon lights here people, no free refills on pop, or crayons on the table... this is not East Side Mario's, the food will not fall off the side of your plate. In fact, the food is a smidgeon of art work; I felt so bad destroying its perfect placement each time a course came out. But then again, the flavours were incredible, so I didn't feel bad for long!

Like another reviewer on here, I can't possibly describe the intricacy of the courses and do them justice. There were NS Bay scallops (a big maritime hug goes out to the waitress who pronounced ""scallop"" like she was from Digby!), Fluke, Ham (not just regular ham, but super ham) and then duck breast and duck sausage, which was honestly the best dish of the whole crew. It's the mix of flavours that get you, you""ll be tasting things for the first time with every bite. So well done.

Dessert was a lemon tart with kiwi berries, and I'm telling you, this lemon tart was delicious!! Lemon tarts usually bore me with their tarty, dry filling, but this one rocked my world for a little bit. The lemon curd was soft and pillow-y and the shortbread crust was perfectly cooked. I would have asked for seconds, but I had to remind myself we were at a restaurant and not my grandmother's house.

This is a cozy, intimate place with a heavily euro-feel. In a way I felt like I was in a small town in Europe, the service was speedy, attentive and proper.

We always joke about the front decor being Native American with eagles.  At a closer glance though, the wooden ""tee-pees"" are just ornaments that are supposed to look like Chinese roofs. We bypassed the lunch buffet in favor of dishes from the menu: chicken fried rice, pad see ew, and roast duck curry.  I also tried the Thai iced tea, which was pretty good.  It was moderately sweet, and creamy.

I wasn't a big fan of the fried rice.  It was less greasy than your average Chinese fried rice, but it was rather salty for my taste.  The onions were way too strong (I prefer sweeter onions in fried rice).  It also was just a little more greasy than the better fried rices that I have had at other Thai restaurants.  

The pad see ew was good, or at least comparable to most other decent Thai restaurants in town. The one complaint I had was that the Chinese broccoli was sliced very thinly, and had the taste fried out of it.  My friend thought that the broccoli might have been a little bit off, but I didn't taste any more bitterness than average.  

The roast duck curry was standard, but didn't shine.  It had small chunks of duck, and was nice and soupy.  I would say that the curry here is about average as far as flavor goes, but at least it wasn't overly sweet.  The duck seemed to be prepared well.

Although we didn't try it, the buffet looked decent, at least much better than the LoS buffet.  There were a wide variety of dishes available.  During lunch the place was quite busy, with dishes constantly being replaced as we ate, which is a good sign that the buffet is at least partially fresh during lunch.

Nothing to write home about. I tried the pulled chicken sandwich (mainly because I just like the notion of pulling a chicken, heheheh ) and was disappointed. The requested cajun bbq sauce was sharp without being flavorful. The meat was bunched together into a kind of a puck shape, and the whole dish was lukewarm. 

Others in the party enjoyed the ""Brontosaurus"" beef ribs, and given the novelty of this dish (my guests from South America) it was hard to tell how good the meat really was. They appeared delighted.

15 minutes later I got a cup of blended ice with a slight SLIGHT hint of a taste of pineapple.

NO thanks!

What a waste of five dollars.

I drank a few sips and the rest of the half of the cup was filled with tasteless blended ice.

The atmosphere was the perfect noise level: not loud at all, but not so quiet that you were afraid to laugh too loudly or accidentally hit your knife on your plate. The BYOB policy is very convenient, and within minutes of arriving, our table was provided with an ice bucket and two glasses for our bottle of wine. The service was attentive and friendly, and the food was rich and flavorful. Overall, the entire experience was lovely!

We ordered the mussels and lamb shoulder ""cheesesteak"" as our appetizers. Both were incredibly flavorful, but the winner was the dish of mussels with its vibrant broth that had the perfect salt level. I would've loved at least five more pieces of crusty bread to soak up all that broth.

For entrées, we ordered the wagyu meatloaf and the scallops with prosciutto wrapped shrimp. The meatloaf had the perfect texture and was very rich. I loved seafood dish best, though. The scallop was cooked perfectly and the farro risotto had a creamy texture with the ideal amount of bite from the farro. The shrimp were also perfectly cooked, but the prosciutto made it just a bit too salty. However, when paired with the sauces, it was balanced.

Finally, for dessert we ordered the carrot cake special and the caramel chocolate bar. The carrot cake had a pillow -like texture and was slightly warm when it arrived to the table. The caramel chocolate bar was rich and was paired with a tart sauce that cut through the decadence. Both were incredible.

A friend told me that Avenue B is going to be closing shortly. This really is a shame. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. If you haven't tried Avenue B yet, please do so. Maybe a flood of new diners will convince them to stay open!",2018-02-15 02:31:35

They've got limited space to work with, but fill it with some really great, fun, and throwback candy selections. I wanted to play with half the stuff in the shop, but my wallet didn't want to go home with anything else this particular day. 

The adults will all come running, after you stop in for candies, treats, and sweets; they've got some goodies you don't normally see most anywhere else.

Granted, I'm relatively new to the whole art thing as I've only recently gotten into checking out art museums and galleries.  So while I don't have a true sense of crazy modern art, I was kind of blown away by what was at the Mattress Factory.  Some of their permanent collections like the room with toys/dolls and the interactive set-up with the models and room with mirrors/dots were super cool.  What probably blew me away the most was the exhibit in pitch black where you kind of chill for about 15 minutes and wait for these light dots to appear.  It's so trippy!  You can't quite tell if you're vision is totally messed up, or if it really is light that you're seeing.  No, I'm not high right now.  You really need to see it to believe it.

Service 3/5
We came in with our dog and the girl the counter asked us if it was a service dog, we said yes. Then she asked us if she could see some paperwork (which lawfully she is not allowed to do) and if we couldn't provide it we'd have to sit outside. She mentioned to see paperwork again, luckily the one table that was outside just freed up so we sat outside to avoid her having to keep asking. 
However, the drinks came out fast especially considering how busy they were. They also added sweetener to one of our drinks after I asked because it wasn't sweet enough. 

Drinks 3/5
We ordered a jasmine tea and their popular Hokkaido, both with boba. Took the first sip of my Hokkaido and all I can say is that it was kind of basic. Tasted like any standard boba milk tea you'd find at tea station, volcano, half & half, etc. The boba was soft and chewy which was good but tea wise it wasn't anything special. Also can't say I liked jasmine because no matter where I get it it tastes like I'm drinking lotion. But my friend who did get it was not impressed. 

Overall our experience was underwhelming. Maybe we ordered the wrong drinks? If I'm on this side of town I might ty it again, but can't say I'll go out of my way to grab boba from here when there's a great karate inspired boba place near my house that also welcomes our dog ;)",2017-06-02 21:24:52

My hubby and I had been talking about doing this hike for quite sometime, but every time we were going to do it something came up. This time we planned to do it this past Sunday morning and I am so happy we did! 

We got up early and hit the trail by 7:30am. The trail is marked very well in the beginning and it starts out with a moderate climb. Once you get past a half mile, it all changes very quickly. You are climbing up, up, up! The trail is a mixture of gravel and rocks. There is also some rock scrambling involved. As you are climbing, watch for the rocks marked with the painted light blue/green circles. These help you to know you are staying on the main trail as there are several other paths that go off in other directions and it can throw you off. Once you reach the saddle, the views looking down are amazing from this vista. Brownstone Canyon is in front of you and you start to feel accomplished. No, not yet, keep going to the right as you still are not at the top. 

Now your adrenaline is really flowing, you are determined to get to the top and know you will. I kept checking my watch monitoring my heartbeat to determine just how hard I was working. You will see other people coming down on random paths that have been created we, however, stayed on the main trail wanting to respect this area and leave as little damage as possible. As we came around the corner after a bit more climbing, we were rewarded with another incredible view. This time a peak of the valley floor and the city but we still were not at the top. We made our last ascent and then we knew we made it. Thankfully, there was only us and two other people which made it very special. We made it over to the little trough that had a book in it to sign, an unopened beer bottle, dog collar and a few other trinkets. These were obvious mementos that previous hikers had left. I signed the book although the ink ran so who knows if my signature will remain. We spent at least an 1.5 hours up there taking in every view and enjoying an early lunch. My favorite view was facing the beautiful peaks of Red Rock and a snow capped Mt. Charleston in the distance. My watch determined it took us almost two hours to get to the top, this would be including rest breaks and there were many. 

The hike down is much more grueling and hard on the body. I came down the chute sideways trying to prevent myself from slipping, however, there were a couple of times when I still heard myself saying ""WHOOOAAA"" as I slipped a little. We met some cool people on our way up and up at the top but people were not quite as friendly going down. We continued to be friendly and encouraging knowing what they still faced. Once we got down to the bottom, I kept looking back up at the peak with a big smile across my face! 

So remember the following if you plan to conquer Turtlehead Peak:
1. WATER, WATER, WATER is a must (I couldn't believe the naive people that had one little bottle of water - What???? This is the desert people no matter what season it is!
2. Safety should be your main concern. Watch your footing.
3. This hike is not for beginners, it is HARD and difficult as other reviewers have stated.
4. I do not recommend this hike for young children under the age of ten. If you are plan on taking your kids, then be sure to watch them as there are edges where they can slip and fall. 
5. Take snacks or sandwiches. Your body will thank you for the nourishment.",2017-04-05 04:24:44

Last night we went to see the Doobie Brothers and Chicago. At first our experience was amazing!! My husband and I were with my brother who requires ADA seating. An usher greeted us and walked us to our seats and made sure we were comfortable. I was impressed! 

Our seats were in the back row of our section. The next section was separated by a sidewalk/walkway that was probably 8 feet wide. The next section was elevated. 

The Doobie Brothers were on first and were amazing! They were awesome and they encouraged everyone to get on their feet! We did as did most in front of us! It was amazing!! 

After their encore, there was a break so Chicago could get set up. That is when it ALL CHANGED!!
A guy (who had been drinking a lot and was in the section behind us) DEMANDED we sit down during the next set as they couldn't see. We said that this is a rock concert and people stand. That is when this guy spoke to us in a threatening manner and used awful expletives! I got really scared and got security. The first two security staff went to talk to him. A more senior security guy then came to talk to us and said he was moving this guy so we would be able to enjoy Chicago. I told the security guy that I was truly threatened and he promised they would move this guy. I thanked him and was once again impressed.

Well, they didn't move the guy. It was so uncomfortable for us during Chicago. In today's world so many awful things happen and you just never know.!

Why wouldn't Ak-Chin Security move this guy? They promised us. All the people sitting next to us were shocked by his behavior! I was more shocked he wasn't moved. WOW!

What started out as amazing turned into a very scary situation! This was my first visit and I like this venue; I'm just not sure if I will return as I'm uncomfortable with the Security enforcement.",2017-06-12 15:51:35
mu1dKT6R7FrG2nsYI1YuOA,TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,KYasaF1nov1bn7phfSgWeg,3,6,4,6,"This was my first experience with Vietnamese desserts/drinks. The options are rather similar and there were several ingredients I didn't recognize, so it was difficult to order without really studying the contents in each of them. However, the girls were very kind and answered all my questions as I formed my decision.

I settled on #1 Bambu Special ($4.50): Coconut, pandan jelly, longan, basil seed, and coconut juice. I opted for the Large for $1 more, but it was surprisingly filling, so I'd recommend the larger size for sharing. I didn't care for Longan, described as a fruit similar to Lychee; it seemed more ""earthy"" in taste (though I am not very fond of Lychee either). The pandan jelly was chewy, delicious, and very fun to eat and the basil seeds reminded me of chia seeds, so I loved it. The coconut, although tasty, was very cumbersome since it was one very large, long slice. The coconut juice/water had a touch of welcomed sweetness. Overall, it was a nice, refreshing drink.

I'm intrigued to try other elements, but the menu doesn't really have a single Chè that appeals to me since I don't like longan, lychee, or beans (in desserts). I haven't seen a lot of information about customizing your own Chè, but hopefully you can?

The place was nice to hang out, but in the mid-afternoon, the sun fiercely heats up the shop (and most of its tables), so the only refuge was the couch/lounge area by the television. One couch appeared broken since its cushions would sink immediately upon sitting. The other couch was located directly under the television where the location of its speakers (and loud music videos) made it difficult to hear conversation. That left a wooden bench.

Anyway, I would love to create my own Chè because I love the concept and several of the ingredients. Otherwise, I don't really have a reason to return.",2016-01-25 18:54:40

So let's start with the price- I would give their price 5 stars because it's pretty cheap and the most fancy donut is $1.75 and it's a big burrito apple fritta which I will get to in a minute. It's also under $5 for a half dozen which is cheap. I did include a picture of the menu since I couldn't find any prices anywhere 

Next let's look at service- we'll I should say the lack there of but hey it's a donut shop and what you see is what you get. So if your looking for a recommendation from the shop or someone to great you, your at the wrong shop. Just go in pick your donut and run.

Finally taste- I must say I wasn't impressed, I got 4 donuts even though I wasn't super hungry and I never do a ton of sweets but I wanted to get a fair sample size and hey it's cheap so why not lol. The glaze was regular almost like a donut you pick up from a 7-11 or gas station , the maple bar was large as you can see in the pic and mind you I'm 6'3 so my hands are large but the maple was lack luster . The only one that was above average was the burrito apple fritta which is something I never seen before, it's a fried tortilla shell then covered in glazed and then stuffed full of cinnamon apples and topped with more glaze and cinnamon. I was very intrigued by this and it was tasty but be prepared because it's overly sweet . 

The one thing I will say is that it is 24hours and they make fresh donuts in the morning then again around 7pm so there's always a chance that if you pick up when they are fresh it could be a better experience and based off the reviews if I'm on that side of town and it's a time they make fresh donuts I will pay my $1 and try a glaze once more lol",2018-04-23 01:25:54

I'm a frequent visitor at ABC and finally was able to sample the other end of the alphabet.  Now, granted, I've been happy with a pizza I'd gotten there before (see below for Carl A's review) and with my eggs Benedict for Sunday brunch.

Alas, their regular menu just doesn't impress.  I'm always thrilled with the options and taste at ABC, so that's what I was expecting...with maybe a little jolt.  I would actually say that ABC blows XYZ away AND it's cheaper.

We ordered the fish, the chicken and the special of the day: sweet potato gnocchi.  Overall, the fish and the chicken were fine, but the gnocchi was probably the worst I've ever had.  I'm a gnocchi fan too!  It was chewy and dense, plus the Parmesan butter sauce gave it a very close resemblance to dog food.  (My mom actually had worse things to say than dog food)

So 2/3 isn't bad...but the two meals weren't blow away awesome either.  It was just a regular ol' sandwich!  Will I eat there again?  Probably not unless I'm drunk after Dyngus day and want to share a whole pizza with Carl A again.",2012-07-11 16:20:29

chLKrwJlM3L9kj7PkBTeIA,DPitNu466172os6m0Yri1Q,E_DXCeVllZtHV93hsAIZvw,3,3,2,1,"Located on the NW corner of Oak and 32nd St.  Cash only.  Straight dive taco joint.  Dirt parking lot and stating the inside is basic is an understatement.  The floor is tore up, the walls are a yellow painted wood paneling, the ceiling looks patched together, there are random tables and chairs.  Some are plastic Costco picnic type, others look like random wood tables and chairs someone donated.  If your kids opened a taco stand with left over furniture you had in your garage this is what it would look like.  There is a flat screen in the corner and a donated looking wall unit displaying sodas next to it.

The menu is pretty basic.  Tacos, tortas, burros, etc with meat options such as, al pastor, carne, pollo, carnitas, chorizo, lengua, cabeza, etc.  I ordered 5 tacos to cover all the bases and get a feel for the flavors and execution.  

First I had the al pastor.  The tacos were a good handful.  Not an extraordinary amount of meat but they filled the tortilla well.  The tortilla was crisped up a bit and while being soft corn they cook gave it a nice crunchy texture.  The al pastor was hot and freshly heated.  The seasoning was lackluster.  It was hard to tell it was actually al pastor by taste alone without looking at it.  Next I tried the carne asada.  The meat was very dark colored and had been reheated more than once.  The chorizo was third.  Good flavor and excellent chorizo.  Slightly on the salty side but the best meat of them all.  The pollo was good straight forward simple grilled chicken.  The carnitas was last and probably my least favorite.  Very bland, dry, and needed a tremendous amount of salsa and lime to throw back.  

Flavor wise everything tasted reheated and the seasonings were a bit dull.  I put lime and continuously applied salsa.  The salsa was tasty.  Especially the orange one.  Nice heat and balance and I would have eaten it on anything that came out of the kitchen.  The crisped tortilla shells were the highlight of the meal.  They were crunchy and pliable.  The young lady at the counter was very nice and provided good quick service.  Price wise the tacos were $2 dollars each.  While I wouldn't give it a second thought other than to mention it in the review we aren't talking about a great value here.

I would recommend a make over of the inside.  If you are going to use cheap tables at least make them uniform and a splash of paint on the walls and making the ceiling one solid texture would do wonders.  I would trash the dusty candy stands, throwback wall unit the sodas are displayed on, and the other tube tv in the far corner.  Put some covers on the lights and tone down the volume on the tv.  Foodwise, I would make the meat fresh to order.  I realize thats not possible with carnitas and al pastor, but it is for chorizo, carne, and pollo.  For the other two I would add more seasoning and at minimum make fresh once a day.  

I probably wouldn't come back again but still feel it's worth a try if you are nearby.  Best of luck.",2013-05-21 20:00:53

My sister and our mutual friend went here last night for dinner and had a really good meal. 

The food: I love that they have the ability to vary the spicy-ness of the dishes, and then they also bring out several condiments that can make it even MORE spicy if you like it that way. I tasted my sister's curry, which she ordered spicy. I typically hate spicy food but I thought I should at least give it a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised actually! It had so much flavor and just enough bite for me. I ordered the pad thai with tofu, mild, and it was perfect. I still have some left over :). I also ordered some jasmine tea that was delish and my sister and our friend said the plum sake was a great addition to the meal. 

Ambiance: the restaurant itself is small, but they make good use of the space.

The salon is a pleasant place to relax while waiting on a comfortable couch for your stylist. I perused a provided copy of Vegas magazine while waiting briefly for her to emerge. In that short span of time I was offered and received a bottle of water from the receptionist. Here on a first visit a stylist takes the time to consult with a new client concerning exactly what kind of cut or style is preferred. This short but unrushed talk occurs at the stylist's station before a tall mirror. 

Next it was off to have the hair shampooed while reclining over a porcelain basin following the clipping on of a towel, and turning under my buttoned shirt's collar. I would have thought that such a detail would be no big deal until the back of my neck and my shirt were drenched on at least three occasions somewhere else. Now I appreciate a shampoo where I emerge dry afterward, as on this day. 

Then it was time for the actual haircut. Nothing much to report on here except that it appears that my hair is turning progressively more white as I continue to mature (at least it is not falling out--which would be far worse!). And, the cutting was done in a very professional manner, using both scissors and a clipper, and wound up looking the way I wanted it to. Eyebrows were also trimmed without having to ask. While this was going on, the place was really bustling with activity on a Friday afternoon. Two women in high reclining seats were receiving pedicures, another was getting her hands manicured, and even a bride walked in--complete with bridal gown on and her white train sweeping across the floor. In fact, I was the only man in the room--which is not a bad thing! With all the action swirling around me amid all the green- and brown-colored items in the room, I felt like the lion must have as he was being pampered in Emerald City. 

The experience was not cheap--but I knew that going in. A men's haircut & blow-dry starts at $45, plus an automatic 20% service charge. So, at least $54.00 a whack. But at least it's a great haircut!",2011-07-16 01:22:20

Chef Justin, his wife Michelle, and co-owner Scott were there with open arms and the graciousness is infectious. This place continues to be amazing and will be at the top of our list for a long time to come. Keep up the insanely good work!

When we got there we had to sign up and register on ipads (I thought this was annoying... it took forever to type all my info in and why should my address, phone number, etc. be required anyway? I just want to get out on the course and drive!)

I think this place was a total rip off, I won't lie.  We were initially going to do 3 races and, although I had a lot of fun on the first race, I'm glad we just went once.  It wouldn't have been worth the $60 pp if you ask me.  

I think the whole racket is more of a really good tourist trap and a one time deal.  If you do wind up loving it they have a monthly membership ($55, I think) that gives you discounts on your races.  Again, (cough) RIP OFF. 

We all requested to be in the same team.  Didn't have to wait long for our race.  We were shown a short instructional video, got our helmets and off we went.  Now this is FUN.  If you're like me you like speed but are a little apprehensive at first, and are the granny off to the right lol But eventually I picked it up and enjoyed flying through the course and hugging the curves.  

If you're here for a real competition just know there's bound to be at least one ass who bashes you into the wall or forces you into a collision more than once and the whole thing will just slow you down (unless you are that ass. In which case, no offense).  For me I just enjoyed the ride and I liked being behind on the course :)  It allowed me to take a leisurely but fast drive lol 

A fun thing to do once with friends but probably wouldn't do it again.",2013-04-22 14:39:47

We hadn't been to Loews at the Waterfront, so decided on there. Since we were in the area, we also decided to dine at our favorite place at the Waterfront, Rock Bottom. 

While at home, I hopped onto Open Table at 6pm to make a reservation. One was offered to me at 6:15 as well as 6:30. We went with the latter to avoid rushing. We arrive at 630pm and were informed by the host that we would have to wait another 45 minutes to be seated. We asked why and mentioned our reservation. He said manager insisted walk ins have priority over reservations. I have no idea what world they live in but that is a foolish rule. Why even bother being on Open Table if you aren't going to acknowledge those reservations? I have worked as a hostess at a fine dining restaurant using Open Table.. it is not a complicated system so unsure how they managed to not make it work. We were upset. The guy said he'd put our name down on the wait list and to come back at 715!!!!!!! My boyfriend asked to talk to the manager because that was just cray. Luckily the manager over-heard our entire conversation and said he could seat us now. 

Walking through, I counted 7 open tables ready to be seated (plus our table). Since I worked in the food industry before, im assuming their kitchen was backed up which is why they didn't honor our reservation and needed more time before seating new guests. Fine, I get it. but explain it that way instead of saying ""walk ins have priority over reservations"". 

Despite that hiccup, we had a great dinner. As always, we ordered the firecracker shrimp as an appetizer. We also ordered their signature Champagne Mojito. It was a little too bitter (cheap champagne im assuming) Next time we will order just regular mojito. 

For entrée, I went to the Ale Chicken which is chicken, mashed potatoes, veggies served with mushrooms ale sauce on top of it was delicious and I highly recommend. My fiancé went with the Cuban Cristo.. a basic cristo which is then beer battered and deep fried. It was recommended by our server and bobby really enjoyed it.

There was an adorable paint night event in the side room. We still love Rock Bottom but I wanted to update with their official rule regarding reservations.",2017-02-15 15:23:44

We had a studio suite which was pretty nice. We also requested a view of the las vegas blvd strip as well as a room on a higher floor level and that is what we got on the 32nd floor! Yay!

The rooms have a lot of amenities such as coffee maker, fridge that is open for use on the bottom half and top half is a stocked supply fridge with drinks, chips and candy as well as several mini liquor bottles for purchase. 

Also a sink, dishwasher top, dining table and chair, dishes, silverware, glasses, liquor glasses and coffee mugs for a setting of four. Even a blender is included, can opener, toaster, pretty much everything you could need in a kitchen. The freezer even makes ice!! Although our ice maker was not turned on so it was not making ice, we called housekeeping and they brought up a huge bucket of Ice that lasted the weekend!

I really enjoyed the jumbo jacuzzi bath tub with jets! The separate shower with rain fall shower was nice which included a handheld shower mount as well. The best shower and bath I have ever enjoyed for real! Love Love Love the bathroom, TV installed as well. 

My only complaint is that the rooms are clean however extremely dusty just as other reviews have made note of. It was clear the room was clean however the dresser and table areas all had a layer of dust clearly visible. 

The balcony doors do NOT open for ""Security"" reasons as stated by the front desk. Bummer as it would have been nice to have hung out on the balcony to enjoy our strip view room. 

Rooms have a king size bed and sleeper sofa in the living room area.

Hats off to Housekeeping! We had a bio incident as my sweetie had way too much to drink after playing super hero bartender. He threw up and some unfortunately ended up on the sheets and comforter. I contacted Housekeeping who sent someone up to do the room. Myrna was awesome! She really cleaned the room with a smile and did a great job!

The Sofitel is in a great location - in the heart of the Golden Square Mile - in the middle of downtown and very accessible. 

We had booked our stay during a very busy time of the year -  a few days before the Grand Prix weekend. The hotel was booked choc a bloc, but service was unfailingly polite and prompt. Kudos!

Our group arrived a bit early and we had to wait until 3 pm for the room to be ready, which was the normal time for check in, which was a bit of a bummer.

I had requested a room with nice views and we were kindly accommodated on the PH floor with sweeping views of both Mont Royal and Sherbrooke Ouest. Sherbrooke is a special street: a main arterial road that is both modern and aristocratic a la 5th Avenue in NYC. Mont Royal was lush green and sight for sore eyes.

The bathroom was spacious and had Lanvin products which was nice.

Room service was great throughout our stay. 

The concierge was very knowledgeable about the newer places in town which came very handy.

The only thing holding the hotel back is that it is beginning to look a bit dated: at least the decor is. The carpeting needs to change. I did like how they've incorporated scenes from the city into the artwork in the elevators and the rooms.

With the nearby Ritz having undergone a complete makeover, the Sofitel will be well served in considering slight cosmetic changes: a nip here, a tuck there never hurt!

We've been watching the progress of this Farmer Boys location and since I haven't eaten at one in 4-5 years, I was a little anxious for it to open so I could try them again. Last time I didn't like it, and this time was no different...

For starters, they have a great location right on the corner of Centennial Center & Tropical Parkway/Azure. They are on the SW corner where Big Lots, BJ's & Party City are, and with so many other surrounding businesses, this place is probably going to be packed throughout the day. We went just a couple days after opening and as expected, it was so busy it took us a while just to find a seat. The inside is a bit smaller than I expected but they do have a decent amount of seating and it's always nice to see big, open kitchens. There's a ton of parking outside and of course, they've got a drive-thru as well.

The menu itself is pretty extensive and a lot bigger than I remember. They've got breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, salads, wraps, a few side choices, and even a fried fish dinner. I didn't see anything that says if they specifically do or don't, but I believe breakfast is served all day as well. For those with a sweet tooth, they don't have much in the way of desserts besides a couple milkshake choices though.

Now, the whole thing with Farmer Boys is it's supposed to be a fresh, ""farm to table"" like restaurant. I've heard very few people rave about the food, and now I can see why. I ordered one of their self-proclaimed, ""Award Winning Burgers"" and just wasn't a fan. The patties seem way too uniform to be fresh and aside from the complete lack of flavor in the meat, mine came out cold. All the toppings were basic, nothing seemed fresh and it was extremely sloppy. I also asked for bacon but instead got two small strips of sad, limp and flavorless meat. To top it off, the whole burger and the tray it came on, were soaked in grease. My chili cheese fries weren't much better. Frozen, over-salted fries and they didn't even bother trying to melt the cheese all the way.

They were also having issues with the ice and fountain soda machine when we were there, but instead of blocking it off, they expected customers to try and get their own drinks while some sweaty dude was hanging over the drinks and had his shoes all over the counter. Luckily, one of the managers noticed they were out of tea and happily offered to get me ice and fresh tea from behind the counter. The customer service was really the saving grace for me here. Every employee was friendly and it's nice they come around asking if you need anything or to clean up used plates and such.

I know they're new and maybe I'm being too critical, but reading reviews of other locations, it seems like the food just really isn't that good. They are really close to us, so I might give them another try, probably for breakfast after a few weeks of being open...but for now, I'll pass on Farmer Boys.",2014-07-19 17:14:28
8qPAls8RYyM7T4oj66N6tA,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,esivMfjV4OFS5g8YMuR3UA,5,7,1,6,"To any local in tune with the Las Vegas dining scene it seemed only a matter of time before Portofino shuttered, the combination of its out of the way location, poor marketing and an older Casino virtually guaranteeing only regulars and those in-the-know would seek it out, yet a mere 32 days after closing its doors Chef Michael LaPlaca and team are back with Osteria Costa and although only 3 days in at the time of this writing it is safe to say what's past is in the past but that there are plenty of good times ahead. 

Located in the old Samba between Pantry and the Buffet, an expensive build-out with a bar and lounge that extends up to the gaming floor backed by a more formal dining area and open kitchen, Osteria Costa continues a recent trend in moving Italian Cuisine from North to South and towards the sea, months of research and recipe development helping to create a menu that reads lighter than Portofino with a price point that is also more accessible.

Focused on the Cuisine of Naples and the Amalfi Coast with a menu divided into 6 sections, a collection of housemade Pastas the largest but surrounded by Salads, Pizza, Antipasti, Secondi and Sides, it was after greetings from familiar hostesses that guests were led past the Wood-fired Pizza oven to a slate 4-top in direct view of the kitchen, general manager Chris Zadie looking dapper in a three-piece  suit and overseeing a team of ladies and gentlemen mostly familiar from his prior front-of-house.

Looking over the menu and realizing more than 1 visit will be necessary to fully sample its breadth, a table of four likely able to walk away completely satisfied by a Pizza plus a couple Salads or Antipasti plus an equal number of Pasta or Entrees, it was with eyes bigger than stomachs that a 6-course menu was selected, Iced Teas plus glasses of Sangiovese refilled as necessary and the meal starting off with Warm Housemade Bread featuring a robust Crust and delicate crumb that paired well with Olive Oil but even better when grilled and served next to Housemade Mozzarella or Chef LaPlaca's peerless Meatballs ported over from Portofino.

Sticking with the light and sharable theme throughout Antipasti and Salads, though any of the $10-20 plates could easily make for a healthy dinner or snack prior to the show or club, it was with a light head of Truffles that Costa's Beef Carpaccio found itself in the company of Fiamma for the best at an Italian Restaurant following the closure of Olives while the Insalate Frutti di Mare, peppered Tuna Crudo and golden Fritto Misto all took fresh Seafood and let it shine amidst good Produce without much manipulation.

Showcasing a 900°F wood oven along the right side entering the restaurant, a quartet of Pizzas plus classic Focaccia di Recco emerging from the fire hot and lightly charred, it is with little more than Flour, Water, Salt and a bit of Olive Oil that 2 distinct styles of Crust are created, the former pliable with a puffy cornicione while the less well-known product of the city it is named for outshines any local version by being Cracker-thin and crisp despite a thick layer of Cheese.

Moving next to Pasta, the purchase of a top-end extruder allowing Chef LaPlaca to create 9 separate versions in-house daily, it is somewhat unfortunate that neither Gnocchi nor his signature Agnolotti made the jump but remaining true to the region fans are not left wanting for choices, a mistake with the Water first seeing Rigatoni a bit too saline though the re-fire was textbook al dente with subtle spicing while the Linguini with Clams and ribbons of Fettuccine were spot on from the start with the latter not afraid to show a meaty sapor and all the better for it.

At this point fairly well sated, about half of the Rigatoni and a few twirls of Fettuccini both packed to-go, it was with 2/6 Secondi plus all four Sides that savories concluded, Michael's billing of the Eggplant Rollatini as ""the best thing on the menu"" at first seeming a little overzealous for a $6 item written in a six-point font but in reality fairly true as the thinly shaved Vegetable and gooey Mozzarella ate like the lightest Mozzarella stick one can imagine, though the White Sea Bass in Tomato Water and Mary's Organic Chicken Parm were not shabby themselves, nor were the boiled, smashed and fried Potatoes teaming with Herbs and Garlic. 

Declining Coffee or Espresso after a long day and plenty of Iced Tea, the online menu and Social Media images of Dessert slightly different from Osteria Costa's actual offerings, it was with 4/5 of the menu served that eyes widened at a portion-to-price ratio far more generous than expected, just $5-$7 for Cakes and Sweets that cost double elsewhere and highlighted by lightly sweetened Olive Oil Cake plus chalices of Gelato and Tiramisu that are perfect for sharing given their substantial size, though if one is forced to pick just one the Tiramisu was said by a few to be the best they've tasted in Las Vegas.",2018-02-06 12:53:00

We arrived on an early Saturday morning at sunrise and parked in gravel off of Durango since I wanted us to get some good mileage on foot.  We found the park's trail quite easily which meandered towards the main park where the playgrounds are located.  The trail itself is nicely paved and we encountered several other folks walking and running along it.  There are great views of the valley here, as well, and it was early enough to see the hot air balloons that are a common sight in this part of town on the weekends.  
The park features playgrounds for all different ages of children, including grown-ups with a section of fitness equipment for the older set.  There are several grassy areas as well as picnic tables.  This really is a fabulous park to visit for people and pets of all ages.  It's just too bad I don't live closer because the trail system there is wonderful.

Which is ok, because I love that particular food.  But something sets Phoenix Palace a notch above the rest.

The menu looked great, and I floundered over what to get, until we saw the family style options on the back.  For a flat rate per-person, you get soup to share, a plate of appetizers, and as many entrees as you have people.  That sounded perfect, and we got a nice variety of food to share with the table.  

The hot and sour soup was very tasty, and with a little soy sauce added, not too hot for my mild palette.  The crab puffs and egg rolls were top notch.  Sweet and Sour Chicken tasted like it was made with real quality chicken, had fresh breading, and flavorful sauce.  The Broccoli Beef had really tender meat and veggies, and is easily my favorite version of that dish from what I've tried elsewhere.  The Kung Pao Chicken wasn't as spicy as I expected, which was a good thing for me.  We had more than enough food, and the leftovers proved delicious the second time around too.

The service was attentive, though there was a bit of a language barrier.  I appreciate the authenticity of the restaurant all the way around.  This may very well turn in to my go-to Chinese food!",2014-01-13 03:52:22
DRc7wPiJiCdRmZMyyEFMZQ,0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,2,3,0,0,"Now that my office is within walking distance of downtown, I could feasibly tackle every casino on Fremont St, although I'm not sure that's entirely necessary.  Triple George was certainly worth the review, but I've questioned the burger worthy choices of everywhere else. Binion's Café has also come up in the past few weeks, but that will be saved for another week. The D Las Vegas opened fairly recently, along with its D Grill, which several people have mentioned for its burger. I was skeptical, but once it comes up in conversation I must educate myself on any requested burger in town so off I went.

The D Las Vegas took over and rebranded the Fitzgerald's Casino & Hotel last year, giving the interior and exterior a much needed refresh. Being a Fremont St location, no matter what you do the shady crowd and smoky interior will persist. Without the help of poor signage I found my way to the D Grill tucked in the back of the second floor of gaming. Half of the space is flanked with tall banquettes and diner style tables and chairs, with some back lit walls. It's pretty large, and overall looks pretty decent. It was a little smoky despite the fact that no one is allowed to smoke in there, and you even get the faint sound of slots in the background. Their menu, which can't be found online, has over 75 breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert items which I can't recall because I only looked at the burger offerings.

After some deliberation I went with the wild mushroom cheese burger: sautéed wild mushrooms, garlic aioli, and asiago cheese on a challah bun. The meat had a really fresh beefy flavor, but it was totally overcooked beyond the medium-rare I ordered and had no char flavor. There was great garlic flavor mixed with the mushrooms because of the aioli, but not much flavor to the mushrooms themselves. The cheese was melted well but not all that flavorful or good. The bun was nice, but a bit too dry and cut poorly so it was too thin on bottom and too thick on top. I think the chef attempted to grill the bun because I noticed some grill marks at the very edges, but the center was apparently not in contact with the grill as I got bites of almost raw butter in some spots. The lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle were all fresh, but didn't make up for the rest of the problems. Overall it had all the elements to make a somewhat decent burger, but didn't really achieve it.

The fries were very generic; cooked well but had no great flavor to speak of. Also I received a really small portion, smaller than the other two helpings at my table for some reason. I understand that Fremont St is somewhat of a tourist trap, but this is where you should be able to still get decent deals. At $10.49 I can't really condone purchasing this burger, especially when you can go around the corner to get Triple George's burger for $2 more and far better quality.",2013-03-11 18:42:36

The only reason why am giving this a four star is because they dont have much bench seating outside the store since this is basically a drive by. There are few parking spaces so we usually (majority of the time) eat inside our car (which isn't a problem at night, but afternoons can be a little tricky especially during the summer). Plus they only take cash but there is an atm there just in case.

Even Sunset Grill can't offer three eggs, home fries, toast and bacon or sausage for that price, unless you show up at an ungodly hour like 8am for the early bird special.

My eggs were perfectly done, toast was nicely buttered and the addition of sliced tomatoes was nice in place of meat. Homefries could have used some spices like paprika or cumin to liven them up - the texture was great but they required heavy salting and ketchuping. I didn't leave an iota of food on my plate.

I don't feel out of line mentioning that my server (who appears to be the owner's mom) was not well versed in the art of hospitality. Peter (the owner/cook) came out to ask me how my food was, but she didn't. She spent most of the time behind the counter sorting jam packets or whatever she was doing back there. There was nothing particularly egregious about my service experience but it just wasn't very welcoming or attentive - when I ordered the combo I wasn't asked how I wanted my eggs, type of toast or meat, nothing. She came back later to confirm those options but really it should have been noted immediately. At a diner I expect the service to be friendlier.

Decor, as mentioned by others, is forgettable. Think the early days of IHOP (Buffalo locations only) church banquet hall. Certainly not befitting of the ""diner"" name. Booths would be nice.

I cruised through the NoDa area and when I saw Cabo I recalled the decent Yelp! reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  I went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy (the rest of NoDa was a ghost town) and the service was prompt and friendly.  I ordered the jalapeno & cheese 'mashers' which I presupposed meant mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, I was giving the beans and rice, kind of a downer as my GF ordered the beans and rice and we wouldn't get to see what both sides were like.  In the server's defense, she did ask a moment after bringing it out if everything came out right.  I enjoyed everything else enough to just overlook the error.  The chips and salsa were good and, as this was my first time here, came as a bit of a pleasant surprise.  Price-wise I think it was about what I expected $22 for two meals w/ water and tax+tip.  If it was half that price I'd be here everyday perhaps.  One more note, they let me switch the cilantro (yuck) white sauce for honey wasabi (yummy) sauce without a problem.",2011-01-25 01:43:49

Sometimes I'm just not all that hungry, or I want something quick but not too filling.  Other times I just want a light and healthy meal or snack on the go.  For any of these moods, Carolina Smoothies fits the bill nicely.

This small local shop is always immaculately clean, friendly and quick.  Their smoothie menu is right above the counter and is logically laid out.  Ingredients and options are clearly listed.  I've found the smoothies to be always tasty and the flavor combinations to be complimentary and pleasing.  Options abound even if you opt against dairy.  

Want to skip the ice and just have fresh juice? How about a shot of wheatgrass?  Just walk over to the right-hand counter and survey the juice bar. 

Perhaps more impressive, however, is the selection of protein bars and powder packets.  They carry lines here I've not seen elsewhere.  Downside is I'm not likely to spend $3-4 to try something new from a class of product that has the dubious history of tasting like cardboard.  

Luckily, though, they also carry a selection of petite packages of bulk foods- sesame sticks, yogurt pretzels, fig newton bars, almonds, etc.  

At $4 -$5 for a regular smoothie, you're not coming out much cheaper than a sit down lunch, but this is typical of any other smoothie stop in town.  Still, it's a cool treat for those otherwise intolerable summer days.",2011-07-14 01:25:43

Right from the start, I had a feeling it would be good because there were THREE different types of hot sauces already on my table when I sat down. A sriracha, a plastic ketchup bottle containing ""fresh hot sauce"", and a little white bowl of chili oil. A great start in my book. 

The restaurant was busy, as was the wait staff. All three employees were doing triple duty taking turns serving patrons, cooking, and keeping an infant occupied with toys and a laptop in the corner of the room. This gave the place a kind of homey feel, a subtle assurance that the food will be authentic, possibly based on generational family recipes. 

The service was fast, friendly and informative. After ordering the chicken pho, one of the servers quickly brought me a plate of fresh basil and bean sprouts. As a pho novice I stopped the waitress and asked how to properly eat the pho with all of these wonderful ingredients on my table. She kindly told me when the soup comes out I should put the sprouts and basil in the broth, as much as I like. She explained that most Vietnamese usually put sriracha in their pho, however, she prefers the chili oil. 

When the pho arrived I basically put the kitchen sink in there. I started out with the sriracha on one side of the bowl and chili oil on the other. Tasting each side before co-mingling the spicy goodness. It was fantastic. The noodles couldn't be better. There was a bit of gristle in one of the pieces of chicken, but it's not a big deal for a $7 lunch. Tip - if I had to do it over again, I would probably skip the sriracha and use about a tablespoon of chili oil. I think I over did it and the strength of the hot sauces eventually overwhelmed the balanced simplicity of the original flavors. 

Another example of Saigon Nites authenticity.... If you look hard enough, the menu has a little section of ""French"" sandwiches with pickled daikon. As a history buff (see - French Indochina) this little nugget of information has me quite intrigued and now I know what to order next time. 

I left feeling glad that this restaurant is so close to where I live and work. I definitely plan on coming back... often.",2010-09-15 21:14:32

Wanting food and not wanting to cook or go anywhere it's always great to know you have choices in the area for delivery.  Hungry, we got the menu and jotted down everything we wanted and called in our order.

Calling in the order was quite easy.  Bing, bang, done.  We were quoted 45 minutes for our delivery, but I kid you not, it was there in about 25.  So I guess they were super fast at cooking and delivery.

I ordered my old reliable, General Tso Chicken with white rice.  The broccoli that came with it was crisp, I like that little bit of crunch you get.  The sauce wasn't too overpowering.  Sometimes you get a sauce that can be way too spicy or way too sweet, but this one hit right in the middle and was satisfying.  I had also ordered a vegetable egg roll.  Amazing.  

When we had ordered we had asked for sauces to come with, we got more than enough sauces which is nice since some places don't send any at all.  Overall it was a good experience with delivery from this place.  Fast and courteous.  I was told that in this area this is a favorite among the locals.",2018-09-20 03:54:43

There were basically two minuses that subtracted from my experience there.

First, maybe because they are catering to a business lunch crowd that isn't familiar with more authentic Thai seasonings or-- well, I don't really know-- their food tended to be overly sweet.  The pad thai was very sweet, such that someone I brought there for lunch was almost unable to finish it.  The yellow curry (one of my favorites) was also cooked such that the curry itself was discolored, with brown flecks-- I was told by another Thai cook that this is from over-cooking some part of the mix, but I'm afraid I can't help past there (though it did not taste burned and it didn't actually taste bad, it just tasted ""off"").

Second, this is the second location as far as I know and it definitely lacked some atmosphere.  It felt more like a generic restaurant with some Thai decor thrown in for good measure.  The first location is a little bit more quaint, and the people working there seemed slightly more relaxed-- since that first location is not in the same sort of business-centric area, it's entirely possible that the faster pace of this second location is just part of doing business.

Anyway, for a quick Thai lunch in the Chandler area it's not a bad choice at all.  I just think if you're looking for a serious Thai meal, that this one strays a tad too much from authenticity.",2007-02-04 05:28:57

They slathered it really generously with nutella and put an entire sliced banana on top. For less than $5, that's pretty great.

But really, it's the drinks that sink this place. I have learned to stick to the beer and wine because the mixed drinks are uniformly terrible. I have yet to taste any alcohol, and the sweet mixer always overpowers everything else in the drink.

We were a group of 8 that went to celebrate one of our friends birthday. The team of the season is ""Alice in Wonderland"". 

The decor is quite cute, I liked all the props around the tea salon as it was done tastefully. The staff was also costumed, although only one waitress was dressed in a cute costume. The others had some kind of underwhelming accessories. 

The food we has was quite stunning. The quiche, shrimp sandwich and turkey bites with mango were really out of this world. The assortment of sweets were also quite delightful and well balanced. A lot of the food items were bearing decorations that reminded of Alice in Wonderland and it was nicely done. 

As for the tea, I went with the Feuilles d'argent, a tea that had nice creamy and light floral tate. This tea was made exclusively for the Ritz.

I think that they they were understaffed as it took an awful long time to get started and by looking around the room, some other tables were also looking around appearing to wonder were the servers were. 

The service was nice, the waiters always explained what the teas were and what the food items were, but it was a very reactive service, not proactive. 

There was no follow up in between the services, we had to remind them our water glasses were empty and that some of our tea pots sat with the lids off for a long while, waiting to get more hot water. In the world of luxury these are little details that make the difference.

There was an egg something or other, a frittata maybe? Finally, we ended with a suckling pig with the crispest skin and pork that melted in my mouth.

OKAY NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. 
lets talk about this dreadful experience from the beginning just on the phone. 
1. After repeating my order 3 times, where it was consistently repeated back incorrectly, she seemed to FINALLY understand the 4 things I ordered and asked for my name. I said it was JESSICA somehow that was changed to Claudia and then Miranda... WHAT!?!?! 
When my friend went to go pick up our food for us... they were missing a whole burrito, still screwed up an order when I clearly said one of the burritos was with bacon ( they gave us sausage) AND I HAD TO WALK SOME GUY THROUGH THE ORDER AGAIN OVER THE PHONE BECAUSE IT STILL WAS INCORRECT
Seriously. Its like speaking to a two year old.  So irritating. 
So other than having to spend 20 minutes of my time to relay what 4 items off the menu I wanted we get out food...
4 minutes after my coworker was eating her food, she had to rush to the bathroom to throw up and had to be sent home early from work .
This is not the first time this has happened to a friend of ours but desperate times call for desperate measures and we were giving this place one more shot, and yup, they are terrible.

I enjoyed walking around looking at all they had and being taken down memory lane as I saw alot of things I haven't seen since I was a kid.

All the staff were friendly and helpful and they get pretty busy, you wouldn't believe the boxes and boxes of books and things that had accumulated since we first got there. It took them awhile to tally up our credit amount but we didn't mind, we were too bust taking it all in.

If you're looking for vintage Vegas, this is it. Be prepared: it's got a funky talcum powder smell (I presume to mask smoke), the interior is bathed in a golden yellow sepia-esque tint, and it's a bit small by comparison to modern day casinos. But, if you can live with (or even like) those things, then the El Cortez will be a treat for you. On the gaming front, they even have coin operated slots and video poker towards the back. Retro cool, man.

There are a few bars to take advantage of: the main bar is always good, but if you want that retro Vegas feeling, there's a lounge toward the table games you should check out. It's got the leather and dark wood thing going on. The third bar back by the keno is also an option, it's more open than the other two, but gets a cool afternoon glow during the summer months.

Food-wise you can order at Siegel's which is a solid choice, or try Pizza Lotto by the keno. The Pizza is pretty solid, and you can do whole pie or by the slice. If you're more into sandwiches and chain dining, there's a Subway on the north corner, near Ogden and 6th.",2016-09-27 18:49:02

I had been needing some major work on my 1997 Ford F250 and since the quotes were running from $2500 to $3100 for the repair, I thought I should take it to these guys for a truly honest quote.

So, I called to make an appointment and of course, he asked what was needed. As I was telling him what was wrong with my truck, he actually interrupted me to tell me that I didn't need the work that I said that I needed.  His attitude was that I had no idea what I was talking about and that the other shops were trying to rip me off.

So, I patiently tried to explain that even though I was female, that I was used to doing my own vehicle work, that I come from a background of mechanics, etcetera.
He became more condescending, and I eventually realized that there was no talking to this man.  Ever.

Took my truck to AAA automotive.  For around $2800, I got my work done with no arguments or verbal ""pats on the head.""

My boyfriend and I have been coming to this dry cleaners for about a year now. Him more so than me. He takes at least 10 - 15 pcs of clothing with him every week and a half. Honestly, we liked this place.... until they lost his shirts. 

And, my problem isn't that they lost his shirts. It's the customer service after the fact. They had accidently given someone else his clothes, which is completely understandable. This is TWO months ago.

So far he has gotten 2 shirts back and that was about two weeks ago. Everytime we would go in my boyfriend would politely asked if they've heard anything about his shirts and the owner would just grunt and say no, haven't seen them. 

LITERALLY, a day before he got those 2 shirts back, we went in to drop off another week's worth of clothes and when we walked in the Owner looked at him and didn't say a thing until he said hello. She said, ""Hello. No shirts yet."" No smile, no friendly greeting. JUST NOTHING YET.

She told him to give her two more weeks for the shirts before they do something about it. This was about a month after they had misplaced his shirts. 

THIS IS RIDICULOUS. We come here EVERY week and half with a fair amount of clothes. I feel like she should REALLY care a little more. She didn't have to bend over backwards or anything but she's been at the best cordial.

Clean, luxurious and attentive. My daughter and I went for our pedicures today. Tip: Call in advance and make an appointment. We both agreed that we received excellent service also because we came during the week at 2 pm. 

Nice environment. The entryway is super cute. The manicure stations and the pedicure spas were all in good condition. I love the beige, purple and white color scheme. 

Welcoming. We arrived early, they got us in immediately. My daughter got the Classic Pedicure $22, and I got the $29 Callus Pedicure. They had me at the rose petal and grapefruit in the spa. The aroma was so refreshing. Then, when I slid my feet into the bath, the bath salts they use were luxurious. I started my chair massage immediately. My pedicurist threw in an extra grapefruit slice before getting started. Both technicians that worked with my daughter and I were pleasant and polite, quietly asking after my daughter and my family. 

Clean and sanitary. The tools they used to trim our nails were in sterilized packs. The bath had a plastic liner. The technicians used gloves. Tip: Be sure to ask for latex free if you have a latex allergy. I had no fear of contracting an infection or fungus.

Quality foot and leg massage. Our whole experience lasted a little more than an hour. A good portion of the time was scrubbing with pumice stones, lathering with cleansers, massaging with mango body lotions. They even massage using the grapefruit slices. Then, they bring hot towels, wrap and press on your calves and soles of your feet. I was on Cloud 9! After that, they carry in two medium size hot stones. They massaged our feet and calves again with more lotion. 

Detailed.The callus removal treatment was neatly done and with great care. When they add polish, they use a paint brush to remove any stray polish. I felt pampered and cared for.

I love that everything is natural, and they believe in working with your skin rather than using harsh chemicals.  I found the staff to be really helpful as well - both the receptionist and the technician who did my facial.

The facial itself was lovely, and I was really impressed with the technician.  I had booked one type of facial, but after analyzing my skin, she suggested that another type would be better for me.  That alone gave me confidence in her abilities and knowledge, that she could know which would be best and wasn't going to just blindly do what I (with no knowledge on the subject) had chosen.

I told her I have to go pick up my daughter as it was approaching 2:30. She said that it's policy and insinuated that I have unpaid items. I got frustrated because I stood around and had to do the security work myself and no one helped for like 2-3 minutes and now this?? I was so mad I told her to take everything back bc I have to leave. This associate knew I was in a hurry and dragged the procedure. I used to work for department stores and I'm positively sure that when the alarm goes off, all associates are to be alerted and proceed to the help with shoppers' bags. After the incidence, I called the store and explained the whole situation. I'm pretty sure they reviewed the cameras and sent me two $25 gift certificate. Honestly, $50 cannot represent an apology for calling me a thief.",2014-05-19 20:46:46

We started with the gazpacho and the mussels, which were the highlights of the meal.  Unfortunately, the tuna (although marketed as being seared) was overcooked.  The short rib ravioli seemed like a good choice, but was a bit oversalted.

My extra stars are more for Casbah's ambience.  The covered and lit patio is pretty romantic, so I would suggest drinks and appetizers with a reservation on the patio.  The staff was VERY attentive...maybe a little too attentive.  But this was probably because we came on a Thursday.  I've heard that it gets pretty busy during the weekend, so reservations are a must.

The menu overall looks really tasty, so I may go back to try a few more dishes...but not before trying some other places in Pittsburgh!",2010-09-09 01:51:21

I didn't eat here but I'm giving 3 stars because of my first impression upon coming to this restaurant. If it wasn't for the Instagram account I am following for Kingyo, I wouldn't be remotely interested in checking this place out again. However, the interior design of this place is pretty awesome and inviting. What wasn't impressive was the greeting I received and the hostess. First, I walked in and no one greeted me. There was a girl who had a uniform on but looked kind of lost. She eventually made her way to the front and then went a table and then came to me. But she was also talking to someone else at the same time while greeting me so it was super awkward because I didn't know what was going on. 

Btw, (REWIND) I tried calling to make a reservation on Good Friday. I called on Thursday and Friday morning but the line was busy/ it kept ringing with no answer. When I got to the restaurant at 12:30pm there were tons of empty tables but also a lot of people waiting (about 4 groups were ahead of us). The waitress told us it would be a 30 minute wait and if we didn't want to wait, we should have made a reservation. I told her about the phone situation but she just repeated herself.... Okay, so I'm supposed to call to reserve but I can't get through to make the reservation. One guest suggested that it's busy because they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen. My question is if there aren't enough chefs to cook food for the number of seats in the restaurant, then why aren't there more chefs being hired? I have read other people said the same thing about the long wait, lots of tables issue. I also read that they provide board games to play while you wait so I'm not sure why they didn't just seat us, tell us that it's going to be a wait until we can be served and give us some board games. That would've been cool! 

Needless to say, I was starving so I left. I really want to try the food here (although I'm reading that it's kind of mediocre)... But I'll make a reservation next time and do a real food review! Until next time...",2016-03-26 03:57:54

We had a few bloody mary's and some mimosas, coffee, and iced tea too.  My GF had her normal bacon/spinach/feta cheese omelet with the fruit bowl (she always orders the same thing), and SIL had the bacon, eggs, and blue berry pancakes (two huge ones).  He said they were good.  My GF's daughter and I had the Mulligan Special breakfast -- three eggs, bacon, home fried potatoes, and toast.  This was good, but it was just a standard, simple breakfast.  I was half expecting the chef to do something special, even if the menu did not mention anything different or creative.  I was also a little disappointed in the potatoes too -- they were just plain fried and the last few times, they were fried with rosemary, which gave them some ooomph.  Not complaining -- we still love this place.  Oh yeah, on Sundays it is happy hour all day long, beginning at 6 am.

A pretty solid spot to get decent Chinese food near State Street. The 3 star rating is because things can be a little bit hit or miss here. There are times when our favorite dishes are not as good as they usually are. Despite this inconsistency, this is a restaurant that we very much enjoy whether for eating in with a big group or to order takeout. When the dishes are on point, they're the best near campus.

As far as dishes go, I really like their fish with tofu and ginger sauce. It is a large and filling dish, which often leaves us with leftovers. The beef dishes have always been really solid go-tos for us. I also like the fried chicken with chili pepper, but this is a dish that we've had mixed results with.",2018-04-09 19:15:09

Portions are generous and there are 32 dishes to choose from ranging from Italian red wine beef to sweet and sour chicken. I had the coconut scented Portuguese chicken which was creamy and flavourful, along with bass and veggies simmered in rice wine as well as bitter melon and egg.  The set comes with soup, but you have to order your own rice. 

All dishes were pretty good and I had plenty of leftovers to enjoy for a future meal. 

Also you can ask them to hold the MSG. 
The only caveat is the combo sets described above must be chosen from a Chinese only menu taped on the window. With my poor Chinese reading skills, it was a bit overwhelming.

Our server was very attentive, the atmosphere is cozy & casual but with an upscale vibe. 

But what really matters is the food, right? So let's get to it: It was incredible & I am not even remotely exaggerating. The real reason we tried Greenhouse is because my husband was hankering for poutine (french fries smothered in gravy & cheese) & it's the only local place we knew that had it. I  would describe the food as bold flavor combinations made from the freshest ingredients. I had the PLT (a BLT with pimento cheese & goat cheese). With the bacon, crusty grilled bread & a rich tomato dipping sauce, it was a delicious flavor explosion in my mouth.

For this Casino I think you'll probably have a better time at the Casino than in the rooms.  If there is one theme here its Smoke.  You smell smoke on the casino floor, in the halls and even into your non smoking rooms.  This isn't a problem I've had at other Vegas Casinos, and I am not a smoker so I'm probably extra sensitive.

The rooms themselves are pretty nice, so no complaints there.  An actual working fridge that doesn't have some pressure sensitive plate trying to charge you 14 dollars for a bottle of water is a nice touch.

The pillows were very flat.  Fortunately they give you three on the bed so you can construct a pillow to your size liking, but it still felt a little cheap of them.  Also, my bed was really squeaky.  I think nearby animals were frightened away by how loud it was.

The rooms also are not very sound proof, so if you are looking to avoid being awakened in the middle of the night by hall partiers, you are likely to be disappointed.

Finally, my chief complaint was the Internet.. Its PER ROOM PER DEVICE. In this day and age that's kind of a bummer. Each device is 13.00 for 24 hours of Internet access.  Other places at least give you per room Internet access.  I was sure to download a 2 gig episode of ""Planet Earth"" in HD just to register my disappointment.  However, the speed is VERY nice compared to some other places I've been so they at least give you your 13.00 worth.

Honestly, I would have preferred Wan Fu, but it was a bit out of the way and I was in a hurry so I just went for something close by.

My S.O. and I both got Kung Pao Chicken.  This place does not offer brown rice, so we just got steamed white rice. We also got a side of 2 egg rolls  & a spring roll, which brought the total to around $27.00  

The food was ok, typical of a take-out Chinese place in a strip shopping center. My S.O liked it better than the takeout we got at the Wok on Providence Rd. However, I think I slightly prefer the Wok over Chef Kwo. Both places could stand to put a little more chicken in the dishes. 

Each place seems to make Kung Pao with different veggies, and I don't prefer the veggies they use at Chef Kwo.  Also, I noticed a produce sticker on a piece of Bell Pepper in my food last night, so that sort of put me off.  Obviously, they don't wash the veggies well before using, but that is probably the case at most of these types of establishments.   The white rice was super sticky, and not really the best rice I've had.

Sidestreet is one of the places I'm starting to frequent when I need a quick Pho fix.  At the northeast corner of the intersection of Desert Inn and S Durango, it's easy to get to.  There's the main storefront / set of shops there, and several others grouped together in smaller buildings in the parking lot.  Sidestreet is one of those, so don't look past it.

The menu is big enough to satisfy you regardless of what kind of Pho you're after, and there's a generous assortment of other appetizers / assorted street foods on the menu to ensure you can supplement your soup.

If you don't already know what you'd like, I recommend trying the Pho Ga or Pho Tom.  Both are tasty.  Another way to go is to ""make your own"".  This was what I did the first time I went, and still do when nothing else on the menu seems to satisfy the craving.  From the appetizers, the Papaya Salad is very good, as are the fresh spring rolls with grilled pork.  I haven't tried any of the Udon or egg noodle soups yet, but I keep promising myself I'll do it soon.  I know I'll find some new favorites from those parts of the menu.

While it seems there are always people there eating at mealtime, I've never had to wait to be seated, making this a place you can go to for lunch during a busy day and not worry that you'll lose valuable time waiting for a table.  The restaurant is always clean and relatively quiet.  When you arrive, you'll notice the staff always seems happy and genuinely glad to see you, whether you're there to dine in or just to pick up an order to go.  Speaking of take-out, if you order soup to go, the cold/fresh items are packed separately from the hot broth so you can add them just before eating.  Just what you'd expect from a good Pho restaurant.

If you find yourself in the south-central part of the westside of town and you're hungry for Pho, swing into Sidestreet.  I'm pretty sure you'll be satisfied.",2018-04-24 16:35:03

Greeting visitors before they even go through the door is a bin full of free books. I haven't seen anything to my taste but I do like the idea of books distributing their ideas for free.
The interior is clean and spacious and more importantly, well lit. The center of the store has the bargin fiction and non-fiction section with books ranging from $2-$4. This section mostly has books that were popular a few years ago, but where I always pick something up. These books are always in  great condition and cheaper than you could buy for a Kindle or ship from Amazon. Other than the second bargin section along the side wall the rest of the books are priced about the same you'd see anywhere else.
The next great bit of this store is the themed Fandom areas - great source for gifts ranging from a Dr. Who scarf to a Walking Dead Risk.
My biggest complaint about this store is that their credit card machine has been down twice, and I pretty much never carry cash. It was frustrating to spend the time to find the best of the bargin books only to hear over the loudspeaker that the machine was down (again!) and I had to abandon my finds.",2015-01-28 02:02:11

I own a car that is of one of the (now) many GM brands no longer produced. Because of this, it can be at times difficult to find a dealer who can service my car. (*note* I don't always go to dealerships for service. I realize that many times they are much more expensive. However, I go to the dealerships for genuine parts, and a recourse if the service stinks). 

For this occasion, I was having a couple major problems with my car. I had taken it in to an independent mechanic about 2 weeks prior to taking into Findlay, and the first mechanic said I only needed a tune up and an oil change. They were wrong, but I unfortunately found that out after I had already paid for the oil change and tune up. I had some major problems with my radiator, and my engine intake. Findlay spotted this right away. The service staff was incredible. They laid everything out for me and were honest. Well, after fixing those problems, 2 days later my fuel pump went out. I took the car back to Findlay, and they quoted me on a price. Being so close to the holidays and having already spent over $1000 the same week, I let them know I couldn't afford to fix the problem. I left my car at Findlay over the weekend to pick up on Monday and tow home. 

On Monday morning, I got a call from the service rep I was working with, and he let me know that they were going to work with me and give me a deal. Previous to the call, I had gotten a couple quotes from other shops to see if I could get the work done cheaper. The quote that Findlay came back with was over $125 cheaper than any of the other mechanics gave me. I was definitely in luck.

My car is now working better than it has in a long time. I was very happy with both the work of Findlay's mechanics, and the quality of their service.",2010-12-17 01:17:27

The big plus was that the valet got us some really great deals on a Sunday/Monday for limos and party busses, like under $50. A lot of the hotels out there will turn up their nose to you if you ask for a deal, but Elara would offer it to us. We were a group of 6-8 people and needed two cabs to get everywhere. It really helped to make our trip more special to have nice vehicles and I'm quite thankful to the Valet staff- they ALONE earned a star on this review.

The negatives this trip were mostly on check-in and check-out. Don't expect any preferential treatment here if you are getting a 3 or 4 bedroom suite. They don't care how much money you are spending $600-800 a night, they make that quite apparent. We arrived 4 hours before check-in... I didn't EXPECT an early check in but it would have been nice if we could have checked into our room with refrigerated items a little earlier than 4 P.M. And it still took 30-60 minutes after that to get our bags brought up. The night before check-out, I asked for 11 A.M. check out (as I had been instructed to do the night before). I had requested it in my original reservation as well (they are a 10 A.M. check-out hotel). I was at first told no on the phone until I threw a fit and was finally granted 11 A.M. Not a very organized or service-oriented hotel. Valet staff excluded of course.

I thought the service was good, but for the most part, I was not impressed with the quality or tase of the food.  I had a spicy ""southwestern-style"" burger ($12.99), and the majority of what I tasted was the THICK, doughy-Bun.  The meat was rubbery and bland, the condiments were soggy and tasteless.  Fries were ok (they were hot, so I assumed they were fresher that the rest of my plate).  In my opinion, a terrible burger for the whopping price of $12.99.

Another member of our group ordered a Reuben sandwich - According to her, It was greasy, and she was ill for the rest of the night. 

The rest of the food that I saw seemed mediocre and rather plain, especially given the prices they were charging.

Very cute hipster ambiance. Loved that. But be prepared to get cozy with total strangers. It is a very tight space.  Also there is very limited parking. If you have a larger car/ truck/SUV, don't even try.

I ordered the chicken pho and traditional spring roll. The food left a lot to be desired. When I go to a Vietnamese place for the first time, I see if they can nail the basics before I venture to the other items on the menu. I'd say this place is catering to an American palate, so I thought it was bland and not as well executed as I thought it should be.

I thought $15 was expensive for what I got. I can pay $6.95 for some seriously good authentic pho at that hole in the wall place across from MCC, but hey, I guess you pay extra for the atmosphere and location (just don't expect the food quality to match the price point).

Service could be better. I wanted to order another drink mid meal and try a desert but was never asked if I wanted anything else. The servers were rushed and it was difficult to get their attention.

However, from what I've experienced in comparison to what others have written about The Willow House, Hob Nobs is da' bomb. (Okay, I know what I just wrote is really cheesy, but I just had to -- I can't pass up an opportunity to flex my rhyming muscles!) 

The place, for some reason, reminds me of the coffeehouse from Frasier. I think it is the dark wood, craftsman style bungalow feel. Very reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest, especially Seattle. I really like that warm and cozy vibe, and Hob Nobs pretty much has that covered. They kept the look and feel of the place like an actual home. There is a living room area with a more formal feel, a nice sitting area with leather couches and chairs around a fireplace, and then some nooks and crannies in the back for those wanting a more intimate and secluded setting.

As far as the coffee, I'm not much of a connoisseur of the stuff, but it was okay.  Nothing really special -- I have had better -- but it was decent. They've got other stuff too -- pastries, sandwiches and yummy chocolates from a company called Belle Fleur Chocolate. 

The other nice touch is their live music offerings. A friend played there the other night, and despite the sound being a little so, so (not sure if it was his amp or theirs) it was a lovely setting for hearing some local and visiting musicians perform their stuff.

I am, in no way, an authority on what makes for good Ethiopian food but I know what I likes, and this place I definitely likes.  I dig the atmosphere and the music that's always playing that totally makes me think of a smooth jazz station in Africa or something.  

Yesterday I went and got some grub here.  The food came quick as usual and it tasted extraordinary, as usual.  But, man, there were these damn kids running around.  These people sitting across from us must've brought like 8 goddamn kids with them.  Somewhere between 8 and 10 totally bad kids that ran around and were loud and singlehandedly gave me an aching headache.  If I wasn't a pussy, I would have told them that they're selfish, yuppie fuckheads.  What are you thinking bringing that many kids to a place without a ball-pit?  Kids don't wanna eat at a quiet restaurant, they want to jump around and swing around and shit before totally passing out somewhere.  That's what kids do.  I don't blame the kids for being bored... I'd do the same shit.  I blame the parents for being such retarded, wanna-be cultured fucks.  ""We'll bring our sophisticated children to get African cuisine.  Mmmmyeessss.... that's what I plan to do with my afternoon.""

There's not much the dude who works there could have done, unfortunately.  I mean, people who let their kids act like assholes would freak out if he told them that the kids were maddeningly loud.  They'd be like, ""We're not paying the bill, shall never come back and will tell people there are rats in the food.  Whole rats.  No, it doesn't make sense but it's gross.""

Aside from that one incident, the place is great.  I love it.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like.  Something tells me that with the monster gas this place gives me, I'd be super healthy and would benefit from hitting 'em up on the montly.

The food are served with very fresh ingredients and you can tell by the taste of the dishes they serve here.  Our server was also the manager and was very mean or so I thought, but that's just the way he spoke (loud as if he were mad). He proved me wrong by asking us if we want to put two chairs together with cushion for my friend's 2year old son when he saw him falling asleep. Very thoughtful of him, so for that i'll give this place 4 stars for its service.

The Pho menu didn't have numbers and I was like damn, i've never ordered Pho in my life by actually trying to pronounce it.  I ordered the Pho Dac Biet I think it was called.  Added my spices, handful of beet sprout, and jalapeno (my usual addition) and taste came out superb.

Walked in, asked about their patties, was told all the patties are frozen, but, the Homeburger was made for them using their own recipe, SOLD!  I ordered the Homeburger combo, upgraded the fries to a Poutine and added another side of onion rings because they looked really good.The burger was huge in size (8oz patty), the poutine and rings were also generous. 

With a big smile on my face, took a big bite into the burger.  What was this...dry and bland!. What a disappointment, the bread appeared to be on the dry side, which would have been fine had the beef patty been juicy and not dry as a hockey puck. It was completely overcooked,  so much so that the cow's distant cousin was thirsty! I was unable to finish my burger. I'm not sure where other reviews wrote about that ""Juicy"" burger, but this was not it...I'm extremely disappointed with my burger !!!

On the other hand, the onion rings were fantastic and meal like due to the thick batter coating each ring. The fries were also very good on their own. However, combined with the sauce and cheese that was cut to look like curds (was definitely not curds, perhaps it was mozzarella) It was a sloppy mess that caused the fries to get soggy and the melted gooey cheese that lacked texture, ruined the poutine. 

I compare this place to the old burger places of yesteryear that used to serve up broiled burgers in big round buns with a large portion of fries and a drink for 5 bucks. They were the greatest burgers at the time when the alternative was Harvey's and Mc D's. This place remains in that era and serves up that same type of food, of course there are many that still like that and this is the place for you (if they don't dry out that beef patty).  If you are looking for a modern take with a burger that has more of a gourmet taste, thick and juicy, IMO, you may want to investigate other choices.",2018-06-13 22:39:38

Before I even get to saying how amazing the food was I will start with the atmosphere. We got sat at a table with walls around it so it was almost like having our own room. The waitresses wear traditional Japanese garments and speak very little English. It's considered casual but you would look a little under dressed if you showed up in board shorts and flip flops. It is a very cool setup and added to the experience. 

Now about the amazing food. Sadly enough I didn't try the sushi but I did get the vegetable tempura which was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best I have ever had. My sister got the chicken Lo mein and it had such an amazing flavor to it I wanted to eat her whole meal! My boyfriend got the platter with shrimp tempura and teriyaki chicken. It was huge and he loved it. I think he picked the best thing on the menu! 

Overall it was amazing and definetly will be a returning customer.",2011-06-11 19:24:01

5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


I should mention that my reviews for Sushi On Bloor and New Generation Sushi are identical, as, after many visits to each, I find they are beans from the same edamame pod.

There's much to say about Sushi. It's raw fish on rice, and it must be prepared by hand and with care. That helps justify the expense, even though it's customary in our society to equate ""value"" with ""man, I'm full.""

Which is why places like Sushi On Bloor and New Generation Sushi continue to be overflowing success stories. They provide the same ample feeling you might expect for $15 at any bistro, pub, or family restaurant, but, under the cover of ""sushi"" the average consumer feels that they had a healthy meal, or that they've experienced something avant garde.

The sushi at this restaurant barely has any taste, except for a hint of the saran wrap it sits in before a chef slaps it on some rice, and/or in a box, and on your table. Let's be frank: most Bloor Street consumers drench the rice in soy sauce and wasabe paste anyway.

The fish here is barely distinguishable. They make some extremely tasty special rolls ($10) but these tend to use cream cheese, avocado, tempura, or other filler that, again, makes the fish indistinguishable.

So it's hard to rate this place other than to say: expect a wait, you won't pay too much if you order smartly, and you'll probably get tea at the beginning and ice cream at the end.

We got the cheese tray as a app. Seemed like if there was a display to show what they were serving that's the plate we got. The prosciutto was very fatty and had a clump of what I would say fatty grease in the middle. For entrees we got the halibut and NY strip steak. Both were cook great but just lacked flavor. Seemed as if there was no seasoning on the either. Strip was suppose to have a Demi glaze over it which couldn't tell at all. The middle of the steak was cool great which I asked for med/rare but the outside of it was charred to the point that it smelt burnt with every bite. I didn't even eat half of it. My dog loved it though! Got wild mushrooms with the steak. Again flavorless tossed in a pan with olive oil that's about it. I honesty felt like I asked for everything plain due to some diet restriction or something which of course I didn't. We also got asparagus as a side. Very strange the top layer was not bad at all but when you got to the bottom of the dish it was very gritty. Kinda like getting sand in your mouth.

The pieces or karaage were massive and probably the best I've tried from all izakaya places. The short ribs were meh. The seaweed salad came next, which I wish it actually came at the beginning.

On my third day on the job I went to find a hotdog stand and was successful. However, it was just a plain jane hot dog with a little ketchup and mustard. Good but not really anything to look forward to again.

Fast forward a few weeks. I am walking the streets of Tryon looking for something to inspire my palette because I'm in one of those rare moods where I just can't decide what I'm hankering for.

I came across the Chili Man stand on Tryon between 4th and Trade and saw a few people ordering and being chatted up by the owner. Loving verbal engagement I wandered over and stood in line meanwhile listening to a random story being recounted by the Chili Man himself.
There are essentially two main options on the menu: Hotdogs and Brats.
Fortunately I happen to like both and ordered one of each.

Then I got to pick my toppings for my meal. For my brat I just got brown mustard and Sauerkraut (major kudos for even offering a brat with kraut, which is surprisingly rare). I took my dog based on his recommendation which included spicy mustard, spicy ketchup, chili and cheese.

I will say both were great but the chili just put things over the edge. It did not seem like a generic canned chili and I have been told (though not confirmed) that he makes it himself. It would not surprise me. It does not matter if you don't have cash because he is up on the digital age and can accept credit cards.

So the food is fantastic but one thing that makes you want to come back and what puts this place at the top of my Uptown lunch list (besides the chili) is Vic ""the Chili Man"" himself. I do not think this man has ever met a stranger. He always has a great story or conversation topic that has nothing to do with the weather, sports or politics. It is refreshing to say the least. If you are ever in a downcast mood, this man can lift your spirits with a good conversation or story. He is not intentional about it, it is just who he is.

The lighting is bright, the colors are sophisticated, and even though the manager that day apologized for the A/C not working properly (it was getting fixed that day) it was still a suprisingly comfortable temperature.

My burger was fantastic! It was one of the best burgers I've had that wasn't cooked by my wife or mother-in-law (seriously they make the best burgers!). I liked how they set it up where you add the toppings and sauces to your specifications.

I adore Burgatory. And it's weird that I would love a place called Burgatory, because I don't really eat any meat except for chicken. But the beauty of Burgatory is that they don't just cater to the traditional beef burger eaters. Their handy build-your-own option gives chicken and veggie lovers like me the ultimate burger freedom! Hooray!  My favorite combination as of late is a burger made with chicken breast dusted in cajun seasoning, topped with farmhouse cheddar, BBQ sauce, and onion straws. That's it. Very simple, yet so, so, so, so, so yummy. The ingredients that they use are so high-quality and fresh that you can really TASTE them. The farmhouse cheddar is perfectly sharp and tangy, the spice from the cajun coating on my chicken really pops, the BBQ is sweet and smokey, and the onion straws add a nice salty and crunchy bite. All of these flavors manage to simultaneously stand on their own while working in perfect harmony together. It's truly chicken sandwich bliss.

Of course, you can't have a helluva burger without balancing it out with a heavenly shake. And their shakes live up to their heavenly moniker. My favorite is the S'mores, with chocolate, micro-marshmallows, and tiny bits of crushed graham cracker throughout, topped with a giant toasted marshmallow. The salted nutella crunch shake is also amazing (though really, have you ever had anything with nutella that WASN'T amazing?!), and I love their specialty shakes too. Around Easter time they had a Peeps shake that was out of this world. Their shakes are huge and easily enough to put anyone into a diabetic coma, so split one with a friend (sharing is caring, after all).

The only thing I don't like about this place is their high-top table chairs. I know they're trying to go with the ultra-modern decor, but those high-top metal chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable. I'm a tall drink of water, and I just don't fit right on them...my legs dangle and there's no comfortable place to rest them. I just end up feeling like an overgrown toddler when I'm sitting on those chairs, I don't know why. It's quite odd.

This place does get really, really crowded, and not just during normal weekend dinner hours, but sometimes at completely random times as well (there was once a wait at 2:00 on a Tuesday, WTH?)  However, their wicked wait times have gotten a lot more manageable with the No Wait app. Click a place in line in the app, and they text you when your table is almost ready so you can start heading over. Unbelievably convenient, especially for me since I live within walking distance of this place. Now I can wait at home and just walk over when my table is ready instead of having to putter around outside the restaurant with a huge crowd. Fantastic!",2014-07-21 17:26:48

You know if the restaurant is run by people whose ethnic background does not match the food, something is bound to go wrong.. (Sorry, just a stereotype of mine I cannot break)

Anyways, we decided on Indian for dinner tonight, and I suggested to try Samosa Factory as I had bookmarked this place for quite some time. The restaurant had mostly positive reviews which is what convinced me to stray from our usual Indian joint.

The restaurant itself is small.. Definitely a ""hole in the wall"" type of place.  We were greeted by this a large caucasian man, definitely NOT what I was expecting at an Indian restaurant.  Not sure if he was the owner.. but in addition to seating us, he took our order, and served us our meal.

We order the chicken tikka masala, shrimp vindaloo, and garlic naan.  Both entrees served with basmati rice.

The chicken tikka masala was NOT what we were expecting.  Prepared completely different from any other Indian restaurant we've ever tried.  I was expecting yummy curry sauce, but this hardly had any.  Although it wasn't badly prepared, it just wasn't up to our liking.  The shrimp vindaloo was nothing spectacular either.  This had more curry sauce than the chicken tikka masala, but nothing impressive.  I like curry sauce to be thick, this was more watery.  Lastly, the garlic naan and basmati rice were just average.  I didn't care of the naan because it was thin and dry as opposed to thick and fluffy like how we are used to having at Mt. Everest.

There were plenty of minorly annoying aspects of staying at a major hotel in a big tourist city - the check-in lines are unbearably long, there was trash in the hallways (?), housekeeping forgot to clean our room one day. All that aside, I had an overall positive experience at the Flamingo. 

The staff seemed to do their best to alleviate some of the issues. A very friendly front desk staffer walked us through kiosk check-in so we could avoid the VERY long line & walked us to the front of the line to work with someone else when the kiosk malfunctioned a little bit. When I called to be sure our room would be cleaned the day after housekeeping passed us over, a very apologetic housekeeping staffer promised to tend to us the next morning & offered up a conversation with his manager if I wanted to take it up the chain (I didn't, but I appreciated his forthcomingness). And so on. Other staffers were absurdly friendly, too, in ways that made the whole stay a more positive experience overall, from the amiable bellhop to the fast-moving buffet server who kept us rolling in water refills & much-needed coffee to the gift shop worker who helped me pick out a clutch purse 20 minutes before my big event to the pool bartender who remembered up names (big ups to Rigo for treating our group so well!)

Other positives: The Flamingo has a few nice shops attached to the lobby, a spa with inexpensive quick massages, a Margaritaville, a party pool & a quiet pool, a few shows & attractions, a massive & comprehensive buffet, a brewery with a great outdoor patio, &, of course, a casino. It's in a great location on the strip, pretty close to everything, & from some of the rooms & hallway windows, you can see the famed Bellagio fountains! 

If you're looking for a swanky Vegas experience, the Flamingo may not be the hotel for you. But if you're looking for a positive experience in a hotel that seems to give a damn about its customers, even without big-time prices & fancy extras, then this hotel is a great choice. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Flamingo!",2013-05-20 20:12:18

I will echo the suggestions other reviewers made that they need to open more checkout lines during the busy times.  However, I usually go on a weekday night or a Saturday night when it's not busy, so I never have to wait in line for that long.

The free wifi is nice, but kind of useless.  Who spends enough time in a grocery store to lounge around and surf the internet?

Another useless section is the cosmetics.  They don't carry enough of a selection to make it worthwhile and the price is a lot higher than what you'd pay at Walgreens, which is right across the street.  I can't imagine a ton of ladies are buying their cosmetics there.

""I consider myself a burger connoisseur, so the Aloette burger ($18) was a natural choice. And after one bite, I knew I'd savour every mouthful. On the patty were the perfect proportions of sautéed onions, shredded lettuce, mayo and fried Beaufort cheese. It was a classy burger, as I'd expect it to look at this establishment. While I could taste the quality of meat in the patty, it was cooked closer to well-done, which prevented the burger's natural juices from seeping out. Regardless, the components elevated this diner staple. And the fries...Mon Dieu! Hand cut, double-fried and crispy...""",2018-04-10 02:26:49

4th of July and we decided to grab a quick dinner before the fireworks.  My wife and I have been coming here since they opened a couple of years ago and this is one of her favorite places.  I like it too and with the exception of the Oyster Po Boy, the food is generally good. They have never mastered that one.

I had the Prime Rib which was one of their daily specials. It was excellent and great cut of meat.  Only downside was the salad that came with it.  Lettuce was limp and the balsamic dressing left much to be desired.  My wife had Philly Cheese Steak Wraps which she enjoyed and even brought the leftovers home for a midnight snack.

Service was excellent.  They just took over the space next door and expanded the restaurant and the remodel came across well.

We ordered to go and when we got home we opened the containers to discover that our 2 orders (both were large chicken teriyaki bowls) were different.  1 was correct and the other had half the chicken, no sauce and no garnish...I do believe this was a mistake and that the container got closed before they finished it?!  We took photos and are going to go in and I hope they rectify it but regardless this shouldn't have happened in the first place.  Dock a star.
Secondly, the majority of the chicken was charred to the point it tasted burned.  Quite disappointing.  It was also fatty enough that we had to pick fat off the slices.  That was also not cool.

So, I stopped in and was very impressed with the variety and quality of dishes. It's a small, modest restaurant, but the food is very satisfying. Being from cuyahoga county, I have never been to a restaurant that allows you to bring your own alcohol. Since there is a corner store next door, this was great. Only thing to prepare for is... they cannot store the alcohol, so bring your own mini cooler.

I have tried the octopus salad, tasted like octopus in a teriyaki sauce-fine. Also, ordered the veggie pot stickers (dumplings) which were really good. Just ask for the eel sauce for dipping. I have had the crab roll (wouldn't order it again). Cali roll, added cream cheese, is done with imitation crab and I didn't think it was anything special. I enjoyed the philly roll and liked the salmon. Even though it is not smoked, like some other philly rolls I have had. My favorite roll that I have tried so far is the spicy tuna roll. I order it every time I'm there and I love it.

Out of the specialty rolls I have had the clark roll and spider roll. The spider roll is made with soft shell crab and a special sauce, which was different. I wouldn't say I would order it again. The spider roll was enjoyable, other than the artificial crab salad that is piled on top. I would stick with apps, entrees and sushi rolls versus the maki rolls. The two I have had were fine, but I have had better. 

One thing I really enjoyed was the bulgogi. It comes with a soup and salad, which were really yummy and completely devoured. Then the entree is served with nice quality, thinly sliced rib eye beef. Sauteed with mushrooms and carrots, and a nice sauce similar to a teriyaki. White rice and pickled veggies on the side.

1. It's located on the second floor of a smokey hotel. While smoking is prohibited in the lanes, you could still smell it while you were bowling. I was only in the vicinity for 2 hours and the smell of smoke was detectable in my hair. 
2. Why are the employees so miserable? The employees working the cash register/shoe rental were rude and impatient with customers. Plus they moved at a snails pace. The girl with the super curly hair working the snack area needs an attitude check. Honey, be grateful you even have a job. 
3. In a huge germaphobe, so everything to me was just yucky. Putting my finger in the bowling ball holes and putting my foot in a shoe used by hundreds of other people. GROSS!! Best believe I washed my hands afterwards and brought a clean pair of socks to wear when I got my own shoes back. 
4. Oh my goodness, the people who come here. It's like shopping at a Walmart. You get your drunk 20 something's, to the couples and their overly affectionate selves, to the family who brings their infant baby out at night to a loud bowling alley, to the weird old guy bowling while talking to himself. You get what I'm trying to say. EVERYBODY is here. And if you're bored while waiting your turn to bowl, you'll definitely be entertained by all the people watching. 
5. People need to stop ball hogging!!! I saw numerous small groups with around 8 balls in their area. Is it really necessary to have that many balls for 3 people? It's called sharing people!!!!!!!!! . The only balls that were available were 13 lb and up. We had to wait for a larger group to finish their game to snag an 8 and 9 lb.

Ok rant over. The 2 stars are for their surprisingly clean restroom and friendly cleaning lady picking up trash from tables. I'll just stick to going bowling elsewhere.",2018-01-29 07:34:52

So after last night's post-For Goodness Shake visit, and the helpful Yelp reminder I will get this submission submitted.

Custom Built Pizza (CBP) is great.  They have fresh and quality ingredients that you can select from to engineer your very own pizza or pick from their menu of pizza combos.  If you get one with everything (all the sauces, cheeses, toppings on one pie = Suicide Pizza) it still costs the same as another pizza that you customize with just all the veggie toppings.  Awesome concept!  But don't go crazy, as the pizza might get more soggy when overloaded with too much sauces and toppings, plus some ingredients (bell peppers) will not cook properly or gets overcooked (the herbs).

My first personal sized CBP was a Suicide Pizza, the very first one ordered per the owner.  It was definitely a very hearty pizza.  But one with less stuff on it is actually better.

All meats + sweet onions, red onions, green onions and mushroom pizza with BBQ sauce was really good.  Of all the crazy combos pizza I have ever architect (doesn't it just sound more sophisticated instead of customize???), this was my favorite.

Regardless of how conservative or institutionally insane your pizza creation is, it still just requires a quick minute or two to be baked in their nice hot oven and delivered to your table for immediate consumption.   

CBP also offers dessert pizzas.  If you still have room to spare that is, which in my case has always been ""no"".

Quality ingredients, fast friendly service, even faster baking time, and 16,464+ combinations of pizzas = a lot of visits with a lot of friends, just so you can earn the coveted right to say you have tried every type of pizza offered at Custom Built Pizza.  Gotta eat 'em all!",2013-07-24 14:21:53

The reviews here were what made us decide to give it a try.  We did not think we would be disappointed.  Well, when compared to the Thai that I am very fond of, it was indeed disappointing. 

The spring rolls were decent, very large, but mostly lettuce (I did not mind this so much being that I love lettuce, but my husband said they did not have the hint if basil he is more so accustomed to and enjoys), and the edamame was good (the only place I have ever been to that has messed up edamame was Nakama).  My husband seemed to enjoy the crab rangoon too.  Now on to the entrees, the Chicken Pad Thai was way spicier than the level three that I had asked for... it was almost inedible for someone like me who does not love spicy.  The noodles were not your traditional Pad Thai noodles rather it seemed more so like vermicelli.  Just not good compared to what we like (Nicky's and the Smiling Banana Leaf).

Chorizo - Small thin slices of chorizo w/ dates and Cabrales cheese...delicious balance of salty and sweet! This was one of my favorites of the night.
Poquillo Rellenos de Bacalao - A pepper filled w/ potato. I thought this was just okay but I am biased because I don't normally like peppers.
Churro de Cangrejo y Estragon - This was amazing! This is essentially fried dough made with crab and tarragon. Comes with a creamy dipping sauce.

Service was great. The staff was very friendly and service was adequate. 

Food/drinks: 
The first section of the menu is a variety of meats, cheese, and olives for a customized charcuterie board. Nothing really wowed me and I wasn't expecting much. My group ordered a few dishes to share. We ordered the arancini, flat iron steak, and the daily catch of the day (salmon). The flat iron steak was impressive, they made it really well. I would definitely order this again because it was just that good. The other items was really nice too. The salmon dish had corn and diced chorizo. It was an interesting blend. 

Overall, the food was great. I wanted to try the parmesan cheesecake but I was too full by the time we got to desserts. Maybe I will return to try that cake and more cocktails.",2018-02-27 20:16:54

To the benefit of Markham Bowl, it's independent, attracts a local crowd, and isn't as league-heavy as Club 300.  It seems like lots of families come out here too - it's good for kids.  They offer both 5-pin and 10-pin bowling at about a 50/50 split and it's not uber-expensive.

So why am I a hater?  There's something wrong with the lanes.  They're either warped, crooked, or just not waxed well, but bowling here is extremely frustrating.  We're no pros - in fact we pretty much suck at bowling.  Yet while we can normally get somewhere between 60 and 100, at Markham Bowl getting a 30 is a good day.  It's impossible to throw a straight ball here!  

So if you're coming here for some beer and really don't care if all your balls wind up in the gutter, this is totally sufficient.  But if you want to knock down a couple of pins every now and then, I'd suggest bowling elsewhere.",2009-11-29 20:20:44

Time to remedy that! 

The best thing about Cafe Conmigo is the people who work there. The owner and her young, friendly staff are always cheerful and very accommodating. They get the food to you fast but still every order is prepared fresh and to your specifications. You can even order ahead so that you can do a quick pick up if are expecting a short lunch. 

For breakfast, they serve up Starbucks style coffee drinks (lattes, cappuccinos, etc) that are very well done with every flavor syrup you could possibly want, plus the usual toppings of cinnamon, nutmeg, etc available. Unfortunately, the prices are almost as high as Starbucks. However, their other items are very reasonable. They have bagels and pastries to grab on the go and also so egg sandwhiches/burritos and other hot options. Also fresh fruit is always available, which is nice. Usually bananas and grapes. 

For lunch, I am not a big sandwhich person, but all the salad options are good though unfortunately the dressings are usually chilled to the point that the olive oil has solidified (that kind of grosses me out). The best thing by far is the soups. A new one every day but they are always amazingly good. They come with crackers or you can order pita bread or a half sandwhich combo. They also have a daily special lunch which can range from tacos to pasta to just about anything. It is almost always very good and so that is usually a safe bet for a cheap tasty lunch. 

I highly recommend Cafe Conmigo. It is super-convenient for anyone working in the Galleria building but even if you are just shopping in the area it is one of the quickest, cheapest options in the area.  There is not much in the way of seating in the actual cafe area but there are comfy chairs and couches scattered around the first floor Galleria atrium.  A great way to bask in the sunshine without being exposed to the heat!",2011-04-13 20:02:59

It always seemed to be empty, which led me to believe it must not be that great.  Well, don't judge a book until you walk in and try the spaghetti! 

The Bollo Neapolitan has been my favorite pasta so far and the steak sandwich is to die for.  I'm telling you- I never order steak sandwiches and I fell in love!   I've tried a few of the other pastas and they were ok, but the Bollo Neapolitan was my fav with the runner up being the Garlic Shrimp Pasta.

Now for the Negatives.  The chicken on the pasta just never really tastes right to me.  I don't know what it is, but it has a very gamey taste.  The dishes I've tried without chicken have been far superior in my view.  

Finally, I've never seen this place packed.  That can be a negative or a positive depending on my mood, but I would like to see a few more patrons.  So, if you don't want to wait in line at the other Italian joint in the AMC 30 complex (Macaroni Grill) or are looking for a non chain option, check out Neapolitan!

Wow!!  I'm lucky to have Marcia as a friend!  This amazing woman, business owner, singer, mother of three sons, and soon to be grandma, rocked my hair-styling world!  

I told her I wanted to look like and rock star, and she didn't disappoint.

We did a color, and a cut and style and wow!  

Did I mention that Marcia is one of just a handful of people in the state to win some prestigious hair awards?  Because of that she was asked to go to Tokyo! Whoo hoo!

Of course the added benefits of going to a beauty school are that the prices are amazing.  I paid $55 for a custom color, cut and style, which normally would have cost $200.  The flip side is that it takes a little longer than going to an experienced stylist, but I was okay with that and thoroughly enjoyed my time there.


If you're looking for a rockstar hairstylist, I recommend Marcia McGovern at Kohler.  But you need to hurry up before she graduates!

Then you wait what seems like half an eternity to get your food. Of course it might just seem that way because there seems to be no system for the people delivering the trays to know who ordered what - no numbers to put on your table - the folks with the trays just go around shouting names and what was ordered until they find the right table. This is kind of silly because there are tables all around the perimeter of the restaurant and I'm sure it adds greatly to the wait time. They have loyalty cards but I don't think I'll fill mine up any time soon. Parking is a real clusterfarkle.

After being a long-time Cobs Bakery gal (see my review of the Kensington Market location), I went a few doors west on Baldwin and gave My Market Bakery a try for my weekly loaf and monthly buns.  I have been in on and off through the years for various treats, but have in the last few weeks been a regular patron (and must say am quite glad Cobs in Kensington disappointed me so!).  
More often than not, I saunter in in the later half of the day, 4 o'clock onward.  There is always a few regular white or whole wheat loafs, buns, and bagels of fresh baked goodness at that time, but until this past weekend, I was unaware of the sheer bread-ey goodness that welcomes patrons earlier in the day!  I finally managed to make my way in before noon and almost couldn't find my usual whole wheat loaf for all the fresh baked goodness!  The selection is also amazing: french loafs, olive bread, fig and nut bread, Calabrese rolls, dinner rolls, bagels of all sorts, muffins, funny torpedo shaped loafs.  It was a carbaholic's dream! 
The service is friendly, but not pushy.  The cashiers wait at the register for patrons to acquire their goods, or mosey down the sweets for those who look especially interested.  And my bread is always sliced with a smile.  The only draw: occasionally it takes a few moments for them to finish their conversation before they acknowledge me, but it's usually no more than literally moments.     
The product is delicious - the bread denser than I'm used to, but not so dense it reminds me of when my dear Mum tried to make bread with expired yeast.  The buns are massive and airy, a complete dichotomy to the bread loafs.  And I usually have to use great restraint to avoid getting a bar or treat of some sort, but they look incredible.  Some day, after a very, very long run, I will take down their carrot cake and/or nanaimo bar in seconds flat.  And the price?  Incredible; perhaps the best part.

Food took a little while but was really good. My sister's poke bowl had a TON of poke! My salad was delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I will say the salmon plate (kitchen split it in half) didn't have a whole lot of salmon.  My niece enjoyed her ramen, but my bro in law's mom said her udon was a bit salty.

We came here for lunch recently. Yes, the interior is a little odd as others mentioned. It's a mix of random furniture. There are some couches at the far end of the restaurant, which we turned down.

We ordered one of the set lunches, which included lobster and crab, fish in soup, and bok choy. The lobster and crab were a little small, so it made it difficult to eat because there was a lot of shell. However, the fish in soup was really good. The broth was great on its own, but the fish was also amazing. It also includes transparent flat noodles and tomatoes. The bok choy was... well, bok choy. Nothing special there.

We were also given a cup of sweet potato drink at the end, which I didn't care for. I would definitely come back for the fish soup, and to try other dishes.",2014-11-25 01:54:28

Came here on a Wednesday night. It was packed so we had to leave our number and kill time before a table was available (not too bad considering Duke's Refresher Bar is right next door). I love the ambiance here; it's super casual with a great selection of beverages and food. Portions are quite generous here so just order a few plates and share it with your dining companions. As others have mentioned, SIKB is a great place should you be in a group. They have a lot of large tables that can accommodate big numbers. The location is very convenient as well; you're about a block south of College Station. I found service to be excellent ... even the Manager does his rounds and introduces himself to everyone. For drinks, I would recommend the blood orange mojito. As for food, we ordered mozzarella (only available in the evenings & it comes with crostini, jam, and prosciutto), pizza (comes on a long board and you get cool scissors to cut up pieces), and the regular meatball (it's a little salty for my liking).

The one thing that I LOVE about Los Taquitos is that in Arizona (where people mistakenly assume that the Mexican food is good no matter where you go), they are proving that a delicious plate of food doesn't have to come at a premium.  You could go down the street to Macayo's and get a meal for twice the price and half the flavor.  More than price, value is king these days, and Los Taquitos knows the drill.

I tend to judge the quality of a restaurant on the goodness of their machaca, and Los Taquitos does an excellent job for the low price point.  In their burritos, quesadillas and tamales, the meat is flavorful and moist.  I second the vote of others on the rice and beans being tasty - I particularly enjoyed the rice in its fluffy, flavorful goodness.  It didn't taste like an afterthought.  Spring for the side of guacamole - it's a welcome addition to the plate, particularly if you're sopping up the whole mess with a bag of chips.

Garlic breathe be damned through THREE teeth brushing cycles and 2 mouth wash swishes. But it was worth it. So sorry for whoever has to talk to me the next day..... 

I had heard SO many good things about this place that it had been on my places to try list for a while now. It absolutely did NOT disappoint! Thanks to Carrie L.'s suggestion, I got the Mediterranean Lamb Plate. The lamb was cooked to perfection and surprisingly had little fat for lamb. The rice was also fantastic, because who doesn't love a little sprinkle of pine nuts on top!? I was really not too keen about the Greek yogurt sauce but LOVED the garlic sauce (hence the garlic dragon breathe!). 

The decor inside is also really cute! I love the glass accent pieces and I really wanted to keif the little vases with cute wooden flowers on our table. Since I try not steal....I did not....don't worry! 

For a Mediterranean place to also be famous for desserts is a big surprising. But I had also heard many good things about their choice of cakes and cheesecakes. I had JUST been to the Factory of Cheese earlier in the week so I opted for a Coconut Cake. I love me some coconut and it was the perfect combo of moist cake and coconut! Yum-o!

We made a reservation for the Sunday night, but the place turned out to be pretty quiet (more people did trickle in as the night went on however) so probably didn't even need a reso for 2. The restaurant is quite spacious! There's an upstairs too, presumably for larger parties? Beautiful interior design, though I would say it's more ""business-y"" than romantic... There's a sterile, proper feeling about the place? 

It is quite difficult to find edible things on the menu here as a vegan btw, and even as a vegetarian it becomes a bit limiting since everything has a dash of land or sea animals :P We asked our server for vegetarian recommendations and we ended up ordering 

1) Quesos board (3 cheeses + jam + woodfired sourdough bread): My favorite was the goat milk cheese because I love stinky, pungent foods lol. My partner, a big cheese lover, found the cheeses here too strong, which is actually good news for sharp cheese lovers out there as there's guaranteed lots of flavor! The bread was a bit too toasted imo, too crunchy, but I loved the smoky, salted flavor. The bread was probably my favorite part of this dish ahaha.
2) Ensalada de Pera: We asked for the blue cheese on the side, which was not recommended as the cheese as I can imagine usually gives this salad a creamier texture and certainly a huge flavor boost. The salad came looking like simple lettuce leaves with nuts sprinkled on top, and essentially that's what it was and tasted like, so maybe next time that $16 we'll spend on another vegetarian hot side.
3) Coliflor Con Ajo Blanco: It was between this side, the cauliflower, and the chickpeas for us (both sides are vegetarian). We made the right choice - can't go wrong with roasted cauliflower, but more importantly it was the sauce, omg the sauce... It was so aromatic!
4) Paella de la Huerta: We ordered the small size to share and it was pretty reasonable. No leftovers though! This paella is completely vegetarian. I've never had paella before, so can't really comment too much, but I thought it was a bit too salty, but well-seasoned. I didn't really like the battered artichoke crisps on top. I love artichoke, but not battered and fried like that.

The portions of everything were on the smaller end, so don't expect to leave satiated with just one dish per person. Dishes here are more or less tapas style, so come with a few people and order a bunch of dishes to share and try a bit of everything.

Oh yes, it is also quite $$$... Yikes. Special occasions only!",2018-02-09 00:40:36

CG63NEMsglqdFxRuInBowQ,ckMFtaljrmXWaSiQqk9ZWA,hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q,5,5,0,0,"Another great addition to the asian food scene in Pittsburgh, which seems to be heating up! My husband and I were so excited in the months leading up to the opening, because I have always lamented the lack of really good, authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh (although try Sichuan Gourmet for Sichuan food, and Orient Kitchen for Cantonese). When I heard that they had xiao long bao, I knew that I had to come. 

I've been twice now, and have thoroughly enjoyed myself both times. While the xiao long bao isn't as good as those you might get at Joe Shanghai's in NYC or in LA, it's probably one of the few, if ONLY, places you can get them in Pittsburgh. And for that, I give them immense gratitude for giving me access to one of my favorite things to eat. For this alone, I give them five stars. The potstickers are also very large and tasty. My personal favorite noodle dish is the noodles with minced pork. The noodles are perfectly tender, and every bite is just super tasty. 

Now, do I think this place is as good as the places in NYC or LA? No. But for Pittsburgh, this is probably the best. So, for example, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the braised noodle beef soup could pack a little more punch (in fact, I think Ice Tea Taipei down the street might do a little better in this department. But if you're not familiar with asian food, I think Ice Tea Taipei is kind of hard to navigate). Part of the issue is that they are catering both to people who don't have a lot of experience with Asian cuisine, while also trying to satisfy those of us who have expectations for what they should do or how things should taste. It's a fine line to walk, and I think that they do a good job of it.

The service is friendly and fast, and I love the open kitchen. If you don't want to see how your food is made, go somewhere else. But for those of us who want to be in touch with those who produce the meal, the open kitchen gives you a great peek into what goes into each dish. Come and try it!

p.s. not super veggie friendly. They do have some options, but they are extremely limited. I hear that they are going to try and change that, but just something to keep in mind.",2013-03-30 21:25:56

What I didn't like about it was the three employees cleaning the whole time while we were there for a 2 hour party.  The party was until 7PM and at 6:30PM they started cleaning the bathrooms which they should have waitied until the party was over to do. 

Those three women who cleaned were watching the children like a hawk and did not have any room to be around children by the way they treated the kids.  Some balls came out of the playarea into the lobby area and one of the workers threw them back into the area with a pissy attitude where the kids were hitting a few kids on the back.  Then another lady yelled at kids with a really mean voice if they were being too loud (they are kids).  Come on it is a play area.

There was another party going on during the party I was at while we were in the playarea.  A kid from the other party went into the playarea of our party and one of the mean workers yelled at him (he is 3 years old) and scooped him up.  Come on.  The way the place is set up they really can't do multiple parties like Pump it Up and really shouldn't.

So, for me I won't be having my daughter's parties here nor will I go for open play if they offer it.  I want my daughter to enjoy herself and be a kid.

I asked again and he acknowledged silently and then gave me a really dirty look. Brings the drinks back and says nothing and then walks away. Doesn't even bring us a receipt? 

I could be understanding if it was busy and he needed to tend to someone else or if he was being irritable because we were being rude but we were being really nice and just wanted a drink LOL. 

So anyways I was like.. um can I have a receipt ?

He says nothing turns around and slams it down on the counter and walks away. My husband said thanks man and he said nothing. 

I take a sip of my beer as I'm walking away and Its flat. Time for a keg change. I wasnt trying to bother nick anymore so I just drank my $9 flat beer.

My husband is a very nice and tolerable man and we said nothing about this while it was happening.

He walks away and says to me ""holy s*** that guy was rude.."" 

Harkins... please get rid of nick the bartender or tell him to stop being such a di** he was working March 19th and 6:15pm.
His last name may have started with a G and he was dark haired. 

I was so upset about the first part of my movie experience that I didn't get to enjoy the movie at first and neither did my husband. 

I don't want to come back here and it is too bad because we live close and we love to come to the movies. I can buy a 6 pack for the price of one beer at Harkins and watch Netflix at home. It's cheaper and there are less assholes at my house just saying.",2017-03-20 17:49:30

Pop Up Pizza makes a very good pie. (Yes, east coasters call it a pie.)  it is 18' so one pie will feed 5-8 people as 1-2 slices will fill almost anyone.  The toppings are great, the pepperoni is from Chicago and large flavorful slices instead of those microsliced ones you get on chain pizza.  The bacon was real and crisp.  There is a ton of flavor in their sauce and maybe just a touch too much oregano.  There is a lot of garlic but I like that.  

The Chicken Strips are very good but be careful, the ranch has a garlic flavor to it and many don't like that.

The delivery person was very friendly and only had good things to say about the pizza place letting me know they get many repeat customers.

The fries aren't my favorite.  A bit soggy.  But they are healthier tasting than fast food.

Their pizza isn't terrible at all.  I don't think it's gross or anything.  It is bland.  I ordered a few pizzas from Gus's that's sort of like... sort of like biting into pizza-like food with pizza essence.  The flavor was just weak for some reason.  It was like, and I know it's not physically possible, but it tasted like they watered it down somehow.  It's the only way it makes sense.

I have been surprised a few times and have had a pizza that was stand-out good.

Things to appreciate:  It's cheaper than most places.  Since this place is open 24 hours, you can pop in at all odd hours of the night and get a bite to eat with a few buddies.  Split the bill a few ways and you're really only out a couple bucks each.  Also, it seems like the perfect place to hide after doing a mob hit.

The first time I ate there, I was so drunk I didn't even know what the fuck.  It was my 21st birthday.  I was a little, uh... I was out of control.  I've been back quite a few times since then, most of which I have done in a sober state, so hopefully when they see me they don't think, ""Oh great, here's drinky...""

One night I felt super antisocial.  I didn't want to go out.  I just felt like kickin' it.  I spent the night with my dog and I ordered pizza, then fell asleep watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles--the first movie.  That was a particularly good pizza.  When I was like 5 years old, when I REALLY would have enjoyed doing that, I never had a chance because my parents would be like, ""Do you know how expensive pizza is?!""

Of course, they insisted I pay the $10 admission first - no problem - I am sure they'll credit it back to me as part of the down payment.  The biggest issue that I had was that everything was roped off, so I could not get a good look at the price stickers. WTH! I still need to know how much to write the check for!  Instead, all you can see are the mileage numbers - 11 mpg city, 15 mpg highway. Next question - was the mpg highway calculated at 65 mph or 165 mph?  I think a Ferrari would get better mileage at 165.

So I was thrilled to see the car I wanted (Ferrari Scuderia in red) listed for only $215,000 albeit used.  But hey, it only had like 3000 miles on it and it beats paying $330,000 for a new one.  It was in the budget range of what I had been saving up for - I only needed to come up with $214,000.  Slot machines, here I come!

The downstairs showroom had more cars, but definitely not their cream of the crop.  Unless you count NASCAR models.  850 hp and stickers for headlights?!?

Gee, these dumbbells are always disorganized!  They are either on the wrong rack, or they're on the floor.  Why are people not putting them in the right place?  At first, I thought nothing of it, and thought it was just gym-goers putting them in the wrong spaces.  Then, after looking at the racks and numbers for awhile, it finally hit me:

There are more dumbbells than racks for them!  Seriously, there are more dumbbells in the weight room than there are spaces for them.  No wonder the dumbbells are always disorganized, or out of order, or on the floor.  Why and how did this happen?  Before they opened this gym, didn't they realize that since there weren't enough racks and there was a surplus of dumbbells that it would cause inconvenient disorganization?  It boggles my mind that not only wasn't this fixed before the gym opened, but in the almost one year since it has been remodeled that nothing has been done about it.

And it sucks, because besides that, this is such a nice gym,  But this is such a glaring error that it can't be overlooked, and thus must be deducted two stars.  Once that gets corrected, this gym automatically becomes five stars again.  Until then, I can't give it more than three.",2011-04-04 06:43:57

Intimate theater barely begins to describe this theater.  If you weren't specifically looking for it, you wouldn't know it was there.  It's hidden in a strip mall - so make sure you have your directions in hand.  Really it's not that hard to find ... 

The experience:
Some of THE best entertainment for your dollar in the east valley.  I have been twice, and saw two completely different shows.  Some of the ""games"" that were played were same/similar, but the audience interactions ensures it's always fresh and new.  We went with a bunch of friends for my wife's birthday - they made sure to get her involved ... and it would up being the funniest part of the show (naturally since they were funning on my family).  They even gave us two free tickets to come back another time!!  My wife and I really enjoyed the experience (as did our friends) and we're excited to use the tickets.

The bottom line:
If you're looking for something to do on a Friday or Saturday evening, you'd be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable time.  If you're reading this review before 5/1/09 ... they are having a one year anniversary that weekend ... Friday/Sat/Sun shows ... check it.    You can hit the site showup.com for discounted tickets.

Check in was easy and my elevators were right by the front desk.  You do have to wave your key in front of a sensor on the elevator to use it which nobody told me, but was a nice safety feature.

Played my share of video poker at the bar and the bartenders were right on with bringing me another drink without asking.  Played some black jack and was on a roll till 3 drunk guys started playing and after one hand I cashed out.  I did try to upgrade my room to a jacuzzi suite but none were available and I was given a $25 food credit, which was a nice surprise.

I have been raving about this place for some time, but don't manage to get out to these parts often.  I am sure everyone would agree a relocation can be bitter sweet considering that the current location does cater to the medical and business district surrounding the area..  Those of us that don't frequent this area suffer while the nearby patrons prosper, although, Oliver makes it worth the drive as well.  If a relocation is in the future, I pray that it's not an expansion unless they can duplicate it enhance the service, otherwise, it's hard to replace the experience.

We stopped in after picking up my fiance's pops from the airport.  Breakfast was on order and we all had a day off what better time to sample over of the great breakfast joints Vegas has to offer.  Our walk from the parking lot included a warm greeting from the maintenance workers outside, uncommon but awesome.  We were then greeted inside and conversed with Oliver again, who provided a passionate overview of the days special offerings.  Everything looks up for the day ahead.

My fiance offered the chicken brie, my pops in law, the breakfast pannini, and myself, the fresh made quiche.  I don't know about everyone else's dish, but the quiche was the best I had.  It was most and flavorful with a good balance of ingredients.  The slice is hefty and a perfect portion to hold me down till lunch rolls around.  I did get to sample the fresh made chocolate truffle croissant twist as well and it was euphoric, considering I'm not much of a sweet tooth.

The ambiance is very welcoming and noticed new decorative art that added a nice touch.  The over sized glossed photography art adorned the walls, but a fee more were needed towards the rear of the eating area.  I believe the art resembled modern French stills.  I dug it and it reminds me of the art in the original Bachi Burger, also priced for gallery sale.  Staff always make you feel at home and when the weather permits, the outside patio provides a refreshing experience.

Don't forget about the coffee selection.  Illy can be a little overwhelming for my taste, since I'm a black coffee person, but think will more than satisfy other coffee aficionados.

I would give this experience an overall 4.5, minus 0.5 for the location, but round it up and what do you get?? A five-star experience and coming from me, that's really saying something.",2013-06-13 19:50:33

He's a big time eater so he deserves some credit & I trust his judgement. This place is no where near the strip, you're going to take a lovely drive on Sahara before you reach this place. it's easily missed in this plaza since it's kind of hidden in the corner so keep your eyes peeled.

We were warned that this place gets packed so we actually arrived at 5pm for dinner on a Saturday during Memorial Weekend. It was probably a good idea to eat early anyways since we were planning to tear it up later on that night. The 7 of us all sat at the sushi bar. The restaurant isn't that big in general.

We now had 60 minutes to play man versus food. For AYCE, that's the time limit. On a good note, they had unlimited hot sake free with the AYCE too but we passed on it to concentrate all our efforts on the food. Anything and everything on the menu was a green light. Wo said keep en eye for the items on the boards but I never saw the boards.

I honestly have low expectations for Japanese AYCE period. Todai was great the first 2-3 times then you realize how whack it is. Fortunately, Sushi Mon wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Plus they pumped out our orders with a mad quickness (made to order and not already rotting out). They have everything from sushi (cajun albacore is note worthy) to crazy rolls and you can even order ice cream (green tea, plum, and red bean) for dessert. I don't think the AYCE is mandatory but if someone in your party decides to go with it, I believe everyone on your table needs to be on the same page. Nah mean?

Be warned though that some of the rolls are rice and kewpie (Japanese mayo) heavy and that's going to put a major road block in your appetite. For some of the crazy rolls (8 pieces) you may ask them to make it a half order. If the roll is 5 pieces like the spider roll (soft shell crab) they will not make a half order for it. Every creation on the menu sounds crazy but stick with what you know first. Play it safe before you venture out too far. Certain rolls like the lasagna or volcano rolls are way too rich and heavy. Those are under the baked rolls. I'd keep away from those.

All in all, the place wasn't too bad. I wouldn't say I need to come back to Sushi Mon everytime I am in Vegas but if someone was to ask for a Japanese AYCE joint, they would be mentioned. The quality was decent and the waitresses were friendly. With drinks, tax, & tip, we ended up paying around $30 something each. Not too shabby. Bring that appetite if you come here for some AYCE sushi. Get in mahhh belly!",2011-06-06 22:18:12

- use biodegradable plastic for forks, spoons, cups etc
- ditch the packets of ketchup and whatever other condiments. Also change brands. The stuff you are suing is mostly high fructose corn syrup and msg.

With Jennifer L.'s months-old rave review still lingering in the back of my mind, I finally took the opportunity to visit Niu-Gu Noodle House tonight when it appeared near the top of my Yelp bookmarks (sorted by distance). After getting lost and asking for directions from a local barber who professed his love for Niu-Gu's noodles as well), I found it on the opposite end of the plaza from its current Yelp map spot. Look for this restaurant in the southeast corner next to Imperial One, which still is called HK Star on the facade.

The restaurant was devoid of customers except for yours truly, and the lady running the front of house seated me at a booth and brought me their menu on an iPad. After quickly scrolling through the options, which included a fair number of traditional beef, lamb, and pork dishes and some appetizers (including chicken wings that apparently would take 20 minutes to prepare), I settled on what I came here for: the miso noodle soup.

I can't remember the exact name of that dish, but it wasn't outright named ""ramen."" Nevertheless, it did have a very ramen-y feel, starting with a moderately rich and mildly spicy miso beef broth that was very slurpable. The thin noodles were cooked perhaps a touch above al dente but are definitely reminiscent of ramen, as are the diced green onions and kikurage. The beef was very tender and flavorful, and it made forget momentarily that chashu was even a thing. The bean sprouts were a nice touch, and I didn't miss the lack of bamboo or egg (the latter available at additional cost).

Despite the fairly modest portion (lunch-worthy, easily), this is a reasonable deal at $9 for one of the better noodle soups that I have enjoyed in town. Ramen or not, this dish is enough to put Niu-Gu on the map, so keep an open mind and try it the next time you want a hot bowl of goodness.",2016-02-02 04:51:06

I could have spit all over them, or poked every single one of them.  Of course I didn't, but to see them be restocked for someone else is just straight up nasty and I know it's a fast food no-no.

Casual lunch eatery with Chicken decor. Bravo on keeping up with the theme.

I ATE 
The chicken fingers came highly recommended and they are good. It's like buttermilk fried chicken in finger format, really. I wasn't stuffed after 4 fingers and a side and at $12 that's pretty pricey. For 2 fingers and a side it's $9 (SUPER pricey for what you get). Go for 4. I had Mac n cheese as my side - way too creamy for my taste. The tangerine juice is delicious. Plum sauce was okay - I would opt for the BBQ sauce next time.

First time around the service was atrocious. Second time the service was excellent. Some lazy people on staff and some really good ones.

On both occasions the place was empty (on the weekend)...this creates a problem because you want the food to be fresh...dry rice on the sushi rolls, extremely dry basmati rice in the Indian section.

The selection is small for a $40 buffet and if I were paying regular price I'd be pissed.

The prime rib was decent and rare just how I like it. The snow crab is cut for you so minimal work (although it was on the salty side).

Crepe station was nice, although the first time I went the guy burned my crepe and still served it to me, it was dry and crackly...shoulda been throw out and restarted. They have warm cookies and molton lava cake...add some vanilla gelato to hit the spot.

Panna cotta wasn't set correctly, kind of drippy.

The asparagus was overcooked.

The sushi section is ""ok"" for buffet sushi. Just pluck the strips of salmon off the rice mound to make it more than ""ok"". 
No ""Must Eat All Rice"" policy here.

They had the exact same food out for dinner 3 weeks ago as they did tonight so don't expect anything to change if you revisit.

3 stars because I had a 2 for 1.

My boyfriend took me here for valentines day and may I add that we weren't the only couple there! Fortunately we found out about this on Groupon which was $27 for 2 hours of range time for 2 (equipment included). I would have to honestly say that was an extremely great deal for the experience we got.

We first checked in at the front and one of their workers led us into the back to their spaciously sized shooting room (there was also one bathroom located in there). He gave us a quick mini-lesson on how to use the bow and arrows, as well as safety rules. For the rest of the hour and a half, we freely shot arrows on our own. Trust me, it was more than enough shooting time for us. 

There were a total of 20 rows for shooting, there were bullseyes that were mobile to move closer for the beginners, as well as stationary ones all the way towards the end of the range. I can't compare this place to other indoor/outdoor archery ranges because I haven't been. But based on the reviews on bang-for-your-buck Groupon deal, I'd have too say it's an excellent place. There are also hunting/shooting merchandise sold in the front of the store such as specialized bows and arrows for serious hunters and archery hobbyists.

The venue was organized, clean, and came with great customer service! I would definitely recommend this for those who've never shot an arrow, (double+) dates, or if you're just interested in taking up a new skill or hobby.

What I am is, an addict of purchasing art supplies for me to ""try out later"", for my imaginary projects that never even makes to the drawing board. And as such, I will say that this place is a horrible place for my wallet to ever visit, because not only do they have supplies at a reasonable price - they actually want to help you with your artistic endeavors, and ensures people like me - leave with more than what I think I want - in more than one variety. 

I mean if you want more economic prices, that hole-in-a- wall on Spadina is better, where nobody cares if you're in or out of the store.

I totally forgot about the impact this store had on me and popped in during a random stroll on Queen street - mostly because it looked like it was...closing(I almost shat myself at this thought)? Either way, turned out to be a horrible choice because they are now having some SERIOUS sale to make room, I assume, for larger variety of stuff that I will purchase to tackle ""later.""

The friendliness hadn't changed either - or maybe it's because I look like I have NO clue what I want or what I am doing -the person that made the mistake of asking me if I needed anything went to great lengths to explain the various sketch books available and what it's good for and what I can and cannot do - and did the same for paints. Seriously, I couldn't do anything BUT walk out with 5 sketchbooks- she also just assumed that I was a freshmen in an arts program and gave me a discount (say what?! I am so flattered I look young).

I assume since they're that patient with a non-artist, I assume that they even more willing to share their love for it with actual artists...that do...art...-_- instead of just collecting supplies... in which case, I advise you not to go in.

I was meeting my brother in law downtown for dinner and walked past this place. I assumed they were closed because it was desolate. After dinner I walked past on my way to the car and noted that they were open for a few more hours! Awesome!

I walked in and no one was there. It took a bit for the 2 employees to come out and I felt like I was bothering them. They were having their own conversation. Greet a customer? Yeah right. I asked a few questions, which were answered in between their conversation and we're not very helpful. I pondered just leaving but the pull of frosting was strong. I ended up with two cupcakes - salted caramel and their version of a Ho Ho. Never asked if we might like to stay there or have a drink (it is very cute and I wouldn't have minded staying). Also worth noting that mid-fun chat while retrieving my sugary goodness the employee didn't wear gloves. Yuck. Isn't that a health code violation? Luckily she seemed to only touch my (nicely oversized) cupcakes' wrappers but still kinda ick.

So to the real reason I was there - those cupcakes. I had the salted caramel chocolate  to reward myself (since rewarding with sweets is the sign of an awesome health educator) after a deadline. First, they're HUGE. The store name is right. I cut mind into portions. I expected an ooze of caramel filling and was disappointed. More like the bottom of the cake was caramel soaked. Bummer but I can deal. The cake itself tasted a little stale. It was dry and not super chocolate-y, it was rather bland. The frosting tasted a touch gritty, maybe that was the salt? There was a good amount of frosting but the taste was nothing amazing  

I ended up not finishing the cupcake. I had no desire to try to save it, and I could easily finish it had I enjoyed it. I may gave them another shot but it's not likely. My minty tea (made at home) was much more fulfilling than a cupcake - thoughts I never thought I would have to write. Bummer",2014-05-01 07:48:43

Came here for the first time as a party of 7 for a friend's birthday party.  The setting is intimate with comfortable and simplistic decor and live piano entertainment.

Our server gave us space and time to look over the menu while never leaving us alone for too long. 

I ordered the four cheese ravioli and, although the sauce and ravioli were delectable, I ended up not being fulfilled.  I admit, I'm not one of those ""I'll have a salad and a diet coke"" kind of girls, so I may not be the best judge of this, but I felt my portion was too small and I was actually still hungry afterwards.  The ravioli are not large and there were 6 of them.  As far as fine dining goes, the prices were not horrible but, for the price of the dish, I hoped to be satiated at the end of the meal.

The guest of honor was given a complimentary creme brule and the musician sang happy birthday for him and personally greeted him towards the end of our meal.  A very nice touch.  

The wait staff was very attentive and service was terrific all night.   They were very gracious when the birthday boy was mistaken on a type of wine he ordered and they happily returned the bottle and helped to figure out which one he was thinking of.

After reading some positive reviews on yelp, and being of Middle Eastern descent I knew I had to go check this place out. Armenian kitchen is located in a small strip plaza off Victoria Park. This is a modest restaurant; the décor is old school and probably hasn't changed since this place opened. Fortunately for me I am not here for the décor! 

My friend and I were seated rather quickly and the place was quite full on a Saturday night. The menu is pretty standard; kabobs, shawarma, falafel, hummus etc. For appetizers my friend and I ordered a plate of hummus and some falafels. The falafels were the best part of the meal, they were large in size, so crunchy on the outside but nice and fluffy on the inside, they were seasoned well (went great with some tahini sauce and the complimentary pickled turnips). The hummus was pretty good, it was quite creamy and went well with their house made hot sauce; however I felt like a little more garlic would have elevated this dish. 

For main I ordered a chicken kebob with tabule instead of rice, my friend had the chicken shawarma plate with rice. My main came with a single skewer of chicken, the chunks were on the smaller side. The kebob was all white meat, had a nice grilled flavour and was quite juicy. The side of tabule was ok, the parsley was not chopped as finely as it should have been and it needed more lemon juice, overall the tabule was just ok. My friend's shawarma came with large pieces of white meat chicken, the chicken was slightly dry and not crispy on the outside (as shawarma should be), but it did have a pretty good flavour. The side of rice pilaf with the shawarma was quite good, very buttery and cooked well. All in all our mains were satisfactory. 

They do have a small dessert menu but my friend and I were too full. They also have a full bar and they do have arak (a traditional Middle Eastern liquor), I had a glass of that and it was a nice accompaniment to my meal. The service was ok; the waiter was friendly but a little slow at times. 

Overall Armenian kitchen has the right idea, makes adequate food but could be so much better with a few tweaks. It was good enough to warrant a second visit and is a good alternative to all the shawarma places in the area when one is craving some Middle Eastern cuisine. I shall return.",2012-09-24 00:43:33

I always get the pho with beef brisket 3A (6.25) which never fails to satisfy me and usually with that i order the fried rice with chicken and shrimp---

The fried rice is just perfect. It had the perfect amount of oilyness (dry rice is the worst) but the fried rice here is at the perfect moisture especially eating this with pho and topping it with chilli sauce is the best

I enjoyed being in the 1950's diner vibe because those were the better days of food service compared to the more corporate feel you get today.

So, when it came time to placing our order, my friend and I each got Rocket Doubles and a side of onion rings to share and I got a bowl of chili for myself.  At first, we thought that we didn't order enough food and then it showed up and we began eating it.  Toward the end of the meal, we realized that it was definitely a lot of food and we were really hungry when we showed up.  We barely finished our burgers and then the last of the onion rings which then left us bursting at the seams.

It's an easy error to make; I'm a somewhat articulate woman working towards a bachelor's degree who holds multiple state credentials. Yeah, I guess a certificate with a photocopied signature on it can count as credentials, right? 

But in reality, there is no method to the madness. Like a jazz soloist or a Republican defending anti-gay marriage laws, I'm just making this shit up as I go along. 

I am often overwhelmed by seemingly trivial decisions, like ""what color should I paint my nails today"" or ""should I give this place 1 or 2 stars?"" 

Places like Coldstone or Baskin Robbins, therefore, frustrate me to no end.

Do I get a flavor I know I'll like? Or do I branch out? But what if that flavor's totally nasty and I can't finish it? What mix-ins should I get? Oh god there are people in line behind me, make up your mind, voice in my head!!!

When Amanda B brought me to Chill, the first thing I noticed was the wide array of gelato flavors. Immediately, I felt myself paralyzed with indecision. 

Oh shit. Pineapple and Coconut? Dulce de Leche? Sweet Zombie Jesus, they have a Twix flavor! Oh Eris, goddess of cha--oh wait, you wouldn't do me any good in this situation, would you?

Off-handed, perhaps sensing my panic, Amanda's sister Allison grinningly said to me ""you've got to try the chocolate pistachio. It's the best.""

At first I was a little hesitant to take her suggestion. While chocolate is awesome and pistachio is awesome, 2 x awesome does not always awesome squared. 

Other examples of two awesome things that suck when put together; 

Babies and movie theaters. Girlfriends and strip clubs. 

Roleplaying games (fuck yeah I slayed a dragon!) and the internet (sorry guys, I can't go out tonight, gotta stay home and do a raid with my guild).

But Allison assured me that this would be all the chocolatey pistachio goodness I could ever ask for. I was sold. 

Legend has it that once, an Italian merchant once gave Buddha a bowl of gelato. Buddha was so delighted with the dessert that he reciprocated the gesture and gave the merchant a book of Buddhist teachings to bring back with him to Italy. Unfortunately the merchant's ship was sunk on the voyage home, and Buddhism didn't reach Italy for hundreds of years.

What does that have to do with my review? Nothing. 

The chocolate pistachio really was amazing. And at 2.59 for a small it has a reasonable cost/delicious ratio (I'm assuming anyway. Allison covered me in the event I didn't like mine so she could finish it herself). 

I may not be as well versed in the art and science of gelato as others, but I can tell you from my limited experience that it was creamy, chocolatey, smooth, nutty and everything I am told gelato is supposed to be. 

Maybe next time I will choose a flavor by myself. But I wouldn't count on it. I was late for work today because I couldn't decide which pair of pink flip flops would better match my Sarah Jessica Parker jeans.

The woman was friendly and efficient and took down all my information and thanked me for calling.

Color me impressed. Then I get a call from a pleasant robot letting me know the cab was there at my work and how long I wanted it to wait. I typed in the minutes. When I got downstairs the car was there idling and waiting. I hopped in and the man greeted me by name! He was jovial and friendly and not too chatty, just how I like it.

I needed to go to Oakland's Soldiers and Sailors Hall. He took a picturesque route that wasn't out of the way so as to charge more. The cab was clean and he was a safe driver. We got to Oakland quickly. Now anyone from Pittsburgh knows that Oakland is usually a nightmare on a weekday during college fall term near lunch time. That's not something unusual at all. We get into Oakland and I can feel the driver's growing agitation with the traffic. 

Admittedly I don't drive often, I haven't owned a car in years. When driving is your job though, and this is the city you drive in... one would assume he'd be used to it. The agitation was making me a little uncomfortable, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened next. As we pull up next to the line of parked car he puts on his 4-way lights and tells me the fare 10$ and some change, it's about what I had anticipated so I hand him my bank card as the cab didn't have a reader in the back seat. He takes my card and turns around but doesn't swipe it. He just sits there for a second. He then turned around to me and forced my card back at me and literally YELLED, ""JUST GET OUT!!"" I was a little taken aback, I just sat there not knowing if he was serious. I could only ask, ""I'm sorry, excuse me?"" The reply, ""I SAID GET OUT. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THINGS LIKE THIS. JUST GET OUT OF MY CAB."" 

I got out. Dumbfounded. I didn't pay for the ride and they were there to get me exactly on time so I suppose it wasn't the worst... I don't appreciate being treated that way at all.

Shipwreck Burger - out of control good.  I loved it.  Many times truffle anything can be overpowering if they have too heavy of a hand with it, but in this case it just helped to funk up the burger just enough and the patty was amazing.  Also ordered rare and actually received rare!

Nadalee Burger - really delicious.  So good I was only able to try a bite, but enough that I could say I understand why I was torn between this one and the one I ordered. 

Fries with beer cheese and bacon - I am so glad we only ordered one order of fries.  The order was huge and definitely defeated us.  The fries stayed crisp even under the mound of cheese and the bacon was delicious.

The waiter told us that they had a Grand Opening Special of 20% off entrees and a buy one get one free soda, with free refills.  For the drink, try the Sweetened Green Tea.  Not too sweet and compliments with the spicy seafood.

The special of the day was dungeness crab.  We didn't get it as it was $14.95/lb.  Instead we ordered 3 lbs of shrimp in a medium sauce, house special style and the catfish dinner.  We also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, some rice bowls, corn and bread.  I agree with Andy R.  OMG - the shrimp were huge from its head to its tail - as big as the distance between your thumb and your index finger!!  The shrimp were as thick as your thumbs!!!  They were indicated on the menu as Gulf Atlantic Shrimps.  I think they were just huge Tiger Prawns.  Make sure you order some rice and some bread to sop up the delicious sauce.  The sauce was unfortunately too little but we managed to sop up every little bit of sauce.  The sauce had roughly chopped up onions in it.   The rice was so fragrant; I think it's jasmine rice.  Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm!  We wanted more shrimp so we ordered another lb of shrimp, this time with spicy sauce.  The spicy sauce this time had a bit of kick in it and it tasted better.

The waiter was very helpful, pleasant and quick to serve.  

Would we go back?  Sure, for that size of shrimp and the spicier sauce!

SaWw6epRC0zTVE3bz1MMEg,AmwIIooGA9lbcXafML5xzQ,gBy6UXTpoSHhW6qd15XU0g,3,1,0,0,Let me preface this review by saying we ate in the restaurant first and the food and service were terrific. The restaurant was getting busy and rather than take up a table we moved over to the bar so people could eat. The bar was full but some nice guys moved over so we could have three seats together.   We order our drinks.  The machines have laminated notes on the screen saying that the machines are for gamblers and if not gambling will be asked to move.  No problem...  I know how to read and take note. Common knowledge I would think to all who go to local bars.  We order another drink from the bartender. I called after I left and asked her name and was told Stephanie. Young girl with long medium brown hair working on a Friday night. She had an attitude and only continued to get worse as the night progressed. She proceeds to tell us the the two games we are sitting at are one of kind machines and that if someone wants to use them we need to move. She than puts the laminated note back on the machine.  Rude... my friend had been gambling but apparently she either didn't see or wanted to continue being nasty.  One of my friends boyfriend arrives and she leaves.  Not going to deal with nasty she says. As my other friend begins to gamble on another machine the now try to be nice bartender asks her if she wants a drink. Also mentions it is for two drinks. Uhh ya... she's gambling drinks should be comped. Not to mention the bar was half full by this time. Treat your customers nice maybe people will stay. So turned off by her attitude we didn't even finish our free drinks. Also we had ordered a beer while we were in the dining room.  Tasted off.  Very sour.  When we told the bartender she said we just didn't know wheat beers.  So funny.  My girlfriend is beer connoisseur and would never send a beer back just because...

As soon as I stepped inside the establishment, I could tell I was in for a treat. It was later at night and there was a family seated near the entrance, but the overall mood of the place was calm and relaxing. The menu is on the wall behind the counter and is basically broken into: hot tea, iced tea, frozen tea, fruit smoothies, shaved ice, and others.

I ordered the Salted Caramel frozen latti and Taro frozen latti. It took just a bit longer than anticipated for my drinks to be ready, but it seemed like only two women were working at the time, and the family before me were only starting to get their order. The women were very polite, as someone else on here mentioned. I asked if they make the raindrop dessert to-go, but sadly they don't; I couldn't try it on this visit due to time constraints. That's another reason for me to come back!

The salted caramel was pure heaven! I could taste notes of sweet caramel and, at other times, the saltiness. It was surprisingly not super sweet at all. I tasted the taro and it was just as yummy. I could taste the distinct flavor of taro which was not masked by an excess of sweetness. It also did not have that graininess you sometimes taste from the powdered mix. The 24oz is perfect for one person and you will most likely not want to share!

I think this will be my new boba spot from now on! I know another boba spot opened down the road from here, but I'll probably be coming to LOFTTI instead!

EDIT: The raindrop dessert was fantastic. They explained that you should swirl the powder and sauce in a circle around the raindrop and then eat it. All of the flavor comes from the sauce. During this visit I also got the honeydew frozen latti and the matcha frozen cotton candy. The honeydew was perfect. It had the perfect amount of sweetness which complemented the honeydew flavor so well. The frozen cotton candy is reminiscent of snow ice, but not nearly as thick and is very light in flavor. Everything is so yummy!",2016-07-30 05:38:36

I am one of those people who peruse the menu before the week even begins and plan out exactly where I am going several days in advance. Considering many of my friends are of the vegetarian variety I was really craving a long-overdue steak. 

Sullivan's was convenient for its South end location, and we were able to get a nice reservation time to fit our schedule. I was impressed with the ambiance overall. It was cozy, very classy, and interesting. Photos of boxers align the walls and a large wine vault (mmm wine) displays their vast collection. 

We were greeted right away by very friendly staff. The Malbec I ordered was delicious - but I could see the wine list being slightly intimidating for new wine drinkers as it looked more like a novel than a list. We then received our bread which was very difficult to cut (we even heard the couple next to us say the same thing) and overly flaky but overall it tasted fresh. 

We decided to order the $30 Restaurant Week Menu but they had similar Summer of $69 (for two) menu that seemed to be a great deal as well. I started with just a classic Caesar salad (I have a thing for them) which tasted good but definitely wasn't anything super amazing. Next, I had the Filet with Horseradish Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans. The steak and beans were cooked wonderfully but I felt the potatoes could have used a little bit more of the Horseradish flavor. Overall the dish was excellent and definitely satisfied my hunger for a steak! Finally my date and I shared our two desserts Banana Foster Bread Pudding (WOW!) and the Chocolate Mousse. Both were very good but the Bread Pudding was a stand-out. 

I want to try some other steakhouses in the area since Charlotte has a plethora of them but I would definitely recommend Sullivan's - it was very good!",2010-07-28 13:18:02
S0Nk4-pQf8gy2AWjr4DG_w,kxz6Q2AERQeo9x6nnbHZNg,02BXFKzu1rgaYulNGYvi6g,3,1,3,1,"I think this place under went new management from the last time I went because they had a change of name and decor from what I remember. Setting wise, I enjoy how the restaurant is very spacious, and since it was lunch time, I didn't have to wait long to be seated. In terms of food, the menu is pretty much the same as any other AYCE sushi place, BUT the dessert menu is especially long.  Let's focus on the actual food for now. The other foods on the menu are pretty typical, I think my top items would be the sirloin steak, and the matsuda Q sushi pizza. I chose the sushi pizza not so much b/c it tastes especially good, but because it's MINI sushi pizzas which I found to be very cute and convenient to eat. I WAS looking forward to the volcano roll which I've had before, but this time it was cold, and as the name suggests, the roll is supposed to be HOT. Which leads me to a major issue in this restaurant, much of the food we were served that were supposed to be hot, or at least warm, were not. This really ruins my perspective on the food here.

Dessert wise, the long menu was very impressive, but I couldn't help but notice that certain items such as the mango yogurt, the tiramisu, and the chocolate mousse were all knock offs of the Tenichi desserts. They even copied Tenichi's dessert presentation with the shot glasses. However despite this they did have items that were unique to them (as far as I know) such as the durian mousse (which was unavailable along with many other items that I wanted to try). I think dessert was probably my highlight at this restaurant, Since I think I ate more dessert than I did actual food.

Finally service was good and bad. Our main waitress was a cranky cranky girl, and it doesn't help her attitude towards us when my friend almost poked her in the eye while he was stretching. However there was another lady who provided us excellent service. She was patient, and smiled often. So it depends on your like in terms of the service you will receive.

I went with a friend's recommendation for the Tom Kha soup (which is my favorite dish at Thai Cuisine) and the fresh spring rolls. I asked very clearly about chicken/beef stock and fish sauce and the server assured me that the soup was completely vegetarian. 

The soup contained fish sauce. I am not morally offended but I do have an acute aversion to the flavor. Unrelated to my request, I also think that they dilute their coconut milk with dairy, a common cost cutting trick at ""cheap"" Asian restaurants. 

The spring rolls were good, though the dipping sauce was boring (like straight from a jar). 

Mid-way through the meal, the server threw our check onto the table. Um, good thing I wasn't going to mention the issue with my soup! And my friend, she didn't need that ice cream she had wanted for dessert!

Then, as if we weren't still sitting there, the server cleared some PBR cans from the table next to us and set them on our table!

Peter with Anthem responded within an hour or so and was in the area so he came out that day. Within a day or two, he emailed me an estimate. It included a computer generated picture of my backyard and what the new plants, rock etc would look like. The price was reasonable, but I still wanted to get the other estimates to compare. WELL, two of the others I scheduled via Yelp called withing minutes of their scheduled arrival time to say they couldn't make it and needed to move to different day. Another of the company's showed up 10mins after I told them I had to leave for work. They let themselves into my backyard and sent me a cheesy estimate without any discussion with me as to what I was looking to do.

Jump ahead, I hired Anthem because of the promptness, and price. I couldn't be happier.

There's a separate entrance to the left of the main Bisha hotel entrance. We were greeted by a hostesses in the elevator lobby, went up to the 2nd floor and they gladly took our coats for complementary coat check.

The restaurant is dimly lit and felt as if you were in a cave under the sea. I really enjoyed the dark furniture, the stone tables and spotlight above my table for photo taking.

Service was very good, the server was friendly, knowledgable of the menu and gave recommendations of popular items and even a bit of history on the inspiration of the dishes.
 
The menu is meant to be shared and for two people, it was recommended to order 4-5. We ended up ordering 5 plus dessert and left still a tad hungry.

Now, onto the dishes.. we mostly ordered from the recommended dishes and they were all very unique and creative.

Highlights of the meal were the tuna pizza and the waygu tacos. Both these dishes had an interesting mix of flavours and textures. 

The tuna pizza had a crispy crust with what tasted like an aioli sauce under the tuna. It was unlike anything I've had before and very tasty! 

Waygu beef taco was really good! Tender ground waygu beef covered with bulbogi sauce encased in a crispy taco shell. If you like bulbogi you'll like this.

The hot mess was a roll with avocado and crab topped with poke drizzled with spicy sauce. It was a decent but more so of an average dish compared to the others we tried.

Also have to mention that between the dishes, there were frequent cutlery and plate changed which was a nice touch. However, for a fancy restaurant, I would have preferred real chopsticks rather than the disposal kind.

We followed with the jidori chicken (the most expensive but also the largest portion of the meal) and the jeju domi ( smallest portion of the meal). The chicken was moist and cooked to perfection topped with crispy skin. The jeju domi, a signature fish was red snapper sashimi with tobiko rolled within infused with citrus flavour and chojang sauce.Realized that I wasn't a huge fan of the fish mixed with citrus but I liked the textures of the fresh fish, the rock salt and the popping tobiko.

We finished with the Yuzu citrus dessert which was yuzu curds, merengue, and strawberry gelato. It was a nice tart finish to the meal.

Overall the meal was about $155 including tax and tip. It was a great experience but not the most bang for your buck since it left us still wanting more to fill our bellies.",2017-12-09 19:32:37

You have to damn near yell out your answers, and everyone can hear you.  Do they not realize the concept of identity theft?

It wasn't ready.  She said ""We got backed up..""  She asked me to come back for it in 15 minutes.  I guess I should have just told them that I needed them ASAP and that I would wait in the store for my prescription.  

Strike 3.  I brought back a prescription because it wasn't the ""cream"" that they usually give me.  I explained to the pharmacist that this new one is more of a cream and my original medication was more of an ointment.

They played three pieces. I enjoyed the first piece, which was ""Short Ride in a Fast Machine"" by John Adams. It's fast-paced and energetic. The middle piece was a Mozart Concerto. It felt a little sleepy, but that was probably just me. The final piece, a Symphony by Schumann, had a better composition to it, but as it turns out, the sleepiness was indeed me. In any case, I enjoyed the concert.

This is actually the first time I've been inside this concert hall. I thought I had been years ago. Before I went to UNLV, I saw a production of Cabaret, but it turns out that was in the Judy Bayley Theatre across from the concert hall.

The concert hall itself is interesting. It has this ""cloud"" system that can raise or lower the acoustic height of the ceiling. From what I understand, it is always at the same height. The seating itself is nice and spacious with good visibility. The sides of the hall are strange. They look like giant locker room cubby holes. I'm not sure if those are for acoustic purposes.

We both haven't been to the Islands since our college days when it was on Mill.  Turns out not much has changed.  This place still churns out some decent burgers at reasonable prices.  We each got a burger, shared a salad and a basket of fries.  Everything was quite good but the fries are awesome.  You really can't beat a bottomless basket of awesome fries for like $3 even-though we didn't come close to finishing it.

Aside from the fries being delicious, I like it that each of their beef burger selections can also be ordered as a turkey burger.  I didn't order my burger this way but my wife did and she said it was very good.

Another thing to note is the service.  I thought it was excellent.  Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and fast.  My diet coke refills arrived faster than I could drink them and that is a definite plus.

In my opinion this place is on top of their game in terms of service and food and is a solid burger place in my book.",2011-04-04 19:02:43

Once we parked and entered we were assured that the parking was legit in the evenings for the venue. 

Upon entering it reminds you of a NYC speakeasy or one of our Hole In the walls in Chicago both are places you have the most fun ever. We had a VIP table with our name and the place was already jammed packed and our Friend artist was on stage. We came right on time and stayed for more as the other acts were amazing.

Unfortunately you have a meeting on the other end of the valley that goes way past spa closing time. In a desperate rush you are searching yelp, trying to find places that have walk-ins available. After two failed attempts, you are running out of time and losing hope. Then you see it. Fuchsia. And it's all pink. You feel like you've possibly discovered the holy effing grail of spas. 

Then it ends.

While the waxing was done well and the price was reasonable and about the same as what I pay at my regular joint, the staff made it uncomfortable. There was really no place to sit and wait.. well there was, but it was hidden and I wasn't informed of it, while my room was being prepared. The wax started out fantastic with the typical awkward chat.. but then it got weird. 

A huge sales pitch started telling me how I needed all these other services done and made me feel like I would regret it if I didn't.

Sure you have to wait a bit, but your burger is not frozen, its made fresh to order and hand formed, thats right- hand formed.

So I guess this place might not be so kids friendly cause there is no ""KIDS menu"" here. 
The toppings are amazing and the variety is incredible anywhere between the usual ketchup, relish to mayo and even grilled onions and grilled mushrooms all at NO COST!

Their most expensive burger the BACON CHEESEBURGER is $8.50.
While you wait for your juicy creation to be made you can snack on some shelled peanuts completely complimentary.  If you decide to get their fries please know that their smalles size MEDIUM is a ridiculous amount of fries that no human should eat on their own.

- not your standard menu but ""small"" plates meant for sharing
- has tables upstairs and down -- upstairs is warmer in the winter time-
- a bit on the expensive side, but the food is well worth it
- great modern ambiance
- street parking or lot parking nearby

Plates I would recommend:
- warm octopus salad
- beef short ribs
- ahi tuna tacos

We also had the hamachi, the naan bread and the donut holes with caramel and chocolate sauce to end.  Some of the food had chili or jalapeno oil  -- so a bit of a kick -- but very good!

I think this was because we hardly ever went there, and unlike Century III, it was quiet, less congested, and had a fewer amount of big-haired, obnoxious teenagers running about. 

Last week, in search of dessert, we headed to SHV in part because I hadn't been through the campus in over 15 years, and (wait for it...) I hadn't reviewed it yet. 

Eerily perfect and orderly (you won't get lost in here as there's only 2 levels), it's almost too much of both, and aside from the Disney Store (SHV's secret weapon), it's full of chains that can mostly be found elsewhere. There's a Dick's, a Macy's, a Victoria's Secret, an Apple store, a Brookstone, Sephora, J. Crew, the obligatory fountain...zzzz...

Kay almost bought something at Teavana but found it too expensive. 

Eschewing a Dairy Queen and a Mrs. Fields franchise in the gaudy, corporatized food court, we opted for pie at Eat 'n Park. 

SHV survives and thrives, doesn't she?. Think of her as the mature older sister of both Ross Park Mall and The Galleria who married a humble accountant and chose to keep her career as well as remain active in the local PTA. 

Something has been lost about SHV, however, and I can't exactly pinpoint it. Then again, I've been a mall detractor since the age of 13.

Good customer service. A guy asked for water and he didn't even buy anything. The owner of Dolce 21 asked the guy if he wanted warm water or cold water. Very nice. He explained to us how everything worked (soft serve in a cup, then topped with interesting toppings). He also gave us a sample of tiffany vanilla soft serve (blue colored vanilla ice cream).

Had:

One of their daily specials. Mixed popcorn with soft serve ($5) - Choice of tiffany vanilla, Japanese green tea, or a twist of both ice creams. I chose green tea. Size of the portion was great for $5. It's about the size of a regular bubble tea, but filled with ice cream. Mixed popcorn was Christmas flavored? Peppermint candy and stuff. Interesting with the green tea, but I'm not the biggest fan of popcorn, so I probably wouldn't get the popcorn again (cheap Asian. Tried something new. Got the cheapest option). The ice cream was good soft serve, and it did have a matcha taste, but I'm into super-strong matcha tastes, and this wasn't strong enough for me. My friend thought it was the perfect balance of matcha to soft serve. She likes matcha too, so I'm guessing she represents the majority of the population. I like my matcha strong and bitter. Yeah. Probably not so appealing to the rest of the population. Their spoons are a very interesting shape, and very lick-able. It's hard to describe. 

They have a stamp card where you can buy 9 items and get the 10th free (under $4.99).

* Supposedly, they're on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, although I have yet to check that.

I walked in needing an eyebrow wax, and figured I would try this place out, since it was newly opened. The receptionist asked me if I had ever been to a European Wax Center before, and I dutifully (and truthfully) answered no. She then went into a spiel about their rates on getting brazilians done (seriously lady, I just said I wanted my eyebrows done). Their rates are by subscription or volume packaging. So, you could buy something like 6 treatments, and receive 1 free OR subscribe for a monthly rate and know that you'd get a treatment every month. OR you could pay a la carte (which I did... sort of. Your first session is free - score!).So if you are a waxing junkie or just really like to go regularly, this is definitely a good place to consider. It's clean, young, and hip.

The wax job itself was fine, but unexceptional. They use some sort of wax that doesn't require cloth strips and was not painful at all. Allegra was very nice and explained each step to me as she was doing them (""now I'm using a cleanser, this calms the skin,"" etc. kind of seemed superfluous for someone who isn't new to waxing, but whatever). I don't think it was the most amazing eyebrow waxing job I've ever had, since other places I have gone have been more aggressive about shaping my brows. She was worried that my brows were too sparse for what I wanted, and recommended that I use some sort of brow regrowing solution.

Frankly, I was just amused by the entire experience. My brows got cleaned up, but I'll be going back to my usual place, since they are perfectly able to work with my brows as they are now (no growing solution needed!). And, they are comparably priced. When I walked out, all the products that had been used got put on the counter, and they assumed that I would be coming back in three weeks and tried to push me on making an appointment. I really don't fault them for this - their business model is to get you going regularly and frequently. But the upselling and aggressiveness by which this was done really turned me off to the experience and I won't be going back unless I have to. So word to the wise - if you are at all a pushover, avoid this place, because you will be strongly encouraged to buy things or sign up for things.",2014-05-20 18:12:50

Long story short, they (Nicole and I forget the other tech's name) figured it out, took their time and were very patient. A girl sitting next to me had the ombre nails that I've been wanting and Nicole was giving me info, letting me know they were acrylics and I stated that I was anti-acrylic for a long time. She ensured me she only carries the high quality materials so that put me at ease. I may just return for a full set. I love their salon, very cute and chic.

We arrived to the trailhead at about 6:15 this morning to find an almost already full parking lot. We started hiking around 6:30 and got back to the parking lot around 10am. I'd estimate around 2 hours was spent on the way up, 30 minutes at the top, and 60 minutes coming down. Trail begans relatively flat and continued as so for about a mile. We found it very easy to veer off the trail into the gully to the right, which would eventually lead to an extremely steep climb towards the end. There was a particularly confusing section about 2/3 of the way up where there were 3 different paths with none marked particularly clearly. The paths to the left and right both lead in odd directions, but if you continue up the steeper climb behind the ""trail"" marker, you will find the trail. Towards the top, teal and white spots will mark where you should be following, which was definitely helpful. After the mid-climb, the trail is pretty flat until the Saddle. We took the ""Hard"" route up, which ended up being very similar to the steep midpart of the trail. The view at the top was spectacular! On our way down, we accidentally took a very odd path down the middle of the Saddle, which led to a bit behind the split. Overall, the hike is always great. We would undoubtedly do it again, and again. Highly recommend and definitely worth the rating of 5 plus stars for the accomplishment of being able to enjoy the spectacular views of the Las Vegas Valley.",2018-06-12 20:12:35

My husband and I played video poker here for less than two hours on a Saturday afternoon (around 2:00 pm, when the bar was not busy), and we had THE WORST service we have ever experienced in Vegas from the bartender, Josh.  He was rude, offensive and extremely condescending.  When we sat down we both put $100 into the machines, and began playing the max bet, which was a requirement we both fully understood and were fine with to be able to comp our drinks.  Josh reminded us when he brought the first round that we could have one drink every 30 minutes, and that we needed to be playing the max bet.  Again, we were fine with that and it was not an issue.

We started playing and were winning.  After about 35 minutes or so we ordered our second round of drinks and Josh, who was busy making shots and espresso martinis for the two couples next to us (of whom only one person was playing the video poker machine occasionally but all four persons were receiving comped drinks), seemed annoyed.  He reluctantly brought us the drinks and then continued to ignore us and boast an air of arrogance to all of those around him.

Finally, after another 35-40 minutes had gone by, we asked Josh for a final round of drinks, and he rudely told us that he had to ask his floor manager because he didn't know if we had played enough.  His comment was absurd and delivered in such a way that we could not have been more offended.  He did not adhere to this policy with any of the other players around us, so why we were singled out when we had been consistently gambling and did not ask for drinks before we knew 30+ minutes had passed just baffled us.  We were merely killing time before taking a limo to the airport, so his behavior was just absurd.

After checking with his floor manager who informed him that we had been gambling enough and another drink was approved, he decided to tell us that before he could give us another drink we had been warned by him, and that ""his job was on the line.""  We were LIVID.  My husband offered to pay for the drinks, and we left right away to speak with management about the treatment we had just received.  Upon asking to speak to the manager we were told to walk back to the Bar and that he/she would be there to talk to; however, no one was to be found.  We don't know if it was by the hand of Josh that this person never appeared, but it leaves us to conclude that this particular bar and this particular bartender are some of the worst in not just Vegas, but the US.  

We are huge fans of the Aria and were extremely disappointed in this service experience and the way it was handled afterwards.  We will seriously consider other casinos and hotels to stay at during our next trip to Vegas, even though we loved the Sky Suite and every other person at the hotel besides Josh.",2014-03-23 23:06:34

I came here with a friend who's been here many times and highly recommended it and I'm glad I checked it out.

I ordered Idaho trout which was very light and tasty and then I sampled a side of olives, which were not what I was expecting but still edible.

Then the best part was that our whole table got hooked up with samples of champagne and Moscato paired with almost every dessert on the menu except for the chocolate cake, which is fine because I don't really eat chocolate anyway. 

Wow, this was definitely an overwhelming amount of dessert for just a table of 3... but I'm not complaining... Speaking of the desserts my favorite was the lemon tart pie. Wow! That was the best tart I've ever had. All the other desserts were a little over the top on sweetness and dairy, which I'm not a fan of but still good.

Not only was the food fantastic but the service was accurate, friendly and humorous. It was nice to see all the workers getting along and poking fun at one another. I liked it that because it was unexpected and it says something good about the establishment. 

A crew that gets along provides exceptional service and it's very true. The menu was very simple and not as expensive as I thought it would be, which made this meal all the more enjoyable. 

Overall everything was great but my only complaint is that the hostesses could have done a better job with their lack of friendliness/poise and assigning tables. We had a table reserved at 9:15 and did not get seated until 9:40 which was unprofessional.

For a restaurant of this caliber as a hostess you truly need to make sure the table and time promised is what is delivered... no excuses and that's why I'm sticking to 4 stars.",2013-04-24 23:35:30

Being not far from the Phoenix Open makes this the optimal place to grab a bite before, during or after the open. 

The eye candy here is very pleasing (really, it is a dish on the menu). Anyway, this area is about what you drive. Busy sit on the patio and watch the stream of pretentious drive by. It's a joke. 

However, the location is great and both the staff and food are excellent. I do recommend giving it a try. You will not my be disappointed. It is quite the spot to be seen in the valley. A who's not you know...lol.

I am a bit behind on my review writing so I will try to include the highlights, or lowlights as it may be, from my memory. I was eagerly anticipating a spectacular birthday lunch based upon the reviews and the pictures taken. Unfortunately, I was sadly dissapointed and actually left hungry, which is saying a lot for an AYCE place. There were only a couple other tables there at lunch. There was only one waiter which made service incredibly and painfully slow. In anticipation of how long it would take to get our order, as we thought the response time from when we sat down was indicative of the service, we ordered a mass amount of sushi initially - probably 4 orders of nigiri, 4 hand rolls and three cut rolls. There were four of us. Waiter consistently forgot about 1/3 of our orders. My friend must have requested the same hand roll about four times and still didn't get it by the time we left. Also, the specials on the board were not available at lunch - so be careful this was one of the reasons we came were some of the specials. The fish to rice ratio was decent but if they forget 1/3 of your orders I am sure they can afford to cut the rice down on what they serve. The sushi in and of itself was okay, nothing memorable and pretty standard. I would avoid ""the shit"" despite the accolades provided by other yelpers it was nothing more than a fried mess. After about two hours of fighting through this horrible experience we finally left - we didn't get dessert because we were on ""lunch"" and were already really late and just couldn't take the agonizing service anymore. It was the perfect storm of forgetful slow waiter, slow sushi chef and being understaffed. I dont' know if the other yelpers came at night and the staff gears it up for the evening but my experience is one I hope to never repeat again in my life. Also, be warned that they didn't provide soda fountain drinks, if you buy a soda it is just a can. Also, the green iced tea is not brewed (despite the representation that it was) and is merely a mix, this was apparent by not only the taste but the mix floating around in the drink. 

 So so sad that I wasted my birhday lunch here...",2014-08-01 19:21:09

While an expensive restaurant in itself - it has the $25 fixed price menu, which can include Steak Frites or the Rib-Eye - available from Thursday to Sunday past 9PM. You get unlimited pickles/coleslaw/bread, but dont fill up on those as the steak is a marvel.

Nothing more to say - just go have it. The place is a bit crowded, but that shows it is a good place. It has the old ambiance, almost Mafia-style type of place, where I can see Al Capone type of mobsters wearing coats and hats walking in and enjoying a steak. The tables are the old original ones in the restaurant.

Service is a bit snooty (esp for the ""poor"" people that are having the cheap menu) - but who cares. I am there to stuff my face with a delicious steak and not to have a fun conversation with the waiter. Ours wasn't the best guy, but my food was delivered promptly, pickles/coleslaw/water glass always got replenished and never had an issue with anything.

If you decide to go for the $25 menu - it doesn't include wine. The cheapest glass is like $15 or something, so that can add heavily to the cost. But hey, whats a steak with no wine???

Fantastic place, excellent atmosphere, will always come back.",2014-07-21 23:08:09

Super convenient location for us, off GV and 215. We've had family stay here in the past and the hotel is beautiful, but very expensive. The rooms are nice but not overly impressive. The pool is just my favorite place. I love the little sandy beach, the pool chairs are comfy and it's usually easy to get a spot. I wish they had local deals for the pool. If they did, I'd never leave! 

The spa is out of this world luxurious. My GVR spa days are among my favorite days ever. The spa is modern, clean, the ambiance is super relaxing, and there's a co-ed area. The staff is friendly and helpful. I absolutely love the gym and how it's open to the separate spa pool and outdoor area. The new locks in the locker rooms are pretty finicky - I had to have mine reset multiple times on my last visit. Every second of my spa experiences at GVR have been nothing short of spectacular! 30% off on weekdays for locals.

They have Pizza Rock now, which is really growing on me. It gets busy on the weekends, so head there early for a table. 

The buffet is, well, a buffet. Lines are usually slow, and wait times are ridiculous even when lines are seemingly short. I like that they do gelato milkshakes, but I should lay off milkshakes for a while, LOL. The mongolian grill is awesome.

Since we moved a year ago we haven't really been to this side of town all that often and it's been ages since I last been to Jun's. I needed to reacquaint my taste buds of how good their food was and had me wondering why we don't come more often, because not only do you get a bang for your buck here, but they serve you quality food foremost. It's amazing that quality and prices have remained top notch despite their 10 years of success and continued growth. It's family owned hole in the wall places such as this I like supporting as they are the ones with the most heart.

They offer a lot of Korean specialties and Hawaiian fusion as well. I must admit, I'm not all too familiar with most of the Korean soups and find them intimidating hahaha probably due to the long and hard to pronounce names, but I do want to try them one of these days as they look good and appetizing. I'm up for suggestions on which I should try first, nothing too spicy, I'm a sissy when it comes to that ;)

Last night we got two 2 item combo plates ($11.95 each) First with Bulgogi and Spicy pork with fish cake and bean sprouts as sides. Hubby chose Meat chun and BBQ chicken with kimchi and fish cake. Everything tasted so good though the pork was too spicy for my taste. The Bulgogi was well marinated and mouth watering, chicken was perfect with a little char yet remained moist & juicy and the Meat chun was oh so tender and flavorful especially when dipped in the accompanying sauce. Portions are big enough that I still have some for my lunch today. I have been to several places that charge $3 more yet left me wanting and unsatisfied with the meal.

It's located at the SE corner of Cave Creek & 101 in a nice suite that seems to be cursed for some reason...  First, there was Native Yorker (serially successful in the Valley across many locations)... After a few years, they gave up here and Brick Yard (a nice sports bar) took over the spot.  Just a few months later, that was over.

In the last year, Upper Crust moved in.  Our first visit, shortly after they opened, was not great, but showed promise.  The wings were average, and the pizza was straight up soggy in the middle.  However, you could tell the ingredients were good and it was reminiscent of Grimaldi's (same style, almost the same crust...).  The salad was... well... FRIGGIN' AWESOME.  Simple romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, and kalamato olives topped with nice feta tossed in a simple vinegarette.  I'm not sure what kind of olive oil they use, but it was just perfect.  Just the right amount of dressing with a perfect balance of the buttery olive oil and tangy red wine vinegar.  Maybe a bit too much feta, but damn... it was good.  The pizza was much improved.  The center was still just a bit on the soft side, but as before the ingredients seemed top notch and the sauce was just right.

Happily, we can say that the kinks appear to be working out.  Tonight, we had a couple beers, a small Mediterranean salad (they say it serves 1-2, but as a first course, it's more like 3-4), and a 16"" w/ onions, mushrooms, and sausage.  

The atmosphere is casual, but a bit on the quiet side (sad to say, it was probably because the restaurant was about 1/2 full on a Saturday night).  They retained all the TV's and sports programming from the Brick Yard/Native New Yorker days, but don't crank up the volume, so it's a bit unique, but cool.

The service is pleasant and earnest (admittedly, our server seemed a bit inexperienced and awkward, but effort was all there).

We'll be making an effort to visit more often (gotta hit the neighborhood places a bit more...).  

Really, this place is just an over upgrade away from being right on par with Grimaldi's and the prices are bit better.",2011-05-15 04:43:07

I would say the food is really only about 3 stars as far as quality goes, on par with a St Louis or Wild Wing, but I gave them the extra star simply because they have the best wing deals around.

Tuesday nights are .59 cent wings, and Thursday nights are .49 cent boneless wings.  No minimum orders, take-out is 100% accepted and even encouraged when a shitty place like Wild Wing are overly anal about it being dine-in only.  Plus they always have draught beer specials to go with the wings, and $5 apps during the most popular hours.

For these reasons alone, it kicks the living crap out of Wild Wing, which in my opinion is just the most greedy, pathetic wing chain of all time.

Probably explains why BWW was packed last night for wing night, in a massive building with hundreds of tables, and the Wild Wing across the street can't even fill 3 tables.

This is probably the closest bar to where I live and I had been meaning to try it out forever. Thursday night was the prime opportunity with a break in the rain and us wanting to get out but not go too far. Unfortunately I cannot speak to the food since we had dinner before we left but everything smelled delicious! They have a wing special of $6.50 dine in wings (12 I think) if you buy a beverage from 5-7.

We sat down at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender. The companion ordered a $4.75 OMB copper and I opted for a $5.25 Sweetwater IPA, not great prices but the only special they had was $2 miller and that's not on my radar of beer any more. 

The thing that really made this bar was the bartender - always busy but never neglectful. He always kept our drinks full and told entertaining stories to the people around the bar. I noticed he finished a bottle on one drink and gave the little bit that was left to a patron at the bar saying there was no point in it going to waste. I liked that. We only had a couple beers but he made sure to fill them to the brim. 

This is my kind of bar - you can wear what you are comfortable in, the locals are friendly the bartender entertaining and attentive. There were TVs around but most of the people were interacting which is a rare find in the age of the smart phone.

PS for the ladies - the restroom was surprisingly nice with flower scented jars everywhere and a little sitting / powder area. Not what I was thinking it would be.",2015-06-05 12:24:23

Fun experience, especially if you've been to vegas several times and want something new to do

Awesome scenery 

Guides were patient and easy to work with

Cons-
Other reviews regarding Groupon are correct.  They rope you in with $99 deal and then add on a ton of fees once you get there (about $30).  Then if you pay with a credit card, they tack on another fee.  My thought was, ""who is going to bring that much cash to a desert unless there is a casino nearby?""

Pick up service was a mess.  I arranged for a pick up in the morning, then they called to changed it to pick me up an hour earlier.  I had a car and didn't want to get picked up earlier, so they sent me the directions.  Said it was only 30 minutes from my location.  There is no way that location is 30 minutes away.  Because it is not at a physical address, a gps was no help.  Instead they give you ""treasure map"" directions (at the tree turn right, turn left at rock, etc).  Place was seriously in the middle of no where. 

Took several minutes to get liability waivers and other paperwork signed.

My recommendation:  send papers ahead of time, so customers can be hand it in right away instead of taking time from activity, honor pick up schedule, and be up front with actual price for activity.  Is that so much to ask for?",2015-06-18 20:17:50

I don't even know where to begin (I'll upload some pictures shortly). The room, the service, the staff, and the S'mores!!! Not kidding. At the Firesky, they offer ALL their guests complimentary (and unlimited) S'mores supplies. You go to the front desk and tell them how many bags you'd like (each bag holds enough supplies to make two S'mores). They give you the bags, along with a 'S'more skewer'. You take the supplies and head over to any of the bonfires they have outside and roast your S'mores while meeting other guests staying at the hotel. And let me tell you - an ""Oups, my marshmellow just fell on top of yours"" is a better pick-up line than you would have ever imagined. 
Once you're done with the S''mores eating (or perhaps BEFORE the S'mores eating begins is a better idea) you can go swim/float in any of their pools (yes, that's plural) or toast in their hot tub.

My first visit, the guy doing my gel manicure would not look me in the eyes or talk to me.  I'd try to look at him and he'd just turn his head.  When he wanted me to take my hand out of the UV light thing, he'd just tap on the top of it.  I tried to talk to him.  I tried to smile.  He was having none of it.

I told my friend who recommended this place and she agreed the gel manicure guys were creepy with her, too (apparently they are two - they look similar and they do the exact same thing).  She recommended I just go for a pedicure.  I tried two pedicures here and the ladies were fine, but they pretty much talk to each other the whole time.  I felt like I was one of many in a manufacturing line of pedicures.  And when they did the calf massage, holy crap, totally painful because my legs were straight and muscles flexed.  Both times. I tried to explain this to them, but they didn't get it. And they wouldn't let me adjust my legs so finally I just had to pull away and ask them to stop.

(Free to sign up with them) We arrived and had to visit the concierge to get our tickets.  It must have been the first time they offered these particular tickets for free as they were unaware of how to process them.  The two ladies helping us were awesome!  They assured us there wouldn't be any issue getting us the 4 tickets we signed up for. It took them a few minutes but eventually said our names would be on the list to get it.  Wow!  I never had my name be on 'the list' to get in anywhere!  Doesn't that only happen to celebrities? ;-) I felt important for the night! 

The theatre itself is not too huge but seated plenty of people.  Even with our free tickets, they seated us at one of the 'reserved' booth tables to enjoy the show. The waitress immediately came over to get our drink orders.  She was fabulous and always came back to check on us.  

Louis Anderson had a few opening acts. The first one... blah.  I was hoping this wasn't setting the tone for the night.  The second act was a comedian/magician.  He was great! I'm always fascinated by their illusions.  Louis Anderson was great! I think he had a few bits in mind but alot of it was improv with the audience.

These are a few reasons why I love Winco. 

1. I'm always experimenting with recipes so if I need a spice I don't have I'm not forced to by the whole thing. If I only want a teaspoon it would be possible in their spice section. They charge by the ounce. 

2. The food is cheap! Fore example I found medium sized ground beef packets for 99 cents. Containers of strawberries $1.45 instead of 2 for $5.00. Pita bread ( fluffy kind) 99 cents. It lasted longer then the one I bought from Whole Foods that went bad in under a week. 

3. You can get the food cheaper because they do take coupons.  

4. I haven't tried this yet but you can make your own peanut butter.

It wasn't the execution either. My backyard burger windsor style was hot and cooked properly. What was missing was savory flavor. Everything was sweet with no balance. The burger itself did not taste to be seasoned and all the accoutrements were sweet including the bun. My wife got the crab cake BLT and it was assembled and cooked fine, but it is just a bad design. It comes on a huge chewy hoagie roll that drowns out any crab or bacon flavor and is virtually impossible for humans to put in their mouths. The chopped kale salad was way too tough to eat.

[Just kidding; we all know Santa is real.] However, I found one! Yes, the holy grail of all of modern man's greatest desires: a genuinely honest mechanic.

Here's the scoop. My brakes start to get a tiny bit squeaky, so like most of us, I put off doing anything about it for a few more weeks. Finally, I hear one squeak too many. Time to suck it up and shell out some of my hard-earned dough to whatever shister with a wrench I should haplessly fall victim to. However, my sis recommends this Meineke place down the street; she swears by it even. ""Okay,"" I say, ""I'll give it a shot.""

So, the mechanic (I wish I remembered his name--but I think it was one syllable, like Bob or Mike or Jack or Bud) puts my car up on the lifts, comes back a few minutes later and says, ""You don't need new brake pads. You've got at least 40% life left in them--probably 50%. The squeaks are probably just brake dust. Save yourself the $100 and wait to replace them."" Excuse me!? Did that guy wearing the coveralls just offer a way for me to save money? I was so taken aback that I was speechless for a minute while my brain wrapped itself around this brand new reality.

Well, long story short, they topped off my brake fluid and sent me on my way for the grand total of $0. Yes, you read that correctly. Zero. Dollars. When's the last time that happened to you? You know as well as I do that any of these other brake repair places (read: scam artists) peppered around the Valley would have not only charged you for replacing the pads, but also would have told you that your rotors are shot too. So, I'm not going to tell you to go this place. If after reading my story, you're not already driving over to this Meineke, well then you deserve whatever happens to you at any other mechanic.

Everything an artist could need and a lot, lot more. They have a ridiculous selection of paper including specialty papers, mylar, tissue, photo paper, and notebooks too. I was looking for paper cutting accessories and was extremely impressed with the quantity of offerings. 

They also have a host of things I know nothing about like paint and paint tools. You could easily get lost in a store like this, and I have many times. Everything is of top quality and the staff are more than willing to help. Oh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is killer too? Woolfitt's works on so many levels.

Obligatory Title Pun: If this store was a sandwich I'd WOLF IT down.

Menu Readability: The façade itself is a work of art.

Need to mention: They have parking! A rarity on this stretch of Queen St W.

What this place teaches me about myself: Maybe I should get a part-time job at an art supplies store.",2012-02-16 00:21:11

With another couple we came back for a drink pre-dinner.  I had the key lime martini and pretzel bread once again.  At dinner, we had a great waiter Claudio.

Eric R. and I decided to share a steak.  We started off with the hearts of palm salad (hearts of palm, avocado, tomato, micro greens, pear vinaigrette) and our friends shared beef carpaccio with us.  For the meal, we split the 24 oz bone in ribeye (with plenty of leftovers!!), creamed corn (mmmm) and the foie gras, but instead of just foie gras by itself, it came with berries, fresh figs, and balsamic glaze.  Even Eric R. who first announced at Vegas Uncorked 2 years ago, ""WHAT'S FOY GRASS?!"" enjoyed the foie and all of the berries with it!

We were all too full for dessert, but the food was tasty, the service great, and the ambience very nice.  We were under a stunning chandelier.  Claudio even joked with us when he asked what type of water we wanted, Eric R. and I both exclaimed, ""LAKE MEAD!"" and Claudio told us, ""It isn't Lake Mead...at Hank's we serve Chateau Lake Mead water!""

Nanny's is a French cafe. They have a small menu of sandwiches, paninis, salads, and omelets. Plus, they had some beautiful looking pastries. After perusing the menu Joel ordered the salami sandwich and I had the Belgian panini.

So that pretty much leaves me with nothing...until I remembered Taziki's.

When you walk in, you go all the way to the end of the hall where you order at a counter.  The person taking the order was pretty friendly.  When we ordered drinks, they handed it to us already filled with the crushed, chewable ice, which I loved.

They have a small covered patio with about 8-10 tables.  When you pay, they give you a numbered card, so they know what table to bring the food to when serving.  We got a lamb pita with garlic sauce and a greek salad.  Both dishes were pretty good.

Overall, I would say this place is a good alternative if you want something fairly quick, but you don't want a sandwich or something at the drive-thru.

Yesterday was my most recent trip and I went for some very specific items. I make all of my daughters baby food so I went for fruits and veggies for her. I came home with 1 bag organic carrots, 1 bag organic peas, 5 organic apples, 3 sweet potatoes, 4 pears, 2 acorn squash, and 4 peaches. My total came to just over $16. At 55 cents and up for a jar of baby food... you do the math! This will feed her for well over a month! 

I do shop here on a regular basis for my fruits, veggies and grains. They have a huge selection of bins housing grain, nuts, fruits, trail mix and candies. Always a fabulous selection of health items like vitamins, I am a huge tea drinker and they always stock my favorites. The employees are friendly and always willing to answer questions. They usually have some meats that catch my eye for dinner that night... stuffed pork chops and the like. They carry this amazing hummus by Oasis Naturals, my favorite is the artichoke but the jalapeno is also divine. Make sure to pick one up!

The good thing is that the server promptly took the food back and had it remade. Other than being microwaved gravy it was ok.

It is in a strip mall facing Northern, you must either park and walk along the front sidewalk or go down thru a hallway around to the front- a bit odd and far if you are handicapped.
The first visit we sat on the patio on a weekend, it was busy but I have seen longer waits where the service was faster in other places. The waitress was overwhelmed and kept complaining to every table about how she had no help, etc. If you can't cut it have a different job! Our food took at least 45 minutes to arrive, it was getting hot out, insanely loud kids, waitress spilled drinks, food not very good, so.....
After about 4 months we ventured back, about 10:15 on a Wednesday, not busy, table inside where it is cool. It is clean and decorated with a western theme but if you do not like to eat while looking at dead animals on the wall, don't go. It doesn't bother me, but I know there are people who do not like it.
I had iced tea and a western/denver omelet with the country potatoes. The omelet was ok, but the bell peppers and onions are not sauteed first so they are pretty raw in the omelet. The amount of ham was good. The potatoes were described as sauteed with onion and bell pepper- perfect, I love that! Well, as you can see in most pictures, they are baked or microwaved, but not sauteed. They were very dry and mushy on the inside, I had 1 speck of bell pepper, but honestly I think it rolled out of the omelet and a couple teeny specks of onion. The flavorless, dry mushy potatoes stayed on my plate. Oh, I was offered biscuits (plural) or a variety of toast, I chose raisin toast. I have never been to a restaurant that gives you only 1, count it, 1 slice of toast. For the price this was not a good value and I will NEVER return!
While the service was friendly and efficient this time, it does not make up for the very mediocre food!

This is sushi for the American crowd or the people who demand all you can eat. Deep fried items and deep fried rolls abound on the menu. If you can tolerate all the grease you won`t leave here hungry, that`s for sure. Service ranges from poor to non-existent - I had to walk to the counter and wait almost 5 minutes just to get my bill, so don`t go here if you`re in a hurry.

mdSGX7njXZcvSvm24B6sMA,65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw,zUyXbscEfafmK8jkvfd1eA,4,5,0,4,"This place is a new discovery for me although it's been around for a while.  About a month and a half ago I went with my wife to 850 Degrees on Lakeshore in Long Branch to have a nice pizza dinner.  I had ordered a beer that they had called Canuck and since then I have fallen in love with this beer.  This beer is a pale ale and it has a nice hoppy taste to it but it's not overpowering like some of the pale ales I've had in the past.  

In reading the can I discovered it was from Great Lakes Brewery right here in Toronto and as a matter of fact it's in my part of town (Etobicoke) as well.  A recent return to 850 I had the Devil's Pale Ale which was 850's feature beer for November.  Devil's to me was a little different, practically a stout and the color, it looked like I was drinking a Coke.  I different taste, a different look.

Being an active member of Yelp myself, Kris U who is the CM of the Greater Toronto Area had worked with GLB to get a pale ale made for YELP!  That's right Kris has worked with Great Lakess Brewery to have an exclusive beer made for Yelp!  From what Kris said an original batch of only 20 x 56 liter kegs were brewed.  I'm not sure how many cans were made or if that was included in the quantity for the kegs but considering this beer has been spread out to local establishments during the past month until supplies last is pretty cool.

Restaurants such as 229, Union Social Eatery, Hungry Brew Hops, King Henry's Arms, Smash Kitchen, Ten and Bru were all participants in the Yel-PA program.  

A dollar of every Yel-PA beer sold at these establishments is being donated to the Daily Bread Food Bank.

This past Monday Kris held a CM Event at Union Social Eatery for a small group and we were able to all sample GLB's Yel-PA.  Being as Union features a craft beer on Monday they were featuring Yel-PA that evening for 5 dollars.

Yel-PA finally I had a chance to try it and it was good.  It was a nice dark amber color and it had a good taste and wasn't overly overpowering and light on the hops.

Well I had went to GLB near the Costco in Etobicoke to purchase some Yel-PA the other day and they were sold out!  I was sort of sad but I did buy one Pompous Ass to try as the guy there told me Yel-PA was a lot like Pompous Ass.  I also bought some Canuck.  

Now that I know where this place is I'm happy to say it is nice to know we have a local brewery very close that makes great beer for good prices.  The Pompous Ass and Canuck sell for 2.50 each for tallboys (473 ml).  Now this beer is really good and for 2.50 well that's just the same price as many of the other types of beer I can get at the LCBO.  Pricewise GLB is competitive but taste wise well I will be coming here more often to stock on good locally made quality beer.",2014-12-05 15:20:17

I bought a Gringo style burger with sweet potato fries and an iced tea.  They were all OK.  The sweet potato fries were not as crispy as I would like but they are not bad.  Because it is a new, off menu, item they asked me how I liked them and although they were not the best I have had they were not far enough off I could say exactly why.  They could have used a dipping sauce other than ketchup.  I liked the burger.  There is nothing great about any of the food but it is reasonably priced and OK.  

The service is fast casual where you order at the counter and they bring it to you.  They are obviously passionate about their restaurant as how many cooks in a fast food place come out and tour the dining room to check on their customers?  They have a frequent diner program that is web based which is sort of cool.

Given I have to drive past this place for either In-and -Out or Culvers I will more often than not stop at this local place to eat rather than the chains.

The last two times I have been here, they have completely skimped on my tacos or really messed up our order. And here's the best part: we're doing online ordering. With explicit instructions. How do you mess that up?? 

The customer service also stinks. My husband went to pick up food right before I got off work. We get home and I'm handing him his burrito and it's ICE COLD. Like it was sitting in a freezer. There is no way our car was cold, it was a warm day out and he put it in the backseat so the dog wouldn't get to it. When he bit into it, it was freezing. How the heck can that happen? My tacos were also ridiculously tiny - they were filled halfway if that. They also added guacamole which I loathe. I remember when I've gone there and the tacos are so big that I could barely eat two. Now I can eat all 3 and be hungry an hour later. NOT COOL! 

So my husband is so upset that he goes back to Chipotle. A second time. What happens? They try to make an excuse that they made the burrito right in front of him and it couldn't possibly be that cold, and all they do is remake the order. And my second tacos are just as tiny as the first. When you can grasp the top of the taco and have an entire inch on both sides, you have a problem. His burrito was HUGE - my veggie tacos were tiny. We're paying the same price, so why am I getting less? 

I am so fed up with this place that I honestly can't come here anymore. We used to come here about every two weeks but it's annoying to have to keep going back to do things semi-correctly, and still be disappointed on now multiple occasions. It's a VEGAN TACO. I am the cheapest customer you have! I shouldn't have to glare and ask you to give me more of every single ingredient to get one decent taco.

We arrived after work at 6:30PM. No trouble getting a seat, as there were plenty of seats available. Service was great... In the beginning. Waitress was able to keep up with our choices as we went through the extensive menu.

Each item came out one after the other in short amount of time. We were instantly questioning ourselves if we ordered too much (which we did not of course).

Sashimi came on ice which was great to keep nice and cold. All sushi and maki was served on wooden platters which made it feel like a fancier AYCE restaurant. 

When it came down to our second round of food, the waitress was again, very attentive and took our orders quickly. Soon afterwards, the service started to crumble.

Food came out at adequate times, but once it came time to order dessert no one was to be found. The restaurant was at about 50% capacity on a Wednesday night and we were only able to see 2 waitresses taking orders. There were plenty of servers running food to tables.

Street parking is pretty limited around the area, so I just parked on the 2nd floor of the parking deck next to Trader Joe's.  Because it was Friday around 7:00, I was afraid it would be crowded.  Fortunately for us, it wasn't.  

We walked in and were immediately greeted and seated.  We followed the hostess through the dining room.  I liked the modern decor in the open restaurant.  Suddenly, we turned OUT of the dining room and down this corridor, which I wasn't expecting.  There were intimate booths down either side.  You entered the booth through this large round opening, which provided additional privacy.  ""I wonder what kind of dirty stuff goes on back here?"" my friend asked.  It provided a nice quiet, intimate environment for a romantic dinner or conversation.  

Pisces had a special on a Cucumber Sake Martini that night, so we both decided to try it.  Wow.  It was amazing.  So refreshing, and it went down easily.  

To start, I had their house salad with ginger dressing.  Mmm...  You can't go wrong with ginger dressing.  It really feels right before sushi.  

I finished off the experience with a Hawaiian Poki roll and a Crunchy Spicy Tuna roll.  Both were delicious, fresh-tasting, and beautifully presented on the plate.  The prices are a reasonable, but by the time I was done with dinner and drinks, I think I spent $40 on myself alone.  Oh well...it was worth it.  

The service was great, too.  Our server kept checking in on us.  After we finished, we wanted to talk longer and catch up; our server didn't hound us to leave.  She got a great tip, so no worries. :)

I ordered the squash gnocchi, which had really delicious pieces of brussel sprouts and other veggies in it.  My two friends ordered the pork shoulder and the bolognese, both of which were very good.  They make their pasta in-house and it was remarkably fresh.  

The wait staff informed us that they also make their desserts and sodas in-house.  My friend tried a cocktail with a house-made soda and it was really tasty.  

Our dessert, a zucchini chocolate cake, was superbly legit: not too sweet, not too dense or light, the icing was thick but melted in the mouth.  It left you with that extra-satisfied-but-not-bloated feeling good desserts tend to do.

 2 1/2 hours getting an oil change and tire rotation and when they finished, my air conditioner no longer blew cold air. Coincidence? I doubt it!

They told me it was impossible for an oil change and tire rotation to affect the air conditioning, which is not true! I have no choice due to the high temps to get it done.

They told me $250 and they could do it today. Well, they take my car back and then they come out and tell me that I need new drums because mine are warped and shocks and struts, yada yada...Suddenly it's a $1,400 job. I just had it at the dealer for a recall and they said they did an inspection and didn't mention any of this so I decide to wait and get a second opinion. So, I ask them to write all this down for me...Suddenly, the shocks and struts are mileage recommended, not because they've noticed anything wrong with them and the drums are just ''slightly'' warped.

I usually get the same few things here and just switch the order among them: teriyaki chicken, Beijing beef, string bean chicken or sweet fire chicken.

The menu is very varied, and offers a mix of Mexican cuisine as well, with their infamous fish tacos. Very eclectic menu and atmosphere overall and great for groups. Their bbq mahi mahi fish tacos are probably my favorite dish (I usually always order fish) and their salmon comes very well-flavored as well. 

The salsa that comes with the chips is very good and addicting, with their pico de gallo/corn mixture. I always get seconds and thirds. They also have a lengthy margarita list, if you are a tequila lover, which I assume you are if you are contemplating Cabo. !

I was in Vegas for a work convention (exciting, I know) and on the way to the airport, for the last couple of hours, I wanted something quick and easy... but relaxing.  My local friends wanted to meet here for Happy Hour.  

I got here around 4:30 on a Monday.  I really love being able to just park and walk up in Vegas. Eating on the strip is a whole process of parking and walking through casinos... that's like a wasted 20 minutes there, another 20 back.  A place like this, nice and easy.  

The layout is great.  It goes for a Caribbean/Cuban feel, especially outside, without feeling cheesy.  Nice shutters on the enclosed patio area, warm air coming in, sunny... just a very relaxed atmosphere where you really don't feel like you're in Vegas.  I felt like I was on vacation, actually, which sounds cheesy but it's true.  The restaurant was pretty open, though, but it was a weekday.  

Now, the food...

Happy Hour is an amazing deal.  It's like $5-something per dish and beers and drinks are from $2-$3....!?  What... the... hell!  So good.   

We were starving so we got almost one of everything; the jerk chicken, pork sliders, burger sliders, empandas, quesadilla, coconut shrimp, etc.  Everything was great.  My friends were a little hesitant about the jerk chicken because it was black, due to the rub, but it was great.   My friends had a pineapple coconut martini (great), mojito (they loved it, had real sugar cane), I had a hefeweizen.   

So basically, you can't miss at Happy Hour - everything was great.

This is a small detail that I really appreciate. In the men's bathroom, they have mouthwash dispensers. It's a great touch because, let's be honest, your breath after eating isn't going to be the best so this is a great way to hit the reset button.

We sat at the bar and were handed the Beer Menu and a ""Brunch Menu"". They have a VERY nice Beer Selection covering MANY local brews as well as their OWN! We were then told that the ""limited menu"" was actually even MORE limited than it looked. We were told we could have ""Brunch"", (5 different choices) where everything included eggs. Even the Nachos had eggs on them! We were told that we could order Brunch, but NONE of the other sandwiches they had on their menu. They could do a burger, but that's it! 

So, I thought I'd have a Burger! My wife ordered the Nacho like things w/eggs. My neighbor had the Eggs Benedict Special. The food came and was actually VERY good! However, IMMEDIATELY following our meal, (2 mins) my wife said she felt sick! She ran to the bathroom and ended up throwing up. Instantly feeling better afterwards and NOT being sick when she entered, nor AFTER throwing up. We came to the conclusion that ONE of the beers she had, was probably BAD! That's exactly what happens to a person when they get hold of bad beer that's sat too long in a keg, without selling. 

I'd have given them a much higher score had they not had a ""limited, limited menu"". Over 50% of their limited menu wasn't even available to order. The Staff was nice and friendly. But they're restricted in what they can do. They don't make the decisions to not serve food in a restaurant. They'd also have gotten a higher score had my wife also NOT gotten sick!

I will preface this review by saying that I prefer the dives over the hip and trendy so my opinion my be biased.  I recently met a friend here to partake in their dinner menu.

lbFNLmnqKwIzJFCupWId0g,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,CK-Gv3vqIlWOrKP4fhT8_g,5,18,6,16,"D's famous, expansive Beer Cave brought us here by necessity being that Kay and I were throwing a housewarming party the next day and required some alcohol for our guests. We didn't walk out with any booze thanks to an honest employee who directed us to a cheaper beer distributor down the street, but dine on some fabulous franks we did. 

Hey, we had enough cooking to do in the morning, and since D's serves food...

Resisting the urge to destroy burgers wherever I see them listed, I opted to take on a duo of dogs as did Kay: A Chicago and a Bacon Cheddar. Kay stayed true to her Southern roots and went for a Mason Dixon (a slaw 'n chili dawg) and a Mac 'n Cheese (yup its on there), neither of which I got to try.

The Chicago is just that; relish, onions, pickles, tomatoes, sport peppers, yellow mustard, and celery salt on my choice of a Vienna All-Beef frank, all of it contained in a mattress of a poppyseed bun. 

If THIS was an ""authentic"" Chi-town style hot dog, then Chicagoans are more blessed than they know. 

What I couldn't fathom was not only how the folks in the kitchen got all of the components inside a bun but also how they did it in such a picturesque manner. It was so aesthetic, I was afraid to munch on it.

From there, I got down 'n dirty with the Bacon and Cheddar and found that the molten orange goo almost usurped the beefy, salty flavors of the grade-A proteins, taking the bread with it down to the bottom of a sea of cheese Primus would avoid. 

Coming back to Chicago from Yuba City (I kid my uncle's hometown), I found that this regional take came off more like a sandwich, transcending its genre so to speak. Fresh tomato cuts stood where ketchup should not. Sport peppers livened up the affair like GG Allin. A literally neon-green freakshow of a relish acted as a feather boa as well as a sugared counterweight to the briny proceedings. Dill pickles added more sass and bite as well as chill, and the yellow mustard/onion tandem had a bit to say about tradition. Archetypal, the majestic franks within each sheath of bread, but particularly the Chicago, were mountains above ballpark or arena fare. The flavors of slain, ground, smoked, grilled bovine were ALL you tasted upon breakage of the natural casings, and no amount of topping could smother or deny them. Note that I said the cheddar on the former dog was ALMOST overwhelmed. Not even Cheeze Whiz can kill wieners (stop...snarking...stop it!) like these. 

A ""handful,"" as D's calls it, of french fries were beer-battered and superlative in every crisped, aurulent way frites can, should, and must be. The BBQ wings had a sauce that was stickysweet like a certain Def Leppard hit and fell apart in our hands and in our mouths. Come, come ye wing fanatics. 

Another valid reason for D's to be is its energetic, far from obnoxious, live-and-let-live atmosphere that few places can match let alone top. People we absolutely did not know came up to us, asking us how we liked the food, if we had been to D's before, how our night was going, and etcetera, glorious etcetera. We dined underneath a whimsical painted mural full of famous people and fictional characters. While awaiting our meal, we spotted Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Spider-Man, Bill Cardille, Richard Pryor, Bruno Sammartino, Captain America, and we'll leave it at that so as not to spoil your time-killing, conversation-making fun. 

Regent Square is fortunate to have D's. Come on a Friday night, grab a seat, have a frank, sip a cold beverage, and allow your weekday worries to disappear.",2012-06-13 02:12:57

The place is packed and with a lengthy waitlist on Sunday mornings.  We got there and had our name on the list by 10:45 am and still had to wait about an hour to get seated.  And then, getting our meals took a long time also.  I actually went with the server's suggestion and got a special (smoked salmon frittata) - not the best, it turns out.  The frittata was especially dense and nothing to write home about and it came with 2 small pieces of smoked salmon on top.  Hmmm.  The french toast and sage ham meals that I saw looked good, and probably would be my choice the next time.  Later, I heard that avoiding the specials and sticking to the basics of the menu is usually your best bet.  

Price-wise, it's about on par with other brunch locations in the city.  While a bit more inconvenient with respect to the wait and location, I am sure I will be back here for the different menu options and the charm of the cafe.",2008-02-25 21:47:03

We shared the roasted sweet potatoes, masala cauliflower, kale & red cabbage caesar and roasted beets as well as the red lentil dahl. Everything was very fresh, hearty and so well composed. My favourites were the cauliflower and the caesar.

We have gone every year for the past three years. This year we went on a Thursday night with reservations made on opentable and were sitting within 10 minutes of arriving. I will say that I received a phone call from the hostess this year to confirm our reservation but also to read off a LIST... A LONG LIST... of restaurant week rules. Most of which are kind of common sense, but it just seemed like a bit much. You're a restaurant, chill. 

Every time that I go during restaurant week, I always opt for the Queen's Feast which does not include all of the rodizio options. However, it certainly has an assortment and you will not be disappointed. Each year that we have gone, it seems that switch up which meats are included in the Queen's Feast, which is nice. At this point, I think I have been able to try almost all of them by going each time during restaurant week. 

The salad bar is always well stocked and has delicious options. However, I know the salad bar is just a ploy to fill you up before they start bringing the meats around - don't be an amateur and let them trick you into filling up on the salad bar! 

The meats are always cooked well and have great flavor. It is always pretty busy during restaurant week as one can imagine and they still seem to do a pretty good job making sure the meats are circulating to all of the tables. 

They always have drink specials during restaurant week. They usually have sangria for $6. This time my friends and I opted for a bottle of wine on special for $30 that is usually twice as much. I think they had 3 options of wine for the $30 special. Our waiter seemed very knowledge about the wine. 

For dessert we got the chocolate toffee cake and cheesecake. The cheesecake was strangely hard - almost like you had to chew it. It was not melt in your mouth creamy. The chocolate cake was better, but very rich. The desserts are not anything great. We got them mostly because it was my friend's birthday. Two of my friends also got coffee, one got an espresso and the other a cappucino. Both said that the coffee was good. 

Throughout the evening the service was great, almost to the point of too much. I swear every time one of my friends took a sip of his water the waiter topped it off. But that's better than being ignored. 

As our evening was wrapping up, we took a couple pictures for my friends birthday. When my friend reviewed the pictures on her phone, another patron had photobombed the picture in the back. After making eye contact and realizing she was less than pleased with his addition. The other patron asked the rodizio server with the sausage to come over to our table and tell us that he had sent it over. It was clear we were done eating and our table had been cleared. AND THE RODIZIO SERVER DID IT. I love a dirty joke as much as the next guy, but this just wasn't the time or place. I would hope that perhaps there was a cultural or language barrier that the server did not understand how crude something like that is to a table with WOMEN seated at it. Or perhaps the server thought that we knew each other. Needless to say, I would imagine that this is not the norm, but would expect a little more professionalism from the staff at the restaurant. Our waiter was apologetic and said he would let the manager know about the situation.",2015-01-24 21:45:10

Kaffir is located in the atrium area of the market and it is where I head to when I have a hankering for Indonesian food.
It's hard to pin down Indonesian food, it is so diverse because Indonesia is a country made up of over 6000 islands and people from more than 300 ethnic groups. My mum was born and raised in Palembang which is in the island of Sumatra and there are Indonesian dishes from Sumatra that you will not get on other Indonesian islands. One of the best loved Sumatran food is pempe which is basically fish cake but served in umpteen number of ways. Diversity aside, there are common dishes throughout Indonesia such as Beef Rendang and Sate but each geographical region will give these dishes its own twist. Beef Rendang was a staple of my childhood, and it's beef simmered in coconut milk flavoured with coriander, galangal, lemon grass and a few other spices. Kaffir does a delicious version of this and serves it with nasi kuning (literally rice yellow) and a salad. The beef is tender and flavourful and the rice just flavoured with tumeric to add flavour but not overpower. It is a good compliment to the rendang. Salad in Indonesia is generally vegetables just quickly tossed in a dressing of vinegar, sugar, salt, Kaffir has mastered the blend and the side salad adds a coolness to the dish in case you find the rendang too spicy.
The official ""salad"" of Indonesia is a variety of vegetables with possibly tofu, tempeh, hard boiled eggs,  all tossed with a peanut sauce and topped with deep fried fish/shrimp crackers, The dish is called Gado Gado which really just means mix-up. This is as close to salad with dressing as you will get. The vegetables will vary from region to region but at Kaffir it is shredded cabbage and other fresh vegetables with baked tofu and tempeh.
If you have never tasted Indonesian food I recommend the Beef Rendang and Gado-Gado as a good place to start. If you are into spicy hot then make sure you ask for a side of home-made sambal (chilli sauce). Kaffir's sambal has a quick hit of spicyness that leads to a slow sensuous burn so be careful when trying it, it is spicy.
Prices are extremely reasonable, my take-out of Beef Rendang in the photo was $10 including GST. The market is only open from Thursday to Sunday. There is a small but good assortment of vendors from organic meats and vegetables to artisanal products and an interesting variety of foods such as Sushi, mexican, organic soups, asian fusion, indonesian and east indian to name a few.",2014-07-18 14:31:08

^that was my initial feeling prior to dining at the highly anticipated Zin burger. I dined here opening week, and again three days ago as a second chance in hopes the kinks would be worked out. Not so much. 

The servers on both occasions seemed unfamiliar with the menu specifics and lacked the confidence and personality I am used to from the other Fox Concepts. 

Both visits I ordered the same thing....sweet potato fries and the garden vegetable salad. The fries keep this review afloat. They are perfectly crisp, and the dipping sauce is nothing you would expect but everything you would want. Yum. Order two servings. 

The garden vegetable salad has all the makings of a vegetarians dream, with the added bonus of the almighty quinoa to boost the protein. Too bad they DRENCH it in salad dressing. I had to actually spit it out because the dressing was so potent. Pools of it in the bowl and the spinach looked like seaweed from being so wet. I asked to have another one with out the dressing and it took them 25 minutes to bring the new one. The manager didn't verbally address me, or the soup....I mean, salad.

Decor does seem to be quite nice and modern, but the space was not used very well. There was a huge bar in the middle, a couple tables towards the windows, and then a cramped area in the back with tables. Not as much seating as there could have been, but it made due. The ambiance was way darker than it needed to be, as everything inside seemed to be decorated in black and the lights were super dim. 

The food was reminiscent of a night market, with their skewers and snacking options. However, everything seemed only half thought out. All the skewers we ordered tasted about the same and were just about mediocre at best. The Chicken Knuckles were unevenly seasoned as well, so only half of my skewer had any taste. The Ramen was the only thing that seemed to be like a meal, but the portion was very small, and definitely didn't fill me up like other ramen places. The noodles didn't have much chewiness to them, and the soup base was average.
With a look at the menu, it seemed more like the food here was catered towards snacking rather than a meal, but not worth the price they asked for. 

The service was okay overall. All the girls here seemed to have a specific kind of look, which I won't go into detail. You can go see for yourself. They did seem quite friendly when they came to the table though.

I wasn't sure to try.. From the outside there some Arabic signage that threw me off I dunno.. Inside it didnt look like the typical diner shop. Well I was here so no turning back ..I am going to check this out. 

So I walked in and said hello and looked up at the menu hand written on a white dry erase board ..theres a few choices of burgers from the menu. Junior, Chef, and Super. One thing they advertise is that they use fresh meat not frozen. Cool. Having fresh meat is the one thing that compelled me to stay.

I asked the guy whats the difference between the burgers? He said it's the size of the patty. (noticed just after he said that the weights of the burgers were written in grams) I went with the Chef.

Fast forward the Verdict.. It's a really good burger. The meat is a fresh handmade patty. It is grilled slowly and seasoned with salt, pepper and perhaps garlic powder.

They use a sesame and poppyseed kaiser to house this whopper. It stays together and it's not too bulky to hold.

Try some of the special garlic sauce .. Taste like garlic purée and mayonnaise
Goes very well if you'd like to try something different. 

Fries and onion rings are frozen variety.. Didn't try them but the owner got a little huffy when I asked about them.. :)",2012-01-27 04:31:02

I know it's a horrible cliche` but when you enter an ethnic cuisine resturant and hear the customers AND the wait staff speaking the language of the cuisine ... you KNOW it's gonna be good!! 

I've been going to El Mesquite for nearly 10 years. The servers have been there forever and I think are related to one another. 

When you first enter you see some sterotypical posters on brightly painted walls and cutsey mexican pottery and plants. The resturant used to be only one room and has since expanded to two rooms. Another sign that a place is good! :) You are expected to seat yourself and will wait a minute or two before a bowl of paprika dusted toritilla chips that are served with TOXIC hot sauce!! Man it's killer!! but sooo good!! Just sprinkle some salt on it and ask for water and power through it!! Trust me! It'll get sweet after a bowl or two!! and when it does... MAN! that's good eatin!!

I like the two eggs with beans and tortillas with a side order of fried potatos! it's the best vegetarian breakfast on the south side! For lunch, a yummy burrito will do! And for dinner, the combination dinners are KING! The beans a lil runny, but when mixed with the rice, are AMAZING!! I like their iced tea, it's very dark, almost like sun tea. and the cups are huge! 

And every meal is under $10! who can beat that?? Look out for the daily specials! they're rarely on the menu and are usually indulgences of a cook that gets bored easily! LOL! Today's was Pezole with fresh Pan. 

One of the things that can be a little confusing is that the servers rarely give you a check. It's up to the diner to go to the back cashier register and pay. Usually, that's when the diner is told what the total is. I belive this is done as to not rush the patrons out of the resturant, which is something I appreciate. 

When you're on the south side and want something a little off the beaten path and like leiserly meals served rocket fast and with love super hot suce all for under 10 bucks a pop this is TOTALLY the place for you!! Seat yourself, order water and sweat while u dare to enjoy the salsa! It'll only take a second as your food will be ready in a flash!",2008-02-21 00:46:15

Corn on a cob is a buttery and creamy favour (contains real butter) while the other is more light and refreshing.

The scents and flavour they have in body lotions, body creams, bath washes and more are incredible!

From what I have counted in the store the last time I was in there, they must have at least 20 different options per season. This is wonderful because everyone likes different scents and enjoy various collections from this store.

These scents are my absolutely favourites:

- Country Apple
- Juniper Breeze
- Exotic Coconut
- Mango Mandarin
- Cucumber Melon
- Irresistible Apple
- Pearberry
- Warm Vanilla Sugar
- Wild Honeysuckle

BUT all of the scents are wonderful! 

To find your personal favourites, store is equipped with tons of tester bottles for you to smell and try on your skin.


And let's not forget the SALES and AMAZING DEALS!

Throught the year, they always seem to have the BUY 6 ITEMS FOR $30!!!

A few times a year, they discontinue some scents but it is amazing because they sell the leftover items from $3 to $6 per item!

As for the home products, such as candles and aromatherapy, they have HUGE candles that smell delicious that cost around $6.

Seemed like the consensus was, good food, god awful service. Since I was running out of AYCE options,  I finally decided to try it at around 11:30am on a weekend, which is always a great time to avoid crowds in places like this so that I can focus solely on the food. When I got in, I got immediately greeted with a frown asking how big our party was. For the place to be less than half occupied at that time, I could imagine how terrible things could be if the servers had to do some actual work during rush hour. Everything was smooth sailing after we got our seats so no complaints for me so far.

First observation,  the selection is slightly more diverse than what I'm used to. They have ramen in the AYCE  menu which I have not seen anywhere.  It obviously wasn't great ramen but just having it in the menu makes me give them my thumbs up. The sushi selection was pretty standard and was pretty much the same as in any other AYCE. Seriously, how much fish quality can you get for a $15 buffet!?

I ended up ordering some grilled squid, fried salmon belly, oyakudon, and a lot more items that weren't sushi. This is probably the restaurant where I had the least number of sushi orders just because they had other stuff that seemed interesting. The food was good, not amazing, but that's pretty much the best I can expect from a sushi buffet.

Amaretto sour was really good and my dining partner's seemed to really enjoy the beer and wine offerings on the menu.

A lot of things on the menu peaked our interest so we opted to get a few ""small bites"" and a pizza to share.

Ahi Tuna Tartar Taco - meh, there was supposed to be wasabi in this dish somewhere but it just wound up being a little bland and messy.

Crispy Duck Confit Nuggets with curry aioli - best thing we ate outside of dessert, the curry aioli was really nice, but I couldn't distinguish a very ""ducky"" taste, they could have been chicken nuggets for all I knew!

Lake Erie Creamery Goat Cheese cake - this was quite nice as well, but a little too small even for a ""small bite"", very difficult to share but the flavors were all in the right place.

Crab Cake - not bad, mustard aioli (they like using that stuff a lot here) was good, but the crab cake was kind of ""fishy"" tasting, not sure if they used the canned variety or fresh, but it was lacking a little bit.  The crust was nice on it though, well cooked.

Lobster crust - basically a thin-crust pizza with cheese on it and one lobster chunk per slice.....there was supposed to be leek and spinach in this thing too but I didn't catch one glimpse of any green.  It was ok, definitely nothing to write home about.  We packaged up the two slices left over and were going to take it home but it started smelling up the car so we just chucked it out after driving for a couple of miles.

Dessert - got some kind of peanut-chocolate thingy that was really good, but you can't really mess up that flavor combination even if you try  ;o)

The questionables:

1.  Service was good, perhaps a little ""too"" good.  Our friends were still working on their fries near the end of the meal and we literally had about 5 separate people come over and try and snatch the plate out from under them, hands off people!  There are easy signs to watch for to let you know when people are done eating, learn them!!

2.  The menu with their ""bites"", ""small plates"" and ""feasts"" seems awfully similar to the Greenhouse Tavern's ""firsts"", ""seconds"" and ""thirds""......it seems like they tried ripping off the menu concept, but they didn't really succeed with the execution.

I might come back and try their burgers as our friends (who both got the burger) really enjoyed their meals and the couple fries I scooped off their plate were pretty tasty.  The cheese board that a couple of ladies at the bar ordered also looked really nice.  So, deserving of a second chance, but I'll definitely be less adventurous in what I order next time.",2011-05-11 16:34:36

however, on the return tour, we swung by and had a good time.

it definitely is a renovated house, cause this place is HUGE! several floors, a lot of space, even a back patio drinking area! nothing like outdoor drinking with good music playing - Rob Zombie, Stone Temple Pilots, Iron Maiden, and more.

decent selection of beers, and they were inexpensive. definitely reminded me of a frat house so far as layout, with the atmosphere of a dive bar. 

random sampling of the crowd included
- three guys who are apparently in a band called ""Shit N Dales"". they were dressed as the Blue, Green, and Pink Rangers from ""Power Rangers"".
- they were sitting with a girl who kept yelling out the C-word
- there was also a crew of tattooed and pierced punks

overall, not a great spot, but an electronic jukebox, friendly bartenders, several pool tables, and a young, college-age crowd make this a decent place to either start the night or wind it down.

Spoiler alert: just like Town Square, Tivoli Village doesn't have any good places to dine. In fact, Tivoli might be one of the larger development failures in recent years in Las Vegas. I found nothing good at Bottles & Burgers which recently closed, and I don't think anyone in town could tell you the name of another restaurant there. Now we welcome Poppy Den, the latest restaurant to open in this cursed shopping area. This place is brought to us by Chef Angelo Sosa from Top Chef D.C. and Top Chef All Stars which really means nothing to me as I don't watch any of those. Still, with those credentials it promised maybe something good. Right?

After waiting over 20 minutes for our table to be ready even with a reservation, we were seated directly next to the bathrooms which made for a high traffic, slightly annoying location. The booths are incredibly awkward; they fit 3 people comfortably, but for a party of 4 they're forced to place a chair outside of it in the circulation area. The space is also incredibly loud as there are no soft surfaces anywhere, so if you're there on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner, be prepared to shout. There's a bar at the front that seats maybe 10 people, those crappy booths along the left side, and a bunch of loose tables filling the rest of the space. There's some sort of upstairs area that wasn't opened yet at the time of my visit, not sure what it'll be and I didn't ask.

The Poppy Burger that I came for is based on his Bibimbap Burger which was voted the Greatest Burger in America by Eater in 2011 you can read more about it here. I was hoping that the burger which was based on something with such an acclaimed title would represent a little more. The four of us ordered almost identical burgers, but what came out were four distinctly different burgers. First of all, look at the insane amount of lettuce that was placed in my girlfriend's burger, I have no idea why any chef thought this looked ok enough to send out. Two of our burgers were ordered medium rare and two of them medium, yet none of them looked similar to each other and my unevenly cooked medium-rare burger was cooked a bit more than that in spots. This was a great way to test the restaurant's consistency, which in this case was a total failure. Also, if you clicked on that link above to see the original burger this is based on, this one looks nothing like it.

As for my burger, the meat to bun ratio was completely off as there was way too much bun. The bun was grilled and actually very tasty with great sesame flavor, but was way too big and fell apart. The meat had ok flavor, but nothing great. It was charred well on the outside but that char didn't really have standout flavor. The pickles had really good flavor, but the egg and sriracha weren't that noticeable. This was incredibly messy, and the plate they give you is completely flat and makes for a very risky meal. Napkins had to be put in place as a dam to stop juices and sauce from spreading onto the table and eventually us. Overall this burger was a total failure in general, and ten-fold if you know what it's based on or compare it to other Asian themed burgers I often speak highly about. After about three bites I actually spoke out a simple ""nope"" in a response to no one's question at the table. 

The fries looked and tasted almost like McDonald's upon first bite. They didn't have great flavor, but were cooked ok. The salts and whatever seasonings on it were present but not all that noticeable. The kimcheese sauce was gritty, flavorless and not really that great either, and I longed for ketchup most of the time. If you do like this kimcheese sauce when it comes out, eat it quickly because as it cools it becomes really gritty and nasty.

Between the less than stellar appetizers, and absolute failure of a burger, I can't say I'll make my way back here to try anything else. I love Asian food, and the menu certainly has plenty of great sounding items that would normally bring me back, but not in this case. The burger with fries is $13, which would possibly be acceptable if this was good. Our meal for four with a couple drinks, two appetizers and four burgers came to $120, which is way too much for how unhappy I was walking out. While the restaurant was very full the night we were there, I fully chalk that up to the fact that it's a brand new 'hot' place, and don't expect the lack of draw that Tivoli has to bring anyone to it, just like the rest of the places there. If Chef Sosa truly wants to make a great Asian themed burger, he should go down the street to Bachi and take notes on the proper size of a bun, how to form a patty, and how to apply your toppings. Until then, don't bother coming here.",2013-01-14 23:41:45

My relationship with the finer things in life is one that either just happens because of the uniqueness of my job (being a magician has its advantages) or results from the shortcuts I happen to know.  The membership to the ""ladies who spa"" club is one that belongs to the latter category.  I don't go to Vegas spa to receive the various world-class treatments that are equally world-class in price.  I get a day pass with my best girlfriends and use the facility.  We get to enjoy a dose of indulgence without really burning a wallet hole for it.  Vegas is the perfect place to do this, with its abundance in high end spas that even allow day passes.

I've been to my share of interesting amenities that spa facilities offer in Vegas: Aria has hot stone beds and a shio salt room, Encore has waterfall showers and silk-lined robes, Venetian has a tropical rainshower experience.  It's difficult for me to get impressed, which is why I was not, at the Sahra Spa in Cosmopolitan, which means Sahra should probably get four stars in most standards, but not when you compare to the rest of Vegas.

The staff is very nice and attentive.  The entrance with the high fountain is distinctive.  The gym is well-equipped and divided into manageable sections.  But it's relatively small overall; there aren't any features that really separate Sahra from the rest.  It's a nice enough place to spend the day.  The tea selection is nice.  The granola is nice.  The cool mist room is nice.  

Next time when I'm looking for special instead of nice, I may try spending money on a treatment, which is 20 percent off for locals on weekdays.  If it's more than nice, I'll write a review update.",2011-01-30 07:02:04

I don't like smoky casinos and I did not miss the clanging and jangling machine noise that I try so hard to ignore in the other Strip casino hotels.  The Trump is right across the street from Nordstroms in Fashion Show mall and kitty corner to the Wynn, which is convenient for all the shopping and dining in which one may desire to partake during one's stay. 

All staff members with whom we interacted were super friendly and helpful.  Our king suite was on the 53rd floor and had a great view of the Strip and surrounding mountains.  The suite was immaculate and the bed was comfortable.

Each fish has their own garnish, their own sauce....absolutely stunning to the eye. l can't pick a favorite, everything we had was our favorite. Gotta try the salmon sashimi with truffle vinaigrette!!!!!! OMG! The couple next to us had the abalone prepared two ways and it was absolutely stunning. all of their plates have such great beauty and attention to detail. Next time i want to get the live lobster, it comes with raw lobster tail sashimi in shell and also lobster nigiri with warm miso butter, mmmmmmmm....We will absolutely be back and sing high praises to all of our friends!",2013-09-11 05:44:29

It was Summerlicious 2015 and today was the last day of the event.  I was craving Spanish food but I didn't want us to spend $$$.  Midi Bistro was a good choice bcoz it was close to our place and their prix-fixe menu for dinner was only $25.  
We had
- Salad Midi that came with smoked duck.  The salad was a regular dish but came with duck. That is a good thing for someone who likes duck and doesn't want to pay much.
- Provençal Escargot with sauté mushrooms.   It came with two slices of garlic bread. The sauce was little bit salty but it was good with bread.  This was my first time having snails!  It tasted like mussel. Interesting!  Oh! And I counted it..there were four snails in the dish haha :D  I like it though.
- Seafood pasta.  At first I wanted to have Seafood Risotto but I changed my mind.  I felt like having pasta today :) The fettuccine and vodka sauce was tasty but the size of mussel made me disappointed.  They were very tiny!  You can't even see the mussel inside except the shell (--"") This must be because of the special price on Summerlicious I assume. However, Shrimp and Scallop were ok :) In average it was good.
- Faux-filet grille.  The steak came in garlic vermouth sauce and sun dried tomato butter.     I personally don't eat beef at all so I can't really tell how steak is.  The opinion was based on my husband.  He ordered medium for the steak.  He said it was ok.
- Vanilla cream brulle and Peach with vanilla ice cream. They were our desserts. 

Service
- Only one server took care of the whole restaurant.  I'm not sure if it's normal here or they are short of staff.  However, she did a good job.  She knew how to handle it.

The restaurant 
- The restaurant is small size.  The tables are very close together.  It's cramped. Customers definitely need reservations ahead of time.",2015-08-26 05:50:45

For our food options, we had Tartar de Carne, Queso Frito, Patatas Bravas, and a small plate of Paella de Pollo. Each was brought out individually, so we were able to savor each dish before moving onto the next. I especially liked the queso frito and the paella, but everything was delicious. This was plenty of food for two people. We probably could even have skipped one of the smaller plates, since the paella is pretty big and very filling. For dessert, I had a Baines Pacharan Chocolate (Spanish Grappa) and the Flores con Miel. Both were wonderful!

V07-Fw8nQqiBEtljbrMrsg,r98FaAOAoJDCPp384XpcYA,-WVF5DKZeEWlMK8Cucto-A,4,9,4,6,"What a pleasant surprise!!

Here's the deal: I was apprehensive about going to Savoy. The prices are on the high end, there's no doubt about that. There's a recommended dress code, and the website describes the restaurant as being inspired by high-end dining establishments in cities far bigger than our little 'Burgh.

So these are fancy things. And, well, I'm just not that fancy of a broad. I was a little apprehensive that I was going to be way out of place at a fancy restaurant.

But once you're in the doors, you're treated like a regular, even if it's your first visit. Yes, Savoy is classy, swanky, and as fancy as a 'get on the list months in advance' New York restaurant, but in no way is it pretentious. From the friendly hostess at the front to the excellent attention from our server and assistant server to the managers strolling through and chatting with patrons, this place has service down to an art form.

We went on Monday night, which is Jazz Night, and you should too. Great music while you enjoy your food and beverages - who can argue with that?

We started with the fried calamari and shrimp plate. This could have easily fed 3 or 4 people (and yet the two of us managed to plow through it somehow, mostly because we are foodie troopers, I guess). The breading was so light and crispy, and it came with a little dish of sun-dried tomato horseradish cream sauce that was heavenly.

For entrees, my husband got the shrimp and grits (because he just cannot pass that up on a menu). This dish was stacked: andouille sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, and scallions on top of the grits, and all the flavors worked together. Very savory and creamy and filling all at once.

For my entree, I got the pork chop (because I just cannot pass up a pork chop on a menu). The house preparation is 'medium well,' which is waaaay more well done than I ever order my meat (yes, even pork), but I decided to trust the chef and go for it. That proved to be a good decision: there was nothing tough about this pork at all. It was super juicy and accompanied by a sweet potato puree, mushroom ragout, sauteed kale & arugula, and little balls of apples. So very, very good.

Throughout dinner, we also had baskets of bread delivered to the table. There are several different varieties: olive, rosemary, little sweet buns, all accompanied by olive oil & balsamic for dipping. We enjoyed wine with our meals, as well as the fabulous sounds of Roger Humphries and his band the RH Factor, the featured band for Jazz Night.

Service was excellent: never was a water glass empty, never did a finished plate linger on the table. All of our questions about the menu were answered by our server Jared, and he was prompt, attentive, and friendly.

The only negative I could find about Savoy is that yes, it is a little on the pricey side, and (brace yourselves) they make their Cosmopolitans with triple sec. Yes, this may seem a minor detail to some, but it is one of the Seven Deadly Foodie Sins According To Fox. And I wouldn't have minded seeing some bourbon on the spirits menu for after-dinner. Lucky for me, there was a solid selection of wines to choose from (both by the bottle and by the glass, as well as a tawny port for dessert), so I didn't have to worry if the spirits menu wasn't right for me.

So, triple-sec-related-sins aside, Savoy is the real thing. Great food, great service, great wine, great atmosphere, and great music on Jazz Night (complete with middle-aged couples getting up and dancing, the best!). With an option like this, there's no excuse for not going out on a Monday!",2015-01-09 18:11:49

The best way to describe Choolaah to those who may be unfamiliar is ""Chipotle, but for Indian food."" While this is not a perfect comparison, it paints a picture. You can create a bowl, a salad, a wrap, etc. They also have samosas and other options for nibbles. 

On my very first visit, I ordered the Choolaah salad topped with veggies and tofu. The Choolaah salad was very impressive for a fast-casual restaurant concept. In addition to the usual lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers, there were also golden raisins and picked onions on top. The addition of the veggies and tofu turned that salad into quite a lot of satisfying food. I would've loved some more greens to make it feel more like a salad, but honestly, complaining that a salad was too hearty is not really a complaint at all. I topped my salad with the Choolaah ranch, which packed the perfect amount of heat. However, there was a lot of flavor in that salad, so the dressing was barely necessary--just a nice bonus.

The samosas were yummy, but I have had better. I dipped them in the Choolaah Fire sauce for a delicious kick. Actually, one of my favorite parts about Choolaah was the available additions--a variety of sauces, chopped red onions, peppers, and lemon wedges were provided to add to any dish.

At the end of the day, you can get a delicious plate of food at Choolaah. The naan is bomb, the flavors are bold, and the concept is very strong overall. Try the black lentil masala for something a little different, and be sure to add that Choolaah Fire sauce to any and all things.",2018-04-27 01:05:18

We walked in and were greeted by some friendly faces and were instructed how the process works. You order first from the bar at the entrance [you drinks as well], and then your seated to wait for your order to arrive. This reminds me of the pubs in England that I've been to.

We had ordered many different items to get a taste of all the different varieties of dishes on their menus.

This is where I was a little confused with the menu sported asian fare. It didn't really fit the theme of the restaurant, but we ordered anyways just see to see what was unique and different.

The Charcuterie platter was great. The Crunchy Deviled eggs was also a favorite, I personally liked the Tempura French Green Beans, The blackened chicken sliders was another hit! The Ahi tartar did well and the Fish and chips were crunchy and light.

The Teriyaki Skewers seemed to do alright, the dressing was hit and miss, perhaps a more ""brighter"" and ""lighter"" might do well with the choice of spring greens.

Overall, the staff was friendly, service was quick, and the atmosphere was perfect for such an occasion!

If you're looking for something different from all the other places on Fremont street, this place does stand out! Enjoy some good drinks, a friendly atmosphere, and some good food. I didn't get to try the bangers and mash, But I did see it at another table and it did look epic!

Have a great time! Cheers!

As I said in my review of that event, most Calgarians are not in fact real cowboys... And in the art of pretending, we need to search out the real, authentic Cowboy gear. 

Don't get me wrong: Lammle's is the real deal and has plenty of locations in the outliers of Calgary and Alberta to prove it. But this location is meant for business people and tourists.

What that does mean is excellent service. I came by in off season, when I needed some clothes for a western themed office party. The service I got was prompt and friendly, and I got all the pieces I needed to fill in the blanks of my outfit. There were tons of hats in different shapes, sizes and price points, and tons of flannel for men and women (denim too, but I didn't look at that). 

There were lots of Cowboy boots: walls of them, all made of leather, all really quite expensive. If I'm paying $300 for boots, it's going to be for boots I wear more than two weeks of the year. They also had leather belts and tons of hilarious belt buckles, and to finish it all off, fake sheriff badges for the lawmaker in all of us.",2009-11-29 04:14:24

74t6_RIdoHeHvLD0vlKOQA,renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,LOWn1xi9PfG2kxrUuC21nA,5,7,3,5,"A few months ago, I saw a video on Facebook about Great Harvest.  I was intrigued, and being the carb lover that I am, I decided to have a Yelp book club meeting here. 

Great Harvest has a really amazing selection of breads, sandwiches, sweet treats, and drinks.  They have a daily bread selection, and also a different specialty bread for each day of the week.  

When we came in on Saturday, we saw the beautiful bread tray, and were offered a sample of whatever we wanted.  
We tried the lemon bar, the challah bread, the pumpkin bread, and the dakota.  
Each different bread (and bar)  was mosit, delicious, and soft.  the dakota had a crunchy crust, and was a thick, dense bread that was absolutely delightful.  

For our meals, we tried: 
The Roast Beef chimichurri:  Roast beef, Swiss cheese, Chimichurri sauce, red onion, lettuce and tomato on Honey Whole Wheat Bread
Clam Chowder, served with cheddar garlic loaf.

The sandwich was amazing.  My husband and I split it, and split a medium chowder, and that was definitely a filling meal.  The roast beef was delicious, there were plenty of toppings, and the honey whole wheat was soft, but didn't get soggy.  Loved the chimichurri too, it had just a tiny little kick to it that was wonderful.

The clam chowder was delicious.  Very flavorful.  Paired with the cheddar garlic bread, we were very happy,  let me tell you.

We ended up purchasing a loaf of the cheddar garlic bread.  It was too good to pass up, and for $7.95, there's a lot of bread there.  I want to make grilled cheeses out of it tonight!!

Also...the salted caramel cookie?  To die for.  Chewy.  Sweet.  Salty.  Perfection.

Can I talk about service?  So nice!  The young man and the lady that helped us were both super friendly and super nice.  My sandwich took a little time to come out, but I'm not mad.  The quality of the food, and the friendly service was more than enough to compensate for a little wait.  And it wasn't even that long of a wait anyway.  

Great Harvest also sells apple butter, syrups, jams, and other goodies.  

All in all, this was a great visit.  
I'm going back tomorrow to try their Autumn apple loaf!!  I can't wait!!",2017-10-16 14:03:55

I decided I wanted ice cream for dinner (I'm totally okay with this occasional meal replacement). So if I was going to have ice cream for dinner I wanted to make it worth it by getting a sundae. I looked to my Yelp app and Sweet Republic popped up. The reviews were great and I kept seeing pictures of this delicious looking s'mores sundae. One of my loves in life is s'mores, so I was sold when I saw this. 

My husband and I drove on over, and I of course ordered the campfire s'more sundae. The sundae came in a delicious homemade waffle bowl, which was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I normally don't like to waste calories on waffle bowls because typically I'm not a huge fan, but I ate every single piece of this one. The Belgian chocolate ice cream had a dense cocoa flavor and was quite rich. It was topped with hot fudge and homemade whipped cream, along with the best part which was a large toasted marshmallow which they torched right in front of you. 

My husband ordered the Pecan Turtle with salted caramel ice cream, caramel sauce, butter pecans, hot fudge and whipped cream. This was equally delicious as mine although I only had one bite, neither of us were too into sharing on this one. I was nice enough to give him a few bites of my waffle bowl though.

I would highly recommend Sweet Republic, especially their sundaes in the waffle bowl, and if you're feeling guilty just have it for dinner instead. I was perfectly full and satisfied with this decision, and will definitely return.",2014-07-22 20:28:48

Yelp said it was on smithfield near 4th but It must have closed because all we found was a 7/11 and subway. We found Zorba's on the corner and considering how cold it was neither of us felt like walking to search for food.  

We stumbled in here after reading the outdoor menu mentioning specials. The hubby  ordered the buffalo chicken salad which is the special on Wednesdays. I went with the gyro salad which came with a side of pita bread. The hubby's salad was huge, topped with fries and plenty of chicken, not to mention lettuce. He choose balsamic dressing which I thought was weird but he enjoyed it. The fries were great, nice and hot while the chicken was mildly spicy but a little bit dry.

My salad was just as big but it was mostly lettuce. At first I thought they were a little scant on the lamb meat but  almost like the loaves of bread that Jesus fed to the hungry, it just kept showing up. I was a little disappointed at the quality of lettuce. I hate those big crunchy chunks that you find close the root, they are so bitter no matter how much dressing you use. 

So the reason I give this place only 3 stars is because of my salad. Crunchy bitter lettuce, gyro meat was a luke warm instead of hot which after 5 minutes made it cold because of the chilled dressing. Not to mention the dressing was rather bland and they didn't add enough to my huge salad so i ended up ordering more which cost 75 cents. The fact that I had to order more dressing even though it had little to no flavor was disappointing. 

There is enough seating in here but just some simple tables and chairs spread out, nothing fancy or worth taking pictures for. It's almost like a cheap cafeteria which I don't mind if the foods good but I wasn't impressed with my gyro meat or with the chicken on the salad. Sometimes places have an off day so I won't count this place out just yet.

I went with a family friend the other day, and she encouraged me try something new. I had wanted to order a hamburger because I'd been watching a ton of Gilmore Girls and they eat a burger in almost every single episode. So, I ordered the chicken cordon bleu skillet. It comes with potatoes on the bottom; chicken, ham, and cheese on top, with 2 eggs on the very top. I really wanted to break my egg yolk, but I was scared to what would happen to the taste of the food. I did get sourdough bread as my side which was not that sour. I prefer sourdough to be tangy.

We did order a banana nut muffin which is famous. It was pretty tasty, and I don't normally like bananas. It was delicious and warm! The potaotes tasted super yummy! They were flavorful and nice and crispy. I would definitely go back for the potatoes alone!",2014-12-08 00:20:17

I finally made the trip across town to check out HanshikTaco and wonder why I didn't try it sooner

Today I had the ""Nate"" dog and the Chicken taco.  Both were spot on delicious.  

The chicken taco -  Has really nice heat, maybe too hot for some, but nothing out of control.  The crunch from the kimchi adds excellent texture.  For those who aren't familiar with korean flavors, gochujang (red pepper paste) is used in many dishes, and has nice notes of salt, heat, and almost a garlic taste.  The kimchi (cabbage) used at Hanshik is  a mild and balanced approach to what can sometimes be quite sour.  

The ""Nate"" dog - The best hot dog I've had in Vegas!  No, this is not the Chicago dog some of you may know.  This delectable treat features many of the same flavors found in the tacos.  It was cooked perfectly, and featured that crisp snap that all the best hot dogs have.  

The owner, whose name I forget, but am dubbing Onyoung Money, is a solid guy.  We spoke for a while, and it became obvious that this is someone who takes a lot of pride in his product.  Onyoung Money is a 5 star guy, running a seriously spectacular joint on wheels.

Like seriously, you can knock down some beers, and especially mixed beverages without a dent in your wallet. 

The seating is almost exclusively long tables, with comfy booths lining one wall. When weather permits, the outdoor canopy is pretty neat, especially since all the couches are new. 

They pride themselves in a full menu as well, and while yours truly hasn't had it yet, I've noticed they do appear to partake in Taco Tuesday, where you can get your hands on some hard-shelled snacks. Overall, I like it a lot...it's a dive that doesn't realize it's a dive. My only concern is the bit of an identity crisis it's having. The sound system is weak, it's too brightly lit, and there's virtually no standing room, so it feels like a straight up restaurant despite the jukebox and billiard tables.

The food is very fresh and tastes very authentic. Compared to any of the (many) other take-out burrito joints in the area (Burrito Boyz, Burrito Bandidos, Mucho Burrito etc.) this place has real Mexican ingredients and recipes being executed all day long - you can see the women making the meats, salas and guacamole in the store. 

I give them less stars because the actual burritos are sub par. They over load them and then bake them as opposed to putting them on a flat-top or a press. I find this compromises the abilities of the tortilla and more often than not it rips. 

The naked burrito, or burrito bowl however is VERY good. I prefer the chicken tinga which is shredded chicken in a chipotle/adobo type sauce. It comes on top of rice and your choice of beans (black or refried pinto), and with cheese, salsas, guacamole, sour cream, burrito sauce, and cilantro. They also serve a generous handful of tortilla chips on the side which is nice for dipping.

But it does exist in north Phoenix in where else but a strip mall. It's called naked for a reason since the sauce isn't smothering the meat like in most smokehouses. No, there's innate trust in the quality and flavor of the meat presented here, whether it's pulled chicken, sliced turkey, hot links, or the two that I selected, Pulled Pork and Chopped Brisket (photo: http://bit.ly/2eOADSp). For $14, you get a Platter, or more accurately, a tray of two meats, two sides and a cornbread muffin (photo: http://bit.ly/2eOxhix).

My choices for the sides were Mac & Cheese, the melty kind that isn't baked the old-fashioned way, and the Veg of the Day, which were Grilled Broccoli Florets (photo: http://bit.ly/2duVIM1). Both were delicious but not more than the plentiful portions of brisket and pork which benefited from splooges of barbecue sauce and mustard. But it was on my terms. My one disappointment was just the size of the cornbread muffin which was uncharacteristically mini-size, so I stocked up on the sliced pickles as compensation. By the time I get to Phoenix next time, she may not be rising, but I'll be eating some 'cue naked. Not me...the meat. That would be so wrong...like a day without sunshine.

The restaurant was nicely decorated, although it seemed like we were not seated at the original table that had been booked (we purposely had booked a table near to another couple of friends, but ended up two rooms away) and the staff appeared to be overwhelmed with the volume of patrons. Once seated, our waitress was very friendly and explained to us the Valentine's Day dinner special for $65. We had already booked based off of the Valentine's event online, so our decision to go ahead with the dinner special was easy. Each course was delicious! We began with the stuffed artichokes and kibbah appetizers, which were perfect starters to the meal - one cold and one hot appetizer. Our entrees were a shrimp saute and chicken kebab in a clay pot with vegetables and rice. Very balanced and tasty! Finally, the tres leches cake dessert was beautiful and adorable! Heart shaped cake with a layer of jam, topped with a chocolate covered strawberry. It was a perfect end for the meal and was complimented very well by the Turkish coffee and tea we got.

Our only complaint about the meal was that we did not receive the champagne that had been advertised as part of the fixed price meal. It appeared no one in the back room who had the Valentine's dinner received champagne either, however when we were leaving, we passed the couple we originally planned to sit near, and saw they had received champagne. Not a huge deal, however it was slightly disappointing given that it had been promised as included in the price we paid.

Don't get me wrong, I laughed, and I was entertained, but I was kind of let down.  It's still worth going, but maybe I need to go on a non-holiday-ish day to get the full effect.  We went last night for black Friday - and I suppose I was hoping for a mix of guys and gals - but all eight players were fellas.  

It is not easy to be funny - especially when it's on the fly - so I give credit where credit's due, what these players do is not so simple.  That said, I would only give a thumbs up to about half of them - as the other half just didn't cut the mustard.

The seats weren't what I'd call comfortable - like straight from the auditorium from your elementary school that needed to be renovated back in the '80's.  The concessions were plentiful, and reasonably priced - so no complaints there.  The wait staff was courteous as well.  

I don't think it makes me a bad person to want more of an adult theme for the late night show either.  I think it's perfectly reasonable to do a family friendly show in the early evening - but then let the players act a little more tongue in cheek for the late night show - to satisfy those of us who prefer grown up humor.

I had a craving for pho, which I normally get from Superior Pho (The Best, hands down!), but didn't want to drive downtown.   I ordered spring rolls, the cabbage chicken salad and the deluxe pho.  My dining companion ordered the meat skewer trio and grilled chicken over noodles.  The spring rolls were just ok, a little bit mushy and not a lot of flavor.  The salad was pretty good, but kinda skimpy for the $9.95 price and the pho was a let-down.   The meatballs didn't have much texture, the beef wasn't appetizing, there were pieces of tendon (I think) in the soup, which was off-putting and finally the soup wasn't served steaming hot, therefore, by the time I finished the contents of the soup, the broth was lukewarm, murky and not very good.  The accompaniments (basil, bean sprouts, lime & jalapenos), were fresh, but I agree with other Yelp reviews that the small dish of siracha and hoisin, was insufficient, I would have expected a bottle of each on the table.

People's opinion of Red Lobster is usually hit or miss; either people love the food or they don't. Personally I love the food. Being a franchise this place will have food that tastes like any other Red Lobster, so service is what separates the restaurants.

Our baseball team goes every year to pig out on AYCE shrimp. With 9 people going, most of them eating all the shrimp they can, it can be pretty demanding on the waiters. Although we had to wait for about 30 mins to get a table because they don't take reservations, I'm willing to overlook that.

With such a large party, there were 2 waiters assigned to our table, and they kept the shrimp and refill drinks coming to the very end.  It even got to the point where they were bringing out shrimp dishes even if we didn't order them because they knew they would have to at some point. There were no unusually long waits in between shrimp deliveries and the food coming out was hot and fresh.

Approximately 825 shrimp later the feast was finished and a grand time was had by all.

It seemed like a really normal meal--we ordered our food, the lady was very brisk and snappy, as usual.

We sat down, and waited for our food to come out. My friend had ordered the fried pork chop and everything seemed normal... till she pulled a RAW PIECE OF PORK OUT OF HER PLATE. She was horrified because she had eaten some of it. 
This my dear was not ordinary slightly uncooked meat. This was completely raw--dripping, red, the whole shebang.

When she brought it back to the front, the lady took it and said they'd remake it for her.

When they brought it out, she was checking the meat to make sure it was cooked, and she reached under the rice, and PULLED OUT HALF OF THE UNEATEN RAW PORK.

The people didn't even give her a new bowl...they just put a new pork chop ontop of her plate, which had already touched all the raw meat and was all bacteria filled.
And pork isn't even one of those things that you can eat semi raw (like beef). Pork is hella dirty when it's not cooked. and not only did they send it out once uncooked, which is already unforgivable in my book, they sent it out TWICE knowing what was wrong with it.

By that point, I was fed up, and I went to talk to the lady. She agreed to make my friend a totally new dish, but when my friend asked for orange chicken, she said she'd have to pay extra -_________- Like seriously? You fed my friend raw pork TWICE.

We got a tower room on the 14th floor. Nice room, 2 queens, fridge, desk, small sofa, great view of south strip toward Stratosphere and beyond.
They have a decent happy special in the Parlor bar, 2 for 1 well drinks (of the same kind) and some beer specials too, as well as 75 cent chicken wings. We enjoyed a few cocktails and continued about our night of crazy Fremont St fun.

An employee we talked to the next day mentioned it was either the Commonwealth or a club called The Place which is around the corner. Seeing nothing going on at the Commonwealth that night and by the direction from which the sound came, we determined is was from The Place or somewhere east of the hotel. We're were on the 14th floor and could still hear the incessant thumping of bass beats till at least 3 to 4 am. This obviously isn't the El Cortez fault so it's kind of hard to knock the hotel, but it was really a drag. Everything else was great.
I've heard local media accounts of downtown residents complaining of the noise from all the clubs, concerts, stages, etc. and I now have sympathy for them.

We invited to the kitchen, before ordering, to see that offering there were in addition to the items on the menu. The ladies each chose a fish (sea bream and sea bass), and I chose Stuffed Peppers the other gentleman chose Lamb stewed in tomatoes.

We shared an appetizer of feta cheese and a couple of small plates of TREMENDOUS black and green olives. The bread was a high quality French type bread, not that wilted hastily toasted offering in other restaurants on the Danforth.

I had a Fish Soup before my main course and it delicious. Great broth, plenty of nice fish chunks, and a light pleasant taste....a real find.

The other gentleman had a green salad while the ladies shared a Horiatiki Salad. I taste both and found them both excellent. Finally a restaurant that does not bathe salad in oil.

My dish,  the stuffed peppers was succulent. The medley of rice and meat and the sweetest of the peppers really elevated this dish. The Sea Bass and Sea Bream were all exceptional, grilled and seasoned to perfection. Neither of the ladies eat fish heads it was a real bonus for me. The lamb was good but not great, and this started to provide a 'drag down' on a potential 5 star rating.

The ladies ordered an espresso each, as this really genuine Greek establishment does not have Greek coffee. They had very few desserts, just Tiramisu and Flan. This combined with the lamb got me to 4 stars. 

The place is much as Lauren described it. Its very homey, local with a lot of Greek dudes. On leaving my wife said she would happily come here once a week for fish. From Mrs. G. this is high accolades indeed.",2013-03-31 18:14:09

The day before Mothers Day, they offered a free drink to all mothers, a promotion I learned about via facebook. This very sweet gesture brought me in to sample their creative cafe cuisine, as well.

My Tree of Life pita was packed full of flavor. I usually believe any sandwich needs cheese, but I did not feel like this pita was missing anything! For $9.95, it was large and filling, and seemed to be made up of quality ingredients. I'm tempted to add on some marinated seitan next time for an additional $2.95. Healthy side salads are only $1.95 with a sandwich purchase, and served in an 8 oz. deli container.

The friendly barista encouraged me to sample a few side dishes and their raw vegan ""cheesecake."" My free Mothers Day beverage was the almond coconut blended, per his suggestion. Chewy bits of dates sweetened this creamy, vegan smoothie and reminded me of the date shakes served at China Ranch. I could drink another one of these right now.

Bathrooms down the hallway are simply labeled as ""the johns,"" and not separated for men and women. Just a note, as this confused me for a second before realizing the common entrance was for everyone.

ouVVFFcThbDa_ZnJGYZIeA,le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,2,6,5,4,"The wife and I continued to ""unlock our Monday"" at Beauty & Essex for dinner.  We had reservations for 9PM.  The place was jammed, literally and figuratively, when we got there.  Although I haven't been to the NYC original, Beauty & Essex's dining room, unsurprisingly, reminded me of a lot of some NYC restaurants where space is at a premium and tables and diners are squeezed into close quarters.  The noise level of the dining room was tinnitus inducing with thumping club music and a full house of diners practically screaming at each other trying to be heard over the unnecessarily loud music in a room with hard floors and walls unadorned with anything that could be considered sound dampening.  They only sound absorbing materials in the house were basically the diners and service staff.  I'm not too old that I can't or don't appreciate loud music and energetic crowds, but Beauty & Essex seemed to amp it up to an almost intolerable volume.  Not surprisingly, the combination of close quarters and cacophony resulted in service slips.  I noticed multiple cases where food runners delivered dishes to incorrect tables.  In fact, one of our dishes was delivered to a party two tables down from us.

We were more in need of food than more drinks, so we passed on selections from Beauty & Essex's appealing list of cocktails.  For our food, we shared orders of the Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche ($15), Roasted Bone Marrow ($19), and Garganelli ($22).  The Roasted Bone Marrow was a nicely sized portion of two big marrow-filled bones, which came with grilled bread and a rioja braised shallot marmalade as an accompaniment.  It was simple in its presentation, perfectly executed, and delicious.  On the other hand, the other two dishes were failures in presentation and/or execution.  The ceviche tasted all right with bright mango notes complementing the fresh salmon, but it was lacking in execution and presentation.  The knife work on the salmon appeared sloppy.  If you eat first with your eyes, then it was difficult to differentiate between what was salmon and what was mango in the dimly lit room based on sight.  Exacerbating the issues with the dish was that the salmon was drowned in its ""cooking"" liquid and spooned into what amounted to be three Tostito Scoops, which became soggy, losing any hint of crispness.  Perhaps this dish needed to be eaten immediately upon being served.  However, this was the item that had been delivered to the wrong table.  The Garganelli, topped with a sweet & spicy lamb Bolognese and whipped ricotta, while edible, was not enjoyable.  The pasta was overcooked and didn't taste much, if any, better than overcooked, store bought, dried pasta.  The Bolognese was all sweet and little spice, unless you equate saltiness to spiciness, so much so we had to ask our server what was the sweet component in the dish.  It was a balsamic glaze.  Nevertheless, the sauce had a cloyingly sweet component that overpowered everything else save for salt.  It wasn't good.  We left our Garganelli unfinished after only our initial of bites.  We probably should've sent it back, but didn't because we'd had enough.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  Maybe we caught them on an off night.  The staff all seemed personable, attentive, and eager to please.   Other diners seemed to be enjoying themselves.  For whatever reason, Beauty & Essex was a swing and a miss and the biggest dining disappointment of our trip.  That said, I'd definitely be willing to give it another try, if only for their cocktails.",2016-11-04 17:10:40

The biggest thing about this place is that it's in Mekong Plaza. I come here after eating at other restaurants. And if I wanted to, I can go to Taiwan Express next door to get boba too,

My friends like it here because they have the options of yogurt or boba. Their yogurt selection is really limited. They have decent variety of boba flavors. But if you don't see a flavor you want for boba, go next door and see if the other place has your flavor. If you want yogurt in Mekong Plaza, then this is your only option without driving elsewhere.

It's nice sitting around inside though. You could sit and chat with your friends for hours if you really wanted.",2013-09-23 04:31:40

BTW, this is the only time I've ever had the experience of someone sitting down with me and asking me questions in regards to the answers on my paperwork.. I believe that demonstrates absolute professionalism on her part to investigate further so she could provide the best service possible.

She went over EVERYTHING we were going to do that day. She was totally honest too explaining everyone experiences different results as everyone's skin is unique and responds to treatments differently and discussed possible complications as well as the likelihood of those complications arising. I didn't go in with an expectation as to what my skin would look like but I felt totally at ease with Summer.

The facial and peel was amazing! One of the most relaxing experiences I've had. Seriously I was fighting falling asleep I was so comfortable haha. She introduced me to various oils and I actually did experience a slight uplifting feeling in my mood and energy levels (which to be honest I always thought scented oils were kind of a hoopla and never thought about giving them a try). Never once did she make me feel self conscious about my skin issues I have a lot of post acne marks so I never let anyone see me without a thick coating of full coverage foundation. She actually recommended a few products that were more inexpensive and suitable for my budget which was really awesome of her (I'm 24 and have not yet established myself well enough to go out and spend hundreds on skincare.) I thought that was great she took that into consideration. She NEVER pushed her products on me and she discussed my skin's potential which made me get more excited about skin care rather than feeling like it were a lost cause. 


I was beyond impressed with the results. This woman knows what she's doing. She's hardworking, dedicated and extremely passionate about her craft and it shows. She also pretty much doubles herself as a life coach providing me with various tips and pieces of advice that could help my everyday way of life and health. I'm glad there are still people out there like Summer who truly love their job and really tries to make sure every client of hers walks away feeling like a million bucks.

Jennifer K posted a photo of their coffee with the words ""SUPER STRONG"" and I told myself I gotta try this place out.  The hours of operation are pretty limited closing at 5:30pm on weekdays and 6pm on weekends, the only time I can come here would be a weekend trudging through the crazy drivers in the plaza.

Was it worth it?  HELL YAH.

I got their Iced coffee with condensed milk with reduced sweetness.  They took their time to prepare it and it tasted creamier compared to the normal Pho places.  I think they used a different brand of condensed milk, I didn't see Carnation there.  The scent of the coffee is enough to open up your eyes before you even drink it.  The drink was cool to the body and you can feel any sleepiness go away along with having a slight sugar rush.

The drink isn't overpowering with a single flavor.  There's just the right amount of bitterness counteracting with the sweetness from the condensed milk that the feel of the drink flip flops in your mouth while providing a creamy base.  The chilled nature of the drink makes it go down smoothly... too smoothly in fact.

One mistake I did was to drink it too quickly.  Since it's just one shot of espresso I was left with more than 80% of the ice in the end.  I wonder if they can do a double espresso and have a larger cup.

The other thing we ordered out of curiosity is the Edible Planting.  When you look at it, it looks like a pot of soil with a plastic plant.  It's basically layers of Oreo, Coffee, Corn flakes, Condensed Milk and Ice Cream.  We got a small one which came in a cute plastic pot (which we are using for some real plants at home).  They give you a trowel shaped spoon and digging through the layers you don't get overloaded by any flavor.  It's a nice mix of bitter and sweet like the coffee with a hint of saltiness from the corn flakes.  It was a fun snack that I only got to try a few bites of as the rest was eaten by she-who-must-be-obeyed.

The assembly line is not too efficient though, but they take good care of the drink.  Since it was so good for me, I decided not to drop a star and they provided free wifi while we waited.

I would definitely come here again if I am masochistic enough to deal with the drive and parking in this crazy plaza.",2016-07-30 23:22:17

Do not go in here unless you are prepared to buy boots.

Repeat: Do not go in to Lammle's unless you are prepared to buy boots. Because a very nice, but rather aggressive (but in a nice way!) saleslady will try to get you to buy boots. Any boots. And you will feel compelled to buy them because of her niceness.

Good thing being vegan gives me an easy out of this situation! No leather boots for me, even if I can get ""Hot Dang!"" stitched on the sides... which... TEMPTING.

Lammle's is a wall to wall Texas North emporium of everything cowboy, if, that cowboy owned the ranch and wasn't a mere ranchhand trying to scrape together a living so he could buy collar clasps. I didn't even know collar clasps existed, but now I feel like I kinda need them. The clothes are very Marty McFly as Clint Eastwood in BTTF3. 

Besides western wear, Lammle's also carries a lot of beautiful and unusual jewelry, both costume and slightly more refined. I picked up a very nice peacock pendant here.

MyWCzJni6WWfd2_BYZmHiQ,KeuwC8E1238SP6xyKpBM6w,Ns4tjgLfqR1qawGlNFROBA,3,8,2,5,"Listed by Get Out Mag as a hip noodle house (formally called sN Asian Kitchen), Asia is said to have a cool black/white/red decor motif with a sushi bar. The restaurant - described as cozy - features noodle dishes from Japan, China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. Also, there's live jazz music Friday and Saturday nights. 

So, ask yourself: Would that tempt you? It certainly did me, and at 7 p.m. on a Saturday, my sushi-lovin' friend and I met here. 

We were immediately shown to a corner booth and given menus. Our server was friendly, albeit a tad eccentric, which we didn't mind. Her quick, matter-of-fact manner was something we couldn't decide if we liked. But, that's okay. 

Our first challenge was to pick out our drinks. The wine list is HUGE. There's also specials they write on a big chalk board. Narrowing it down to a few selections took a few minutes... and my friend was disappointed to be told twice that they were out of the drink of her choice (including one of the sakes on the menu). Bummer. I went with the J Lohr Wildflower red blend. And I didn't like it. I told our server that I should have taken her suggestion and gotten the Writer's Block Zin and I was hoping I could send back the Wildflower. 

""You don't like it?""
""No, sorry. I don't.""
""That's okay. I hate it. It's so popular, though. I don't understand why.""

Uhm, good to know. For being honest about other wines, she certainly held her tongue when I placed my order. 

My friend and I split the Salmon Salad app, with fresh spinach and pine nuts. It was very tasty. The Salmon was tempura, but I didn't find it too fried to enjoy. 

We then shared the Best of Asia - 3 pieces each of yellow tail, tuna and salmon, lightly seared and flavored with garlic, paprika, ponzu and a jalapeno on top. HOT! I had two pieces and left the rest for my friend. 

The Big Buddha Roll, which we shared, was very, very tasty. It was a little spicy, but in that good way I enjoy. This roll was double wrapped with soy paper on the outside and had crab meat, avocado, cream cheese and salmon inside. YUM! 

About 3/4 of our way through dinner, the server brought out my new glass of wine. Uhm, ok. 

""Sorry, I totally forget.""
""But at least you remember,"" my friend remarked. 

As for the atmosphere, it can only be summed up this way: Airport. 

I got the feeling that if I walked out the front doors, I'd be inside an airport terminal, headed to whatever gate I needed to be at to make my flight. The interior of the place, like my friend pointed out, seemed to be the type of place that ""you cram things inside a space that don't really fit or belong."" Bingo! 

The sushi bar/kitchen takes up the bulk of the space, with a short sushi bar area to its immediate side. There's a few tables scattered about, as well as a few booths. The decor is red, black and white - Get Out was right about that. I just would never call this place cozy. They did turn down the lighting around 7:30 which helped immensely. 

As for the music, it was nice jazz. The trio set up in a corner and played a few songs. Sax, drums, guitar - what else do you need? On our way out, while the band was on break, we learned they weren't even a band... and that they just kind of set up and played in an impromptu style. Regardless, they were enjoyable. They didn't really fit the motif of the restaurant, tho. It was more of the ""airport restaurant trying to be a cool lounge with live music.""

When the bill came, I was pleased to see our server did not charge me for the glass of wine I sent back. I appreciated that. 

Yet, the bill was a bit too high for the type of service/experience my friend and I had here at Asia. $46 for 2 people? Ouch. Both the Buddha Roll and Best of Asia were $12 a piece (the former totally worth it; the latter not). The appetizer salad was $8. My friend's sake was $2 (bargain) and my glass of really great Zin (a new fave) was $9. All in all, it added up. But I definitely would not go back to throw down that kind of money at a place that reminded me of an airport restaurant. 

Also, while we were waiting for the server to run my card, I flicked with my forefinger what I thought was a piece of paper, though in my mind it looked like a tiny, tiny fly. Turns out the ""piece of paper"" sprouted legs and started to crawl across the table. IT WAS A BUG! Ew. Gross. 

This place has potential, but it'll need a real overhaul to entice me to come back. 

Redeeming traits:
*HUGE wine list (almost too big; it's hard to decide)
*Full bar with beer selections, including a couple Asian favorites
*Sake choices for cheap
*Big Buddha Roll that's one of the best rolls I've had - anywhere
*Live music - sure beats pop music blasting overhead
*Clean bathroom with a vibrant green scheme - with several men's magazines to flip through (Weird, eh?) and a pic of Audrey Hepburn on the wall",2008-04-28 18:07:02

Atmosphere 4/5: Nice atmosphere inside with some nice purple lightings. Quiet original for a middle eastern restaurant but I like it. If they could dim the light during the evening, we would feel more in a romantic restaurant than a cantina. It's just a personal preference.
Food 3.5/5: Food wasn't bad but it wasn't excellent as well. Let's say that I was maybe expecting something better and more flavorful. The food wasn't bad, it just fell tasteless sometimes. Presentation of the food was good but I was kinda disappointed that a restaurant that big doesn't make its own bread. That would make this place so much better and worth going. 
Service 3/5: Service was alright. The guy was nice and advised me on couple items. Not the most personable service I ever had but it was descent for a Persian restaurant. Let's just say that I experienced worst.

Overall rating is 3.5 and I am gonna give them a 3 stars because I felt a little bit disappointed after spending a total of $28 for an Entrée and a Sparkling Water.

Okay enough with my intro.......onto the food!  

Since my wife is an Izakaya newbie I didn't order many of the crazy dishes I'd normally such as ox tongue, chicken skin or other fishy North American ""not so used"" to dishes.  

The evening throw down was this:  

Gomae-  smaller portion but nice sauce and quite good.  3 / 5
Seaweed Salad-   great dressing fresh and light  3.5 / 5
Shimesaba-   smaller portion cuts of fish but nicely done.  3.5 / 5
Chicken yakitori skewers in a sour plum sauce-  yummy tender thigh pieces.  4 / 5
Takoyaki- On Osaka classic lightly doughy and good. Not as much tako meat more dough but good.  3 / 5
Vegetable Yakisoba- done with a nice bulldog tonkatsu sauce taste and flavourful  4 / 5
Vegetable Tempura- I've had better elsewhere. Crisp but batter could have been better 2.5 / 5

However, I am writing this review specifically for the Sunday brunch experience.  I never know they have a brunch menu until yesterday.  And there are very good choices.  I narrowed down to 3 items... and the winner was (drum roll please) REDNECK GARBAGE PLATE.

One star deduction for overly dark lighting.  I like to be able to see my food and napkin and there's more to romance than being dimly lit.  And the line in front of the single occupancy bathroom was a little disappointing, as were the uncomfortably hard chairs and the wait to get the bill.

After visiting a few times and having trouble with digestion, I had to be reminded of the difference between vegan and vegetarian.  

Vegan means no animal products - so no dairy or eggs.  Vegetarian means eggs, milk or cheese could still be in it.  I love eggs, but milk and cheese don't love me.  There is cream in the rice, cream in the nan, and all of their chicken is marinated in yogurt, so no chicken dishes for me.  

But most of the lamb dishes are non-dairy and roti is a wheat version of nan that has no milk or cream in the batter.  Problem solved, if you're lactose intolerant but like meat, don't order like a vegetarian.  Order like a vegan carnivore and you'll dine like a king.",2009-01-31 03:04:58

5.  On the water side of the park..it would be nice if dog owners would refrain from standing on the cement launching pad built so that dogs could run and jump off the end.  Often times people stand on the ramp for long periods of time, and quite frankly it temps the rest of us to let our dogs run down the ramp and knock your keester into the lake.  Little children shouldn't be standing out there either if they don't want to be knocked into the lake or knocked down...Dogs don't watch for humans, they just run.
6.  Note to Town of Gilbert...you created a beautiful park, please plant some more shade trees or put up more gazebos...the skimpy trees currently growing there aren't really great shade trees.
7.  If all owners supervise their dogs and are respectful of all the other guests and their dogs, it makes for a great day at the park.",2011-10-13 22:58:41

I'm sorry but ""owners"" should be inside and ready to open the doors well before 10am rolls around!

I really couldn't decide on a color, their nail polish wall is really uninspiring. I thought what the heck I'll give ""french Polish"" a try this time. 

The manicure station is very awkward and uncomfortable to sit at for one, as far as the actual manicure went it wasn't too bad until it was time for the massage which was completely sloppy and half assed. 

Polish, I should have known better than to go with a french, I just wasn't happy with it, it looked a little yellowish with way to thick of white and a few bubbles. To top it all off it didn't even last for one day, it was already chipping off that night!!

Now... if you're looking for a loud, fun, entertaining time and you're staying at Mandalay Bay... this is a pretty good option.  

But if you are looking for good food, a nice relaxing meal with a bit of flair and creativity....  and great margaritas... go to Border Grill.  

This place is pricey and the food is just ok... and it's loud so if you want to have a conversation you'll be yelling most of the time.

The chips and salsa...  chips were a little stale... but the salsas were fresh.  Really like the creamy tomatillo salsa... it was tart but had a kick all while being creamy.  

We ordered the ceviche to start along with a pitcher of Pacifico and a blackberry muddled margarita.

The margarita was ok... I've had better so I only ordered 1... you could barely tell there were any blackberries in it.

The ceviche was small... had good heat and flavor... the odd thing was that it had cucumbers in it... good thing I like cucumbers.

The pozole... very tasty and hearty.... We all shared this... If (big IF) I go back... I'd order this and a beer.  It was comfort food in a bowl.  So Good.

Dinner... 
My girlfriend ordered an Arugula Chicken salad (she's on a diet so her splurge was cocktails)... but the Arugula turned out to be Spinach... not a big deal... but they should have told us of the menu / ingredient change.
My entrée was the Harache?  ... flat steak grilled with a chimichurri sauce on top of what was supposed to be a crispy tortilla... it was actually a soggy flatbread... I didn't eat the flatbread tortilla... but the steak and chimichurri was Great!
Hubby got the taco plate... wasn't anything special.
GF's hubby got the flautas... they were big but he said they were dry inside and only ate half.

For the 4 of us... 2 pitchers of beer, 1 margarita and 2 vodka cocktails... (plus the food mentioned above)... our total was $205 including tax and tip.  IMO... overpriced for what we got... Although, I'm pretty sure the bar tab was more than our food tab since drink pricing on Strip tends to be high... so...

The laser process itself was never painful, just a few hot spots here and there. Waxing hurts much more! 

The result- amazing! While not 100% hair free, the area is very smooth, and what little hair remains is very thin and fine. While the price may seem steep, it ends up costing less than waxing, and with no ""grow out"" period and close to permanent results, I'm very pleased with it.

I love that Market Outlet offers discounts on perfectly good food that would otherwise have gone to waste. Shopping here is a winning situation for everyone involved, and at very little risk to the consumer. Of course be aware about the expiration dates on some of the goods inside, but remember that most things are super safe to consume well beyond the date posted. Things like crackers and cereal may not be as tasty if they've been out for a while, but the canned goods are almost definitely a go. Just use common sense.

The produce outside is also amazing, and I love it probably equally as much as the interior. In the summer, $1 cartons of strawberries (or a box for $6, if you plan to make ten strawberry pies) and blueberries are almost impossible to pass up. I tend to buy a lot of tomatoes, zucchini, and whatever other veggies and fruits happen to be offered that week. I've always wanted to buy one of their bucketful of peppers for $3, but never have had the space in my backpack, since I do my grocery shopping by bike. It's probably for the best - otherwise I'd end up with way more fresh vegetables than I can handle, even though I'd hardly have a dent made in my wallet. As with any produce, be sure to check berries for mold and vegetables for anything else suspicious, but I've never had more problems here than at Giant Eagle. I'd say their shelf-life is a tad shorter, but not by far.

My only complaint is that it is only open 8-5 M-Sat (7-5 on Sun), which means I can't stop by after work on weekdays for groceries, but I will always stop here on my weekend Strip trips.

I would highly encourage everyone to shop here. It's better for your wallet, for your health (since it encourages you to buy more fresh veggies and fruits), and for helping eliminate the incredible amount of food waste that occurs in this country.

Here is an article written a while ago about Market Outlet's first opening, and it seems pretty accurate to how the store is now: http://articles.earthlingshandbook.org/2009/09/28/new-discount-grocery-store-in-pittsburgh/",2014-07-02 20:42:44
QlREUeGhDFSlmH0Lh1rA0g,bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA,3,19,7,13,"Let me preface this review by saying that this business wasn't my intended destination. CES crowds took over most of the restaurants in this plaza and my options were limited after being turned away at two other places. 

Menu is exclusively on iPad, and the pictures are helpful. Translated dish names aren't always accurate though. Menu is a bit limited, specialties appear to be their short rib and lamb shank, which look awesome but take 25-35 minutes to prepare, according to my server. I didn't have that kind of time, I was getting hangry.

BEEF TONGUE APPETIZER: This is a cold tongue app, which isn't entirely clear when ordering. Sliced and served carpaccio style with a fiery sauce and chopped peppers and onions. Once my tastebuds got over the initial shock of the cold and the spice, they decided this was decent.
SHORT RIB NOODLE MISO SOUP: Unclear whether this is intended to be ramen. Other reviews call it ramen, and it has broth-noodles-meat like ramen, and you can add on corn, seaweed, and egg like ramen. But the broth was very light and flat, lacked the richness (for better or worse) that I typically associate with ramen. Noodles were okay, nothing special. Short rib was good, fair portion.
""SALTED DUCK CABBAGE"": I misunderstood this dish. Photo shows a heap of cabbage, I assumed from the name that the duck was under it. This is just a vegetable dish, and the sauce is made of duck egg yolks. It was fairly tasty, but once I knew what it was made of and how rich it must be, I tried to limit my consumption. 

Execution needs work, all dishes seemed to need a bit of refinement. Space is clean but devoid of decor. Service is a little helpful with the ordering process but not particularly attentive. Hot tea was oddly served in tall drinking glasses and never refilled. Owner cashed us out and was enthusiastic and informative, wish he had been present for our whole visit.",2016-01-09 19:35:56

So let me first say, this has NOTHING to do with service.  Service i so subjective that I hate to even see it in a review.  The best wait-person in the world will have an off day or rub someone the wrong way.  This is about the food.  (Specifically, the burgers)
I really feel this place should be in Vegas, because you throw the dice every time you walk in the place.  I'm giving them 3 stars because I have had about as many good burgers as I have had bad ones.  It really is a crap shoot as to whether you will get something you like or something that you will wish you went someplace else.   And I'm not talking about the 400 different styles of burger.   The end product has no consistency, so if you find a favorite, be prepared to be disappointed half the time.  Personally, I normally get the patty melt, as it seems to be the easiest one for them to Not screw up.  However, even here, the quality and the final product varies Wildly.  
Dining in, is better, but not a guarantee for quality.  However, you do have the chance to send it back and have them make an attempt at fixing it for you.  On The Other Hand..,  if we get food for takeout, then place your bets.  Their takeout is the worst, and we have come home to stone cold burgers, congealed grease fries, and mistake orders.  If fact the takeout is so bad that if we have to order for carryout, we now go somewhere else.  Which is sad, because when they are on point, this place has one of the top 5 burgers in town.  But when it is bad...  I'd be more happy with Jack in the Box.

Setting: The interior is basically that of 1980's Korea with the classic high school camo uniform you'll see the servers wearing. The decor reminds me of how soyo's is set up but less post war appearing haha. The restaurant is nicely spaced out with non bbq options available but really you came here for one thing and that's to bbq! The bathrooms are nice and stocked with disposable toothbrushes, and toothpaste to get rid of that post bbq dank breath. Each bbq table has an retractable vent that ventilates the smoke very well but I'd leave that up to the servers to adjust.

Food: You can order the meats individually but I highly recommend ordering the set. Me and my friend opted for the beef set which made us beyond full $51 i believe. The black angus was nicely tender with good amount of marbling to give it that buttery consistency. The side dishes which i typically ignore, I couldn't at this place. Kimchi was really authentic with thick sauce that coats each leaf of radish. Water kimchi was perfectly sour and refreshing when sipping on. The brisket isn't the best but still better than most places in Las Vegas. Here they offer a cup of melted cheese to dip the brisket in which I found great.  The ribeye and the marinated beef ribs were on point! I wish I could've had more room to finish it.

Dessert: Is a korean rice cracker with red bean spread and a thick helping of vanilla or green tea ice cream all put together to create this delicious ice cream sandwich. I recommend going with the green tea.

Service: Never have I been to a Korean bbq place where the servers YES the servers can grill all the meat and cut it for you too! Usually it's my job to do that but very convenient to sit back and have them to all the work for me

First thing comes to mind when you visit this place, is whether or not it stands up to Kazu... my verdict? Naaaaaaah !!!! lol

On this point i agree with Concertina F. but whereas none of Kazu's dishes disapoint   SOME dishes at Imadake do... and this despite the damn lineup at kazu, their habit of constant price INFLATION, their limited menu, no fried items  and their cash only policy...

On to the food... :)
we had, ramen, beef tongue, chicken karaage, jelly fish salad, eel soup, eel omelet, agedashi tofu, bacon wrapped asparagus, and tempura.

of note is the beef tongue, quite delicious, tender and good flavor, I know I kissed a cow... And I liked it :P. The jelly fish salad was nice, refreshing, light and refreshing, except the portion was unforgivably small.

The rest was just all right nothing spectacular, one miss is the omelet, too much sugar, It's an omelet not flan!!! lol :P

Tempura was average, but really no one messes that one up... well except hot and spicy buffet, where it's as big as a celery stick and mostly batter lol.

chicken was good, but I like chicken karaage, so it was fine, but I've had better, at sumo ramen and ichiban. 

the eel soup was another miss, the dashi was weak, no flavor depth, but the eel was good.

The agedashi was good, good soy sauce dashi, and the tofu was silky.

The bacon asparagus was a bit on the bland side, a dash of teriyaki or miso would have been nice.

Final verdict? more style than substance, small dishes... but nice drinks.",2011-12-24 08:04:32

I never thought of altering any of my clothes because I thought it would be expensive. When purchasing clothes, Many times, I have put back clothes because they were either too long or too big. Even petites are made for tall people. Ohhhhh... Why didn't I have longer legs?!? Anywhos, what's done, is done and my life goes on being short.

If I fell, that would be game over, do not pass go, do not collect $200. Soooo............
I walk into Habib's tailor shop and I was greeted with such a wonderful smile and amazing attitude. He took my measurements and told me not to worry. I told him I trusted him, (considering the amazing reviews I have read) and told him that I was in no rush to receive the dress anytime soon. A week later, I get a text letting me know that my maxi dress was ready. Of all the customers he receives, he sees me and immediately remembered who I was. He pulled my dress off the rack and when I tried the dress on, you couldn't even tell it was altered. This is my first maxi dress I have ever purchased and can officially wear. I never imagined that I would be able to wear a maxi dress that fit perfectly. I am incredibly happy and excited to wear my first maxi dress and show it off.

The problem is that it's consistently gone down in service and quality. On my most recent visit, we had a waiter we'd never seen before. He didn't appear to speak English. Our order coming out incorrectly was an indicator that he wasn't understanding Us.

We calmly asked again, and again, and over the course of an hour or so.. we got allot of attitude about sending back items we didn't not order. On top of it, we asked for water 4x, and the server was clearly being vindictive and ignoring us. 

A different female server started coming over to fix things.. and finally we got the 3 of the 4 things we wanted. No water tho..but at least our beer finally arrived. Originally we ordered Asahi, and when they didn't show up after 10 minutes.. I asked the server. He motioned that they didn't have Asahi.. so we got Newcastle.

None of them are great, and even the meat at Greenland is only mediocre, resulting in only marginally better kbbq at home.  We've been to Sura, Mother's, Honey Pig, Shilla, etc., and they're all average at best except for the above average price.  I remember going to Woonam Jung a few years back with mum and thinking it was pretty good, so on this day as we're craving kbbq, we decide to head over here for early dinner.  

The newly renovated interior is quite nice, bordering on the ""upscale"" side as far as kbbq's are concerned.  Being new, it's clean and as yet devoid of the greasiness that tend to build up when these places age a bit.  We'll see how long that lasts.  The service throughout the meal is good and mostly on the pleasant side, so that was a plus.  

We ordered the ""Couple's Combo"", which comes with choice of 3 meats from about a dozen, and the requisite side dishes, steamed egg pot, dwenjang stew, and salad.  Alas, no lettuce ssam nor rice cake ssam, one of which should be required at every kbbq restaurant.  Shame.  We got the woogyup (beef belly), pork neck, and bulgogi.  Beef belly was probably the best (it's one of my favorite meat), and was actually quite good.  The other two were passable, but I wouldn't consider either of them worthy of L.A. standards.  The steamed egg was as good as any, and side dishes were also pretty good.  The stew was extra pungent which I'm not crazy about, but actually tasted really good.  

It was $39.99 for the meal for 2 which is the same price as their AYCE, but we figured it would end up being about the same amount of food for the two of us.  Turns out we were right, so no loss.  In the end, I would probably rank this place #1 for kbbq joints in Vegas.  Note, I have not had kbbq at Soyo, but I don't consider that a kbbq place so...  Probably not quite deserving of 3.5 stars, but with the cleanliness and general advantage in overall food compared to other kbbq places, I'll be REALLY generous.  Anyway, I'm still longing for Woo Kook or Baekjeong, or any of the fine kbbq establishments in L.A...

This place is self-serve: you decide which of the 6 flavors you'd like; you decide how much yogurt you want; you add the toppings yourself (there were 12 fruit bins and 12 dried bins); and then you pay by weight. 

On the day I visited, the 6 available flavors are: cookies and cream, red velvet cake, plain, vanilla, cheese cake, and taro. I got the cheese cake and taro mix at the recommendation of a customer who claimed to have visited this store every day since it opened.  The flavor was pretty good, but I would have liked a bit more tartness. I topped mine with strawberries and mango chunks. The fruit seemed to have been steeped in a simple syrup, so they are pretty sweet.

They don't show the pricing in an obvious place, but according to that ""regular"" customer I met, it's about $0.39 per ounce. Mine came out to be about $4.25 (I got a BIG cup and I like lots of toppings!). This pricing is *much* better than the Sweet Berry in Oakland.

The tomatoes were so thin, all I could taste was goat cheese and the jam they put on it. I got the chicken sandwich and it was fried to a crisp. Not the good crisp, the burnt kind where it makes the chicken dry and it tastes bitter. I loved the kale salad though!! I could eat plates of that. 

Our table ordered a flatbread because it was the day's special. I believe they gave another table our flatbread and then realized they did so brought it back and we had to wait for them to bring it back out to us. There seemed to be a lot of confusion that night and a lot of mix ups with orders. The wait was also pretty long too for food.

I can't deny that I do love the song and dance this place provides as well as the seafood,which I would eat everyday if it didn't cost so damn much.
I guess the prices are competitive, but it's still a bit pricey to me, which is why I only go when I have a GC or freebie. 
Last time I got the steampot with crab, shrimp, sausage, corn, and red potatoes. My kiddo had  a kid version of the same thing and we both enjoyed it much.
The only thing is i wish I had enough to take home-for the same price I can go to hash house and have enough for 2-3 meals, but no seafood in it. I hate how expensive seafood is in Las Vegas.

Luckily I ordered the charity bread or otherwise I would have left hungry. Italian food. I specifically inquired if the Carbonara sauce had the black peppercorn in it or on it. The server said he will ask them to not put it in. Ok great. Nope there was pepper in the sauce. I let the server know there was pepper in the sauce and he quickly tells me he triple checked with the kitchen. 

Then the manager comes over to suggest I should have asked first. I tell her I did because black pepper and my taste buds do not get along. She asks if she can get me something else and I inform her my lunch is now over and I must return to the office. She says she is not going to charge me for the meal and I said I am not going to pay for a meal I could not eat. 

I suggest she educates the server more on how they prepare the meals here so he can be more informed when customers ask questions. I asked for my bill and she walked away. 

There was a large group of people at the next table, the server is walking away from them, does not approach me at my table and he just blurts out: ""no bill for you miss"". I had to look over my shoulder to figure out that was meant for me. Normally I would still leave a TIP in this kind of situation but TIPS stands for: To Insure Proper Service. That I did not get, so no tip. 

I returned to the office and called the manager of Scaddabush and informed her of how the server dismissed me with the ""no bill for you miss"". She too was taken aback by that. She apologized for the poor customer service. I suggested maybe he had too many tables to manage and the lack of education on the menu. She has asked that I return for lunch again and she will take care of me. Nice gesture after the fact. I will give them one more try and I requested I don't sit in his section.",2014-12-08 15:57:43

Chocolate is more than just a form of sugary sustenance; it is an encapsulation of all that is good in the world. Chocolate can no longer be classified as a type of food, but rather a delicious manifestation of human emotion, a symbol of contentment. Lucky for us, a select number of individuals were placed on this earth to spread this embodiment of delectation. One such contributor performs her mouthwatering magic right here in Madison, concocting gourmet chocolates at one of the tastiest shops in town: Gail Ambrosius Chocolatier.

Gail Ambrosius, founder of the shop, has been sharing her passion for chocolate with the Madison community since 2004, when she opened Gail Ambrosius Chocolatier.  Since then, chocolate has become a way of life for Ambrosius. She learned much about the chocolate craft when she went to France to learn from the esteemed Valhrona and Cluizel chocolatiers. As a result, her chocolates have received wide acclaim. In fact, her shop earned the title of America's ""Best Little Box of Chocolates"" on the Food Network, wherein Alton Brown's film crew came to the shop for a whole day of filming.

Over the years, her shop has become a beloved installment in Madison's Atwood neighborhood, earning praise for its innovative flavor combinations and its commitment to artfully crafted chocolates. Ambrosius has melded outlandish ingredients with fresh chocolate in her acclaimed truffle collection, some of which include: 

Sweet Curry with Saffron
Lemongrass with Ginger
Shiitake Mushroom
Rose
Earl Grey

A few of her most popular flavors--Lucille's Vanilla and Caramel Sprinkled with Grey Salt--are similarly transporting, albeit a bit more traditional. Whether it's exotic or conventional chocolates you seek, know that Gail Ambrosius is here to satisfy.",2014-04-11 14:58:31

I am usually not a fan of eating at NYNY because the restaurants don't seem that great (Il Fornaio). I looked up the reviews on yelp for Gallagher's and it got good reviews, so we gave it a shot. I rarely eat steak but when I do I want it to be good. I had a reservation and when we arrived almost the whole restaurant was empty but the host was was having a hard time finding our reservation and took a few minutes to find it with the help of 3 people. I don't know why didn't just seat us, hmm. 

The place does not have a modern feel to it, and usually when I am going to spend alot of money on food I kind of enjoy the atmosphere as well too. That aside, we were so excited about the bread since you usually get really yummy bread at steakhouses. The bread was the really crusty kind and flaky but soft in the middle, a sourdough loaf. Not what we were expecting. I guess I am used to the pretzel bread, cheesy bread, and all the other cool kinds of bread you get at other steakhouses. 

The service was very good, someone there to fill your water every time you took a sip practically. My friend and I shared the cowboy rib-eye steak $38 it was very big. The steak just wasn't as good as I hoped for. The sauce on top was good. We shared 4 cheese mac and cheese and creamed spinach-both I enjoyed. But usually sides at steakhouses are always good. The portion was pretty small on the sides. 

We shared a toffee bread pudding dessert with vanilla ice cream. It was the size of a brownie. It was good but not amazing.

I had originally planned to just order one online (I was due for an upgrade), but didn't want to wait for it to arrive by mail....instant gratification was key.  

So i went to the store, but had already researched what type of service and features I wanted to include.  I told the guy that I wanted to add Rhapsody, but asked him if he could explain how it worked first (for those that don't know, it's supposed to be a $10/month music download program - unlimited tunes).  He was quick to state ""oh, that's not available on the iphone""....confused, I asked why it was offered in the package online then.  He was adamant that it was not a feature available to the iphone, until I asked him to research it.....Whaddaya know. It WAS available.  He said nothing and we moved on.  Next, he asked if I wanted insurance.  I said no, but i wanted the extended warranty for $1.99/month.  He stated again ""that's not available with this phone"".  AGAIN, i asked why it was offered online.  He said it probably wouldn't have let me check out with it.....and then clicked a little button, and low and behold...it let him add the extended warranty.  I then informed him that I wanted to reduce my minutes from 900 to 450, since i have not gone over the 450 in over 6 months....He looked at my account and said that i should absolutely stay with the 900 minutes because I would definitely go over.  Mind you, I had just checked my account earlier in the day, so I knew where I stood.  He told me that I was already at 380 minutes, and I would have to pay extra for any minutes I went over.  I looked at him for a minute....then told him that since my cycle restarted tomorrow,...I was clearly still going to be ok.  He said nothing and kept going.  He then asked me if I wanted to look at cases and I said no because I had already found a specialty one online that I planned to order.  He stated that I should definitely look at their selection first, because they had a ton to choose from and could probably get me discount.  So I said ok and he walked me over to their turnstile....with a total of 8 choices (and three of them were variations of black).  When I asked what the discount was, he said he could get me a discount....if i bought a package that included about 5 other things that i didnt even need or want.....

You are asked to fill out 3 sheets of paper with all the safety,rules, and legal information. While doing so, you are taken to a room to watch a video on the safety and the jumping procedure. Then you are asked to show that you understand the jumping procedure on an ottoman in the room. All of this at once was very overwhelming. It made me anxious and nervous and I wasn't even suited up yet.
I did feel safe and in good hands with the pilot and the instructors. I was the last one in and the first one out of the plane. Make sure to take in the view of the valley on the way up. The feeling of leaving the plane was so intense. I can say I did not enjoy the free fall at all. It was so fast and so windy- not my cup of tea. Once the shoot opened I felt better and was able to enjoy the view. Dangling above the earth- still not my cup of tea. Very skilled to have us land in the same area as we took off from.
 I was happy to be back on solid ground and I never want to go again- once is enough thank you very much. :)

The salad, which was slices of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, was alright. The cheese was different from other mozzarella I've had; I don't know if it is because of the free range cows it is suppose to comes from, or if I am use to some other type. It was an alright salad, the tomatoes weren't very tasty, but hey, they're out of season now.
The pizza wasn't great. It wasn't good either, it was just, well, there. Again, the cheese on it was different, it seriously looks like the vegan cheese from Pop Up Pizza, but it's not.  We had garlic and tomatoes on the whole pie, and it was meh. My boyfriend said the sausage was good, but it cost 3$ to add it to the pizza. He had wanted chicken at first, but then saw it was 5$! Every add on for pizza is 2-5! That's outrageous for the quality and quantity that you get!  I really don't know why people think this is the greatest pizza EVER, but maybe we need to go back and try one with sauce. Maybe that's the best part, I don't know, but I really didn't care for it.

I've been here four times and each time I order something different, also nice because they change their menu a good amount. 

My first time I went there I went with my now fiancé for my birthday. An appetizer dish that we got was a ramen dish with short ribs on it. We laughed and ordered it because we just got out of college and only at ramen while we were in so we had to get it. Holy crap. It was amazing. It even had a soft boiled egg on it and it was perfection. 

Then we went for new years and we did a 6 course dinner. I can't remember what I got or the names of it but I remember the taste, the flavors, and the smell like it was yesterday. The food comes in a little too large of portions but that allows you all to take tastes while at the table.

We were 4 adults and 1 baby and let me tell you right off the bat, this restaurant has a very small dining room (barely 600 - 700 sqft) and is not stroller friendly.  We were lucky that the restaurant wasn't busy (only 3 other parties on Sunday around 1 p.m.), otherwise we would have had to make an impromptu decision to go elsewhere where they could accommodate a stroller.  

We were greeted by the only server for the whole dining room who proved too slow and inefficient to take care of the 4 tables that were there.  

We ordered Tandoori mixed platter, Seehk kabob, Chicken Tikka Masala, Bhindi and eggplant dish with 2 pulao rice and 2 nans.  The slightly spicy Seekh kabob replaced our original order of lamb chops because they did not have any available. The toothsome kabobs were well seasoned and the meat tasted pleasantly of the tandoor.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and the other veg curries were just as well executed and the flavours were all very good.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the mixed Tandoori platter which was supposed to consist of tandoori chicken, fish tikka and tandoori shrimp for $17.95.  When this platter arrived on the same sizzling platter that hosted the Seekh kabobs, we were greeted by 3 pieces of chicken, 1 strip of fish (not sure what kind of fish it was) and 1 shrimp.  Hmm....not the best sampling platter for 4 people, is it?  

As we started our meal, the tandoori platter and the kabobs were served first with no nan or the rice and we had to walk over to the kitchen to find the server to ask her to bring some out.  She quickly mentioned that she was waiting to bring out the rice with the other dishes but obliged anyways.  After a very long 2 and a half hour meal, we finished it with mango and pistachio kulfi which were flavorful without being too sweet (perhaps a little too ice-crystal-ly for me) and just an ok kir.  

I have to mention that we were constantly bothered by a fly (or flies...not sure if it was the same guy or more than one) all throughout our meal which was a BIG minus for me.  Our visit to Zeera by the bay was just an ok one and if I return, it would likely be for a take out.",2013-09-24 11:17:34

I know it's not longer owned by the Guu franchise, but it retains a lot of the menu items and names, and makes me feel like I'm back at Guu Garden (my favourite of the Guus).

The Kurage is a favourite of mine, though this one is certainly smaller than what I'm used to. Flavours are still good, but portions make me a bit sad panda. The Gindara is a classic and you can't really go wrong with it, though I recall it used to be served with a radish paste to cleanse the palate. We also got the ebimayo which came with some lettuce - and I secretly wish the lettuce had some of the delicious spicy sauce so I could continue devouring it. I also ordered the kimchi udon - another classic but this one seemed to lack in cod roe. The textures didn't stand out as much. And lastly, the salmon oshizushi, because I had been craving some pressed sushi. This one was delicious, melt-in-your-mouth with smoky flavours that made me pat the belly in content. Oh, we also ordered the cold soba noodles from the summer menu, but I didn't feel like it was anything to write home about.

Overall, it is definitely on par with my memories of Guu. I hope it stays around for a while, the food is good and the service is as expected!

I came here because I thought the wait at L'avenue, which has the most yelp reviews for brunch in montreal, would be too long.

The waitress told  us it would be about a 30 minute wait, and ""possibly longer"". We ended up waiting for 1.5 hours, which I don't think is justified for ANY restaurant unless it's the top restaurant in the entire city...
 
I was so hungry once the food came that I wasn't sure if I was able to taste everything properly, but I tried the foie gras eggs benedict, and the foie was delicious.

There was about 5 small pieces of foie, and I enjoyed the fact that the bread on the bottom was thick cut and soft; perfect for dipping into the foie gras sauce!

They are really good at presentation, and seasonal fruits were split into two small square cups, and a shot glass of their smoothie was also on the plate.
The dish itself was better than average, but NOT worth a 1.5 hour wait; I would of waited 30 minutes max.

We literally finished our food without talking in 15 minutes since we were all beyond hungry.
 
Atmosphere is really cozy and decorated nicely; there is also patio seating. The servers seem stressed though, probably due to the many clients staring expectantly at them, waiting for their food to arrive.

Perhaps going right when they open would be a better idea. I went at 1:00PM and didn't get the food  until 2:30PM (and 2:30PM is when the kitchen closes for brunch)!

I was horrified when the barista added milk to a cup of ice, and then a heaping scoop of some powder shit and threw it in the blender. It was foul. Hyper sweet and yet acrid all at the same time. The baklava? A soggy, nasty waste of phyllo dough. The other snack items didn't look appetizing at all: tightly wrapped muffins and clam-shelled chocolate cake and cheesecake- all from Costco.

We started with a couple appetizers, and the one that stood out the most were the Edamame Fritters which were delicious! Imagine Edamame fried into a ball with a sweet sauce to dip. For our main meal, we decided to try several different dishes including the Massaman Curry, Chow Mein, Fried Rice and a couple other items. My favorite item by far was the Curry and when I come back, I will just order that and possibly ask for extra chicken. It had the perfect flavor to it and was creamy and delicious!

The menu is very cute and done on a chalkboard. They have a variety of bowls, juices, smoothies, and poke bowls. 

My wife decided on the chocolate dream acai bowl. The blend hand cocoa in it. The topping was strawberries, bananas, chocolate chips, and honey... Yum! My wife just wishes there was a little more chocolate flavor to the blend.

I chose the body builder. Peanut butter in the acai blend! Topped with strawberries and bananas sans honey and almonds. I loved mine, but it also needed more peanut butter in the blend. 

There bowls are so fresh and filling. I always feel energized and satisfied after having one ! We will definitely be back!",2016-04-19 19:26:56

Dough!- The pizza is perfect! I always get the personal size, with italian sausage and ricotta cheese. Its big for being a personal , I usually share it with my main man and it fits us perfectly, however I think for most people its not for splitting. Its thin crust , sorta similar to Grimaldis but better! and not as pricey. They seem to use a similar style bread on the spinach dip too and it melts in your mouth! noms!

Friends behind the bar- I have only been at the bar seats, but the servers are all friendly and happy to chat with you even when your not at their table. Bartenders are super awesome. All are fun and talkative. Making drinks quick and having a good conversation is hard to find!!

Wine bar?- The sign says Patio and wine bar, soooo it is.. but its very unpretentious , so if you are just getting into wine or are not at all , dont be shy come on in.. its not pricey and the guys are here to help! Plus a good selection of draft and bottle beers! If you like good wine, get in here! I you are a beer drinker, get in here! If you just like a goo place with good friend and soda, get in here!

Break it down Jess- All in all its a great place, half price wine bottles on Wednesday, and a great happy hour. My only thought that if you go to this wine bat for a bottle of wine with friends for a quite time, dont go during any sporting events as there are tons of tv's( which is great) but could easily turn into a guys bar during those times.

1. The ordering/pickup system is NOT well thought out, nor is it clearly marked/people don't pay enough attention for a system like this. When I came here, we ordered then got trapped in the back of the restaurant because the lunch line was taking over where it would be easiest to grab your food: down at the other end. Staff and customers can't easily get to one another and create efficiency. 
2. It's a chain. I'm not a HUGE chain fan and while they have their merits, they make me wonder, especially when they're branded as a ""healthy"" alternative. I'd rather go to a locally sourced tiny veggie stand to get my own fruit for a smoothie, or go to a unique one of a kind smoothie place. One where I can see my smoothie being made and it doesn't just appear to me. I saw some being grabbed out of a small refrigerator, which gave me the impression that some were pre-made, not fresh, and who knows what kind of sugars are added. Don't get me wrong, my smoothie was tasty! But a mystery...
3. The food is actually pretty good and I felt healthier than I would have if I had gotten some BK or McD's, but it certainly didn't taste fresh. The chicken on my flatbread seemed a little processed and when I unwrapped it a mere 3 minutes later (how long it took me to wade through the crowd and get to the outdoor seating), the bread was fairly soggy. Like the smoothie, it was tasty, but a little mysterious. 

I guess my issue is that I don't buy into the health aspect of it, but I do like this place, don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure it's worth the chaos and trouble of trying to get your food in a timely and sensible manner. I'll come back, but probably outside of the lunch time rush and see what happens. 

I'd like to add that we waited at least 15-20 minutes for 2 flatbreads and 2 smoothies, which came out at COMPLETELY different times, though they were ordered back to back. Confusion. Pure confusion.",2012-07-09 20:45:48

Now as for the tacos it was fresh Maui with an interesting but awesome pineapple and salsa twist. Each taco hade 3 pieces of Maui deep fried to perfection. They were way bigger then I thought it was going to be. 
My date had the steak salad which he loved and the steak was cooked to perfection. I didn't get to try it but it looked Devine..

I attended a free class at the Paradise Valley location to see what I was getting myself into.  I quickly realized my Insanity workouts at home have nothing on OTF.   Energizing, exciting and 1 hour goes by so fast. I would never work out for that long on my own. 

I've been eagerly awaiting for this location to open.  It finally has and  it's been just A-OK. Make sure you understand what you are being billed for.   My first class was never confirmed even though I signed up at their grand opening.  After I let them know that I had also called to confirm they did return my call to apologize and explained they had a few glitches signing people up and they encouraged using the mobile app.  I get it, they are new, probably overwhelmed  but taking phone appointments should be important also. Keep in mind they had multiple phone numbers available on their flyers prior to their grand opening so use their main line only. 

Classes fill up quick, so sometimes you have the option to be on the wait list. They will call you to let you know if you've made the class.  A week ago, it was 30 min before the class started and I assumed I didn't make the class since I had not received a confirmation call.  Next thing you know, my phone rings that there is room in the class.  I was ecstatic, yet scrambling to make the class on time.  

Yesterday I was on the wait list for the 4:30pm class and never received a call, so I was bummed I now had to see if there was another class available. I called the location and they did confirm the class was full, however, they encouraged me to show up anyway as people don't  show up for their classes which makes room for the wait list.  I explained that I don't live that  close and for me to drive out  there only to possibly be turned away is not worth the trip. Their next avail class with no wait list was 7pm. With that said, I called the Arrowhead location and they just opened their location a few weeks ago. They had a class available at 5:45pm. They signed me up over the phone, no wait list and had a great work out. 

I've realized the wait list is probably not the best option for me, it feels like I'm in limbo and I like to plan ahead.

You will normality wait 1-2 hours for a table. If your hungry I would get your own tacos. I know the menu says you get 5 shells but they are really tiny. Try the cucumber margarita, its different and refreshing and good. I noticed the happy hour is only an hour and a half which is really short I think. Since the place is small I think only a limited number will get the deals. You pay for chips and salsa here.  Chips are not unlimited, you have to pay for extra. So you only get one basket.",2017-07-12 14:11:16

The Better Half and I were at the Hard Rock and decided to check out Johnny Smalls.  You can imagine the look on our face when we saw the sign that said $19.99 AYCE....seriously, check out the pics.  We thought there was a catch and asked the hostess.  She said, no joke it's $19.99 per person.  You didn't have to ask us twice.....they were packed, so we were forced to saddle up to the bar and eat there instead of a table.  No big deal, we enjoy doing that from time to time.

We were looking over the menu, which has a ton of items to choose from, and the bartender gave us the ground rules.....it's simple.  Each person gets to order 2 Tapas, if you finish both plates you can order 2 more, it stops when you stop finishing your plate.  If you decide you want to order more food and you didn't finish your last order, you have to pay full price for the Tapas plate.....seems fair to me.

Since the average price per Tapas is around $7, each person needs to order at least 3 Tapas to be ""in the money"".....aka ""get your money's worth"".

I was starving, so I knew I was going to eat my money's worth.  Here's a breakdown of each round of Tapas (see pics):

Round 1
Crab & Artichoke Dip (Creamy Cheese, Lump Crab, 'Junk Basket' Chips)
Tempura Green Beans (Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce)
Philly-ish (Warm Flat Iron Steak, Chipotle Mayo, Roasted Peppers, Farmstead White Cheddar)
Chili Dogs (Mini Pinks, Kobe Chili)

Round 2
Small Balls (Creamy Risotto, Shortribs, Parmesan Fondue)
Jack & Coke (Kobe Beef, Sweet Whiskey Cola, Pancetta)
Nuttin' Honey (Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts)
Octapussy (Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange)

Round 3
Shorty (Braised Short Ribs, Baked Apple Chips, Sage, Savory Virgin Oil)
Tuscan Pizza (esto Base, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinated Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers, Balsamic Vinaigrette)

Everything was excellent except the Chili Dogs (kind of plain & bland).

***TIP*** - The Pizzas are pretty big for Tapas.  Order it last if you want to sample a lot of Tapas so you won't get full early in the meal.

Over the course of the meal, we ordered 3 glasses of Merlot ($9 ea) and we were able to keep the bill to $72.41 plus a $15 tip, $87.41 total damage.  Not bad for a night out at the Hard Rock!

Will I return?  Hell yeah!  Return Factor - 100%",2011-01-21 13:35:44

Met some friends here one Tuesday. The place was busy when i arrived and my friends already had got a table. I have no idea why this table is even an option. It directly in front of an open kitchen. It is the worst. High traffic area with lots of clutter not to mention having to heat the kitchen noise. That table shouldn't even be there!
My friends had already ordered the trio of guacamole, queso and pico. It was good and flavorful. 
Our server was very knowledgeable about he menu and drink options. We inquired about what tacos are for taco Tuesday, try only offer two. A tilapia and a buffalo chicken. Disappointed by the option, however i decided on a buffalo and their fat guy in a little coat taco.
Happy i didn't order the fish taco, it looked basic with one friendly getting a decent amount and one getting barely any.
The buffalo chicken was good, but very basic. A place this known for tacos could of added some flare to these.
The fat guy in A little coat taco could of been great but the aioli ruined it for me. I love aioli, this one came with an avacado aioli, but this one tasted like straight up mayo on my steak taco.
The food coming out the kitchen (since we had a front row seat) was looking good and I May give this place another try but for taco Tuesday lovers, this is not the place.",2018-03-20 13:53:22

This time the bacon and roast beef were not offered -- boo!  But still a pretty good bloody mary bar.  My GF always orders the bacon/spinach/feta cheese omelet, but substitutes green salad for the potatoes and fruit cup.  They also give you toast too.  She says you cannot believe how great the green salad with ranch dressing goes with her omelet.  I had my Mulligan's Special Breakfast -- 3 eggs, bacon/ham/or sausage, roasted red potatoes, and toast.  It was good as usual, especially since they accept restuarant.com vouchers.

I love coming to Vegas and we have always enjoyed South Point Casino.  They have so much to offer under one roof and it isn't just a casino. They have a 64 lane bowling alley that they use for tournaments as well as guest play. A Cinemark movie theater. Huge booking areas. My favorite the horse equestrian center.  Being from the East, I don't get to see the real Cowboy Stuff and I enjoy sitting and watching. 

The casino is clean and well maintained with cleanliness and service. The casino also offers a wonderful craps tip class, which I really enjoyed, being a craps player. A little help now and then can't hurt. As in any casino the players card does give some discounts. Staying next door at the Grandview we also received a coupon book that also offered great discounts. The casino floor is very spacious with plenty of room to move around. I am  a non-smoker, I wasn't affected in any way with the smoke quality others have commented on. 

If you are here for a long weekend as we mostly are, there really is so much to do here, you don't need to go to the strip, but if that is a desire, as we usually do for one night, they offer a shuttle to the strip for $7.00 a person one way. If you think about it, it really isn't a bad deal, your rental car for parking would be much more as well as hailing a cab. 

I have enjoyed the buffet here, it isn't as good as the buffets on the strip, but it is good food at a good price. With the wine lovers become more present everywhere, which I am one, the casino restaurants are offering wine deals, which has made me externally happy. They have a restaurant for every foodie, with a lot of food choices. We were here one New Years Eve and the dinner specials were wonderful. 

The casino bartenders aren't so friendly and my only complaint. Don't ask for directions, they don't seem to care about offering assistance if you're not sitting at their bar. I just need help find a certain area in the casino and the un-friendly attitude I got as unappreciated. I was told the wrong place and had to hunt a casino guard for help. If you don't know your way around the place you work your in sad shape. It wasn't just one bartender twice in one day was enough to make me stay away from the bars in the casino.

In Toronto, this is the best place I have had in terms of Japanese style pasta. I really love going there for pasta and the pasta dish I love the most is the one call ""Sukiyaki"". It's pasta with a variety of mushroom with some thinly sliced beef cooked together with some Japanese soya sauce together with the the pasta. The flavor is rich, in my opinion. And if you add another $3, you can get a cup of soup of the day. Their Soup of the day I have tried is always a kind of Cream of XXXX where XXXX = potatoes or tomato or Broccoli or corn.

Once in while, I guess depending on who is in the kitchen, the pasta dish can get abit salty at times, but most of the time, it's very delicious!

Dinner with my cousin & his wife was definitely guided by the positive reviews here, and thanks to all of the collective Yelpers who posted pics of the food.  Everything looked great!

There is a special appetizer plate that isn't even on the menu, but thanks to the Yelp photos we knew what it would look like.  Why isn't it on the menu??  It's awesome!  Olives, parmesan cheese, soprasatta, ham, and a make-your-own bruschetta with lightly grilled bread, chopped tomato & pesto mayonnaise.  I was a little disappointed at first because it seems like caprese salad is no longer on the menu, but just ask the waiter if the special appetizer is available & GET IT.  It's really good.

I got the minestrone soup & it was fine, but the highlight for me was definitely the Amatriciana pasta.  Sure, you can make pasta at home, but my pasta never came out like this!  It's slightly spicy, with *perfectly* cooked pasta & prosciutto.  If you can't decide what to get, this is a very safe choice.

The service is very attentive, and they for some reason they give you very small water glasses, which meant that our busboy had to stop by every 5 minutes & refill our water.

All I needed to do was convince my co-workers to give it a try...which really wasn't difficult.

At 7am on a winter morning the store front that is Chev and Rachel's is like a bacon calling me home.  Uh, I mean beacon.  The owner, there by himself for the first hour or so, was happy to greet us.  Upon sitting down there were a couple little things I noticed that impressed me.  First, under my utencils was not one, not two, but instead a generous pile of napkins.  Things can get messy when it comes to me and food and I like when a restaurant lets me be liberal with my napkin usage.  The second thing I noticed, which has nothing to do with the food, was a bag of pet friendly ice melt inside the door.  As a pet owner, it's nice to see a business owner who cares like that.  Especially when I saw several dogs walk by the door.

The menu isn't all that adventurous but what they do offer is well executed.  The chocolate chip pancakes are massive.  My Breakfast Bowl was a delicious mixture of potatoes, eggs, onions, cheese and bacon with some Mancini's toast added.  The prices were reasonable (my breakfast bowl plus side of toast was under $10 with tip) but be advised they are cash only and the dining room is very small.  Still, if you can squeeze your way in, give it a try.

My one star deduction is only because, as David B pointed out, they need to turn on the grill hood.  I don't mind smelling like the diner itself, but not when the diner smells like it might be on fire.  Perhaps during warmer weather when the doors can be left open that will help.

We constantly had servers refilling water, asking others if they wanted another drink, if we needed anything else. No issues at all there.

I ordered the vegetable chop salad. I was surprised at how meh it was. Perhaps my expectations were too high? It had very little variation in texture and was rather small (though all of us observed that the portions were small for the money). It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular, either. 

I was still hungry afterward, as were my nearby companions. We were glad that someone else ordered biscuits and passed some down to us--WOW! Now those were amazing. Like a Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuit on steroids. Definitely high quality cheese and bacon mixed in. Plus, the biscuits were huge and divided well with a couple people.

We ate chips and salsa.  don't like the little dorito wheels that come wedged in the chip basket.  The salsas are just alright and the tiny bowls aren't big enough for even the two of us.

Got crab queso.  It was good. We filled up on that and when my husband's carnitas (used to be our fav) came, so did the flies.  Yea, the regular dumpster variety.  ILK!!!!  We were surrounded by about 20 flies.  They were landing on the food and us, and biting.  The service was poor.

I had heard SO many varying opinions, from the over-the-top fantastic to the somewhat mediocre. I had heard about the complicated ordering system and the offering of strange meat items (goat? some kind of squid?).
Well, I finally went last Tuesday... and WOW. Here's a breakdown of the trip:

My friend made reservations for our group of six. Our table was ready right on time, and while it wasn't super crowded, it seems that making a reservation for a group of more than four is a good idea. We picked up our menus and a pad of receipt paper, and a friend grabbed tea and cups for all. The tea was fantastic. The menu, bewildering - in the best way something can be bewildering.
There are SO MANY OPTIONS, and so many of them sound AWESOME. We ended up with six dishes, to be shared family style. I chose a crispy eggplant and basil dish, and Mr. Husband got some crispy pork. We also had another eggplant dish (I want to cry just thinking about it! SO much scrumptious eggplant!), a black vinegar pork, some kind of weird crab thing (I don't like eating things that look like spiders, so I didn't eat that), and, uh, something else fried. 
Our food was served surprisingly quickly, considering we ordered six things. It only took 10-15 minutes as I recall. (The conversation was amusing, though, so it may have taken slightly longer.)
The eggplant dishes were like riding a dragon while eating cotton candy made from angel tears (awesome). I loved loved loved the crispy fried eggplant! I surprised myself, too, in that my second-favorite dish was black vinegar pork. Mmm. I tried everything except the spiders, and I was in heaven. 
Prices were decent. Expect to pay around $10-15 per person. Considering that they charge a table-clearing fee and there's no expectation to leave a tip, that's pretty decent. Consider going elsewhere - you might only spend $6-8 per person on an entree, but then you add a drink, and have to tip 20% at the end. The total trip cost me $25 for 2 dishes, which I was pleased with.

Bottom line, for the ""tl;dr"" crowd: Awesome food, not too expensive, go with a group, make a reservation, drink tea, don't eat spider-crabs.",2011-11-29 15:39:34

It's nice that they don't make you feel silly for being afraid to jump out over a humungous safety net, despite the fact that they have likely taken the same jump over a thousand times before. They seemed genuinely interested in our ability to perform well and continously offered advice on techniques we could use to improve as well as big cheers when we implemented them successfully.

This made for a great birthday present, but would be perfect for any occassion or even none at all. I think it would be an especially cool and unique option for a date night. Whatever the case, you are sure to have an experience to remember. We all loved it and can't wait to return.

We went here with friends the other night for dinner, and we were pleased with the burgers and food we got. We went on Wednesday, and they had half price craft beer! Bingo!

The place is small inside, so I have a feeling sometimes it gets quite busy. You order at the counter and then seat yourselves. 

We ordered the Gangnam style burger and the pimento cheese burger. We got one with regular fries and one with sweet potato fries. The pimento cheese burger was definitely the hero. The gangnam style burger wasn't as great as we had hoped. We expected a bit more from the pork belly. The fries were perfectly crispy and yummy. Bang bang sauce is a must. 

Overall, great burgers. Next time, I think we will get a double pimento cheese instead of two singles to split b/c the pimento cheese was the star.",2016-06-17 22:15:13

Next to do so, Habit Burger, with over 40 years of operation under their belts, brings their charburgers, sandwiches, and shakes from Southern California to the Valley. It kind of reminds me of Carl's Jr but a lot better, yet different, and I'm a Carl's Jr fan There's actually one right across the street if you're into comparing.

The Santa Barbara is probably my favorite. It's a double charburger with cheese and avocado in grilled sourdough. I don't know what I like the most about it the grilled sourdough, which I'm always a sucker for,  or the avocado. 

The Teriyaki charburger I liked. It came with a nice sized slice of grilled pineapple with mayonnaise, pickle, tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions. Can't really say no to teri burger with pineapple unless it was bad. Good thing it was good.

I've also had an albacore tuna sourdough sandwich. Different but I actually liked it a lot. A friend tried the albacore in a salad, looked pretty good so I might have to try it for myself another time. 

Their onion rings are a must, very crispy, not burnt, and very delicious. The condiments bar with its various pepper are good. I like that I can stuff my burgers with as much jalapeños as I want to. Their shakes aren't fancy but not that bad I'd order them again.

This location gets pretty busy during lunch and the drive thru is weird cause it goes around the bank next door you might miss the entrance.

To be honest I've previously gone to another Habit Burger location, tried their double charburger combo, and kind of wrote them off cause it wasn't that great, little plain. Glad that I ending up attending the Yelp event held here cause it was a good chance to try Habit again and more of the menu and lets just say I've been a number of times since.

I apologized and said it was my first time. She assumed I had been there before. I was confused about the sides she was asking if I wanted. For that reason, I thought maybe I had to build my udon bowel. From the picture, it appeared that it included all the necessary ingredients that were in the picture. I guess the sides were if people wanted more tempura, etc. in their udon. In the picture, it seemed it had more than enough ingredients, so I passed on the sides. They need to explain their process a bit. Finally, I got the udon. It was just OK. It was a bit salty and didn't have a smooth-tasting dashi base.

It seemed busy enough, so our new breakfast adventure was a foot!

This place has a an older dinner vibe to it with loads of locals, you can tell by the hugs at the door when peeps walked in.  We were directed to a booth and told, ""I'll be right with you"".  At times these are the words I fear the most especially when places are busy.  Well, 15 minutes later I had to ask for service.

I ordered an all American-guy kind of breakfast - heavy/greasy and full of carbs!  I had eggs, hash browns and corn beef hash and a side of (according to their menu) award winning flapjacks.  My wife went healthy and order egg white omelet with spinach and a side of fruit.  My son had a stack of flapjacks.

~ corn beef hash was like saw dust with no potatoes... Very dry and dust-like

You wouldn't think this was a sushi place upon first entering the restaurant. Decor was more mid-atlantic coastal, odd for sushi but intriguing and inviting. 

We ordered a few of the house favorites - variety of oysters, amberjack crudo, tuna tartare, white fish ceviche, pork belly kimchi fried rice, and variety of nigiri. 

Server was nice, but we probably would have enjoyed our selections more if they didn't ALL come to the table at the SAME time. No kidding. Is this normal here or were they rushing us out?  Felt more like a buffet or ayce than a fine dining experience. Kind of ruined it for us.  When you pay $100+ for two, you expect better timing of the food coming out. 

Crudo was very good, with the tangy ponzu sauce.  Surprisingly, the cheap $1 NY oysters were quite plump and more tasty than the more expensive varieties. The ceviche was disappointing, flavorless other than an overpowering taste of lime. Needed more depth, seasoning and heat. Tartare was better, served with tasty waffle fries, and you do get quite a sizeable portion. Nigiri was decent, but unremarkable, as was the fried rice.

I had Bombero sauce put onto a carne asada Chimi this time, and it was FABULOUS.  Works better on a chimi than a burrito, I think, because the sauce makes the burrito tortilla ""wet"" and does not have the same soggy effect on the fried shell of the chimi.

The carne asada last night was smokey and awesome.  It has not been this good on my prior visits.  It was pure, smokey goodness this trip.

The chicken hard-shell tacos held together better too....after falling apart last trip.  I wonder if they changed their shell a little?  Anyway, they were delicious.

A word about the ""salad"" too - it is that micro-shredded lettuce and a few tomatoes and a little white Mexican cheese sprinkled on top.  And it was all perfectly fresh and delicious.

The staff upon arrival was rude and disorganized. They gave us a free cookie which is the only good thing about this dated and aging hotel. There are many many other hotels such as the Sheraton or Park Hyatt that for the same price point offers way better customer service in a much nicer hotel.

Its neighbors are everything related to cars - tinting, auto glass, car insurance - and Blue Nile.  In the land of neon, only the lit-up word OPEN grabbed our attention.

At 8:30 on a Tuesday night, we were the only diners.  The small bar was populated by Ethiopians.  We were greeted warmly by the owner(?), and given menus, which have no appetizers, drinks, desserts, or alcoholic beverages, just the entrees.  Thirteen of them, and that's it!!  I wanted honey wine and my husband wanted an Ethiopian beer, but they were out of both of them; the shipment from California that was supposed to arrive that afternoon didn't come, so we stuck with the delicious Las Vegas tap water.  (I never drink water unless it has coffee in in).

Roberto, whom I presume is the owner - or son of - was extremely patient with our inability to choose what we wanted to eat, but we finally settled on a meat combo and a veggie combo.  We had them combined onto one huge platter.  My favorites were the dry lamb, which was cooked to the consistency of shoe leather.  Normally I like my meat rare, and at first taste I was blown off by it.  But it grew on me, because the flavor was really intense - not spicy, just delicious.  I also loved the pureed yellow peas and the spinach mixed with some sort of cheese, which helped cool down some of the spice, as Roberto suggested.  The string beans were good, but they definitely started out life in a tin can, as did the plain spinach.  There was plenty of injera to mop up everything, but the best injera was the one lining the platter, since it soaked up the flavors of all the foods.  

My major complaint is that they need better napkins.  It's impossible to eat this kind of messy food and have to use the kind of tissue paper napkins you'd find in a stand-up dispenser at Taco Bell.  Nah, I think even theirs are better quality.

It's a nice concept but not so if you're looking for something more private and romantic.

Fun cocktail menu. I chose the cocktail of the day which was a sangria. Smokey and tasty! It was good! The only bugger was that we wanted Modelo beer but they ran out so they suggested us the Corona. Here's the little problem. They're the same price (7$). Usually the Modelo is pricier.

We ordered something small to snack before our JFL show. We got the large (7$) guacamole and the small (3,50$) frijoles. They both came with house baked tortillas. They came in the same sized bowl though. Hmmm. One of our tortilla bowl was bit and pieces like if they were scrapped from the bottom of the container.

Glad we sat at the bar. Great view of the tv and center spot. Bartender was good and told us about the new items on the menu from the other location. New items: bbq meats, catfish, veggies $5, salmon with veggies $16. 

Went for the usual trifecta mild sauce with snow crab legs. The best!! Always pair it with corn $1 and potato $0.50 each. Tried the clams - which was okay because these were the heavy shells and tiny meat. Skip on this. Also tried the salmon with the lemon pepper sauce. Sauce was good with the veggies but bland on the salmon. Use the trifecta sauce for the salmon. Veggies included bok choy, squash, mushroom, fall veggies. I'd say the veggies were well over cooked. 

The couple sitting next to us were a fun couple to talk to. And btw, the bar seating was now full. When someone orders a spicy level of 6 the staff yells and announces it to everyone.

Truly unctuous and delectable. The foie gras lobe was beautifully seared and delicately presented. The crispy cube of pressed sweetbread was beautifully crisp on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. Placed on a generous mound of the fluffiest whipped potatoes, it was a beautiful pairing. The classic escargot topped with housemade flaky pastry puffs was melt in your mouth delicious with the right balance of butter and garlic. I'm a sucker for ordering deviled eggs whenever they are on a menu and they did not disappoint. Ordered a bowl of their house cured olives and sauteed spinach to round out the meal and they surely did the job.

First of all, I don't know why I haven't done any lake reviews around here.  Maybe it's because I only went twice last year since my hubby seem to get annoyed when after swimming and fishing, I just want the canopy up, spread out my big towel over the seats, lay my  body down, hat over my face then I take a nice siesta.  You think?

This is by far, the best lake to take the kids fishing.  The water is usually calm and it doesn't get too windy like Lake Pleasant.  Anyone can catch a bluegill when you're fishing by the coves among the reeds.  Make sure you bring enough tackle and bait to lose to snagging....I guess that goes without saying for the seasoned fisherman/woman.

The marina has a gas station, tackle, bait, little store and water sports rental.   You can also dock the boat if you want to get some snacks or have a meal at the Lakeshore Restaurant (see review).

Lots of ""sandy beaches"" if you just want to spend the day by the water.  There are covered ramadas, only a little treck to the water. 

We try to get here before 6am...the parking is a clusterf*ck after 9am!

p.s.

Can everyone please pick up their trash?  There are trash receptacles all over the place...no excuse!  I gathered some floating empty water bottles and soda cans...plus who knows what's at the bottom of the lake!

I believe there is a choice of either a Hello Kitty or a Doraemon. 

We chose the two flavour soup base which was about $13~ in addition to $26~ per person on weekends. It came up to about $40 per person after taxes and tips. In terms of the meat selection, the beef was a bit cheap in quality but the lamb was decent - not really gamey. The shrimps were quite big and the pork neck was also another good option. Also a nice selection of vegetables and they tasted fresh.

Ordering was quite easy with access to an iPad menu. There were several occasions where some of the items we ordered did not show up so you end up having to reorder your items which was quite annoying.

The sides were mixed. The wild mushroom with tarragon butter was delicious. Good quality mushrooms, not over-cooked. The roasted cauliflower was overcooked - soft and mushy with no real mint 'pop'

Dessert was very good. Chocolate 'pudding' with a lovely salted cream topping.

After last night, I can say that I've been to a spot that is as cool and amazing as the Honda Center in Anaheim. 

I went to the James Taylor/Carole King show last night with my Dad. The crowd at the entrance to the arena was a bit much to handle, but it's Vegas...I can overlook this.

We were a few minutes early, so we had time to find our seats and whatnot. Since many of my followers know that I give ""extra stars"" for perfect bathrooms, this trip was no exception.

The bathrooms are this venue was PERFECT. Clean. Thank God. Usually stadiums, arenas and such have piss-poor (pun intended) bathrooms that smell from the entrance to the building, but MGM, you've done well.

Once you sit down in your seats, you'll realize that there is NO bad seat in this venue. 

The air conditioning was solid (114 degrees outside). 

Parking is great.

The best part? Getting out of the arena was a breeze. I was at my car within a few minutes. 

In summary, this is a fantastic venue, and one of the best places to see a concert. Staff is friendly, the lines for concessions are rather quick and short. Almost like a Utopian world.

The reason why it only gets 3 stars, is because it is incredibly loud.  If you want to sit down and be able to have a conversation without having to enunciate and scream, then this is not the place to go.  It felt more like a Bar/Lounge on a Friday night as opposed to a lunch on a weekday afternoon.  The reason why this restaurant is so sound-reflective is probably because of all the hardwood furnishings, and a tall, open ceiling. 

I ordered the Portobello Burger which came with your choice of sides (Salad, Soup or Fries).  I opted for the Onion Soup.  I like my soup piping hot, and when my order came, the soup was just slightly warm.  The cheese was a little bit too stringy and I found myself having to use my napkin many times to prevent the awkward spider-web-cheese-hanging-from-your-lip situation from occurring.  The burger was flavourful, served with tomato, lettuce, sun-dried tomato goat's cheese and pesto oil, but again, it was barely warm.  We also ordered a plate of fries for the table.  I found that they were not crispy enough, and the spiced aioli was nothing special.  Just felt like mayo mixed with Tobasco sauce.  

To finish I ordered a cappuccino and with everything else that came to the table today, again not hot enough.  I also found their cappuccino to be a bit on the weak side.

We were able to get both types of beans before but now we're told we're only allowed one type with regular size burritos. My boyfriend asked for more olives and the guy gave  him one more olive! If you watch them make your burrito, you can see how they're so diligent in giving you a small amount of everything.

The layout is similar to Kierland but feels a bit more open and the commons area with a fountain and a nice seating area for families or just hanging out.

As many have noted, the menu is very eclectic, or in a big identity crisis. Burritos, cajun food, Chinese, and Sri Lankan cuisine on the same menu? I am not sure if I have seen such a menu anywhere else. 

Our conclusion is that the owner might have a very postmodern idea on what ""curry"" means. Any creamy and liquid dish could be conceptualized as a type of curry--therefore the Southwestern chili and Louisiana gumbo on the menu! It suddenly makes sense! 

We stick to the Srk Lankan dishes and ordered Pineapple Curry, Chicken and Potato Curry, Batu Moju (eggplants), and Kothu the weekly special item. 

The biggest problem for KJ is the small portion. I was stunned to see the tiny portion of eggplants and pineapple curry. 5 of us each got one spoon of the dish, and that was it! The two dishes were definitely overpriced. Chicken and potat curry was pretty good, but too spicy (we ordered medium) for our group. 

The sizes were also inconsistent. Kothu came with a decent amount and was the most memorable dish of the night. 

We also ordered paratha after being told they have no naan or roti. It was very disappointing. I can make better paratha with the frozen ones from Asian groceries. 

KY failed to impress our group with its current style. We still had a good time trying Sri Lankan food, but we also all agreed that KJ should be a three star restaurant. With the same amount of money, you can easily get much better (and more) food in other places.

I did like that there is a private parking lot with plenty of spaces outside and that the interior was neat and clean. 

I came with a party of two for lunch on a weekend, and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were offered a small table for two while other two-people parties were offered larger tables. I didn't mind this at first, but after our dishes came and the table would no longer fit all the plates (the waitress almost knocked a plate off because of how small the table was), we were still not offered a larger table even though there was a four-person one right next to us and the restaurant was still mostly empty. Our waitress was very friendly, so I believe it was more a lack of awareness than ill intent, but it did make the experience less enjoyable. She also accidentally brought us regular coke instead of diet coke and mistakenly added an item we did not order onto the bill while failing to charge us for another item. 

Happy hour prices are super worth it for some dishes, but really not for others. We tried three happy hour dishes: fried octopus, fried soft-shell shrimp, and cooked salmon and avocado roll. Out of the three, I would really recommend the cooked salmon and avocado roll because it was a good size, cooked well, and worth the happy hour price. The fried octopus and soft-shell shrimp were less worth the happy hour price, and I definitely wouldn't recommend them normally priced. 

Fried octopus:
The fried octopus appetizer was very heavily coated in batter and over-fried so that the octopus was very rubbery. I appreciate that this restaurant offers baby octopus, but I had a hard time finishing the dish despite the fact that there were only five little octopi. There was a side salad on the bottom, and I nibbled at some to cut the greasiness of the fried octopus. 

Cooked salmon and avocado roll:
Like I mentioned above, I was a fan of this roll, especially for the happy hour price. This might be the only roll I would come back for out of all the dishes we ordered. I thought the salmon was nicely cooked, the pairing with avocado was classic, and the roll was flavorful without being smothered in sauce. 

Fried soft-shell shrimp:
These shrimp were fried in oil that was too hot so that the meat stuck to the shells. It was a good coincidence that the shells were soft and thus could be eaten, otherwise it would've been nearly impossible to peel off the shrimp from the shell. For the price of these, I thought three shrimp skewers was a small portion. 

Nadeshiko roll:
This roll was on the colored menu, but not on the paper one where orders are marked. I thought that this roll sounded amazing on paper, but in reality it was a textureless glob that really wasn't worth it. The spicy tuna on the inside was so minced that it was like baby food, although it did pack a nice punch of spiciness in flavor. The salmon on top was unevenly seared, and with the soft salmon and soft spicy tuna inside, each bite was a gloopy, soft puddle that I wasn't a fan of.

Arizona Cardinals roll:
Another roll that sounded amazing on paper, I think that this roll would've been tasty if the components had been executed properly. Similarly to the octopus and soft-shell shrimp, the soft-shell crab in this roll was over-battered and over-fried. This made the crab completely lose its flavor and become very dry, which wasn't alleviated by the tuna on top because it's a rather lean fish. I did think that the tuna was fresh, but I was confused by the soy-based sauce that came with this roll. It was bland and nondescript, and I much preferred regular wasabi and soy sauce to it for the roll.

I think it's unlikely that I'll be back a second time, but perhaps if I'm in the area I'd take that cooked salmon and avocado roll (at happy hour price) to go..",2017-09-28 07:35:30

I tossed my grocery bags in the car,  Grabbed my $4 and hiked across the parking lot to Boba Tea House.

Last time I drove by Boba Tea House, the place was packed.  Not true of this visit.  It was so empty the place echoed.  It's a cute place.  I like the couches, and they have a couple of lappies on a table at the side for people to use.  I am going to assume it is free because while I was there, a guy popped in, used a laptop, and left.  Either he's a regular and has an account, or it was free because i didn't see him pull out a card to credit to use it.

The Orange and Green wall menu has all the milk teas, slushes, snows and other beverages divided into categories.  Most are named for exactly what they are.  A couple are named for appearance.... like sunset, but not enough to confuse anyone.  There is also a section for snacks that has tasty tidbits that are perfectly sized for sharing.  I noticed coconut shrimp, and a few other little fried things.

I decided to have a coconut slush.  It was good, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.  It was a little bitter, and a was not blended as well as I have had in other places.  The snack I chose for lunch was the really delightful surprise.  I came for the boba, but now I am hooked on their calamari.  I have NEVER had fresher or more tender calamari.  It was absolutely perfect.  I'm always cautious about it too because most places overcook it til it is about the same texture as a bicycle inner tube.... this was delicious.  I had it medium spicy, which was MY mistake.  

Next time I will order my calamari spiced mild.  It's a good thing I got coconut boba to cool my taste buds after each bite.",2008-02-24 01:13:06

We got into Vegas this past Friday morning and I went straight to gambling and drinking, not the best idea when you haven't had anything to eat. After coming down $100 on blackjack, I went to the bar to get more drinks and forgot about what just happened, another not so good idea with an empty stomach.

Finally, when we went to Bouchon to eat, I only remember a few things after leaving the restaurant to yak in the nearby restroom, then eventually just leaving the restaurant to go to the hotel room and sleep. (Stay at the Venetian, it's beautiful!)

So from what I remember, the bread they give you is tasty and creatively presented along with butter.

The service is top notch, very elegant. You should dress up and have proper eating etiquette. They will say something. I was putting my head on the table (you know why) and they didn't like this.

I don't even remember what I got. I wanted to get the Steak Frites,which was probably going to be awesome, but I didn't get it. I choose something else that was cheaper because I sort of knew I was going to just leave the place and sleep.

From what my friends say, the pork belly and veal were delicious.

One thing I liked is that this place is sort of secluded on a random floor. You must take the elevator then go down its own corridor until you get to the spot with a great experience ahead of you.

That's all I can really say.

Where to begin?

Avocado habanero bacon ice cream.  The avocado adds a subtle element to the creaminess, the spice is perfectly balanced with the sweetness of the cream and then there is the bacon brittle.

Honey Lavender.  Not too over powering - just the right amount of honey balancing the floral element.

IPA ice cream - another fantastic choice.

For dinner, fella got the special - roasted duck with cherries on top and a side of Brussels sprouts with bacon and fingerling potatoes ($30).  I'm not sure he noticed how many times my fork wandered over to his plate, but delicious doesn't quite cover it.  I decided on the filet ($29), which was the first time I've tried their steak.  It came with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes, which were thick and fluffy at the same time.  The filet was good, but it had a mushroom sauce on top - I'm not a huge mushroom fan, and I should've asked them to leave it off because it gave the filet a comfort food/pot roast taste when I was looking for a rare, juicy meat taste.

Downtown Cleveland is definitely on the upswing with the East Bank, Convention Center, Casino, drastically increasing population, and over 1000 new jobs.

Didn't get reservations at the Yountville location when we visited Napa Valley a couple of years ago. I guess with the availability of ample restaurant options in Las Vegas, it is easier to find a reservation at the Las Vegas location.

We stayed at the Venetian during our visit to Las Vegas and while strolling by, ran into Bouchon. I didn't even know there was Bouchon at Las Vegas until that time. With no second thought, I immediately went inside and made a reservation for dinner on the very same day.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating area; each is beautiful in its own way. The indoor seating area has dim lights and very subtle and classy decor. The outdoor seating area is next to the pool.

We were served complimentary bread and butter. So delish. We skipped the appetizers and went straight to the main course.
- Steak Frites (It comes with fries by default; since I usually like mashed potatoes with steak, I asked them to substitute my fries with mashed potatoes
- Gigot d'Agneau

Both the dishes were delicious. Especially, the sauce that came with the lamb dish, ahhhh! Mouth watering. Al though we wanted to wind up the meal with a dessert, there was no room in our stomachs.

I still have a love affair with Sprouts. The produce is still terrifyingly cheap, the natural foods are still reasonably-priced and frequently on sale, and Double Ad Wednesdays are still the best thing ever. That being said, the deepest discount produce is a little dicier than it used to be; berries in particular suffer from the giant sale displays not being refrigerated. The stuff you envision crazy coupon ladies screaming about? Be prepared to dig for the best stuff. The less desirable produce--you know, the stuff you should probably actually be eating--is still in good shape even on sale.

The meat counter, on the other hand, is vastly improved. A few of the old slackers are still hanging around but the awesome new guys more than make up for it. I've actually had them offer to go dig around in the back for me, which was unthinkable a few years ago.

As part of last year's remodel, they've added a hot soup bar, fresh muffins (delicious), a giant artisinal cheese case, and (foodie trendwhores rejoice!) a gourmet olive bar. Better yet, not only has the bulk coffee taken over A WHOLE AISLE, but the dispensers are now at adult human height. Mmm. Bulk coffee.

If you've been to other Sprouts stores, do check your expectations before walking in the door here; this is store #1 and isn't as large as the later locations (never mind the former Henry's or Sunflower locations). You won't manage one-stop-shopping here, but Fry's is directly across the street for all your not-made-by-hippies needs.",2014-05-18 01:43:10

Pretty standard- definitely on the ""nicer"" side- Marriot rooms, but I have to say, the excellent staff really put it over the top for us. From the housekeeping staff, to the front desk, everyone was so sweet and service-oriented, all smiles, and ready to assist when needed.

The lobby is quite impressive with its glass-bubble chandelier. 

The pool area was just large enough, plenty of space, great sized pool and nice hot jacuzzi. Lush grounds.

Right across the road from some good restaurants, the FLW Spire, the freeways, yet tucked away from traffic. Very convenient.

I'd stay again in a heartbeat. Perfect for families. I booked through the Marriot website, used up some points.",2015-07-25 18:02:10

I have 2 offices in Las Vegas, 1 in San Diego, and another in Orange County, but find libraries to be a place where I can get a lot done in a small period of time. I'm one of those dudes that cannot work from home due to the distractions at home (i.e. TV, Bed, and the Fridge).  When I get those days where I have a lot on my work plate, there are times I prefer to do some admin/office work in a library.  Yesterday, was one of those days.  

My favorite library in Las Vegas is actually located in Centennial.  But if I am in the westside, the  Sahara West Library is the way to go.  This library is spacious and the main part of the library is a quiet zone. I have been warned a few times to limit my phone use or go to the lobby to make my calls.  I guess I'm use to the Centennial location where there's not too many people there and also my phone use isn't frowned upon.  But I get it.  A library is suppose to be quiet and I need to respect others while they read their books.  

Overall, I still love Centennial's and am a loyal to the library there.  But if I'm on the westside of Vegas and need that different type of focus, then you'll find me here.",2013-02-13 16:24:11

We arrived and were greeted by smiling faces with menus for us to choose our spa lunch.  We were then given the tour of the large facilities and were on our way to being pampered.  I kept thinking why I had not taken advantage of this place sooner.  I do live in the area and it seems a shame to not frequent this spa.  

The relaxation massage was just what I needed to loosen up after a busy work week.  As soon as I was able to get replenished my lunch arrived; salad, bread, fruit and cookie.  The portion was so surprisingly large that I could not finish it!  Up next; we decided to experience the steam room.  My skin felt about 10 years younger!  I am convinced I need a steam shower in my bathroom.

After lounging around for a few hours we ended the day with pedicures.  The staff is so professional and they use great products.

New restaurants are opening left and right in Las Vegas, especially in the downtown area.  One things for sure, La Comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food, appetizers, and fried food.  Here at La Comida, you get authentic tasting Mexican dishes.  When you think of Morton's, their steakhouse, N9NE, Ghostbar, and Rain comes to mind.  And because this is a Morton's establishment, expect no less than quality, upscale, and great service. 

My first thought upon arriving here was ""Wow"".  Although this place was packed on their very first night, we were greeted by almost every staff member.  Smiles are free and we got them.  My second thought, another ""Wow"".  Las Vegas' who's who was here tonight.  I'm not going to mention names, but the energy was surely in the air tonight.  

There's seating indoors, at the bar, and at the patio outside.  The ambiance includes an attentive staff, wide open restaurant, and a ton of people watching.  Can you imagine this place on the weekend? This restaurant was extremely busy, but there's no rush once you're in and no one seems to be rushing you out.  In other words, this restaurant has a chill feel to it.

As for the food, you really can't go wrong.  Everything made here is authentic. The food was so authentic that I even had a tough time reading the menu.  But our lovely server, Camila, took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short Spanish lesson. My main dish was their Carne de res a la Parrilla (beef skirt steak).  The steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers.  The wild mushrooms were so good that I could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte.  As for the steak itself, I wish I had seconds it was that juicy. Terri R had their Camaron de Golfo (buttered shrimp dish) and for dessert their Platanos Fritos (banana w/ice cream).  It's obvious that Terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing.  Plus, she told me numerous times ""I love my food"".  

It's awesome when new restaurants open in Las Vegas, specifically Downtown Las Vegas. Owners Jenna and Michael Morton open it's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week.  Jenna and Michael didn't miss a beat with their soft opening.  The restaurant was fully staffed, the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full, and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at DTLV.  Even better, they took the time to meet, greet, and take photos with everyone.  My suggestion...visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience.

So before I came here they had told me about the all you can meat part, so I thought hmm okay piece of cake. Boy was I Wrong! They kept bring us cute little trays of different type of never ending meat...about 4 trays all stacked full of meat. Now imagine that and multiple it by 8 or so different types of marinated meat. Chicken, fish, rib, steak, salmon, chorizo, liver, pork etc. Along with that they brought us little bowls of rice. With many different types of Asian veggies. It was sooo good. Thank God it was about 10 of us....but even with 10 of us it was still tough to eat all that meat. My friends like to eat so they kept ordering tray after tray after tray, literally. 

The restaurant itself is nice with the decor and all, so at the end the bill for each of us came up to $23.00 with included the all you can eat food and meat, drink and they had included a service charge which in my head had to mean tip, what I don't like is when they include the tip on the bill.

We came at a weird time (linner) so we were the only ones there. Obviously, we got our first pick on where to sit so we chose to sit next to the fireplace in the covered, outside patio overlooking Lake Jacqueline. Since we were the only ones there, service was very attentive.

This business is basically what it sounds like: it's a chain that specializes in serving multiple styles of noodle-based dishes. It has everything from spaghetti to pesto to plain old buttered noodles with meatballs. It also serves a couple soups as well and it looks like they're expanding and may be offering more sandwiches soon, too.

So yeah, if you like noodles and carbs, Noodles is the place to hit for a quick bite. It's not the fanciest food ever, but really, for what it is - a quick and relatively cheap lunch or dinner - it's just fine. Every time I've been here or any of its other locations, my friends and I have not been disappointed. The servers I've run into have always been nice and quick to correct any problems I've had with my meal.

Personally, I think this location may be my favorite. Out of all of the locations for this chain I've visited, this one (downtown) is the best; it's the biggest and has the most seating, it felt the most welcoming, and I wonder if the menu and drink options are a bit more varied than the ones at smaller places. It's been a while since I visited the alternate locations so I won't say this is a definitive, but at the very least, the downtown location gives the sense that it has more options, and that's a positive whether it's a feeling or a fact.

It seemed like an odd decision for them to open across the street from the hugely popular Globefish, but wise to the extent that El's can (and does) get spillover business. But it deserves to be a first choice (or at least an equal) in comparison with Globefish. El has a menu comprising a shocking 70 rolls and so far I've only sampled four, and have been coming back to two tried and true: an amazing avocado roll containing, and enrobed with, an ENTIRE avocado, and a ""spicy tataki maki"" with raw tuna inside, seared outside and spicy-sweet sauce all over- so good. But today I finally tried nigiri and fell in love with two gorgeous succulent pieces of unagi- at the best price in town ($2.50 currrently)- and they were not tiny. Rice is perfect too- and what great sunny service. I love this place! But I admit I have to sample more of the menu.

EDITED- I'm revising this place up to 5 stars after a few more visits; in fact El's is becoming an obsession for me as I try more things on the menu and the originality, creativity, quality and value become more apparent.

Thought the variety of things to do was fun especially since it seemed more catered towards the older crowd, however the arcade games were lacking. With a $5 game card, there wasn't much to play out of the 7 games available- some being out of order. 

Atmosphere is cool except that it was pretty dead on the dance floor side, especially having a live DJ and all.

Meal: We had the macaroni and cheese, creme brulee, and the pecan pie.  I had a cup of coffee and the fiance had a glass of wine.

Taste:  The macaroni and cheese was mediocre.  It was filling but it was a step above the boxed stuff.  The creme brulee was the worst I ever had.  However, the pecan pie with the citrus ice cream was maybe one of the top 10 desserts I have ever had.  Had it not been for the pecan pie, this would have been a very poor performance.  5 out of 10.

One veggie platter serves two (leaving you either stuffed or with lefotvers), and coupled with two sodas puts you out under $12 (just add in tip).  Just a tip, either accept eating with your hands, or remember that silverware is BYO.

The veggie platters come with about six dishes, always one or two lentils, a split pea (yellow), some kind of green, often either cabbage or beets, a salad (seasoned with a vinagrette, sometimes spicy, sometimes not), sometimes green beans, and one or two other legume based things that are usually unidentifiable and delicious.  I love Ethiopian dishes, they are so warm, savory, and spicy - with complex flavors (I wouldn't even know where to start to imitate it at home), and the tangy, yeasty injera (spongy crepe-like bread) rocks my world.  

My favorites on the veggie platter are always lentils, split peas, anything involving the cooked cabbage (often coupled with potatoes and carrots), greens (sometimes collards, sometimes others, generally finely chopped and stewed until delicious), and anything involving beets (also generally coupled with potatoes).  You don't get a choice for what comes on the veggie platter, just whatever they happen to be cooking up in the kitchen that day.  I don't think I've ever eaten the same meal twice.

Some people just want to watch a well made film in a comfortable auditorium and not deal with hassles.  If that sounds like you, I think you'll enjoy this theater.

You pick your seat when you buy it.  While not everyone follows the rules once in the theater, this is still a great system to ensure you aren't stuck in the front row on a big premiere night.  The seats are by and large comfortable, and the screens are fairly average size.  No big IMAX here, 3D, or 500 seat room.  Just a typical theater room.

The concessions serve alcohol (always a plus) along with more refined sounding menu choices.  That said, I've had a decent amount of the food and it's not that great, not to mention very expensive.  Speaking of price, the ticket prices have a mind of their own and change frequently based on some kind of Guerilla math they've come up with.  This is my biggest knock on Sundance.  But alas, you pay a premium in order to not put up with crappy films, crappy people, and most importantly - crappy advertisements before your movie.  The movies have a few previews and then they start, unlike most other theaters in this age where you are bombarded by silly cartoon characters telling you to be quiet and used car salesmen offering the local town's deal of the day.

I decided to leave an updated review because we order a seafood tower this time. We ordered Pacific Coast oysters on half shell, seared ahi tuna, jumbo tiger shrimp, the swordfish and scallops. The fish was cooked perfectly; it pretty much melts in your mouth. The sauce the scallop entree is cooked in is delicious. Oysters were good. Shrimp was HUGE. And the sauce the seared tuna came in was to-die-for. 

All the above was phenomenal. We racked up a pretty high tab including wine and whiskey but every penny was worth it.

I had it bookmarked for a while as the review on the foodie forum kept raving about it. The setup is your neighbourhood simple pizza/pasta joint in the main dinning area. They do have some private dinning rooms which will provide a more intimate setting (the main area had quite a few people with kids).
The pizza was said to be a must try so we ordered two (Puccini, Napolitina) and one of us ordered a pasta (Chili, garlic, pepper and parsley). 
The wine list is decent and I would recommend to ordering it by the glass as there quite a few  worth trying. 
The place was busy even for a week day. Service was decent and we were checked on regularly. We were given bread with some dipping oil (forgetful). 
The main on the other hand were worth writing home about. Pizza is very good with a nice thin crust, light tomato sauce, good cheese and other fresh ingredients on both the pizzas we tried.  The did provide some condiments and boy those chili flakes pack a punch and will give you a kick if you like your food hot. 
The pasta which I tried a bit was a surprise. I generally avoid having pasta outside but this one is worth trying out. Light yet highlighting the core ingredients. 
This place is worth a detour if you like Italian food.
4 Stars.
Update second trip elevated this place's position on the good pizza in the city/

The meals were EXCELLENT, especially for airport, and even worth the price! Taste, portions, temperature, presentation & variety, all fantastic!

Service was pretty good, except we were there toward the end of the evening, which felt like we were slightly secondary to the staff getting their closing activities done.

Little things like getting condiments out to the table right away or bussing glasses still being used... I get it, but when sweeping involves pushing chairs into yours then wet mopping the room STARTS in the walkway behind your chairs, it got a little ridiculous!

Somehow the overpowering smell of floor cleaner just negated what had been a wonderful culinary experience! Perfectly seared ahi, melt in your mouth burgers, layered pastrami, nice wine, craft beer... now a big cloud of Mr. Clean to run us out of there!

We had happily closed out our bill when asked and told we were welcome to stay and visit as long as we liked by our server. I had even called earlier for closing hours and was told they stay open until last flights.

Here's what could have happened  BEFORE dragging chairs around to sweep or slopping wet mops around the ONLY table with a family visiting at it: Just say kindly that the staff doesn't want to interrupt your group, but we're going to begin cleaning floors at the other end and you may be more comfortable moving to other seating in the airport terminal.

Upon entering, the one and only worker had answered the phone. After taking a carryout order for 6-8 minutes we finally got to order. He was nice though and acknowledged us waiting. 

Each order of food cost $10.88. I got potato and onion and potato and cheddar pierogis with sauerkraut and polish sausage. It came with crumbled bacon, onions, and sour cream (watery). The initial sour cream we got in small solo cups was warm. Got new ones that were cold but still had a watery consistency. 

The sauerkraut did not have any sour bite to it. It was below average. The polish sausage was also flavorless. The potato and cheddar pierogis are pretty good. Overall though i was not impressed. I would not be back. See photos for more details.

Tip:

We recently found and have been buying the Kasia's brand Pierogi's from Sprout's. (They are in the freezer case near the deli.) If you thaw them out in the fridge and then fry a half pound of bacon half way. Then put the Pierogi's in and finish cooking the bacon and Pierogi's!

One of my companions had to send a dish back for other reasons and the service was quite accommodating, so 1 star for that. Being the sucker I am, I just soldier'd through my abysmal pizza and decided to Yelp about it afterwards to vent.

And, it works at most places in America, except McDonald's.

At McDonald's, you pay for something at one window and hope to receive it at the next. But McDonald's doesn't believe in this concept. 
McDonald's believes in taking your money at one window and at the next, instead of handing over your food, they hand you nothing but a friendly smile and request you pull ahead, saying ""We'll bring your order right out when it's ready."" 
Fundamentally, this concept is wrong on many levels, but for the sake of verbosity, I'll spare you all but two.

First, as I said, I paid for something at the window. I want to leave the window with something other than some Mexican kid smiling at me with his gold-rimmed tooth, asking me in broken english to please pull up.

Second, I beat my ass in traffic to cut-off the car turning left into the drive-thru, and now, that fucker has his food onboard, and is likely picking at his french fries.
While I on the other hand am parked in the penalty zone for ordering something I knew they'd have to make fresh....something I knew they wouldn't have sitting under those little heat lamps for the last two hours. 

So I stopped going to McDonalds. 
Their sixteen year-old 'managers' AND their 'please pull ahead' concept can suck a big one. 

This is why I go to Whataburger. 
At Whataburger, I can get their signature burger, 'The Whataburger', (wow...go figure) a coke and large fries for somewhere around eight bucks.
My burger also has lots of mustard, pickles and jalapenos, (on request). All stuff I enjoy. 
And, they never ask me to pull ahead. Something I appreciate in a fast-food place.

Whataburger.
Where the only time you'll hear the person at the window ask you to pull ahead is when you take too long rifling through your bags, trying to find some salt for your fries, but are too stoned to locate practically anything.

Full kitchen with everything in there, full size fridge and fully stocked mini bar, all kitchen ware, it is great for long term vacation rental. I just loved the fireplace in living room, it was a very cold weekend, the fireplace helped a lot to keep us warm. 

This suite was perfect for throwing after parties, we had people over each night, had so much fun! I ordered room service each night, one time was for 2 bottles of champagne and orange juice only, the juice was freshly squeezed, so yummy, but $28 for OJ was still a bit pricey...

The service was not good the first night we were there, they didn't give us the large towels we requested, housekeeping didn't come to clean either, had to call a few times to complain. After my complaint, everything became great, fast and friendly service until we checked out. Bill for 3 nights stay was $1500 for that weekend. 

Overall I loved our 3 nights stay at the palms place, loved the smoking and casino free environment. There was a sky tube to walk to The palms for more restaurants and nightclubs. Really a great hotel choice for sexy & romantic weekend getaways.",2012-11-15 23:59:03

Tomato soup - it was over spiced and very acidic.   I couldn't eat more than one spoonful.

Lobster tacos - I have no clue where the lobster was.  Didn't taste like anything to do with lobster.  Honestly couldn't make out what was in that yummy black corn shell.  It tasted okay but not something I'd ever order again.

Chile Relleno - it was filled with cheese and grilled eggplants.  I didn't try it but my husband enjoyed it.

Passion fruit cheesecake - delicious!

Carrot cake ice cream sandwich - looked pretty but difficult to eat.  My husband ate the ice cream but had a difficulty with the hard shell.

2) There is only 1 ""party room"" where up to 3 birthday parties can be going on at the same time. I haven't seen the space for it but it seems like it would be distracting to have another child's birthday party going on in the same room. 

3) You have to purchase food through them or else they charge $50 if you bring outside food. I asked what other food options they have and they said they only sell pizza and soda. Not very health or diverse options.

4) They charge $21 additional for the parents to go out with the child. I can understand for older kids but 6 year olds often still need help with things and birthday party parents will want to check on their kids to make sure everything is ok.

It bordered on being too sweet. Now, I know to choose on the higher end of the scale. 

The pad thai had a mix of tofu and chicken. It had a heavy amount of red onion. It could've used more peanuts, and I prefer the crunch of fresh bean sprouts these were softened from being mixed into the noodles.

Service was great. Atmosphere is real nice. Lunch was $4.99, plus a buck for an iced tea. While it wasn't the greatest pad thai, but you can't beat the price. I think I'll skip the pad thai next time, but I'll return to try other lunch specials.",2010-02-24 22:26:18

Since then, I have had great experiences.  I will agree that most of the food is standard bar fare, most of which is probably frozen.

I tried their potato skin appetizer based on a recommendation from a friend.  They were amazing!  The best skins I have had so far anywhere.  The potato to cheese ratio was on point.  They were dressed with scallions and real bacon pieces.  They had this sour cream based sauce on top that sealed the deal.  The sauce definitely had a kick but it made them completely unique and delicious.

The bloody Marys are awesome as well.  Mixed perfectly with celery and olives.  The drought beer is always ice cold and the serve it in cold glasses, a must of course.  

I have also had the buffalo chicken sandwich.  They use two large chicken tenders rather than a whole breast which I didn't really prefer.  The sauce was great and the chicken was well dressed.  The lettuce, tomato and onion was fresh and the pretzel bun was great.  On that note, I should mention that the soft pretzel appetizer is also great, one of my favorites.  They serve it with a great spicy mustard sauce and cheese.  

The service is okay, nothing extraordinary.  The main female bartender that seems to be there mostly on the weekends is somewhat standoffish and not very attentive.  I   have had several other waitresses and they seem okay.  

We sit mostly outdoors on the patio which is okay.  It seems to be mostly occupied by smokers which can get old but I understand they sit out there for a reason and I can move inside if I really wanted to.  They have three big TVs on the patio and always have sports going which is great.  They can be hard to see because of the sun glare but no biggie.

Yeah so it was a big letdown when we get there and see a teeny little section for the sushi :-( 

With our dreams crushed, I couldn't fully enjoy how good the Chinese food, that was well represented, actually was.  I might have to give it another shot.

A super plus - they had the delicious sugar donuts here - which I highly recommend to get with a scoop of ice cream.  

So if you're looking for a good variety of hot and delicious Chinese food and a big selection of ice cream (yum!) and desserts than this is the place for you.  If you're looking for rows and rows of delicious sushi - you will be disappointed.

My boyfriend and I happened to be downtown and decided to pass through to see what's new and I wanted to look into grabbing shampoo bars to try out. I have really long, fine hair and it gets oily fast, so I want to find a suitable shampoo that will keep it light and oil-free but I wanted something with less chemicals. Best place to go would be Lush for an all natural product.

The staff here were all extremely friendly and helpful. Seems like while they're all extremely knowledgeable, they would pass your questions to the more expert staff on the floor so you know you're getting the best information. I had a lot of questions that pretty much were all answered. I picked up two shampoo bars based on their recommendations of my hair type and I like that there's a refund/ exchange policy in place incase you don't love what you picked up. They also gave me a few samples -- one being a conditioner that I think I'll definitely want to pick up next time I'm at Lush. I actually just wanted a sample of a face mask that I've heard mixed reviews about. And I don't have very good experience using the masks here. The staff listened to my concerns and ended up giving me something different to try. I did not end up liking that product. It made me very itchy and red, so I will probably end up going back to grab a sample of the original mask I researched. But it's nice to see that they are trying to give you what they believe is best for your skin.

I would say though that if you're like me and you research a whole ton before shopping, you maybe know what's best for your skin then despite how educated these people are. 

I kinda feel bad for them though because it sounds like they do a whole ton of trainings to learn all the information they need to know. =/ I hope Lush takes care of its employees1",2017-09-05 20:47:20

Like the sirens luring Ulysses, this clarion call spelled certain doom for my hunger. Backstory: I never noticed gyro places that serve breakfast, lunch and dinner till I started driving an ambulette through Cleveland's worst neighborhoods in 2005. Up till then I thought gyros only came around with the county fair or East 185th street festival. I didn't know city dwellers craved gyros so much. It was quite a revelation. 
The first one I always saw was by Indian Hills in the East Cleveland/ Euclid/ Cleveland demilitarized zone. Lovely neighborhood. Fast forward to 2009. I'm now a west sider and the Greek Village Grille opens up. Gyro prayers answered. This kept me satisfied until I saw the late night tv ads, followed by the Superbowl ad. That amazing jingle, that hypnotic belly dancing toilet paper roll alleged to be a gyro. This was the Norton furniture of Greek cuisine! I always told myself that if I craved smashed up lamb face, I was gonna hit this place up. 
And all these years later I finally went. On an eight degree winter Sunday morning. I got the jumbo and breakfast for the wife. It was still piping hot by the time I got back to Lakewood some 20 minutes later. That's good to go containers! They're embossed with the logo btw. Collector's item.

Anyhow, the food is solid, staff friendly and price point low. Pretty much the kind of place that gets my repeat business. Do I want a bumper sticker of the gyro for the whip? Fuck yes I do.

She has a great personality (which I have find speaks volumes when you are seeing this person almost more than you are seeing close friends and spending an hour or so of your time when you do). Collette use to have her own business in Lake Havasu before trading the life of lake and sun for the desert of Las Vegas. She tries very hard to be flexible with people, so if you schedule and need to reschedule or something, she's pretty flexible in trying to get you in at another time that is equally suited to both Lash Goddess and Clientess. I have inquired about doing colors with her and hopefully we will get to try those soon.
Pros:
Friendly
Moderately priced
Flexible
Professional
Great Personality
Efficient and timely (I haven't had to wait an extra amount of time when arriving for appointments, she books her time well)

Cons:
She is not at my beckon call if I can't make the original appointment I made
She hasn't started charging No-Shows a fee for not showing up yet (this kinda bums me out cause I could have gotten in sooner recently if the person would have just let her know she couldn't  make it/something came up)

However, I rarely hear noises from my neighbors, unlike other newer complexes I've lived in where the walls, floors, and ceilings are paper thin. The cabinets are cheap and doors come off regularly. Door knobs come off all the time. On the other hand, maintenance responds to issues either same day or next day and are very quick to fix everything. It's not ideal, but I honestly don't think it's such a huge thing that it would stop me from living here.
- Neighbors: For the most part I love my neighbors. Everyone is very friendly, polite, and considerate. I usually complain about dog owners (I am one myself), but the dogs here are well-behaved and I've never seen anyone not pick up after their dogs. However, I know based on what I see out there that people do leave messes in the grassy areas, but I just pick them up along with my dogs' messes and it's not even worth the hassle of getting upset. I would love if the complex paid the money to install doggy pick up stations like two other complexes I've lived in. They have one in the far corner of the property but it is not stocked with bags so it's pretty much pointless. It would be worthwhile to install more for sure.
- Neighborhood/Safety: Sketchy area and not within walking distance of anything. About 10 minutes from the 51, and 15 minutes from the 17 and 101. The view is beautiful. There are dumpster divers on occasion. The gates are almost always broken (but gates provide a false sense of security anyway). My license plate was stolen once. My car has never been vandalized otherwise. I feel safe within the complex, but I don't go for walks outside the complex. As soon as you head south it's super sketchy. When the weather is warmer, expect to see the police choppers at night investigating god-knows-what in North Mountain Park and the surrounding area. Last year was particularly bad and we saw the helicopters with spotlights on the mountain and in the parking lot nearly every night for about a month. Bizarre. But we have overnight security guards which makes me feel somewhat safer. 
- Management: Management has been responsive for all concerns and questions. They seem to recognize residents, even though this is a huge complex, so they really make you feel at home. There have been three instances where water was shut off for 20-60 minutes with no notice, which has been annoying and inconvenient, but 20 minutes isn't that long and again, it's only happened the three times in the year and a half I've lived here. 
- Grounds: The grounds are quite beautiful and well-maintained. The trees could use some trimming as there are dead branches that look as though they're going to fall off anytime. Pests are definitely a problem due to the proximity to North Mountain Park. I request monthly indoor treatment to prevent bugs and we haven't seen any roaches, spiders, or anything else in a year. Bees, however, are a different story. But we leave the windows and doors open when it's cooler out and I know it's kind of my own fault if they get in. 
- Interiors: The spaciousness, layout, and storage space are excellent. I live in a two bedroom, two bathroom apartment with a loft and we have PLENTY of space! I love the layout (except the fireplace in the center of the downstairs). We only have two windows in the entire apartment though. We do have skylights in one room which helps open it up, but definitely check out the unit you'd be renting prior to moving in. While the lack of windows helps the electric bill in the summer, it makes for a very dark existence which is somewhat unpleasant. We had to install track lighting which helped quite a bit but still looks unnatural. 
- Parking: Probably the biggest headache out of everything here. We have one spot for two people and if you come home after 7pm and try to find parking, good luck! We've had to park at the church across the street several times, which I am not happy about. I don't really know what the solution is to this however, aside from buying land that doesn't exist to make more spaces. So I don't know.",2014-04-08 19:45:20

The staff is usually pretty attentive, but we often feel like we get second class service as "" the white folk in the room"". We normally wait for beverage refills and the check.

If you can look past that as merely a cultural thing, you will like the offerings at Mekong Palace. The Dim Sum is plentiful and great quality. It's always hot, and the steam carts are on it like white on rice and a paper plate in a snowstorm! They are everywhere with the goods.

In addition to Dim Sum, we enjoy the sticky rice and other menu items. At least once a week, we get some BBQ pork or roasted pork from the window to take home. The only iffy item we ever got was a whole roasted duck for Thanksgiving. The kids were scared of it, then everyone got sick after eating it. Just a fluke I guess, since we've never had issues before.

With all the noise about bankruptcies at Eve and Beso. I was unsure how long the restaurant would be able to keep its doors open.

So far, so good. Beso is stayin' alive. They actually had a large crowd dining last night. I would not expect tables to be near capacity on a Sunday evening, but they did just that.

We received warm bread and soft butter to get us started. That's always a good combo, all too often we run into room temperature bread and ice cold butter.

With the voucher we had our choice of appetizer, two soups or salads, two entrees and a shared dessert - no choice offered, but we could substitute a side dish, if we wanted.

We began with calamari. This was a good version, tender with a light crisp breading. Topped with tomatoes, peppers, cojita cheese and served with lime and two dipping sauces.

Next, we had the Beso Caprese with avocado and the seafood louie salad.
The caprese was the better choice by far, there was nothing notable about the louie - at all. The seafood didn't seem fresh and the salad was overly dressed.

Then, for entrees, Frank had the 16oz NY strip and I went with a 12oz filet. Both were really good, with a nice crust. Neither of us could finish.

I've only eaten there once and it was for breakfast. I was delighted to see a full two pages of interesting, creative options for breakfast. This place is run by someone who is interested in food, not just selling stuff. I had the breakfast basil sandwich. It wasn't just an egg on a crappy bagel, but an egg with crispy bacon, creamy goat cheese, fresh basil and tomato on a soft/chewy bagel. The side of potatoes was a mixture of white, sweet and blue potatoes. I'm not certain, but I think they are baked rather than fried. In any case, they were not at all greasy and were entirely delicious. 

Service was fine and the place is comfortable and clean. It's the kind of place I'd be willing to drive 30 minutes to visit. All the better that I can WALK there. I can't wait to go back again and again!!! Hope dinner is as good as breakfast.",2009-11-18 17:13:18

I've only been in here for lunch but wouldn't be opposed to coming by for dinner some time. There's something different about this Chinese place compared to so, so many others camped out in Food Lion shopping centers throughout the South.

So many of those other places often feel so gimmicky. Cheap meals with a front of being authentic Chinese. While I've only had the lunches here so far (which fit firmly into the ""standard American Chinese food"" category) I get the feeling that they're legit here. They're not actually strictly staffed by Chinese people. Oddly enough, that's indicator number one that they might be authentic.

Anyways, staff here has always been super nice and helpful. Easily among the friendliest staff I've met at a Chinese restaurant. They actually take time to talk to you and get to know you. They sport mini iPads for taking orders and I'm sure that enables them to get to tables quickly without having to run orders back to the kitchen constantly. I've never met with a delay on receiving my food here.

The food flavor and quality isn't anything to write home about. Again, basing this entirely on the lunch menu right now. I'd really like to take a shot at some more authentic stuff. I've had the sesame chicken and it's honestly a bit plain. But this won't stop me from going back in again for lunch. They move quickly and you can get full and pay tip for $8.

 Like other reviewers have said, the chips and salsa are very good, but most other items are average.

The service has been slow most times and I think it is a bit pricey but prices are on par with most casino restaurants.

A couple of high points; the decor is awesome-it really reminded me of Pueblo Bonito resorts in Mexico (trust me, it's cool), and the mole. Mole is hit and miss, and Mi Casa's is a hit for sure.

Yes, it does actually look like an outdoor beer garden in Germany, but this is not an outdoor beer garden, or Germany, or Dubai. This is Calgary and we are indoors. No restaurant in Germany is going to decorate themselves like this. Yet this place decorates a German exterior into an interior, which is ridiculous. Apparently you cannot just have a good German restaurant and kinda make it your own. Oh no, you have to mimick something else, otherwise you can't justify $40 a plate. 

We instantly go downstairs. Again, kinda mimicking the German Beer Hall look, but not as abrasively. I love the benches, it forces people to share shit, which Calgarians seem really reluctant to do. The kitchen has a wide open view of the place, which is SOOOOOOOOOOOO vancouver/unoriginal/retarded. The kitchen is the place you hide in a restaurant; not expose pretentiously. 

The TVs are lame as well, but, I've bitched about this relentlessly towards every bar in this city, so, you know. But credit to them: the volume is loooow and therefore people were talking at a normal tone instead of shouting like baggage handlers around an aircraft engine. 

I thought a beer would calm my nerves. I do not see a waitress so I assume this is a 100% authentic German beer hall where you just go get your own fucking drinks and tip them nothing because everything is so fucking expensive and the service is mechanical and bureaucratic at best (which it was at this place! 5 stars for German authenticity!). I look at the beer list, and good fucking lord, each beer is $9 and up.

So I say: ""ok, what's on special?""
Bartender says: ""creemore springs!""
I say: ""yehyeeehh!""
Bartender proceeds to wash glass, I realize something terrible and intervene
""Uh, how much would that be?""
""$6.50""
""HAHAAH for some shitty beer from southern ontario?""
""yep""
""hahahaha fuck that"".

We fucking leave. $6.50 is the cheapest domestic beer, ""on special"". this place is really trying to mimic the German beer hall experience, right down to the pricing...but of course, tips are expected. fuck off. i'll buy some Hacker Pschorr from co-op and drink them in the parking lot behidn this establishment....drinking behind high end beer halls: also an authentic german experience!

I had read all of the good reviews on Yelp and my dad grew up in Beechview so I thought that it was a perfect place for lunch even if the menu is somewhat limited.  We arrived to Musa at around 11:30 and tried to enter through the door near the bar only to find it locked.  We were confused and tried again before a fellow customer let us in.  Musa is divided into two very distinct areas, the bar and the dining room.  We sat in the latter and so I didn't see much of the former.  It was decorated in a fun manner with green paint and some vivid art.  There was also a TV on the wall and you could see a window to the kitchen.

For lunch on this day I ordered the shrimp po boy while my dad went with the seafood gumbo.  Since it was our first time at the restaurant we were given some plaintain chips with chimichurri to start our meal.  Holy crap were they good!  The plaintain chips were fried up nicely and salted to perfection.  However it was the flavorful chimichurri that I loved.  As a matter of a fact this dish is why I will make sure to bring my wife here at some point.  Anyways, after we had finished those up our meals came out.  My shrimp po boy was good.  The bread that it came on was crusty in a good way and the shrimp were fried nicely.  The caribe sauce was a nice addition although I still may prefer remoulade.  What was nice is I was also asked it I wanted some hot sauce and was given a choice between a regular one and a scorpion.   I assumed he meant Trinidad scorpion whenever he said it was really hot.  So I treaded lightly with it and loved the spice it brought to my sandwich.  As a side to my po boy I once again got the plaintain chips and chimichurri I had earlier but this time there were also cassava chips.  All of it was as good as the first time around.  After I had finished I asked my dad if he liked his gumbo and he agreed that he did.

The service and food were very good, as was the coffee.  There is a good variety on the menu, and their prices were very reasonable.  I've always been a huge fan of mom & pop owned diners and restaurants, and 'Yours Truly' is no exception.  They are priced much lower than the national chains, and the service was faster.  My only gripe, and it is a small one, is that the floor looked very dated.  The tiny square tiles and grout reminded me of our master bathroom, circa 1972!",2017-11-15 18:48:48

Charkha delivered an extreme mix of an experience. Went at 12:30 pm during Saturday Lunch for the buffet. Great naan, but not very good Daal or Palak Paneer. Great gravy for the chicken, but dry tandoori chicken. Limited selection for the price (no pakoras or samosas or anything). Not very good idli sambar. 

What started out with the potential to be a truly great Indian restaurant, even without the qualifier ""for Cleveland"" unfortunately is now at a point where it is an OK restaurant for Cleveland.

Regardless the chicken fingers were out standing!! great batter, crunchy but light, not greasy in any way. The fingers were huge too, seriously, no kidding, the size of a baby's arm lol... huuuge... i ordered 6 which comes with your choice of side, but just in case the serving was small, i thought I'd try the mac and cheese too. Well first off, the 6 finger meal was huge, i could barely finish it. the shoestring fries were excellent as well. The only disappointment was the mac and cheese, i found it very lacking in flavour, the crushed croutons on top were a decent idea, but seemed a little stale to me. it really needs to be finished in the oven and wasn't. The other issue was the lack of cheese sauce, it was pretty dry. I tasted more pasta than cheese, it really needed to be much creamier and cheesier. Overall, i was very happy i ordered from this place, the food was surprisingly delicious, well except for the above mentioned mac and cheese, it wasn't awful,, but for a Chef David Adjey creation, it was not good, very substandard. My guess is That dish is likely not being executed to Chef Adjey's standards, i suppose this is what happens when you have other people making your food. Some people just don't have as much pride in what they produce nearly as much as the chef. 

Will i order again?? hell yes... (and I did) the chicken and fries were crazy good. will i order the mac and cheese again? hell no.... I want to try the roasted chicken, but man the buttermilk fingers keep calling me... maybe one day I will... for now it's all about the fingers, or maybe we should rename them to arms! :)

EDIT: I had the Mac and cheese again, just to be sure what i originally got wasn't a bad batch, sadly it was EXACTLY the same as the first time, again a very pasty texture, seriously lacking any cheese sauce, the strongest flavours were from the pasta itself and the fairly bad crushed croutons on top. REALLY disappointing, especially since this is from a renown chef.. Chef Adjey, i hope you're reading this.. your crew obviously isn't executing your recipe properly.. i hope thats why at least :) outside of the mac and cheese this place is pretty great. just stay away from the very bland, very uninspired mac and cheese.",2016-06-04 18:54:32

Walking in, the decor feels dated. We we're sited almost immediately. This place advertises itself as an Asian steakhouse. So naturally, I ordered the steak + fries (it comes with rice / pasta but you can add $1 to swap it to fries). It came fairly quickly. 

The presentation of the dish looked like it came out of those minute dinner plates. The steak was small and the fries had a darker golden color to them. It didn't taste any better than it looked. The steak was overcooked and over salted, the fries were greasy and soft. The funny thing was, the waitress never asked how I'd like my steak even though it's suppose to be a steak restaurant.

Our waitress was incredible she was nothing short of lovely smart and very consistent with making any of our needs happen. We gave her a $10 tip and suggested to her to find a new job somewhere else for her talents can be appreciated. The food however was absolutely disgusting I ordered the triple bacon burger which I would assume would have triple the bacon and had two tiny slices of bacon on top. I I was hoping it at least would taste good. It did not the Baconator from Wendy's has more bacon than this did and the taste is much better. Now for $12 for a burger I would expect more. My partner had the steak and shrimp parmesan he looked nauseous as he ate it. We both just got through our meals and hoped we could just finish. I'm sorry we both agreed we would never go back to Applebees again. We told our waitress over the huge concern over our food however I know there's nothing she could do about it.

G4XAFdCJ2sYavdmIQBUL4w,IBiHQzvzP01UNuLbADSz4A,rCijkoXaqx3DwL-Qp_Vy7A,4,2,1,3,"Egg-themed breakfast places...our market is inundated with them. Each one has it's own little piece of flair that they bring to the table to set it apart from the rest.  The Good Egg actually has a couple of highlights that will undoubtedly bring me back.

First things first...I love the menu! It's breakfast, so of course, there MUST be eggs! This menu offers an obscene number of options. The part of the menu that most intrigues me is the healthy options section. There's something called ""La Casa Potencia (Power House)"". This thing is DELICIOUS! 

The power house has 6 scrambled egg whites w/ diced chicken, fire roasted green chilies & bell pepper, topped with fresh pico de gallo. served with house black beans, a large whole wheat tortilla and salsa. All said and done, this delicious concoction has 51 grams of protein. FIFTY ONE GRAMS OF PROTEIN! Now THAT'S the way you want to start your morning!

One quick word to the wise. If and when you order this meal, find a way to get the beans on the tortilla without the juices. If you just dump the beans on top of the eggs, you'll end up making a great burrito...that leaks like a sieve. So, it's delicious...but it's messy. Still...worth it!

A common theme in my reviews is my love for a good outdoor seating area. This particular location (one of 15 in the Valley) has a PHENOMENAL outdoor seating area. It's absolutely gargantuan. In all honesty, I think it's about the same size as the actual seating inside the restaurant. 

When we were last there, it was late morning. There wasn't a single drop of sunshine shining directly on the patio. Needless to say, the weather was fantastic. Granted, it WAS in early fall, so the weather is typical perfect. But, in the summer time, this patio is still going to be shaded from the sun, thus, a great way to enjoy the outdoors without completely melting.

In the Valley, you have dozens of egg-themed restaurants from which to choose. However, I feel like I've found my favorite! Low calorie/high-protein menu, great prices!

The wait was probably 30 minutes, but the beer selection and the ability to get the beers in different sizes made the wait a non-factor.

Sat at the bar and the prices were more than reasonable with very laid back friendly service.  Not the world's best BBQ, but very good.  The atmosphere learns a lot to the senses and I enjoyed the meal.  The smoked sweet potato was a perfect side dish.  Rib tips were not the meatiest tips I've had, but very good.  Wife had the brisket and was impressed.  Not too moist, not too dry, the way she likes it.

Serving size isn't huge, but enough to fill the belly after some beers.  Definitly a worth while visit.

- Greek salad
- Braised Beef (both frozen & fresh)
- Portabella mushroom tortellini (frozen)

I mean, it's a 24 hour pizza delivery joint in the heart of ASU campus. It's a tasty traditional NY pie. It's perfect hangover food. They sell giant 32in pizzas and they deliver quite far. This is a family owned place, and they recently remodeled and changed up their menu. 

Gus's has always been fast, reliable, and convenient. From the looks of things, they are always looking to improve as well. They aren't pretending to be fancy gourmet artisan pizza. At the same time, they aren't some huge chain. The owners are cool, and I prefer to buy local.

It can get a little crazy here after the bars close, but that shouldn't stop you from ordering delivery. There's a reason this place is swarming late nights and it isn't just because it's the only place open (because it isn't). When you've been out drinking, this stuff hits the spot like nothing else. 

They have online ordering and great specials. If I were still in college, this would definitely be one of my main go-to places. It's probably more of a 4 instead of a 5, but I'm going with 5 for two reasons - it's a perfect example of this type of pizza joint, and it definitely deserves higher than a 2 star rating.",2012-07-28 23:11:41

Turning to Yelp, I put the car in gear and headed towards South Park and Piedmont Row. Quite busy when we arrived, there was no reasonable parking to be had. It seems that some people have a different definition of ""compact"" that somehow includes the Toyota Land Cruiser and Mercedes S-class. So I handed over my car to the complimentary valet and we headed inside.

Despite not having a reservation, the hostess was able to bring us to a table immediately. She left us with the regular menus as well as the Queen's Feast menu plus the wine list. Classy surroundings, I felt seriously under dressed in jeans and a polo shirt. It just has the feel that something fancier would have fit in better.

While it took our waiter a few minutes to arrive for our drinks order (no, they don't have a non-alcohol wine), he was knowledgeable, friendly and exhibited a welcoming spirit. I chose to order from the special menu, starting with the mussels and then having the garlic and mushrooms pappardelle for main course. A good sized portion of mussels arrived in a creamy sauce that had onions and was soaked up well by the fantastic sliced French bread that was brought to the table. If you're a mussels fan, you'll love these.

Rather than try the soup, my wife read the Yelp reviews and went straight to the goat cheese and caramelized onion tart. Thank goodness, she let me have one bite. Heavenly. Absolutely excellent! And for her main course, she selected the roast duck breast. Medium slices of tender duck on top of a parsnip puree with roasted Brussels sprouts. Amazingly good stuff.

For dessert, we split a creme brûlée. Perfectly candied shell on top, creamy filling with two perfect raspberries as garnish.

I kid you not, my wife said ""That was the best meal I have ever had in the United States."" So it has that going for it.

First thing's first, I love Olivier!! Anything he said, I believed! And because he said the Yellow Curry baguette was one I should try, TRY is what I did. And yes, Olivier does it again! Such a great sandwich, with a touch of spice, and a cup of tomato basil soup... This had to be the best lunch I've ever had!

Olivier charmed my friend into trying the Moroccan baguette (which I will have to try next time), and she also fell in love with how well-made the sandwich was.

For dessert, we tried the newly made Peach Tart, which was UHHMAAYYYZIINNNGGGG! It was not too sweet, and just the right amount for both of us.

I have never had an issue with any staff member outside of Dr. Shahrestani.
He is the worst of the worst! He inspired me prior to this yelp review to write a certified letter to their owner. 
He's rude.. annoying.. obnoxious.. When I initially started coming to SMD he was my dentist and recommended some work to get done. This work was greater than 1200 dollars. Me being naive signed on with the assumption that my insurance would pay. After battling my insurance and speaking with them over several months it was determined that I didnt need that work and that If I indeed need the work there were less expensive options.Dr. Shahrestani DOES NOT present his patients with all of their options. He always presents the MOST EXPENSIVE option and leaves you feeling like you have no other choices. 
I cannot even begin to imagine how many patients have left this location because of his antics.

The Garganelli was the biggest portion & the most filling. It had bolognese sauce & gorgonzola cheese. One of the most popular dishes, Eloté Style Scallops, seems quite simple but is something I'll be craving from now on. It was that good!

My husband and I stayed here with his company for their annual meeting that was held in the resort.  When we first drove up the signs to find the hotel entrance were non existent so we had to park in self park and walk through the casino.  Fine, whatever, its Vegas.  Except there is no clear way to get from the casino into the hotel...we were very lucky another guest showed us the super secret door. 

Our room was nice, nothing spectacular, and nothing compared to other rooms in Vegas.  That first night my husband's company hosted a cocktail reception for us that took place partially outside by the pool.  They were varnishing the pool area that night so we were treated to fumes and bright flood lights!  Excellent!  The next morning I woke up and grabbed an apple juice out of the mini fridge.  I took once sip and almost spit it out- something was not right with the juice.  Turns out that it was expired by 3 months.  It turns out EVERYTHING in our fridge was expired by 3 months!  It took 3 calls to get them to bring up new juice.

Oh, but I haven't gotten to the part where the fun really begins!  I am getting ready for the formal dinner that the company hosts and I go to put on makeup.  I realized that my Louis Vuitton bag (makeup inside) as well as a vintage beaded clutch were missing!  Gone! Completely! 

What ensued after that was nothing short of insanity.  GVR kept hinting that my husband stole the bag.  Yeah, ok.  They ""investigated"" and their conclusion was ""well, the maid said she didn't see it, so she didn't take it.  Are you sure you even had this bag in the first place?""  Wow, thats not insulting, not at all.  I fully admit that I should have tried to stuff my bag into the tiny safe they provided.  But they should have been at least a little more responsive to the fact that one of their guests was robbed in one of their rooms.  We were given the complete run around everytime we called them, bounced from department to department.  On our last day there we had no other option to call the Henderson police...who we quickly realized were going to be of no help since they don't conduct their own investigation.  If GVR had at least treated us with a modicum of decency and respect it would have been a different story.  But it was more than obvious to us that this was a mis managed property concerned with nothing more than making $$, certainly not concerned with their guests satisfaction.

Some other things about GVR I didn't like-

- The half sand pool.  Totally a personal preference but I am not a fan.

- The distance from the strip.  Don't believe them when they tell you its close, its not.  Its at least a good $25-30 cab fare each way. 

- The ""shuttle"".  The Shuttle to the strip runs very infrequently and stops early in the evening.  It also only carries 14 people...so if you aren't one of the first 14 in line you have a long wait ahead of you.

We hadn't seen American Casino before staying here, then got to watch a couple of episodes after staying.  If that show didn't make it more than obvious that the hotel and casino were mismanaged. . .needless to say we were horrified when we saw the episode where they had to close the restaurants for health code violations.

This one was so simple it is unfortunately they couldn't get it right and still didn't in the end. My Hubs ordered the Reuben with NO 'rocket sauce', but thousand island dressing on the side, please. Our server even wrote it down. Easy, peasy!

1st attempt: Sandwich came out covered in 'rocket sauce', no thousand island on the side. Sent it back. 
2nd attempt: Sandwich came out covered in thousand island. Sent it back because it was soggy.
3rd attempt: Sandwich came out with thousand island on the side but without mustard on it. 

I then had to track down a manager (because surprise, surprise, our server went MIA). The manager offered to bring the mustard over. Great. He brought over two types of mustard with an apology and offered to comp the sandwich. That was nice! 

Now that you have the back story, here is the real reason I am writing this review...

Another ""Manager"" came over and apologized and offered a dessert. We didn't want one, but our friends accepted the gesture. Great.

Bills come: Sandwich not comp'd and both couples were charged for dessert with a -$0.50 (yes, fifty cent) discount. What? I will not bore you with the ridiculousness that came afterwards, but it took them a total of 7 (seven) attempts and 45 minutes to get our bills right.

Honestly thinking about the seafood, I almost enjoyed the seafood the most. We had a fantastic Bacalao cod dish that was reminiscent of the Italian baccala dish I love, but a Spanish version. I also loved the octopus, which was grilled to perfection. An unexpected and maybe favorite dish was the fresh tuna crudo with delicious peaches. It was such a great summer dish. 

We ordered a huge charcuterie board with literally all the meats on the menu. I'd imagine we had about 10 meats on the tray. They were all fab, but my favorite was probably the Sherry Pork Salami. Full disclosure, we had a group of 6 people... So we may have over ordered too much food! By the time our last dishes came, we were all pretty full! Our last dish was the wings, which I did enjoy, but again, it was the last dish and we were stuffed!

A couple of the sides I loved too were the pickled carrots and the heirloom tomato gazpacho... Which is a huge bowl and maybe not the smartest thing to order with a ton of other foods, because it was so much food!

I don't gamble, but I like to go to see my friends and family and people watch lol.  But this is a very nice casino that is nicely designed.  I wish that the parking was attached, so that I wouldn't have to walk to my car (doesn't feel safe when it's late at night and if I'm alone).  It is nice that they do offer free parking if you play for 30 minutes or if you are at least a Diamond Club member.  There are two nearby lots for free self-parking, one of which is an indoor garage.  They are each located on opposite ends of the casino, which is nice because it opens up your access to another area of downtown.  They also offer free shuttle service between the parking garage and casino.  They have a small food court with Corky and Lenny's, B Spot and an Italian dining option on the second floor.  In the basement, they have the buffet which is very extensive and has a variety of cuisines: Asian, Italian, American, Southern, carving station, dessert station and more!  Their prime rib carving station is delicious, and they have pretty good Asian cuisine.  If you play the house table games for long enough, you can ask a manager for food vouchers (hint hint!).  This casino always has giveaways and raffles, where you can win big money for slot play, cars and gifts!  They definitely make it enticing to keep coming back!
This casino isn't very big, even though it is four levels.  But I heard through the grapevine that they are building a much larger facility in the flats, and that soon this location will be limited to just certain games.
The only other downside is that they don't give free drinks like Vegas!  But I am pretty sure that it is a state law that you cannot give free alcohol, unless they are sample sizes.  However, if you are a Diamond Club member, there is a lounge on the top floor, where you can get cocktails for only $2, and I believe that non-alcoholic beverages are free (don't quote me on that...

Like any arena or theater, the seats are small and close together. What I disliked about the seating was that the flooring was aluminum like sports bleachers, and did not feel particularly sturdy as you were inching down the aisle to get to your seat. Also note the lack of support poles/beams to use as handrails. I'm surprised I didn't see more of the old people in the crowd stumbling or falling.

There was plenty of helpful staff to find seats and direct you to bathrooms and such. Assuming you can see the floorplan before you purchase tickets, I'd hesitate before saying ""there isn't a bad seat in the house!"" and say to try to stick to the midway point of the auditorium or closer for the best view.

The first time around I ordered soft shell steamed bun, tasted AMAZING! From what I remembered it was fried and what made it amazing was their sauce that came with the steamed bun. I also ordered their top orders which was the pork belly ramen. Again, the flavor was amazing!!! The pork is crispy, it comes with egg, and kimchee and of course the ramen. 
The second time I visited, I ordered their pork steamed bun, again their sauce and how the pork is cooked makes it the best! And for my meal I ordered their seafood ramen soup. Their noodle is more of a udon soup rather than ramen but still tasted good! The seafood inside the soup was fresh, not over cooked either. The best part of going to this place is their service. They are quick to serve and will take good care of you especially Mike whom does a nice job making sure you are taken care of.

The food has gone downhill since the last time I've eaten here. Menu looks FABULOUS, great photos, but the food tasted freezer burn/from a box and bland. Very unexpected and disappointing. I literally lost my appetite after trying my dish, it was a rice bowl with mahi and shrimp. So NASTY! I recommend the chicken quesadilla instead, those are tasty. The environment was nice but out dated, I feel it is due for a remodel. When we sat down the dining room was very hot, I noticed many people outside on the patio but I prefer eating indoors.

Fits right in with the other family owned restaurants in the neighborhood (e.g. Sofra, Villa Dolce, K Peppers). A wonderfully pleasant, welcoming, and courteous family, and my oh my, can they cook!

Fresh chips and salsa - a mild red, and quite a spicy green salsa (slash hot sauce). The green was too spicy for me, but the hubs loved it. Horchata was yummy, and the drink menu quite expansive! Tried one of the signature cocktails - Cantarito - ""little jug"": fresh squeezed orange, grapefruit and lime juice + house tequila. Spicy salt on the rim. Try it!

Couldn't resist ordering the shrimp ceviche - just don't see that on too many menus around here. It was clearly freshly made, and served with chips and slices of avocado. Happily, we were so full from our entrees that we had some leftover for tomorrow's lunch!  $10.99 - on the pricey side, but that wouldn't stop me from ordering it again and again.

Taquitos ahogados - seasoned crispy chicken. Unfortunately the sour cream, lettuce, pico and guacamole as listed in the menu were missing from the plate, but the awesome green sauce that was served with it made up for it - tangy and delish - we can think of many things we would love to smother it on. The usual refried beans (nice contrasting texture with pureed and regular beans) and rice. $9.49.

Tacos - ordered one fish taco ($2.99) and one vegetarian taco ($2.25). The biggest bargain on the menu. The fish - so flavorful, and perfectly grilled. Sauteed onions, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese on corn tortillas. The veggie ones - WOW. It can be so hard to find good vegetarian options at Mexican restaurants - often the veg taco is simply beans, lettuce, tomato and cheese. Not here! Broccoli, zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, rice, beans, sour cream, avocado and cheese (easily can be made vegan, and would be just as yum). Veggies were all perfectly cooked with just the right amount of crunch remaining. The same veggie option is available for EVERYTHING! Burrito, fajita, huarache, tostada, gordita, sope, you name it! I am hopelessly addicted to cilantro, so asked for some extra, and they brought it out in the most adorable little tortilla bowl you have ever seen (see photo, and yes, I ate all of it).

This place is notoriously terrible for customer service and the food is always inconsistent. The first few times I came here with friends after work, the food was alright. I have tried the papaya salad, the pad thai, the pad ""z-u,"" drunken noodles, chicken wings, tom yum, and the thai bbq chicken. 

Best dish here is hands down the chicken wings because they are the only things that are consistently good. It is insane how that statement can even be said about a thai spot especially since they are just frozen wings that are deep fried with a little sweet thai chili sauce with cilantro. 

The pad thai here is overly sweet and sometimes drenched in sauce. The pad see ew inconsistently comes with flat noodles that are broken up and it almost does not even feel like a noodle dish because there is so much inconsistency with the way the noodles are in this bowl. Same principle goes for the drunken noodles. 

The tom yum soup is ok at best, unless you come at a time where they serve it to you at ""room temperature,"" and it is super sour at other times. I stopped ordering it altogether because it came out super salty the last time and the salt kick was disheartening more so than the times it was at a wrong temperature or when it was sour. There is zero flavor balance. 

Thai bbq was good when I ordered it, but the portion was very small for what I had grown used to at other thai spots around town like PinKaow. 

So, after review of all the food I have had over the dozen times I have been there, I can say the food is a close  2-3 star experience for your money. However, with the service also having consistency in being awful every time I am there, I give that a solid 1/2-1 star experience. 

This spot is open late night, so it limits options for thai for all hours, but honestly, I won't be recommending going back here for anyone. Last night I went with a few of my best friends and service was terrible yet again. I asked for thai bbq chicken and the waiter completely forgot about the order and by the time we were done eating, I had to ask another waiter to make sure to take that off the check because it was an oversight. There was no apology at all on their end and if anything, the guy looked annoyed for their mistake? I thought that was pretty hilarious.  The same waiter refilled my iced tea with water and when I pointed that out, he snapped at me and said, ""I'll get you another one."" Wow for sincerity? You messed up, & couldn't at least apologize? 

Last week when I brought a couple of my friends here after work, the waiter gave us the check after our appetizer order. I asked him why he gave it to us preliminarily, and he had no idea we hadn't received our food! Yay!-for paying attention! We waited over 35 minutes for dinner and this guy handed us the check after chicken wings LOL. Unbelievable.

Myself, & my connections in hospitality won't be coming back to this place ever. Service is gawd-awful and food is not worth the trip. I recommend going to Pin Kaow on eastern near BJ's and Crepe Expectations. There are other good thai spots like Lucky Thai that are mountains better than this rude, salty spot. 

Let me just advise you guys that this location has been closed down in the past and with service etiquette and inconsistent food quality, you will be on that same road for the future. This is not the best way to run a restaurant. This place needs to incorporate some training for the staff to be better and not so terrible to guests. Tips are earned, & it says a lot when all of us food & beverage industry people feel like we've wasted our money on shit service. Maybe management needs to notice.",2018-04-11 16:31:13

I moved and switched gyms and recently rejoined Eos, even though it is not as close to my new home, for the SOLE reason of training with Ramon. To hear that he was let go over ONE persons interpretation of a situation is ridiculous. I have trained with Ramon 4-5 times a week for the last 2 years and have never heard him so much as raise his voice. I have witnessed him stop what he was doing just to go over to another member and offer tips or help with the exercise they are doing. I believe this mistake will cost this gym a lot of business and happy members. I would think that there is probably much more to the story than what is being said, and I would hope that the amount of people unhappy would outweigh the ONE that caused this. 

I love this gym and the team here. Warren is an awesome manager and the childcare girls are delightful, and clearly, Ramon is the reason that you even have a lot of these members.

It was my first time there, so I decided to get a hamburger combo with everything and grilled onions and a side order of chili to dip my fries in.

My wife ordered the chili burger combo.

The fries were great!  They were crispy on the outside, and just perfect in the core.  You can really tell that they were not frozen pre-cut fries that came out of a bag.

The owner came by our table and we chatted a bit.  He was friendly, but not overbearing.  He's a nice dude and he seemed genuine.  It's not like when a worker greets you because he/she has to because of company policy.  

The chili is the perfect consistency and flavor for a side dish that will be used as a topping for burgers and fries.  It's slightly spicy.  Not so spicy that it would turn off people that don't like spicy food, but just enough to take notice.  I'd say that  Chili Billy's chili is better than Tommy's.  I know.. it sounds sacrilegious.  Tommy's chili leaves red oil on the paper that holds the hamburgers, Chili Billy's chili does not.

Now to the burgers..  The owner said that his two favorite burgers as a kid were In-N-Out (regular) and Tommy's (chili burger).  You can really tell that the burgers he makes are a marriage of the two.  He informed us that he forms the patties himself every morning, and they are NEVER frozen.

f7aY-gEerGNfKAykbyafrA,RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg,3,5,2,3,"I have been to Woo Che a few times now.  The first was a UYE last year when a group of Yelpers gathered at Woo Che for an evening of AYCE Korean BBQ.  And the most recent was a lunch visit with coworkers yesterday.

First, I just want to say that if you enjoy having Korean BBQ and not as concerned about paying the right price for the right selection of meats, then wait until after 3pm for the AYCE dinner at Woo Che.  Yeah, the price is higher compared to their lunch AYCE, but you get the kalbi which is not featured during lunch.  And for me that is practically all I eat when I go to an AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant.  And second, don't wear nice clothes when dining at any Korean BBQ places, as you will be wearing the smell of Korean BBQ back to work, home or wherever you are going afterward.

Okay, with that out of the way, Woo Che is a relatively small diner-looking restaurant.  It is in the same plaza as Pho So 1, Honey Pig (they have AYCE Korean BBQ too), and Big Lot, on the SE corner of Spring Mountain and Decatur.

They have a bibimbap bar, where you can fix yourself a bowl or plate of AYCE bibimbap, topped with the desired selections and portion of the toppings that goes on top of it.  Which is pretty cool if you can get that alone, since most of the people that come here are here for the BBQ!

The BBQ station offers raw shrimps, spicy pork and chicken, Bulgogi, pork belly, intestines, tripes, beef tongue, etc.  And the selection improves with at least the kalbi short ribs for dinner.  What I love about Woo Che is that it is a self help buffet, so I can get as little as I want of everything to try and go back for more of what I enjoyed.  At some other restaurants you are ordering plates of food, which you may not want to eat by the plateful , which really sucks if you are dining solo.

They also have a small selection of sushi rolls and Inarizushi (fried tofu skin pouch with sushi rice), which is next to the dessert station (orange segments, jellos and the Korean sweet dessert drink with rice in it-don't know the name of that item).

Their banchan station has a fairly decent selection of, well... banchans :)  Japche (glass noodle accompanied with a variety of vegetables and beef in a slightly-sweet garlic sauce-can be a standalone dish by itself), Sigeumchi namul (parboiled spinach), various kimchis (cabbage, radish, cucumbers), and seaweed salad.

The have fried rice, mackerel pike, and other cooked items that you can eat with whatever you cook on the grill.  Plus a selection of various soups, plain cooked rice and mixed rice.

The waitress that waited on us was friendly and checks up on us regularly.  When the grill needed changing, we let her know and it was taken care of quickly.  Which is better than some nearby Korean BBQ restaurants, which delegates that task to the busser and you have to wait for him to come by.

The only thing that I know can be better is the venting system at the restaurant, but smelling like Korean BBQ after eating at one is pretty typical.  

Decor:  3/5  Looks like a stand alone diner from the outside, and the interior is separated into booths.

Food:  3/5  for lunch. Lower prices, but lacking the kalbi that I would gladly pay more for.
            4/5  for dinner.  Has kalbi!

Service:  4/5  Smaller restaurant with attentive staff.  

Price:  4/5  One of the lower prices Korean BBQ restaurants in LV.

Food Labels:  0.5/5  Most items are not labeled, so it is hard for the beginners to know what it is that they are getting.

Location:  4/5  Not too far from the Strip, not too far West of the Strip on Spring Mountain, so still not a far cab ride for the visitors.",2011-05-12 02:49:00

What a neat place and great idea. My husband and I came last week just to check it out. It just opened and they were actually fairly busy inside. (Though, it kinda looks like they are closed from the outside just cause it isnt well lit).

They had like over 45 beers on tap that you could fill your growler up with. We brought our own growler but you can buy one there for $5 for 64 oz or $2.50 for a 32 oz. There is a large board with the beers on tap and the growler prices. They don't do servings by the pint but they will let you sample beers. I believe they let you sample 4 beers before they start charging (seems like they are fairly lenient on this if you buy a growler though!).

As for the selection, they really do have alot of great options! My husband and I would consider ourselves very knowlegable about the NC (all there beers are from NC) brewing scene and they had a great range of breweries and types. There were actually a few breweries listed up there that I have never even heard of. The lady behind the bar was extremely knowlegable about the beers and breweries I asked her about! I noticed that Raleigh Brewing Company was on tap and she said they are one of the few places in Charlotte that have it. Seems like they go out of there way to make sure to get small breweries in there!

We ended up getting our growler filled with the Duck Rabit Rabbiter (I believe it was around $15 to get ours filled, there is no additional fee if you bring in your own growler) and buying one of there growlers to get it filled. Can't remember what we got....it was a brewery I was unfamilair with.

Once we acclimated to the range, our target set, we struggled with loading the weapon. Adam came in with an automatic thingy that helped us load the bullets swiftly. Now we were set to shoot. While Adam gave detailed instructions to my shooting partner, I listened intently so that he wouldn't have to repeat himself over the bullets propelling into targets. Once we were over the sudden shots being fired, we were able to settle down and get in some practice. I actually shot very well, according to Adam and the other two patrons.

What is going on with the a/c unit? I have been this summer and it has been hot as balls inside. Like literally sweating as I am sitting there. I know it is an old building, but get it together mgt. I went another time and sat at the booths along where the window is and the a/c was blowing straight down on me. It was so cold I had to move onto his side of the booth. This is the booth that is by the window, but closest to the bathroom.

I came here for Winterlicious 2017 for dinner ($28). First impressions weren't great, it's not very noticeable from afar, there seemed to be only 2 servers and it looks slightly run down. But as you settle in, you are greeted with all these delicious smells with notes of butter and white wine, so that got us super hungry.
I ordered the escargot, veal chop and peach melba.
The escargot is a home run, they were deshelled and thoroughly cleaned. The butter garlic sauce was really rich and well balanced. I hoped I had more bread for to soak up every last drop.
When the veal chop came, I was so surprised by how closely it resembles a steak. It was a very large portion, esp for Winterlicious. The mash and veggies are great, nicely roasted and flavourful. The veal however not so much. The cook I received was around a rare, which is too under for my liking. A lot of the fat is still not rendered and the tendons are not remotely cooked. It was then I realized the server never asked me the how I'd like it cooked and I just got chef's pick. The overall dish is great value, I don't love the veal but I think the mushroom sauce and sides are pleasant enough to make me get over it. I also didn't enjoy their overuse of dry herbs as garnish. My friend had seafood risotto and said it was really good.
My dessert peach melba was supposed to be a poached peach with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Tasted like a canned peach, it probably was an actual poached peach, but it lacked any kinda flair other than plain sweetness. I wouldn't recommend it. I also got to try my friend's creme brûlée which had weird gingery notes to it.
They don't seem to have a fixed server per table, both of them helped us equally. One of them was absolutely delightful while the other one just seemed like they hated their job.
Overall, I would like to try this place again, given their regular menu is still quite budget friendly and I loved their escargot. However, this wouldn't be something I'd crave or go out of my way for.",2017-02-02 01:13:44

Why, Dim Sum? Why?

Now it seems besides the Dragon Court (which doesn't seem to be wowing people either), the Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant is all I have left. Le sigh. 

Alright, lament aside and review on, this place did not dress to impress. Outside looked pretty sketch, and upon walking in there, the cook and what looked like the manager were sitting down watching tv. They seemed to be able to afford the down time because there wasn't a soul in the house. I waited awkwardly by the counter, then said, ""Excuse me,"" three times to no avail. Then suddenly, for some reason, the chef looked up, barked something and a waitress came out with my order.

First things first: if you are a full-time Dim Sum restaurant, you need to have some staples that come with availability. All sweet items are done ONLY on weekends. This includes the custard tarts, coconut rolls, fried pineapple rolls, ANYTHING that resembles a dessert, and one of the biggest staples of dim sum and one of my personal favorites, zha leung cheung fun, also known as Chinese fried dough wrapped in rice noodle. I know how this may sound, but for those of you who have experienced a good zha leung cheung fun, you know what I'm talkin'bout. 

That taken off my order, I almost decided to wait for the weekend, BUT I was only 15 out of the thirty minutes away in a car with no air conditioning - I may as well tough the damn thing out. Also up on the list: pork and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, and chicken feet. 

This is my usual dim sum test. Something I like and is easy (dumplings), something I hadn't tried before (shrimp balls), and... the feet. You can always tell how good a dim sum place is going to be by their chicken feet. In this case, the chicken feet were cooked moderately well, but had no seasoning whatsoever and what little sauce there was was very bland. The meat in the dumplings tasted good, but had an odd texture of not ground, but pureed. It took me a couple to get used to it. The shrimp balls were huge, and delicious. However, the outside was soggy instead of the crunchy I was hoping for. 

All in all, hoping for a better dim sum experience. Now all I can do is place my hope in the Dragon Court. Wish me luck.",2010-06-16 22:21:46

Friendly to my tiny wallet, I enjoyed the Yakitori Chicken Salad. For $7, I got a good sized portion of succulent meat drenched in teriyaki sauce (hoping not to get drool on my laptop). The Father ordered the Gyu Don (thin slices of beef, marinated with a sweet soy sauce, and sauteed with onions and ginger over a bed of rice). Once again, for $8 you get a generous portion of beef slices.

Although their range is small, with only about 10 lanes, they do have 3 lanes set aside marked ""locals only"". This is nice because you don't have to wait for a lane, since their main clientelle are tourists renting full auto rifles. You'll see them. They're the ones taking pictures on the range or jumping/screaming when they hear the loud boom of a .50 cal rifle.

The staff is helpful and nice for the most part. The girls at the gun counter are young, attractive and surprisingly knowlegeable about firearms. Go ahead a fire away with the questions (no pun intended). Their answers will be on point. You can bring your own targets and hearing/eye protection or purchase/rent theirs at about a buck each. 

Only bring large paper targets though since you'll only have the ability to clip the targets on cardboard at each lane. We had smaller targets as well and were unable to set them up, so we asked one of the girls at the gun counter if we could borrow some tape. The girl was nice and handed us a roll of duct tape as long as we brought it back. Later on while at the lanes, a safety officer saw our roll of duct tape and took it away. When we asked to borrow a few more pieces of tape, he said no and asked if we'd like a paper target instead since the tape was expensive. We thought this was odd but agreed. However, on our way out we overheard the same safety officer going off on the poor girl that had given us the tape...didn't think that was necessary...how much could a roll of duct tape possibly be? And if it's your personal roll then don't bring it to work to share if it's that big a deal! Very unprofessional but luckily this was the only issue we encountered.

This is especially impressive because the soup of the day was much better than what is usually served at HK style cafes (usual borsch or cream soup).  

For dessert, we had a chance to try their cubed French toast and soufflé, both of which were really good. The cubed French toast is especially crispy, and the soufflé was incredibly fluffy in texture. 

Highly recommended!",2015-09-07 19:18:07

I have been here quite a few times so far (I'd love to frequent an independent shop for my daily fix, but unfortunately, there aren't any in this area now, although one is rumored to be opening up in the new center at 32nd Street and Baseline) and found it to be decent as far as Starbucks go. The baristas are very friendly and the iced Americano (my drink of choice) is always made very well - the Americano at other locations often tastes too strong/muddy or too weak/watery. 

I'm only giving it three stars, however, because does not have a really comfy interior like a lot of Starbucks do (there are only a few tables and it doesn't have the comfy chairs or couches) and because it has a really small outdoor section (just three tables). It's one of the locations you frequent to get a quick drink inside or to hit the drive-thru.

Made reservations earlier in the week and they called to confirm.  Parking was convenient on East 4th with their $15 valet.

Their host and hostess seemed detached, almost as if it was a bother for them to seat you. Mind you, it's freezing cold outside and we're in heavy coats.  They didn't even offer coat check and we had to ask about that service.  Ultimately they did hang our coats, and then they came back and threw the claim card on the table.

Our table server was fantastic.  She had an excellent knowledge of the menu and wine list and we felt she made some great suggestions.

The food was really good. Started with their gnocchi that just melted in the mouth, next was egg battered chicken which was nothing short of amazing. 

Desserts were disappointing. They depart from traditional cannolis  to offer ones with a boring, bland cream and a citrus glaze.  Bleh. Not a treat I could ever recommend.

I fell in love the ambiance here (back in the fall) it is just a very cool place that happens to be trendy,  and comfy all at the same time. Nice place for a few drinks, or dinner followed by cocktails. 

The Monday  5 dollar burger deal paired up with a Stella beer in my opinion just cannot be beat . the Vig burger is gigantic,  and juicy  topped with bacon, gouda,  and red onion. The arcadia burger is a classic cheeseburger with a yummy sauce . Pair these up with crispy sweet potato fries,  and an ice cold Stella,  and it is all good .
And,  i really like the service they all have great personalities and that is a plus in my book .

I also dig their Nacho's, and they have 5 dollar drinks on Wednesdays .And a cool reverse HH as well on Thursday

Like any sushi joint the quality of the fish will vary from day to day. Sushi-Mon is moderately consitent with quality. 

We totally bank on that all-you-can-eat deal. When we go to Sushi-Mon, eating isn't just a leisurely activity; its serious business. 

My faves: hamachi, hirame with shiso, toro, super white tuna (save this for dessert), and salmon. I'm gonna die with salmon in my mouth. And to be American for a second, I like the Frying Jason roll, Moon roll, Moon River roll, and baked green mussels ... with mayo on top. *gurgle*

There are too many other nice places In town to go to, do not waste your time and money here.

Went there on a Wednesday morning and it was not busy and waited to be seated. I also noticed that that was the norm for all customers. 

Ordered and shared a few things that were recommended by the waiter - breakfast burrito and Hawaiian Breakfast which were both average to poor. If that is what is recommended then the other dishes must be pig slop. 

The over the top was when my daughter ordered orange juice and then had a refill and that came to $5 and $2.50 so I asked the waiter why there was a price difference an was explained that each juice hasa $2 surcharge and that the first glass of oj was $5 and he thought he would give me a break and charge a refill for $2.50. Wow sounds like somebody feels guilty of the price.

The waiter said he would include a comment card which would go straight to the owner, so I thought Yelp would be a better way to wake up this cafe.

Lastly, I thought all the items were way over priced from entree to beverages.

So first off, this location is huge, it has two floors and is perfect for large groups (just make sure you reserve in advance as it does get very busy). The decor inside is rustic but nice and comfortable/clean. The prices are very cheap as well , and you get very big portions for your money. They serve italian food like pizza, pasta , risotto as well as a variety of starters and they have a wide variety of alcohol and cocktails. My issue was with the quality of the food , while it wasnt horrible , there was really nothing about it that stood out, it was very bland/ordinary. I ordered a Lobster Mac & Cheese which is usually one of my all time favourite things , but this one just fell flat. There was barely , and i do mean BARELY any lobster inside and the mac&cheese was super creamy but the cheese inside really had no taste and the noodles were overdone. Another person at our table had the risotto and had the same thing to say about it , just very bland and overdone.  However, someone at the table did order pizza and they seemed to be happy with it , so im thinking pizza is the safer bet when coming here. Their cocktails were pretty good all around though , so that was a plus. However, Ive been here twice and the first time our server was great , she was friendly and handled our group very well , she didnt miss a beat and made sure we all had what we needed. However, the second time I came here the server we had couldnt even be bothered to smile and kind of seemed annoyed just to be there. So service seems to be hit or miss.

Food? That pimento cheese dip was dangerously good and the housemade chips were perfectly spiced with BBQ seasoning. Just the right amount of crunch and saltiness. The only subpar part were the chips snapping under the pressure of the dip. Was it a problem? Well, only until you realize they serve it with a little spoon for spreading. The crawfish fritters were also delightful, fresh and served with two tasty sauces. For my main entree I ordered the Mahi and it was prepared perfectly. Light, delicate, yet blackened--served over a bed of cauliflower-corn salsa and balancing a bacon teeter-totter. Yum! I managed to sneak my fork into the mac'n cheese sitting next to me and it was a little dryer for my taste, but the flavor was still in full effect. Lastly, I have absolutely no complaints about those little, tasty biscuits. While smaller than your average, it was the perfect app size and damn were they good. I also didn't notice any issues with portions. My meal for the perfect size for me and I've seen much bigger sandwiches.

Drinks? First off, they have incredible beer prices. $3 for select beers? At a wonderful restaurant? Never! Except that's how they roll at SOHO. I opted for a gin-based cocktail made with ginger, lime and watermelon juice. That just can't be bad... ever. 

I'd definitely come back to SOHO--multiple times. Not only was the food delicious, but the service was equally awesome. 

P.S. I love that they offer a ""Veggie"" menu for all our vegan and vegetarian friends. Hell, most of the dishes looked like something I'd order, and I'm a meat-eater!",2012-04-20 21:39:15

Parking is hard to find so we just parked at the gas station next door then it's just a hop, skip & jump away. 
Total of 4 in our party (2kids). Ordered 2 meals off the kids menu. The plates and food was not worth the $8, toys that come w/the meal are the ones u get from the quarter machines. They come w/Capri sun pouch also, without kids menu the Capri sun is $1 each, which doesn't sound like a lot but u can buy a box of 10 Capri sun for $2. Kids mostly ate the fries which were good. But could've saved $16 off the bill and just ordered side of fries for them.
Adults ordered chicken katsu w/curry sauce on the side, and bowl of beef curry ramen. Chicken katsu portion was a little small for the $9 pd especially when you're used to getting larger portions at a Hawaiian BBQ place, but the taste was alright. Beef curry ramen sounds weird but definitely works! It was like eating a beef curry stew(it had potato & carrots) but with ramen in it. It's worth a try if you're in the mood for curry. We got the tuna poke app which disappeared in 1min by my hubby so I'm assuming it was delish. For dessert we got the honey toast, don't mistake it for French toast because we got plain toasted pieces of bread covered in honey topped w/ vanilla tea ice cream. It was still good but would've been awesome if it were actual French toast as advertised. And to go my daughter got a coconut smoothie bobs drink which was better than I expected it to taste. 
All in all not bad but a little pricey when u add kids meals, dessert and sides. So if you're on a budget I recommend sticking to the ramen bowls (more bang for your buck) and skipping the kids meals. But try it for yourself u might just have a fun dining experience.",2013-04-02 22:32:02

They have pretty awesome drink combos on the menu, and you can choose from all their syrups, fruit purees and more to make a diy one if you want. 

There are so many that look awesome - I'm glad there's one in north Mesa by my house! I will definitely be back.

We were seated in a comfortable booth. Our server Brenda was an exceptional waitress. We ordered the half pork and half shrimp fajitas. Of course a peach margarita. It was good but lacking alcohol.
The fajitas had lots of grilled onions and only three thin uncooked slices of bell pepper.
The shrimp were very salty, the pork was not all that. The tortillas were thick and hot. The salsa was just a chunky tomato sauce, no spices to give it that zing. I was disappointed, I saw the advertising about what a great dish the fajitas are on ""Check Please""

It is truly a world class art museum in every sense, with an impressive breadth and quality of art only seen in the truly best art museums globally.  Amazingly, admission is FREE!  I've been to the popular art museums in New York and Europe, and the CMA ranks up there with most of them!  The CMA has been around for almost 100 years, and they have acquired some incredible and historic art from virtually every country and time period thru the ages.  There is literally something for everyone here-  from massive classic oil paintings to sculptures to tapestries to furniture to medieval armor and weaponry to folk art to wood carvings to ceramics and pottery to jewelry to ornate clocks to modern art and much more.  You literally need almost a whole day to properly take in the expansive amount of exhibits in this architecturally gorgeous, well laid out, and cavernous museum!  The wide open, airy main atrium with it's huge, tall glass ceiling is a sight in and of itself.  I literally was on the verge of tears at one point, reflecting on how I could have possibly missed not coming here in all the 19 years i've lived in Northeast Ohio as a 'transplant'!   As a mentionable sidenote, the museum's cafe 'Provenance' serves up some great tasting gourmet food, sandwiches, salads, and desserts, which rounded out our most pleasant visit.  The museum curators are very nice and helpful as well, and the museum store was enjoyable.  There is paid parking in the adjacent garage, which is conjoined with the museum for convenience.

Food:
 - Tako Wasabi
 - Stone Grilled Beef Tongue
 - Hamachi Carpaccio
 - Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don
 - Aburi Toro & Avocado 2Tone Battera
 - Otona No Pudding

To drink, we shared a bottle of sake - the Kaze Mizu Hitoyo.

Our food arrived very quickly (almost overwhelmingly). The food was delicious, and our favourites were the definitely the Tako Wasabi and the Sea Urchin Stone Bowl. Both were full of flavour and executed well. 

Atmosphere:
We were seated at a communal table in the company of other pairs - that included a small fish pond embedded in the center. Besides this table, there was bar seating and individual tables too. The volume was lively but not too.

Upon entering Balzac's, I immediately realized that this is anything but my scene. I would imagine writers, editors, freeloaders and poets coming here, anyone but the company executive I was with. 
The first floor made me uncomfortable, as most open-concept floorplans do. There were propaganda era art spontaneously placed on the walls, and a chandelier that I felt made the space feel busy. 
There is no décor to this establishment, as everything was left to it's original industrial galore. Even the pressure gauges to what once it was measuring remained conspicuously by the corner. The paint on the brick walls have all cracked away, and the windows had bars on them. If the building was restored, it would look like a factory out of the Soviet Union era, but it wasn't. There was a rustic feeling to Balzac's, a sense of freedom from structure. It was unintimidating, intimate even. The second floor was a separate entity from the first, and sitting here gave me a sense of pure relaxation. Nobody here looked like me, they all dressed differently. Usually this is a bad sign, but it didn't matter here. 

I ordered something like a maple coffee or something of the sort, it was damn good. The bar was neatly organised with modern and vintage coffee making instruments. The staff were leisurely..but I guess in a good manner. The two level of this cafe catered to two different kind of patrons. Downstairs for buzzing bees, and upstairs for the...the less busy bees.

We chose to sit at the bar, because there was a 20 minute wait for a table. We sat at the far end of the bar in order to avoid the huge posts that interrupt seating, so that might be part of the problem, as there was only one bartender working on a Saturday night. 

It took some time to be acknowledged, but when we got our margarita it was terrific. In order to actually order some tasty snacks, however, we had to flag down a random hostess and request menus. For the standard chips and salsa that typically appear like magic, we had to ask another random employee who was walking past. The food, when it came out, was good. The guacamole was chunky and very fresh, and our queso dip was very good.

Or server did his best. When we first sat down he went thorough this speech about the menu. It took about 15 minutes. I realized that this is what they require the servers to do as we saw other servers doing the same, but\ yikes, that was overwhelming and not really helpful.

After we finally figured out what we wanted, he came back to tell us that they were out of the ""Flintstone"". They were also out of two or three of the drinks we ordered. How do you run out of alcohol on a Saturday night in the winter?

I don't eat pork which limited the menu a bit. A friend of mine ordered the pig face. He got the last one in the house for the night. He said it was good, but it wasn't so pretty to look at, for me at least.

* Spicy Udon was favorable 
* Slushy Cups were a bit different.  Size large almost was like a to-go soup container
* The drinks itself were quenching.
* I liked the way the place was decorated
* Easy parking

Cons:
* We didn't receive half of our order
* We managed to get a curry chicken rice bowl instead of curry beef noodles
(I don't know how this happened.  She even read our order back to us).
*  It was obvious that they forgot to give us some of our food, but instead of apologizing, they manipulated our receipt to make it look like we never ordered it.  

In the restaurant's defense... I can't 100% for sure say that this is what happened with the food that never made it to our table.  I am just assuming since the kitchen looked confused when they had our dishes sitting on the counter towards the end of our meal and then we saw them look at our receipt and re-enter stuff into the register before giving us our bill.  They could of easily just apologized for forgetting and ask if we still wanted the stuff.

  I gave a two stars for the prices, menu selection, and decor. The food was nothing out of the ordinary.  It's not somewhere I'd make a journey to get to.

Pros: great ambience if you go in the evening and sit outside,  friendly staff, good food

Cons: limited menu if you don't eat pork

There was quite a line we waited in but it goes by quickly.  You order your food at the counter and they give you a buzzer.  Restaurant pricing might be a bit higher than necessary. Hubby ordered the fontina burger with fries and said it was very good.  I ordered the veggie pizza and it wasn't memorable.  Loaded with onions fyi. I ate it but I would never crave it.

Wait time is anywhere between 30 minutes to a hour and a half. Recently the quick care relocated to the suite next door. I have seen around 5 different doctors for quick care they listen to my needs and have given good advice and prescriptions I may need to get better. Only issue I have ever had is finding out a correct diagnosis to medical concerns beyond the common cold. I highly suggest going if you have a cold and need a quick fix but seeing a primary care doctor if you have a more serious health condition that you need looked into further.,2017-01-11 19:07:34

Very clean, huge, trendy modern architecture and interior decor. Sort of a Noodles-and-company-style menu, but better.

Ordered two Perfect Balance Bowls with chicken and lamb respectively, which contained tandoori and chickpea masala. Took only minutes (10 or less) and we could have as much sauce (tamarind, spicy mango, etc) as we wanted. The raita (yogurt) was extra, annoyingly enough. Anyone who eats Indian regularly knows you need to have your raita with every meal. 

Taste-wise? Not too bad, but the vegetables were slightly hard, and the naan that we added to our meals wasn't that hot. It actually was barely lukewarm. The lamb kebabs were delightfully flavorful, slightly tangy.

However, I absolutely loved the pasta. It's hand cranked and you can tell because it's not as soft and goop-y as some other pastas you might get outside. A very good balance between the sauce and shredded duck meat. I would come here again and again just for this!

The pizza was very good as well. I personally like my crust thin, and this is as thin as it gets. Crispy crust, fresh sauce and cheese, doesn't get soggy after a while. A-ok!

I visited last weekend and although I didn't have a negative experience, I feel that this place was overhyped. On the one hand, the owners have created a nice warm space to hang out or study during the day, as well as of course having a wide selection of different types of creme brulee that was thought out. On the other hand, I didn't walk away from this cafe thinking that it was a must visit type of place.

Craque de Creme has a few things going for it. Again, the space itself is cute and warm with a few tables for groups and some random university lecture hall style single seats. Also, there is bound to be a creme brulee flavour for everyone - they had ube, matcha, earl grey, honey lavender, salted caramel to name a few. They also had a fun selection of character decorated macarons and some drink choices (teas and lattes). Prices were also reasonable at $5 for each creme brulee for dine in and $6 to get it to go. Service by the sole person working there last Saturday was good - he was helpful and efficient. I think it helped that it wasn't that busy since the roads were brutal in TO that day.

The major miss for me was the taste of the honey lavender creme brulee. It looked cute when I first got it but after taking one spoonful of it, I noticed that it was more of a pudding or pureed texture instead of a custard texture. Taste wise, it was okay - it wasn't too sweet (didn't mind) and I could definitely taste both flavours but it was honestly nothing spectacular. I might be open to trying other creme brulee flavours in the future but likely not anytime soon. Other Yelpers may have had a better experience based on the creme brulee that they tried though.",2018-02-17 07:46:25

the burrata was certainly beyond generous - huge, in fact, but if you know serious burrata it was lacking big time. just not creamy and tasted bland. good burrata makes your toes curl. and it's hard to source. buffalo mozzarella would've been highly preferable over this. on a positive note, the bone marrow delivered its promise. it was a high point and the reason for the 3rd star. can you say oxtail marmalade?

we ordered 2 pastas and both the spaghetti and the taglietelle were literally awful. not the dish - but the pasta. bad texture. i've been trying to figure out what it was - but it tasted almost mealy. i know good fresh pasta (no really, i know...) and this just wasn't it so change up your recipe, dudes! it was totally a damn crying shame because both sauces were solid - all'amatraciana and the chicken liver/almond thing. 

the salted caramel budino was nice. chunks of chocolate meringue in there.

Can't speak to that as it was our first time here. We walked over from our apartment but there was plenty of street parking in front of the restaurant. We were seated immediately on a Thursday night, most people were at the bar, I'm sure that was because of happy hour. We started off with the fried green tomato appetizer which has lump crab meat on top and a balsamic drizzle. This could be a fantastic dish, if the chef knew how to season a dish. Salt! Salt! Salt! For our main courses we went with a steak sandwich for myself and a hot and crunchy cheeseburger. First off, the steak sandwich has a lot of steak in it. If you are turned off by the price of the steaks go for the sandwich. Again, needs seasoning. It was cooked medium rare like I had asked and it was definitely a good piece of meat. Just needed salt!

There's a good thing going on downtown... a good thing called Downtown Food. When I first read the reviews about it over the summer, I thought,""What is this place? It sounds like it'd be worth trying out."" It still took me some time to make the rounds and find my way in. My first visit was in early October. I've been back half a dozen times since. Kudos DTF, that's definitely a record for getting me through the doors of the same restaurant in just under a two month period!

What's to love?
- It's all farm to plate.
- Though the food is inventive, the atmosphere of the restaurant and attitudes of the staff remain warm, friendly and helpful. It's all about ensuring you enjoy your experience.
- The Butter'd Beer.
- That everything is made from scratch... right down to house-made noodles and even the bacon.
- The happy hour. It's every weekday from 3-6pm. You can order anything on the tapas menu by the bite. So if you want 15 pork wontons and only two pieces of tuna tataki, you've totally got that option.
- The stonework. Little known fact: The chef is also pretty handy. He did most of the work on the interior of the restaurant as well before it opened.
- And of course the food. Must tries: pork wontons, breakfast at midnight, ceviche, whatever the market pasta is that day, flourless chocolate cake, pickerel, chicken liver mousse.

I'd also like to make special note of the ladies washroom. It's so pretty! And the hand towels? They're not quite paper towel, but not really towels either... how do I explain them? Like 10 ply soft paper towel for your hands. At any rate, it's enjoyable.

And in case I hadn't mentioned it yet... try the Butter'd Beer ;).",2012-11-25 04:52:03

I sat on the patio by the pool.  Nice murals on the walls and pillars. It was nice under the covering with the rain coming down. 

After looking at their menu. I ordered water with lemon to drink. Two pink tacos and one crunchy shrimp taco with an order of the zonked fries. I told Bianca that I don't like onions or tomatoes. She made sure that I didn't have any pico. She was awesome! She forgot my lemon though. :(

Ok so I wish I could say the same about the food. On my pink tacos the only part that had a faint touch of dirty pink was the edges. Both of my pink tacos fell apart so I was had to eat the guts with a fork. Even with the salsa the tacos lacked flavor. The crispy shrimp tacos weren't crispy and were a huge disappointment. The fries aren't fries it's huge wedges of slightly undercooked potatoes covered with some cheese, sauce and some carne asada. I wasn't impressed especially when I got to the under done wedge.  The potatoes are too big to enjoy the other flavors of everything.

I pointed it out to my server who just laughed uncomfortably. 
I would not have sent it back for him touching just one slice of a large pizza (however I didn't eat that slice!) my concern was the server was standing next to him When he did it and he noticed it as well and should've addressed it, someway somehow.

Curious: Keung's 2 menus offer both Hong Kong style cafe options like spaghetti and tomato sauce, an array of congee, rice noodle dishes, hot pots, soups, spicy meats, and some standard dishes like lemon chicken and chicken cashew. If you're choice adverse, better let someone else do the picking!

Anxious: Not unlike other Cantonese restaurants I've encountered, service was slow. We had to wave down a server. Eye contact and arm waving doesn't always work. Come prepared to work for their attention. This, however, was all quickly forgotten when the free soup arrived. Drink it, it's quite delicious. Also, red bean soup is offered for dessert. If you've saved room, go for it!

Ravenous: We ate like kings: garlic eggplant hotpot, chicken with rice noodles, spicy beef - served in a cone and tinfoil, and chicken with cashew. 
The winner? Eggplant hotpot. Warning: watch for the spicy beef - it be VERY spicy!

The burger itself was really good. It was flavorful, green chili really popped and accompanied the lettuce and onions. Felt nothing like a burger from a chain joint which I liked. The fries were different, they reminded me of a hybrid between onion straws and mcdonald fries. The fries were half crispy and half normal. It also retained skin which gave it a darker appearance.

I still have the utmost love and respect for AEAC, after going there for the past two years. I'm augmenting my prior review as a tribute for my guinea pig, whose name was LilyB. Everyone here has been most welcoming and kind. Special mention to Dr. Sarah Mclaughlin, who along with the staff--Cara, Tim, Sonja, and Marisol (please forgive me I don't recall the other names)--Loved and Cared for my LilyB and always made her feel like a princess. 

LilyB lived to a ripe old age of seven years (that's ancient in cavie years, we've been told). When she fell ill with ovarian cysts and with bladder stones sometime in very early part of the year 2016, it was Dr Mclaughlin and Dr Todd Driggers who did the surgeries on LilyB. 

Because of their skills and professionalism, and of course our unconditional love for her, LilyB gave us two extra years filled with love and joy. She will be missed, and I'm really sad, of course. But I think I can speak for hubby and myself in saying that we will Be always grateful for AEAC for the best care that lilyB received.

e3M0X6o1c0CsvPpCgKufqg,4FE8md9fMr_jZFNbcOmHsQ,3JekfARgFuMeLTMcOpgqyQ,3,3,0,1,"I came here because I overheard the owner of Four Peas in a Pod restaurant in Hickory, enthusiastically telling a customer about Tony's stellar banana splits and milkshakes.

I ordered two hot dogs and a soda, because I was hungry. The price was @$5.

One orders at the counter, pays, and receives a ticket. I didn't know what to do thereafter, so I just sat at the only open (dirty) table that was available. Eventually, about fifteen minutes later, someone called out my ticket number and I went all the way back to the entrance to pick up my order. 

One picks up their orders immediately to the right of where one orders and pays for their food. This is a pretty screwed up system logistically, but since they've been doing business this way for 100 years, well........I don't guess that my opinion matters much. I just can't see this reverse, cluttered, traffic system as being the ideal way to manage customer flow - especially with all of their empty counter space past the registers. 

The hot dogs were not good and not bad. The taste was okay, but they were only lukewarm and messy. They arrived wrapped in white wax paper in a brown paper bag. They were wrapped with zero regard to their appearance, and handed to me by a unsmiling young lady who look besieged. I can't say as I blame her, but personally, I would put a little more pride into the appearance of the food that I served.

The hot dogs looked like the bag had been thrown out the window of a moving vehicle. They were ""smushed"" all to heck. The buns were not toasted. Most of the toppings: chili, onions, mustard, and slaw were smeared all over the white paper wrapper. I ate the hot dogs because I was starving, but I wouldn't order them again. I've had gas station hot dogs that were better.
 
As I mentioned earlier, the restaurant was jammed, and every table was full. 

The restaurant was not nearly as clean as I would have preferred. My table was filthy. There was a trash heap of French fries, napkins, and other debris under my table. There was salt and ""stuff"" all over my table top. A man came by with a broom and dust pan while I was getting my hot dogs, but he didn't clean the table. 

The place looked to me like it could use a good steam cleaning. The white linoleum floor was yellowed, and overdue for a good buffing with a circular scrubber. The walls needed painting. Yeah, I know, the place is 100 years old. What do I expect? Answer: for it to be clean. Nitpicking? Maybe. 

I ordered a nut sundae for dessert. It was $4.00. It was okay, but the portion was a small 8-10 oz. plastic cup. An entire HUGE banana split was $5. 

Their milkshakes are.....1950's colossal, I can see the appeal. 

Many younger people were ordering the grape flavor ice cream and shakes. 

The man and woman at the order counter / register were friendly. The two ""soda jerks"" making ice cream confections were very professional and courteous. There was no shame in their game, although they didn't smile either. I don't know why, but somehow I felt that this place is a small version of the Varsity in Atlanta. 

Parking is VERY limited. 

The restaurant is extremely easy to find.
 
Would I return? Yes, but only for ice cream or a shake.  Those items rate a four, and that's why one should come here. This place is first and foremost....an ice cream shop, and that's what they do best.",2015-03-12 21:13:02

The steak was hard and dry and very overcooked, the steamed vegetables tasted worse than freezer food, and I am surprised my boyfriend's still alive after the shrimp he was served. To make it worse, our waitress took our orders and then completely ignored us until the bill was ready, when my glass was completely empty and I needed SOMETHING to wash down the abhorrent food.

Chefs are Indian, waiter looked Indian-ish, restaurant was contemporary and clean, but prices are somewhat high just because they don't include rice/naan.  A bowl of rice on its own was $3.99, but it was a good 2-3 servings.

I went for a bday dinner and arrived late with my bf.  Since we were leaving early, I asked if we could be put on a separate bill.  And the waiter said that groups of 6+ people are put onto 1 bill.  Water was refilled throughout the dinner.

My only criticism was the paying of the bill at the end of dinner.  Since everything was put onto 1 bill, people were leaving at various times, each individual had to go up, and pay their own portion.  So it did get a bit messy.

At one point, the waiter who was separating the bills short-changed my bf and said to the bday girl, ""Don't give me attitude"".  I'm pretty sure the bday girl didn't say anything do prompt this response.

I understand that separate bills gets messy, but wouldn't it have been easier than doing math at the end of the meal?  And wouldn't the waiter end up getting MORE tips??

Not a pleasant way to wrap up a celebration.  I think I'd rather risk a stomach ache and dine in Little India or elsewhere with equally good food.  I'm sure they'd have the sense to offer separate billing.

There was also a ""hostess"" who was there, but she did absolutely nothing, so I'm not sure why she was even working that night.  She sorta faded into the background as soon as each person went up to pay their portion.",2014-06-09 18:59:33

The baked chicken is decent, but its fried version is awful. The meat was so deep fried that I wouldn't have been able to tell if they gave me fried shrimp or fried chicken (I actually contemplated this while eating it because it was so fried it didn't even taste like chicken).

-The Buffalo wings are okay. Nothing spectacular.

-Also the fried mozzarella is good but they don't give you a lot. 

Definitely should try

-So we just tried the roadside sliders and man they were delicious! Soft & delicate. Also served with lettuce and tomato on the side. Definitely recommend it! They come in 4.

This is absolutely one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.  

Shopping
Ok--undeniably Scottsdale Quarter contains a fair share of big-box chain retailers--it is what it is.  However, the big-box chains here are terrific.  My personal favorites are:  Apple, H&M, Sephora, Gap, West Elm, Pottery Barn, and Express.  Yes, I have rushed over to Scottsdale Quarter on a whim on a Saturday afternoon to find a party dress to wear that night. (Thank you, Express and H&M!)
Popular chain stores can be fabulous, but I'm also a big fan of mom and pop local unique purveyors, especially for gift-giving.  It's Sugar allows us all to act like a kid in a candy story--literally!  Oil & Vinegar offers terrific vinegar and oils by the bottle.  Be prepared to taste oils and vinegars galore on tiny pieces of bread.  


Services
 Lens Crafters is conveniently located next to my favorite parking structure.  They have a great safety stock of disposable contact lenses and frames.  The leadtime on my last contacts order was only 2 business days....AND they gave me a free 5-day supply of contacts.  Dry Bar offers an absolutely wonderful opportunity for pampering.  Wash-n-style salons have been popping up all over town lately, but this is the ORIGINAL.  


Dining
 I'm a sucker for Fox Concept restaurants and True Food is my absolute favorite.  I mean, seriously, where else can you get the full foodie experience without feeling like you need to complete a 3-hour workout after gorging?  True Food's menu is simply divine.  For brunch, lunch, or dinner, you can't go wrong.  I always start with a half order of the crudités and literally close my eyes and point to something on the menu--it's all fabulous.  C3 Kitchen is a great trendy casual lunch spot.  Sol offers incredible upscale Mexican dining and outstanding margaritas.

The concession food totally sucks even for concession standards but all is forgiven for one simple thing. You're allowed to bring in outside drinks into the building as long as it's in a clear cup. They even provid you with clear cups to switch out your drink. I made sure to take advantage of that when I came back the next day for the 2nd UFC show of the week.

After checking out the Farmer's Market and noticing that there were only a few shops to browse through, we decided to stay for lunch. On a side note, I do see a lot of potential for this place. It reminds me of something I would see in my old hometown of Irvine, CA. Hopefully when the economy recovers, more stores will open up and it will be a great place to shop, eat, and hang out.

We wanted to eat at Leone Cafe, but after seeing how crowded it was, we walked down a bit further and found ourselves between Brio Tuscan Grille and Bottles & Burgers. Brio also looked like it was filling up pretty quickly, so we decided to try this place out. We sat on the patio since the weather was so nice.

Our server Andre was very friendly and attentive. He explained the menu very well, making suggestions from their most popular gourmet burgers, adult milkshakes, and he gave detailed descriptions of their desserts. I ordered the Blazin' Sliders (comes with 2), which were great! The Angus ground chuck was very juicy and cooked well. The bacon and guacamole also made them very tasty. The sliders came with their regular hand cut fries, which weren't very good. Most of it was soggy and didn't have much taste. I suggest ordering any of the other fries that they have on the menu, which look more delicious! My husband ordered the Double Helix BBQ burger and really enjoyed it. He said it was one of the best burgers he had ever eaten and that it was ""life changing."" lol. I gotta admit, it did look like a great burger because they put BBQ Short Rib on top of the Angus beef. My only complaint here was the plate they used for the sliders. It gets messy when you eat burgers and the small rectangular plates are not a good fit for that. Bigger plates please?

For dessert, we ordered the Opera Cake, which was excellent. It was kind of like a Tiramisu, but with more chocolate. Thin layers of chocolate cake and a hint of coffee bisque. Not too sweet and yummy! Also served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream. My only complaint here was that our scoop of ice cream kept moving around on our plate because they put it on top of a bed of whipped cream. 

Not a bad find. Prices were reasonable as well.  I would like to come back to try the BBQ Pork Sliders and more desserts! According to their website, two out of the three patios that they have are pet friendly. Yay! I wont have to worry about bringing my dog along next time!",2012-10-21 09:46:06

Like the one in sauga, Scaddabush has a hipster and antique feel as you step into their yonge and gerrard location. They have real candles lighting up to set the mood, and antique cutlery and plates to provide that hipster ambiance. Hostess were all extremely friendly and are very helpful if you had any questions. 

Menu is not too big, but the prefect amount of options for everyone! Vegetarian and meaty options are all available. For our first time at the yonge and gerrard location, we had calamari fritti and the spinach dip to start.  Calamari was fried to perfection! Not too salty and a squeeze of lemon juice just did the trick.  The sauces they provided with the calamari was also delicious! The spinach dip did not live on par to our standards... (we're HUGE fans of the milestones and canyon creek dip), but it has a kick to it as they use sun dried tomato in their cheesy base.  Loved the crostinni they provided with the dip though! 

For our mains, my boyfriend got the butcher pizza! If you're a meaty kinda guy/gal, i recommend it completely! This pizza even came with a pizza scissor!! I've never seen or knew pizza scissor's existed until my first encounter at the scaddabush in sauga.  I was so amused and amazed by the scissor my boyfriend even went out of the way to get me one! :) For my main, I got the carbonara. Instead of penne (not a huge fan of penne pasta) I substitute with fettuccini.  Something to note about these pastas is that they make it all in-house, you definitely taste the freshness of the pasta! If you've ever been to teronni's (who also makes home made pasta), i would say the taste of this pasta is on-par or even better! For the cabonara, it comes in a mini skillet and the sauce used was infused with bacons... it was delicious! To top it off, they have a mini sunny side up egg and the yolk gooeying down the pasta was so different but so good! Highly recommend these two dishes!! I've also tried their pesto polo and if you like pesto and chicken and fettuccini then I would go for that as well!

the portions at scaddabush are so big, that it's difficult to finish everything! In the end, my boyfriend and I had to pack half of everything home! But we couldn't leave this time without trying dessert! One of our dear friends boyfriend who ate in the sauga location recommended the cheesecake.  Since we were both so full we decided to take the berry cheesecake to go.  When they say the cheesecake is meant to be shared, it definitely is meant to be shared! Its huge! The only thing I would recommend for the cheesecake is to have a thicker graham crust at the bottem.  

In regards to our servers, they were amazing! We only had one server assigned to us, she was helpful when we asked for her opinion on certain items on the menu, and was always warm and bubbly to serve us.  We also had a random server come over to top off our water every single time our cups were empty.  He was extremely friendly and always ensured we were enjoying our stay! 

Overall, the meal is 5 stars! Definitely a place if you want comfort food and a good ambiance. There are alot of little Italian restaurants in the downtown core, but if you don't feel like trying anything exotic, I would recommend scaddabush!",2014-03-02 16:21:08

There were a few empty tables here and there so, I went up to the host and asked if there was a table for four available.  Pointing at the empty table to the right of us, the host said that we could possibly sit there and that the wait would not be too long.  He then proceeded to take my name and phone number, signing me up for a spot on the NoWait line.  Given that the host had said, ""It shouldn't be too long"" I didn't really bother to ask what the wait time was in an attempt to not be annoying.  When I opened my phone to see our place in the NoWait app, there were 12 parties ahead of us with a wait time of 45 minutes!  I felt betrayed.  The host was pretty much the first encounter we made with this business and already I felt lied to, so that really set my expectations low.

All in all, this situation probably wasn't that huge of a deal, yet I was still pretty emotional.  I talked to another hostess given the original host I had spoken to was of course, no where to be found.  She thoughtfully listened to my issue and apologized for the miscommunication.  What was funny was that initially she said the guy I talked to earlier probably didn't work there.  But alas, he did.  Anywhoo, the hostess got us seated promptly and offered us a custom guacamole for our troubles.  We got the guac with goat cheese and onions.  They are toppings rather than mix-ins but they definitely gave life and definition to a pretty average, but fresh guacamole.

From reading everyone else's reviews I decided to not order any tacos (but my friends did). I ordered the kale and sweet potato salad, the ceviche, the corn elote, and the black bean soup.  Great portions.  Great value.  Except for the corn, which is probably a better value at happy hour.  And from that note it should be easy to guess that the corn was my least favorite item.  The others however looked, smelled, and tasted pretty good.  

The corn:  Pretty spicy.  The textures of the cheese, peppers and whatever else is on there is almost as thick as the corn.

The ceviche: A lot more complex that I was expecting, especially since there is only one ceviche option.  It's a great place to start for those who've never tried ceviche.

The black bean soup: Also pretty good.  The texture made it seem like time went into the preparation and the lime crema was a nice touch.

The salad: I actually haven't eaten that yet because getting 3 snacks was pretty filling.  But it's a pretty large salad, so I'm excited to eat it for lunch at some point today.

Aside from feeling a little blown off by the initial host, the service was pretty good.  Our server was super nice and attentive and even funny.",2016-07-01 16:44:39
ZBXTvlqhhFAsGRDuNiy9sg,2vJ2e51kdbdAmAo_HTr4KQ,sjJOsKnXxsQodXMr1i8fsg,3,4,3,4,"I was very excited to visit the Eaton Center after hearing about all the new stores that popped up. I had a tough week and was ready to shop my sorrows away and rack up some serious debt. But I couldn't! I was basically wearing my credit card on my sleeve, and all I ended up buying was Aveda Shampoo! 

New stores as current date that I was very excited to see at Eaton Center:

1. Juicy Couture. I am not talking about their expensive fleece/sweat wear that came into popularity when I was in OAC (showing my age...I went to high school when there was still a grade 13!!) Juicy has some serious Marc Jacobs-like clothes that make one all chique. But I was so disappointed when I walked in! The front half of the store is dedicated to sunglasses and accessories (blech) and then the end-part of the store has one wall dedicated to Juicy's fleece suits on fancy hangers (which have been around in existence for almost 10 years). The other wall has very boring clothes. Either I just picked the wrong season to go in, or this is as good as it gets for us. Disappointed.

2. Massimo Dutti. I could not WAIT for the higher-end Zara store to arrive. I still have some of my fave Grace Kelly-esque dresses and coats I got from MD in Spain. The store layout is very Ralph Lauren...with dark woods, equestrian-like décor all around. The store is split into Men's and Women's. If you are looking for basic black, grey and dark clothing priced at around $200 then this is your store. Boring as heck.

3. J Crew. I usually get my basic J Crew sweaters, coats, shirts and pants at the huge outlet in Florida. I didn't find that much difference in style but big difference in price. In other words, I can't in good conscience buy J Crew clothing here, but I have to say, the store layout is very nice!

4. Harry Rosen. Newly renovated and nice and big and modern and all for just-Men! My dad went nuts here and bought a great Etro coat. 

Anywhoo, excited to see all these new stores. Although this time around I couldn't get anything, I can always count on Zara for basics, Aveda for my shampoo, and the mall's closest proximity to my fave Chinese restaurant:)",2012-11-01 15:35:41

Oh Sunday morning, February 16th. You started off so well. My boyfriend and I were up early enough to go check out Squash Blossom, a place that has long been on my ""To Try"" list-mostly because of the allure of pumpkin pancakes. We're not typically early risers on the weekend so this was a treat.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted by two different servers who both said they'd be with us momentarily. A third person (whom I presume to be the manager) approached us to see if we'd been helped and when we said yes, muttered something along the lines of ""ok, that's their job anyway"".. Red flag number 1? Another girl told us that only brunch was available which was unbeknownst to us--not a criticism, we just had not seen that there was Sunday Brunch. It seemed like an awfully good deal! $10 all you can eat WITH a drink? We just decided to go with it, not knowing if we'd still be able to get the aforementioned pumpkin pancakes. Finally, we were seated and quickly served coffee and water while we grabbed some plates and ventured off into breakfast land. 

Inside, there were a variety of fruits and pastries, along with some lunch items. In the outdoor area, there was eggs, breakfast meats, and an omelette station. There weren't a whole lot of vegetarian options and the omelette station (which consisted of one guy and a few skillets) seemed pretty busy. I didn't want to go into a diabetic coma from just eating tons of sugary pastries, so I opted for some eggs, potatoes, biscuit, what little fruit was available and a mini cinnamon roll. It was a bit disappointing considering their main menu appears to have a lot more veg-friendly items. 

Let me just start off by saying, this food was not spectacular by any means. It was akin to a buffet at a family reunion you're forced to attend where half of the food is cold and/or burnt. 

I know what you're thinking right about now.. ""well Natasha, why didn't you say anything?!?"" Well I would've-but notice the title of this review. Nonexistent table. NO ONE willingly would come by our table to check up on us. It seemed like our server looked right past us and attended the other tables. Even if he was supposed to be the guy that brought us our drinks, I noticed that we were the only table no server checked on at all. It was actually borderline offensive. I mean, we ran out of coffee and water for a long time and finally managed to flag someone down for a refill. The girl that gave us more coffee and water was sweet and apologized because they were so ""flustered and busy"". Afterwards, the man I presume to be a manager approached our table, not to ask how things were, but to ask if he could take one of our chairs for another table. Let me add that this guy has zero customer service skills. Not too sure if there's a friendly bone in this guy's body.

The boyfriend and I were a little confused at this point. The servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, there's the presumed manager being a jerk to everyone. We wondered if they were understaffed? It certainly was not *that* busy the entire duration we were there. It was also a buffet and it appeared that they had a dedicated food runner. The only responsibility of the servers would be checking on customers and making sure drinks were filled. 

Finally, we were ready to leave and almost contemplated a dine n dash because the people working were *that* inattentive. I flagged down manager guy for the check and he practically scoffed at me when I said I wouldn't be paying in cash. If it's such a problem to pay with a credit card, how about becoming a cash only establishment? It seemed like even if I would've expressed my discontent for the entire experience, no one would have cared. 

After reading several reviews of this restaurant, I can see that there has long been problems with getting good service here. I do see that the business owner does respond to some reviews but if the same issues are happening that were going on based on reviews from a year ago--there hasn't been much effort made in improving ""based on customer's feedback"". 

I will NOT be returning. I suspect this restaurant only stays open because of it's close proximity of Matt's Big Breakfast, which always has a long wait on the weekends.",2014-02-18 21:25:24

What I wasn't that impressed with was the staff.  I think it happens a lot in retail, but many of them seemed like they were being bothered if you asked them questions.  I asked where the $15 jeans were and the person rolled their eyes.   The cashiers must have been new because they kept radiong for help with basically every transaction.

It's 10000 points which seemed like a decent price for lunch.  We arrived at 11am and went to the hostess stand for the restaurant and told her we were there for the My Vegas deal.  She said the restaurant was not open and to go to the walk up place.  We did.  The person there acted confused and started to say they weren't open, but of course, there were pizzas sitting there, so that made no sense.  She told us that the place where they get the beer is under construction so she had to go get the beers from the bar in the restaurant (like 20 feet away).  We're like, ""OK"".  Then she says you can have Bud LIght or 3-2-1.  So what we weren't sure about because she was not very clear and it was really loud in there from the overhead music was if we could only have Bud LIght or 3-2-1 because the regular beer thing was closed or if that is all you get on this deal.  Either way that sucked.  If you're using an offer like this to advertise your business, giving me shitty beer is a sure way to not impress me enough to come back.

Next, to the pizza.  There were four options.  I chose the mushroom and spinach with a white sauce and the husband had the many meats selection.  They stick the pieces into the over to heat them for a couple of minutes.  Then since we were told the restaurant was closed, we took our food to the sports book to eat at a table there.  The pizza was fine.  It's that thin crust type which is not my favorite.  The ingredients seemed good, but between the crap beer and the ok pizza and weird service, I have no desire to return.

Some items you can't get elsewhere. 

They make the best spicy pork here ! One of the best I've tried. It's so tasty and flavourful. If you order a medium it comes with one rice, if you order a large it comes with two rices. 

The bibimbap is also really good but nothing too special. If you order the large Bibimbap, the portions are huge but it doesn't come in a hot stone pot. Rather it comes in a big metal bowl. It isn't as hot as the single portion bibimbap but it's still delicious. One order can feed 2-3 people. 

They have a variety of soups. I usually get the spicy seafood soup or the kimchi pork soup. They all come with rice on the side. 

Jajangmyun here is okay. It's one of the typical things you see people in kdramas eating. It's noodles with black bean sauce. 

If you're unsure of what to order. They also have a set menus where you can try small portions of two different items.

It's hard to imagine anything more pleasant than a refreshing sweet treat on a beautiful day in Little Italy.

Their treats are fresh and tasty. Gelatos and Sorbettos are offered in traditional and creative flavours, priced in the $4-6 range.

Ru3Swh1cnYyYj9XUP4nnnA,Q8xzaz3-OXAxkhtjpFD8jw,oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ,5,3,2,3,"- 4.5 -

Food and ambiance is perfection. Great for date night. 

The menu changes quite frequently and their website is pretty up to date so check it out if you'd like an idea of what they're currently serving. Things will come and go but it seems that the Burrata Cheese, the Roasted Bone Marrow and the House-Made Spaghetti are signature items that will always be available for your indulgence. Thankfully.

Burrata Cheese ($16) - Outstanding. I really didn't know what to expect but this dish went above and beyond anything I had imagined. The cheese was so fresh and creamy perfectly combined with the roasted grapes and toasted bread. Makes me drool just thinking about it. 5/5 

Roasted Bone Marrow ($14) - Delicious and well-portioned. More meaty and substantial than many restaurants I've been to. The oxtail was tender and the bone marrow was nice and fatty. 5/5

House-Made Spaghetti All'Amatriciana ($19) - Perfectly al dente. One of the best spaghetti I've ever had. Super fresh and so much flavour but I wish the portion was a little bigger. Well worth the $19 nonetheless. 5/5

Tagliatelle with Duck Ragu ($23) - The least memorable one for me but that's probably because I'm not a huge fan of anything ragu. My boyfriend who is less bias said the duck lacked a bit of flavor and the dish overall was slightly on the saltier side but it wasn't that bad. Tagliatelle was still nice and firm.  3/5

Seared Red Snapper ($28) - They did a great job with the snapper. Nice and crisp on the exterior but the inside is soft and juicy. Mussels were a nice addition along with the saffron potatoes and roasted pepper fondue. Solid dish. 4/5 

Salted Caramel Budino ($9) - Loved that this was not overly sweet or salty. The pudding was light and creamy and the chocolate meringue is in small chunks so it adds a nice texture. 4/5

Hazelnut Torta ($10) - A bit too sweet for me but I believe the gelato is dark chocolate which really helps lessens it.  Definitely recommend getting some tea or coffee with this one. 3/5

Service fell short.  For a restaurant at this level, I was rather disappointed. It was so standard as our server essentially gave us menus, took our orders and gave us our food. Perhaps it was just our particular server because I noticed other tables were waited by much more attentive, enthusiastic and engaged staff. So I'll give Campagnolo the benefit of a doubt and award it the full 5 stars here because I really do feel the food deserves it.

The place was buzzing with activity at lunch hour - always a good sign!
There was a short line up for take out and bakery items, which gave me just enough time to peruse the display case.
The cookies were literally the size of my face, and they had a few different flavors. Considering that's what I came in there to get, I should've had one.
But instead I got side tracked by the Date Square (I'm a DS snob and I'm always on the hunt for just the right one), and the enormous Eatmore slice.
The date square was pretty good - good enough to order again for sure.  Pretty good fruit/oat ratio, not overly spiced, and a nice large size.
The Eatmore bar was nothing like an Eatmore, so that was a little disappointing.  However, if they would've just called it a chocolatey krispie peanut crunch bar, then they would've nailed it, but I realize that name is a mouthful.
Because I haven't tried any of their lunch items and only two baked goods, I can't give a full 5 stars yet, but I do intend on going back soon to get a cookie (and probably at least one other baked good, because there's no way you can leave with just one sweet!)",2016-06-06 20:24:41

They have an amazing selection of beers, too. So craft beer lovers, come play!! Happy hour pricing is on point too, especially if you want to eat some wings.
Also, plenty of things to do here, since I hate just sitting at the bar and having a drink. There's bucket pong, beer pong (cup challenge game), ski-ball, and rockem sockem robots...which are dangerous for competitive people like me. 
For atmosphere...they have a huge outdoor area with high quality patio furniture and nice lighting.

They have a great deal on Mondays where you get 3 rolled tacos around $1.29 plus tax. I decided to order those to go. So they call another customers order number, and she ordered the same thing as I, she tells them she didn't want cheese just lettuce on her tacos, so they put it to the side and dusted off the lettuce.

I must be psychic because I knew what they were going to pull, I watch them pack her dusted off tacos and tell me my order was ready! Yeah not happening, I tell them I don't want her food, I want what I ordered fresh. So long story short, they take another 5 mins to make me 3 tacos and I ended up walking and eating because my lunch break was nearing an end.

So will I go here again...probably so, the food was decent, although they use mystery meat that's tough as freak in the rolled tacos. I don't expect anything else from a Filibertos honestly...cheap food that's edible. Just make certain they don't try to pull a fast one on you.

The best dishes on the dim sum menu is he BBQ pastry puffs, beef short ribs, spring roll rice roll, deep fried shrimp dumplings with aioli, radish cake, ham siu kok, shrimp har gow, siu mai. Best from the regular and dinner menu is Peking duck, moo shu wraps, lettuce wraps, some shrimp dishes. Haven't tried steamed fish or lobster here yet. At the low, this place is overcrowded, servers are hurried and curt, service is minimal at best, there are no high chairs or boosters so you're forced to hold your child or set up your own folded high chair, nobody answers the phone, take out requires 30-44 minutes to wait for the food, the food comes out looking like it lost the extra touch and was thrown on the plate and tastes accordingly. I came here last Saturday again around noon. Food and service was great and it was not crowded due to sunny weather probably. This place has maintained its level of quality and worth a visit.

The prices are cheaper for most things than the grocery stores.

They have all sorts of household goods for cleaning and even have clothes.

There are many items that are actually a dollar, but , the big thing here is the convenience of one stop shopping.

I took one star off because it is a bit dark and seems they need better organization, but if you have time to walk the store and keep an eye out, you will find some terrific bargains.

We ended up coming here because my wife and I had walked by here many times before and have always wanted to stop by but for some reason had not.  We arrived to Casa Reyna at shortly before 1 and proceeded downstairs.  At the bottom of the steps we were greeted by a hostess and then seated.  The downstairs here is a completely different world from the crazy traffic on Penn Ave which was nice. The floor is made up of tile and the walls are mostly wooden with some string lights hanging from the exposed I beams on the ceiling.  It's walls are decorated with fancy tiles and pictures of famous/historical Mexicans.

For lunch on this day our table decided to start out with the elote while I went with the Bistec a la Mexicana (skirt steak in a jalepeno sauce.) Our elote came out first and I had to admit that I was a bit disappointed by it.  Sure it tasted pretty good but since it was served with tortilla chips I was expecting more of a dipping sauce and less of individual kernels with some cheese on top.  A binder of some sort would have made it a lot easier and more enjoyable to eat.  After we had finished with the appetizer our entrees came out and mine looked great.  The steak and peppers were on one side of the dish with the sauce on it while some foil wrapped tortillas and a circle of rice were on the other.  I first tried the skirt steak in the sauce and thought it was dynamite.  It was rich and flavorful with a good bit of heat to it.  That made a perfect pairing for the steak which was cooked to a nice medium and was flavorful by itself.  I eventually ended up eating the steak and sauce in the tortillas which made picking it all up pretty easily.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed my entree and am curious what other of their dishes I might enjoy.",2017-12-13 00:36:48

I would give this more stars if the employees didn't keep pouncing on me like a used car salesman. I'd actually like to give it less stars when it comes to the customer service at the front desk.   

There's a TON of empty computers waiting for people to play on it.  What they should do is have someone play on the computer so people can see what its there for.  Instead you walk around aimlessly, avoiding the employees asking ""can I help you?"" which you automatically reply ""No"".  

Maybe they should say ""Can I show you what this Fotobar is about?"". Instead, they try to sell me shadow boxes!

So I plop myself on a computer and created an account.  VERY EASY to start an account, and I used the photos from my Instagram and FB to create my own set of Polaroids ($1 a piece, minimum 6).  As I'm choosing my pics, the same 5 employees kept bothering me, asking me the same questions ""Are you doing ok?"", ""Is there something I can help you?"". ""Ask me if you need any help"".

After I was done making my stuff, you'd think the same annoying employee would walk me to the cashier and ring me up.  No!! Its 2 slow employees who ring up people, and there's no organized way to queue up.

As I was waiting to pay, I wanted to see a particular frame for my finished photos.  The girl who used to bother me all of a sudden couldn't be bothered to help me.  She had no opinion on which frame would suit me best, and agreed with me everytime I picked a color.

DRONES, I tell ya! Drones!

I waited 10 minutes to pay for my pictures.  Ridiculous!  There's too many employees ROAMING the store, and not enough to take your cash.

So after I paid for my 10 polaroids, and a $42 picture frame, and I was told I'd get a text message when it was ready.  20 minutes later I get the text, and I walk back into the store, and guess what? The same ROAMING employees, who just saw me 20 minutes ago, asked me ""Can I help you?"" ""Welcome to Fotobar"" ""Is there something I can show you?"" ""Do you want to see the shadow boxes"" 

DRONES!!

I walk to the sign that says ""Pick up order"" and waited, and waited, and waited 15 minutes for someone to show up. Finally I flagged a Drone and said ""who's working this desk""?  No apologies, and someone shows up to hand me my pictuers.

We waited so long, in fact, that the bartender grabbed our check and made sure that she had put the order in. The food finally arrived about 20 minutes after we'd ordered it and was nowhere near hot. It had obviously been sitting there for at least five minutes before it had been brought to us, so the cheese had basically gone hard.

Keep in mind that I am a huge fan of contemporary modern design and my own home is decorated accordingly.  The decor in the common areas are well done and I love the rooms decor from the closets and desk to the glass vanity counter tops and glass floor and tiles in the shower.

CUSTOMER SERVICE *****
I read many reviews of the W prior to my stay and in contrast to some poor customer service reviews I've seen - I received outstanding service from the valet to hospitality staff throughout.

ROOM ****
The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars was the television and its in-room system.  It was glitchy, channel selection was basic cable almost, and quality of picture old school.  They provide a nice JBL apple doc station and stereo, but it's only good if you still own the older 30 pin iPods, iPhones, and iPads.

POOL Wet Deck *****
Like many old town Scottsdale spots it's filled with beautiful people.  There are two bars on the pool deck as well.

THE LIVING ROOM *****
This is a combination of hotel entry lounge in the day and very cool lounge at night with live music.

We found it alarming walking in to see it empty of all clients besides us. Usually, that's a bad sign but I'm glad that my dining experience went completely against that bad sign.

Sapori Di Napoli, which is located in the basement of a building is a homely resto with spacious seating and a distinctive Italian decor that screams of the old country to you. The music is clearly Italian with a flavor of the napoletan and as someone who lived in Naples for 2 years as a teenager, a smile formed on my face.

Kindly note, as an Italian who's favorite resto is ""Casa Di Mama"" (Mom's Cooking!), I'm a very harsh critic of Italian food and service... so let's see how it went. 

We decided to split an order of calamari and we both went with the tomato/basil gnocchi from the Yelp pictures already provided. The calamari was very good, with the right amount of chewy/crunch ratio to make it a classic dish. The gnocchi are made the old fashion way, the right way, with homemade pasta with homemade sauce. The gnocchi was good but I was a bit disappointed by them as they were smaller sized than I expected them to be and I didn't really taste the tomato/basil with a somewhat weak liquidy sauce. All in all, they were alright but I probably should have went with something else, like their Pizza.

For desert we both ordered a Cappuccino and a Tiramisu. The Cappuccino was decent enough but seemed to be off somehow. The Tiramisu simply wasn't for me. Perhaps it's the way my mom used to make it but I didn't like it at all. Too liquidy, flavor wasn't there.

The best part of our visit was our waiter Guido who was very friendly, accommodating, funny and amiable and took care of us. We got immediately served with the most delicious warm garlic focaccia bread that was simply phenomenal (and the best thing we ate!). I mentioned to my friend how I should bring my wife here as garlic focaccia is her kryptonite and would LOVE IT. At the end of our visit, Guido provided me with a huge bag with warm garlic focaccia to bring to the wife. WOW! During desert he provided us with free freshly made donuts as well. They were very good! I was blown away on his service. 5 STARS!

And the wife LOVED the garlic focaccia and we're now coming back... for good reason! I want to try their pizzas, arancini balls and those delicious donuts again! Once this is done, I'll update this review to the 5 stars I'm sure it deserves!!!

As for the resto being empty on week days, the problem is mostly location, I'm sure if the location was closer to the main streets of St. Laurent (it's located smack in the middle of very residential streets, so weekdays it's pretty quiet and weekends require reservations apparently) it would be otherwise full. With this type of food/service... no doubts about it.

They have a dedicated Dim Sum menu and with pictures in case you're unsure of what you're ordering. I prefer the traditional method of carts being pushed around which is much quicker and gets you munching on things faster. My main complaint was the time it took to bring the food out. With everything being custom ordered, this is the drawback to this system.

The food was very good and I had no complaints. This is probably the best Dim Sum in Madison. The selection is very plentiful which is refreshing because some Dim Sum places are limited in what they offer. Not Nani!

Once we were seated the owner, Fanny, came right over to say hi, and to check in. Quickly and cheerfully letting us know the restaurants history (they were 10 years in another location), a few menu highlights, and to take drink orders.

We ordered 3 full rolls each $10-14, and we also ordered a lunch special for $9 with tempura and chicken teriyaki, that include soup, and gyoza. We had a custom salmon roll that my son likes  and Gary's special roll and something else that my son ordered. Gary's roll was really great.

I picked up the apple flavored lollipop. The lady was explaining us how it worked. There's a cap that covers the lollipop if you can't finish it. Once you finish the lollipop, you discard the stick and replace it with another one. You can order the lollipops on line. Great idea. The whole lollipop contraption was a little pricey if you ask me. It was about $25.00 a pop. The other one was free.
The store was very bright and colorful and had lots of different kinds of candy especially the old school candy.

I started off with the french fry trio. Eh. They were fries, so there were some truffles sprinkled on them... good, but amazing? No.

The oysters were good, but they take no special preparation on the part of the chef.

My wife had the tomato soup with lobster grilles cheese... it was ok.

Our steaks, also pretty standard. to be honest, I like the steaks at Flemmings better. 

The highlight of the meal, was my appetizer, the Foie Gras sliders with reduction of caramelized onions, and the red velvet cake with chocolate mouse.

I ordered the marrow bones to go with my steak, and for $29.00, I was expecting larger marrow bones, and at least a marrow spoon to extract it with. Instead I got two 1 inch bones, and I had to fish out what I could with the back side of my fork.

All in all, it wasn't an exceptional meal, but it wasn't bad either.

Pros
- Excellent Location.  Right in the middle of the strip
- Go Room was well worth the price.  Nice lighting that's almost a little kinky. The bed was comfortable and the view was great.
- They have a nice pool
- Take a walk outside for a break and enjoy their koi pond and real pink flamingos
- Plenty of table games and slots.  Limits are ~$10 even on a weekday morning.

Cons
- No security at the hotel elevators so be wary of your surroundings when you walk to your room and put your valuables in your in-room safe
- There was a huge gap under the door that kept bringing in draft.  Someone was also smoking in the hallway for 2 nights and that came right into the room.  I learned to block under the door with pillows to stop the smoke from coming in.
- Comes with cheaper hotels, but people would laugh and talk freely in the hallways.
- Internet here sucks.  They claim 5mbps and you need to pay extra to get 10mbps, but both were flaky.  I kept getting sent to login over and over.  The internet was useless in the morning that I had to go to a nearby coffee shop.
- Their diamond lounge is not so premium feeling
- Parking building exists, but a little tough to park because Cromwell people use it too
- Not much of a food selection in Flamingo, but you are surrounded by them if you walk out.

In summary, it's a great value for the price in a very good location.
Hey, it's either $50/night at the Flamingo or $150/night at Bellagio.  I would suck it up and save the money and go use it on food or a show.",2017-02-04 07:31:33

9alIRgM8w9WDXe-7qNDmfw,JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,bx2KK3t9RHD0FmLYFLE_jg,3,6,11,2,"Booked a last-minute room here for Nuit Blanche 2013 via hoteltonight.com.  Chose the property because it was roughly equidistant to UQAM and the Belgo, where I planned to take pictures.  Also because boutique hotel.  I collect boutique hotel stays the way some people collect Pez dispensers.

Check-in was courteous and speedy, if one disregards the somewhat amusing ceremony during which I was offered a $20 upgrade to a king room.  Declined.  Was then given a ticket for a complimentary cocktail at the bar for no apparent reason.  

Free martini coupon in hand, I went up to the queen room I'd paid for.  Surprise:  It hadn't been made up.  Minks were still fornicating in the bed.   There were towels on the lavatory floor.  Whole place reeked of Chanel No. 19.  I quickly donned a latex glove and called the front desk.

""Hello.  This is President Mugabe in room XYZ.  I just checked in a minute ago.  The, um, room you've sent me to hasn't been cleaned yet--""

""OMG WTF I AM SO SORRY! I WILL PUT YOU IN A BETTER ROOM!""  The immediacy of the reply made me suspect this kind of thing had happened to them before.  To their credit, they were in full grovel when I returned to the front desk for another set of keys.

Next room they sent me to was a huge king, big enough to rollerskate in.  Towels properly folded, no one sitting on the john.  Apart from housekeeping's choice of a nauseating, headache-inducing rose-scented room spray,  my complete inability to convince the thermostat to display anything but 76°F, and the constant, loud white noise from the main ventilation trunk adjacent to the room, it was as nice an accommodation as I've ever stayed in.  Figured I'd be tired enough to sleep through the noise and the smell when I finally got back after midnight, and I was right.

Mattress was nice and firm.  Pillows were like warm marshmallows.  Slept like a corpse.

Bathroom was well-appointed.  Shower stall large enough for a Shetland pony, with a big-ass rainfall shower head.  Hot water, lots of it.  Their soap didn't make me want to puke.  Towels were big enough to wrap, and stay wrapped.  Plenty of light to shave in.

Night clerk was extremely accommodating when I'd needed to make a field-expedient repair to a camera just before midnight, and asked if they had six inches of black electrical tape .  Maintenance man appeared with a roll within a minute.

Check-out was breezy, except for the part when they charged me for a supper at Suite 701.  Problem was, I hadn't even gone in for my comped drink-  the thumpa-thumpa music and the lurid pink light over the bar had scared me the hell away the second I'd peeked in.  I'd actually eaten supper in a Chinese dumpling place on St-Laurent.  

""Really?  That wasn't me.""

""Oh?""  (Frenzy of flipping documents.)  ""HA-HA!  PLEASE DISREGARD!  YOU MAY LEAVE NOW!""  A mixed look of shame and terror on her face, poor beast.  Again, it seemed like something the front desk has to put up with once in a while.

Very good ""damage control"" customer service attitude, plus a clean, parking lot-sized king room with everything working for $125 taxes in, are what's getting them the three stars.  One learns to expect hiccups and slightly dodgy rooms when booking through discount sites, frankly.  If I'd been paying full rate, though, I expect some things would have been quite different.

I'll seriously consider using this place for next year's Nuit Blanche, if I can get a similar rate.",2013-03-04 18:32:06

I revisited this place on Feb 29, 2013 after not dining here in at least 5 years. While impressed by the service, the food selection was unimpressive for a buffet, so I will unfortunately not make the trek here anymore.

We were greeted almost immediately upon entering and promptly shown to a table, were offered drinks, which were on our table when we returned from the buffet station. Our waiter checked back 5 minutes later to see if we needed anything else and to ask if we were enjoying the food. Plates were cleared promptly. Attentiveness was great, although unassuming.

The hot food selection was a disappointment....like other reviewers I am a huge fan of Butter Chicken. Here, while flavourful, the meat contained bones and was a lower quality of chicken. The Tandori chicken was flavourful as well.....but no breasts (white meat) ...it, like the butter chicken, were thighs and drumsticks. The spiciest dish on the buffet were the pakora's, which was a surprise as the buffet also had the chick peas (which are usually a bit spicy, but here were rather bland). 

Unfortunately for us, the best part of the buffet was the naan bread...which is a staple at every Indian restaurant.

I recall a few years back coming across a drink I used to love as a kid and buying it and being hugely disappointed at how the memory of it was actually better than the real thing.......I felt that same feeling after eating here.",2013-03-04 04:48:59

You HAVE to love it, but it's not like the food is out of this world, the closest thing to atmosphere is watching birds chase after crumbs and you know it's not at all healthy for ya and yet...  Pete's has been in business since 1947 so it's quite an Arizona tradition to go at least a few times.

Pete's Fish and Chips are all around the valley, but I happen to think pretty highly of this location.  It's not far from my house so we're often running errands in the area or I can pick it up on the way home.  But also, it has more of an old-school neighborhood feel - even though you can sit at a table facing Central Ave.  Really great diverse crowd pretty much every time we go.  And so far everyone has been fairly friendly when waiting, which can be so important in a hungry crowd.

Plain fish and chips are all good, as are their fish sandwiches.  Their shrimp is actually my favorite I think.  The sauce that comes with all fried goodies has some spice to it, but has enough ketchup-y ness that even the wimps at our table (cough-my girlfriend-cough-cough) can enjoy it.  They make a pretty mean burger too.  Prices are pretty cheap, though if you go hungry and think ""Wow, this is cheap!  Maybe we should also get sides of this and that too!"" it can get more expensive, but in a deep-fried-yummylishious kind of way that somehow makes it all ok. 

It's generally service with a smile, but sometimes, well, folks might have gotten a bit of extra grease splashed their way or something.  It's never hurt the quality (Can I use that word here?) of the product.  

And just to mix things up, my location at least also serves corn dogs, chicken and steak sandwiches, horchata and an assortment of Pete's goodies like bumper stickers, t-shirts and beanies.  And don't forget a quarter fed merry-go-round for the kids.  Gotta love it.",2007-02-11 03:08:53

We are a young couple, and it seemed like she didn't want to give us too much attention because we obviously weren't going to buy the most expensive bottle of wine. Didn't offer us straws when she did for the table right next to us, nor lemons for our water. The bread came after we were completely done with our appetizer. It just didn't feel elegant.

I wouldn't say that the service is bad all around, I witnessed our server take great care of the tables around ours. Offered fresh pepper, cheese, refills, etc...just not to us.

Her $20 linguine with clams was smaller than my 2yo daughter's spaghetti from the kids menu, which was served in the exact same size bowl that is only slightly larger than a small bread plate (see pics). We had to wait 15min, after asking, to receive the check, another 10min for her to take payment, and had to remind our server that the kids meal came with dessert, which we ended up having to take home. The rest of us wanted dessert but we couldn't handle being there any longer (nearly 2hrs). There were only 5 seated tables in the entire restaurant at the time, so it was frustrating that we had to chase our server down so much.

When we arrived we checked in at the host stand and were seated promptly. Our server came over ( I wish I remembered his name) and greeted us and went over the menu and took our drink orders. We told him we were going to order appetizers first then our main course a little later, we wanted to enjoy the night, he was very accommodating and timed everything perfectly!

The infamous popovers had hit the table after the chicken liver pate was served! The pate was quite tasty in my opinion, but my better half didn't care for it much. Now I was ready to try these popovers, I added a little bit of butter to them, first bite was wonderful, then second and third bite started to get a tad bit salty. I thought it might have been the butter so I tried a piece without any... Stil pretty salty.. But overall they were good!

We started off with oysters on the half shell and tuna tartare! Apparently, the tuna was one of the main reasons why he wanted to come to this place, and now I see why, it was excellent and the portion size was bigger than I thought it'd be as well! Bonus! The oysters were delicious as well, but you can't really go wrong with nice cold oysters.

Main course, he ordered the wagyu steak (12oz $92) medium rare with an order of the jalapeno mashed, I ordered the ribeye ($40) medium rare with crab mac and cheese. My boyfriend was so excited about his steak and thought that he would be so in love with it, but he was slightly disappointed. His steak came out more at a medium on one side and medium rare on the other, then on the medium rare side the cut must have been bad because it was pretty grainy and chewy and the medium side was nice and tender and delicious minus it being a tad over cooked for his taste. In my opinion for a $92 dollar cut of meat, I would say it wasn't worth it this time around, but we also didn't want to complain and send such an expensive cut of meat back only for it to be thrown out. My ribeye was delicious eventhough it was more of a medium as well, but that could have been my fault for letting it sit for a bit while I was trying out the mash and the mac and cheese. The jalapeno mash was super yummy, I couldn't stop ""taste testing"" it lol, and my lobster mac and cheese was pretty good the first bite, but as I ate a bit more it was extremely too salty for me and the bf.

Our server saw the look on my face and came immediately over and asked if anything was wrong, I let him know my side was very salty and wasn't sure if it was me or not and ask if anyone else had said it was salty,he said that was actually the first one he's sold today, so I asked him if he wanted to taste it for himself. He laughed a little and said he would take it off our bill and they could remake a new one for us. I told him that its alright keep it on the bill and I'll just take it home and dilute it with milk, but to just check the rest of the batch to make sure it was just us and wasn't a cooking error.

All together, I really enjoyed our night and our server was absolutely attentive and amazing! I still wish I could remember his name, there aren't very many great servers left in this industry! But I'm sure he knew we loved him since we left him close to a 30% tip :) will definitely be back again!",2015-08-27 04:38:51

The place is located South of Greenway (both of them) and right before the AL's Rayco, on the West Side. It is a simple looking place with nothing extraordinary to draw you in. BUT

Once you get inside it is a very comfortable bar. The place holds a bunch of people, has several pool tables and a full bar to sit at. There is a little ""outside type patio for you lung killers"". Several video games, bar top machines etc. 

Since I was ther for lunch, I did not have the Captain and Coke but verified they do have it. ( happy face here)

I had the cheeseburger, (fresh sirloin) with a toasted bun, lettuce, tomato, and pickle. IT WAS FAN-TASTIC. It might have something to do with the pat of butter melted on the top as she was cooking it. 
I also had the hand cut french frys. They were really good. 

The next trip will be for the Braut. 

The only bad thing I can say is, although worth it, the burger, frys and coke came to $11.75. I would have preferred a lunch special with it as a combo instead of the ala-carte. 

The place was clean, the owners are fun and do not mind a little chit chat while they cook and run around. They have the football package for the sports fans. They are a Packers Bar but don't let that stop you.

My pedicure was pretty boring, and nothing to really write home about. Next time I'll ask if they do a deluxe pedi. After id left the salon, I couldn't even remember if i'd had my toes done.

Get Air brings out the inner child in you. My sister and I went and we were the oldest ""kids"" there. We were super pumped to jump around on the trampolines, dunk basketballs in the hoops, play dodgeball, go rock climbing, jump into the green marshmallow cloud, and push each other into the foam box pits. Everything was all fun and games until you finish seeing everything in 30 min. We purchased an hour of play so to kill time, I decided to try and do some flips on the trampoline. Be careful and don't be too ambitious like me because you can scrape your limbs pretty bad like I did. I got two deep scrapes on my elbows from falling on the trampoline and marshmallow cloud. A good tip would be to wear long sleeves and long pants if you decide to do decide to attempt the flips. Otherwise, summer attire is perfect because you'll be sweaty from running and jumping around. What really made our trip to Get Air worthwhile were the kiddos there. They were all full of energy and loved playing with us older kids. 

Get Air has three rooms reserved for Private parties. This is an excellent venue for kids who want to have their birthday parties here. It's rare to spot adults on the trampoline as they'll most likely be along the side chit chatting as their children run around. Massage chairs are available at an extra charge if you decide that you need a couple minutes of relaxation.

Always look on Groupon for deals. We purchased a one hour jump pass for two people for $15. Search Groupon for additional promo codes. What the fine print doesn't tell you is that jump socks are not included in the Groupon deal. Jump socks are required and they cost $3.25 each.

My drink came out and I saw it wasn't marked for almond milk so I asked the barista and she screamed at Kylie who then apologized because she forgot to mark almond milk. It wasn't really a big deal because I had time to wait for them to remake it.

I ordered up one of them Pit burgers with some good 'ol swiss cheese (I ain't know a lot about them swiss but I like that there cheese even though they ain't figgered out how to fill in them holes in the cheese yet) and some mushrooms and green chili.  I axed for onion rings instead of them fries 'cause I just been eatin' up on a whole mess of fries for a stretch and I needed me a change of pace.

Well that there burger shore did hit the spot.  Them green chili pieces was right nice 'cause they put the whole dad-gum slice of pepper on that ol' boy but it ain't had no bite to it no how.  Them Pit Stop onion rings was ok and all but I ain't writin' home to mama 'bout 'em or anything.

It is hands down one of my favourite places to go out for lunch in the area. I was first introduced by some coworkers back when I worked in the area, and yesterday I had the pleasure of introducing a friend who recently started working in the area. 

The dumplings are delicious. I always get them steamed (though they are also available pan fried). Every different variation I have tried has been great. At lunch they have a special menu that includes a soup and a salad with an order of dumplings.  The lunch menu is shorter, which is great for indecisive people like me, especially when like I've already said, everything is great!  

I couldn't give this review five starts because of some service concerns. I don't expect perfection, especially not when delicious food is involved, but this left a bit to be desired. There was an awkward moment when we realized our waitress didn't speak (or understand) any French, which isn't a huge issue, it was just really awkward and unexpected to have someone staring at us clearing not understanding a word we were saying not saying anything back at us. Then there was an order mix up, when we all clearly remember the person ordering a certain item and another was delivered. We were told to just take it, because making it right would take too long. Awkward again. Finally, the pacing was a bit off, we got our soups and salads at the same time as our dumplings, when we had been waiting what felt like a long time after ordering. I wish though there were half stars, because these were minor blips on an otherwise great visit and I feel bad docking them a whole star.  Good food is worth awkwardness.

Small service issues aside, it was a delicious lunch indeed.  Delicious food at a good price.  Cosy and good for catching up with friends.  We didn't ever feel rushed.",2013-03-05 17:19:12

There's a variety of trails with differing difficulties and features. Some out in the open and some under tree cover (if you want to avoid the sun).  Whether you just want to amble through the gardens and park your butt on a bench in front of a pond, or you want a sweat inducing hike through streams and steep slopes (see: Stebbins Gulch), they offer something for everyone. 

Plenty of ponds and streams. There is a lot of (unobtrusive) signage throughout so you can identify the species of trees and flowers. They offer classes and a variety of events for all ages. 

With the exception of a few designated areas, you can take your pooch along with you (if you're cool with stopping every 15 feet so they can pee on things, of course).   

Holden Arboretum is a 45 drive from my home, so it's not somewhere I'd visit regularly, but I would love to return in each the spring, summer and fall. A great place for photographers as there's so many different vistas.

* Bookstore - Full of instructional (both beginner and intermediate) and song books for all instruments (and organized by such as well)
* Drums and Drum sets
* Woodwinds and brass
* Strings
* Guitars
* Sound equipment
* Pianos - located upstairs with a very conservative sales rep who knew his stuff
* Lessons - located upstairs (near the pianos) with a waiting room that looks very similar to a large doctor's office.
* Cafe in the lobby by cash

Based on all the good reviews I had to try this place out. The restaurant is fairly small and when we got here it seemed like it was filled with a bunch old retired people. I had to double check to make sure I didn't walk into a seniors home. Anyway, I ended up trying the lobster sandwich, crab sandwich and a dozen fresh oysters. There lobster sandwich was a-okay (3 stars) and the crab sandwich was double a-okay (4 stars) and the fresh oysters were a triple a-okay (5 stars). I think the sandwiches themselves were fresh and had a decent amount of lobster and crab meat. I liked the crab sandwich a lot more for some reason. Probably because of the deep fried squid tentacles. The main event of course were the fresh oysters and damn were they good. The waitress recommended us trying a mixture of different oysters as they all taste a little different. It came in a large plate of ice and they were all shucked  for us already. Super fresh and tasted even more awesome with some lemon and hot sauce. I liked the big oysters the best. The sandwiches were over $15 each and the dozen oysters were over $30 (each type of oyster having a different price point), so remember to come with pockets filled. A must try if in the mood for fresh oysters.",2013-11-03 04:15:24

My boyfriend and I were starving and on Queen Street and were looking for a healthy, decently nice place to eat when we came upon The Healthy Greek. We looked at the menu and it looked fairly reasonable. However, once we sat down, things just got worse and worse. My boyfriend wanted to order the BBQ Chicken and we were told they were out of it (even though this was well before closing time). This wouldn't normally be a big deal and he simply ordered the chicken shawarma and a pop instead. I decided to try something new and went with the beef gyro.

When the food came, we realized that they had served my boyfriend chicken souvlaki. He was kind of frustrated. We waited awhile for his drink to come, which never did. My meal was horrible, to say the least and I wound up giving over half of it to my boyfriend. I asked him if beef gyro normally tastes like that and he said no. Both of our meals were horribly dry and must have been the remnants from the day. Also, our water glasses were never refilled and we were never served again from the time the food was placed in front of us until we paid.

Then, when the bill came, we found that what I had actually wasn't beef gyro, it was lamb gyro. Kind of a big difference. My boyfriend was pretty angry at this point. At least the prices were the same for everything and they never charged us for the pop he ordered and never got. My boyfriend wanted to leave a really small tip but he was forced to leave a certain amount. For ~$30, it was way too much for very sub-par food.

I think the only way I would return to The Healthy Greek would be if I needed a salad for lunch (lunch meals are much cheaper and the salad ingredients looked much fresher than what we were served). The only good thing I can say about this place is that the meal came with a huge serving of rice, a small salad and some potatoes, so it was definitely filling. 

Overall, if you find yourself on Queen Street, you can do much better.",2012-11-21 00:56:02

The wait staff here are unfriendly but not in a rude or offensive way more like whoever hired the waitstaff showed up to a meet-up for antisocial/introverted Japanese people and just hired them all on the spot. It's not terrible but it does feel awkward when you're being helped by people that want nothing to do with you.

I ordered the Shoyu ramen which is topped off with 2 pieces of chashu (which I gave to my husband, cuz I don't like pork) and a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and green onion. My husband ordered the Spicy Tan Tan and we both ordered extra corn and mushrooms which cost an extra 75 cents which is fine but for some reason my ramen came with a scant 7 kernels of corn and maybe 2 extra buttons of mushroom???  

I don't savour the fact that Sansotei serves ONLY PORK based broths... I get it, ramen is classically based on a pork broth but hey not everyone is a fan of consuming pork and here's one great reason why  https://youtu.be/_KrW6AKWMT0

The noodles I ordered were of the thicker variety but they were disappointingly short and had an undesirable al dente texture which took away from the whole slurping experience I mean, if you're not able to slurp your Ramen what's the point of having ramen to begin with ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The one highlight of the whole experience was the Crêpe Cake which is outsourced by the amazing Millie Crêperie of course. 

In summation,  if you like pork based broth and if you like being served by waitstaff who act like they're afraid to talk to people then Sansotei on Yonge is your type of Ramen place otherwise I'm going to have to give it a 2 out of 5",2017-04-12 23:14:27

The lunch specials come with a little side salad, egg roll, rice & entree for a decent price. 

When I ordered through Yelp/ Eat24, I got a message saying that my order had been processed but that the restaurant was ""very busy,"" so my order wouldn't arrive on time and would come closer to 90 minutes later. My food came, after contacting customer service, after almost 2 hours. Kind of defeats the point of delivery.

It was almost a full house when our party of three plus an infant arrived on a Sunday.  There were plenty of birthday people and other large groups celebrating.  We were quite pleased with the ambiance, service, and food.  

More about the food!  We of course chose from the all you can eat buffet and cuts of meat.  The going rate was $50 per person.  The buffet had the usual cold pasta salads, green salads, and a Thai inspired salad, as well as a tasty salmon in cream sauce, and other stuff we skipped over.  After all we were there for the unending supply of meat.  We were offered lamb and chicken sliced off the skewer, but passed them up in favor of filling up on the Brasil picanha (BP) aka sirloin steaks.  The first round of BP was quite tender and juicy, and oh so delicious.  After eating some flank steak slices, skirt steak, and other cuts, we said yes to a second round of BP.  I didn't quite enjoy it as much because it was a little chewier (even though it was medium rare).  Our party ate at least 4 different cuts of beef each (all tasty in their own right), and we ended up needing to pace ourselves over what seemed like 21/2 hours.  We met the manager who appeared non-plussed in helping clean up tables, and offered details about Copacabana's other Niagara Falls location (yes they are owned by the same people).  The live music was also a plus and the musicians even took a request to turn up the tempo on the much too melancholy tunes.

As well, we could not help but note how attractive our server, and most of the other servers, and the young men carrying the skewers of meat were.  By intention we're sure, and we have every intention of going back again in the near future.",2010-07-19 17:51:12

 -a complimentary in-room movie
- A $30 credit for room service 
 -One selected bottle of wine
 -Breakfast in bed
 -Parking
 -Later checkout at 1 p.m.

For a fee of $35 the Germain allowed us to bring our baby girl, which is our 13 year old Amstaff, and she too was spoiled with her own comfy doggie bed and a packet of treats!

The hotel is pristinely clean and our suite was stunning!  Really my pictures do them no justice, but imagine 9+ foot high ceilings with beautifully spacious modern surroundings.  A powder room, a dining and living room area, a serenely beautiful bedroom ( no briefs or stinky men's socks strewn about!)  with large screen TV.  The en-suite bathroom here is spa-like and has double vanity sinks and gorgeous fixtures by Kohler. I must have spent half a day bathing in it's zen-like oasis  while hubby was oohing and awwing over his gargantuan rainshowering experience.   My favourite room of all of course was the walk-in closet.  At this point I'm really feeling attachment issues and want to move in permanently to Le Germain...Le sigh! 

 Room service was friendly, expedient and timely and the service overall at the Germain hotels go well above and beyond to make things right for the guests. It's also worth noting that they've been ranked #1 hotel in Toronto by Trip Advisor http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g155019-d1940841-Reviews-Hotel_Le_Germain_Maple_Leaf_Square-Toronto_Ontario.html  Our room service dinner was deliciously fab as I ordered the Healthy Turkey burger which came with a piquant corn relish and hubby ordered a rare steak. Also how awesome is it when you get to eat your dinner in comfort and leisure while wearing over sized cotton terry bath robes?

Bedtime is pure luxury snoozing at the Germain hotel where you're nestled among the 300+ count Frette sheets and fluffy zaftig goose down pillows and duvet. I felt like I was sleeping blissfully on a cloud.  Another plus is that because this hotel is not located in the club district (like the other Germain on Mercer) you can actually get some restful sleep here.

The one complaint I have is the stress of parking in front of the hotel to flag the valet parking as Bremner blvd is often packed both with cars and pedestrian traffic. This isn't so much a fault of the Germain as the area is pretty congested in general plus the day we came, there was a Raptors vs Lakers game on @ the ACC so it was a bit of a scramble getting around.

All-in-all the Maple Leaf Square location of the Germain far exceeded my expectations.  I've had the pleasure of staying at 3 different Germain Hotels and this one has become my favourite location by far!  If you're looking for a weekend escape in the city and don't mind splurging, then let Le Germain Maple Leaf Square envelop you in it's oasis of stylish calm, just try not to get too attached :)",2012-02-15 07:44:30

While waiting for the rest of our party, we went to the bar first. There is no happy hour during restaurant week so be prepared to pay normal drink prices. I got a Brazilian version of a mojito and my coworker got a glass of wine. When we did get to our table we were upset to hear there were wine specials. Had the bartender told us this earlier, we would have shared a bottle. 

Come hungry. I ate small bites throughout the day. The salad bar is amazing and includes meat and cheese. Honestly I could eat just the salad bar. The gorgonzola mousse is top notch. Of the items brought as appetizers and sides to the table, I enjoyed the cheese bread. Eat the polenta and fried bananas while they are hot. Once cooled down, they don't taste as good.

And finally meat! Once you flip your card, the meat service seemed nonstop and service was great. Our disappointment was that a fish wasn't included on the $35 menu. And also occasionally if only one person had their card flipped, the servers had a hard time seeing it, but we had a large party. My favorite was the lamb and the parmesan garlic pork tenderloin.

This clearly has happened repetitively to the point where I feel it necessary to post about it. Makes me just never want to ask any questions or even try and make small talk with anyone because everyone just stares at you and gives you bad vibes. 

I will say that I have had 2 positive experiences with the front desk girls; one was via phone call, and the other an in person interaction. Whomever I spoke to those 2x, thank you for being sweet, and answering my questions with care. 

To all of the other times, the perceivably annoyed stares and lack of interest aren't appreciated. After all, isn't this studio based on fitness, motivation, and good vibes? Where are the good vibes from the front desk?! Just seems so ironic.

So as me and my fiancé both go to place our order we are told that we can only choose from a specific category. Well that's FALSE advertisement.

Despite it being 9 or so on a Sunday morning there wasn't a wait. We were seated inside. We were impressed by how clean and well kept everything was. It was a bit noisy but we could still chat without too much trouble.

I had the back bacon and tomato eggs benny and the man had whatever the big breakfast is. Our food came fast and everything looked great. My date was missing a chicken sausage which they were quick to explain and promised it would be out shortly. It was! The food was tasty with decent portions. I like that they use local suppliers and have little cards on the table featuring info about some of them.

While it isn't the cheapest breakfast in town, I think the prices are fair as the food is done really well. Our server was easily confused which made things a bit awkward but she was polite and attentive.

I finally made it to the top of turtlehead about a month after my initial review and have since been up there several times. 

It really is a strenuous hike, but the view up top and rewarding feeling of accomplishment that comes along with it is addicting and keeps me coming back for more. 

I've decided there is no ""right"" way to hike to the top, there are just hard and harder ways to get up there. Being a person who likes maps and rules and designated walkways, it's hard for me, but I make it. I still believe the path could be better marked. I think there are only like, all of maybe 3 trail makers the entire time. 

First time I made it to the top, there was a mini American flag and container with the notepad you can sign and couple other goodies. Over the summer and a few months later, the flag is gone but the container was still there last time I went up. 

This hike is not for the timid or faint of heart. Wear sunscreen and pack tons of water. And know it really will take up a few hours of your day. But it's worth it when you get to the too! Just remember to save energy for the way down though!",2013-11-01 01:24:01

It is part of the Parkway West complex of buildings just above where the former mall sat. The Alcove is located in building number 6 which also houses the main lab of Quest diagnostics. It sits just to the right of the Post Office.

Upon entering I was warmly greeted and given a menu which I would assume would be available for take out. With a Yelp check in you are entitled to a free cookie-chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin. He told me that their soup of the day was tomato which he said was excellent. I opted for one of their daily specials - chicken DeVinci on a hoagie roll. It comes with cheese, mushrooms, peppers and a tangy sauce. Since the sauce was a little to hot for me they substituted a marinara sauce in its place. He then told me that if I wanted to make it a combo I would get a fountain drink and a choice of either French fries or potato chips for just $2.00 more! I was amazed at the fact that most of their selections are under $10.00 just to start with! He also told me that breakfast items were available all day if I so chose.

After placing my order he gave me my chocolate chip cookie and took my name so they would bring it out to me. This place is small but it fills up fast over the lunch hour. I got my sandwich and fries in about 10 minutes and believe me it was so good, I was blown away! The fries were also delicious and even though I knew this was a probably a standard cookie I was amazed at how fresh it tasted! 

Basically all you have at your table are napkin dispensers. You get your condiments and utensils over at the fountain area. There is a separate area if you wish to purchase coffee. 

Among their offerings are various salads, hamburgers, hoagies, paninis, and wraps.  They have a listing for snacks and sides which include queso fritters, white cheddar macaroni and cheese, grilled cheese, hot dog or a cup of soup.

On my initial visit a BBLTA, Double Bacon, Lettuce ,Tomato, and Avocado Sandwich, was right on, with thick slices of Applewood Smoked Bacon and homemade potato chips that were good but salty.  Twisty Curly Fries tasted good, and there were a lot of them, but they were greasy, and fish filets were a bit undercooked for Fish & Chips.  On the last outing, Beer Battered Cod Loins were cooked properly but the breading was softer than usual.

For apps, Fried Pickle Chips were well executed; 6 cheesy Potato Skins were nice and juicy, with a meaty flavor exuding from the bacon; and 5 pork Potstickers were frozen but very tasty, served with a very good spicy Szechuan Dipping Sauce.  A Turkey Avocado Club Sandwich on Sourdough Bread was a fine choice paired with very yummy Cheesy Tater Tots.  

On the first occasion a Cheeseburger ordered plain came out highly festooned with vegetables before it was replaced; and on the third outing Potato Skins ordered with Green Onions on the side came out instead covered with circles of Green Onions before this order, too, was redone.  And, even though only two or four diners were in the entire dining room when I was there, it seemed to take a long time between ordering and receiving food.  But service was always friendly, and otherwise well executed.  It seemed like the glitches with orders were principally occurring in the kitchen, and on a subsequent visit our server told us that a chef had been replaced.

The Millside menu is varied, fairly extensive, and rather inventive, focusing primarily on comfort food.  For instance, on my last late night venture here, I selected a Pepperstrami Sandwich as my main dish.  This combination of pastrami, pepperoni, melted Muenster Cheese, Coleslaw, and Chipotle Mayonnaise spread on and pressed between two slices of lightly toasted Sourdough Bread resulted in an interesting and pleasant mix of flavors.  Thankfully the pastrami was not dry, and the pepperoni was not overcooked.  The hotness of the pepperoni and Chipotle Mayo was modulated somewhat by the pastrami, which tasted like it had been marinated in sweet BBQ Sauce.  But for hours afterward my gut felt like a small fireball was inhabiting it.
 
The dining room of this 24-hour tavern/restaurant has a southwestern ambiance with highback booths.  Because I live close by, and the food has either been good or promising, I will be monitoring Millside to see if further improvement continues here, as I am hopeful it will.

The Velveteen Rabbit is downtown in the art district.  The interior/ambiance fits perfectly here, yet the Velveteen Rabbit is not pretentious like its hip East Freemont & Arts District counterparts.

Also, what grocery store runs out of butter? My sister and I went here on a Monday night to get stuff for our hotel rooms. Their produce wasn't the best, in fact all of the cucumbers were very soft and on the verge of going bad. The lettuce was browning and the fruit looked like it was all on its last leg. Anyway, we needed to get some butter as my sister's husband likes bagels with butter in the morning. Well, I guess the section where the butter is kept broke down and they had to take all of it off the shelves. Like I said, ghetto! I guess they didn't have any in the back either. 

When we went to check out they had 1 lane open with a line about 10 people deep.

We previously signed up for the 10.00 membership since it's considered a private club. You can do it online but then must receive a confirmation email that your payment went through. We got to the door, gave them our name and bam...card in hand. You are greeted at the end of a dimly lot hallway and seated inside at a table or the bar but there can be a wait for the bar. That is where we would have preferred to sit but it was already busy at 6:30 when we ended up arriving. We could have waited at a small stand up area but didn't see that until we had already been seated at a table. 
We ordered these drinks in no particular order; The hot box, the truffle New York sour, modern royalty and the biplane. The hot box is a cocktail that comes in a Bookers box with woodchips that are smoking so it makes the whole place smelled really good. My favorite was the truffle New York sour where the eggs are infused with truffle so you really get that nice earthy note to the drink.
We did end up getting a snack which was the octopus and sometimes that can be tough but they did a great job keeping it tender. The menu looked delicious from top to bottom.

This is the nearest grocer for downtown residents, and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin.

On any day, the parking lot is covered in grease, coffee, and trash. IF by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers, then the heavens are smiling on you.

Once inside the store, your adventure is just starting. The characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in Star Wars. Very random and sketchy. As far as the contents of the store, to be fair they have all the stuff you need, and at a reasonable price point.

The huge problem here, is everything else. During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.

I wanted to because the fried chicken there looks and smells amazing. I'm on a strict diet and can't have fried food or carbs. So I was excited for the bowl options. I ordered the Every Day I'm Brussel'n and had to resist singing as I ordered. I added rotisserie chicken to mine. 

The salad looked beautiful as did my coworkers plates. The salad was uncooked finely shredded brussel sprouts, apple and parmesan, I think. The dressing complimented the salad well and I could have used more of it. The chicken was very dry. I was expecting a tender juicy piece of chicken and, instead got some rock hard strips of chicken. So it's not something I want to order again. 

Staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself was very clean. They also have a Coke Freestyle machine, which is a plus since it has many choices I can drink like sparkling water.

Overall, I didn't see what the hype was about.",2018-08-19 22:47:40

When we arrived on a Sunday evening a little after six there was only one other person in the restaurant. We asked for a table outside as we had our dog with us. Our server came out with waters and asked if we were ready to order. We told her we would start with the hummus and pita. She came back and asked if we were ready to order and we asked if she had put the hummus in. No she had not. When the hummus arrived we ordered our entrees. I was out of water by this point. 20 minutes later, still no water. She dropped our entrees and said she would be right back with water. Never came back during the entire meal. My boyfriend did not receive the salad or pita that was supposed to come with his meal so he just had two sticks of meat with fries. Our meals were actually very good, but he would have liked the salad that came with his meal.
After we were done eating we sat there a minute and still our server had not come back out since dropping our entrees. I went to the counter and she was standing there with the other server and asked how everything was. I said that my boyfriend had not received half of the items his meal came with and we were never checked on or given water refills. No apology. She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. She took $5 off the bill for it but still no apology about poor service or that we never received what we ordered. And there was still one person in the restaurant!

I went here on 1/13/11 with my aunt and uncle who were visiting from Colorado. I didn't want to go boulder scrambling so we picked this trail to do as the other trails I've been on are covered in ice and snow and aren't much of a trail.

This is definitely a beginner's trail but I wouldn't say it's good for kids. The spring is nice and cold, I just wouldn't try drinking any of the water unless I boiled it first. There is a little dam there, that whoever owned that portion of the land in 1968 built, so the water pools up before going down into a small fall and creek.

Loud J-pop music in the background and movies playing on the big screens? Interesting touch. I thought it was a smart move to add the subtitles for those that wanted to watch the movie playing on the big screen. Always something to look at in there whether it's the anime posters on the wall or the maids, I give the owners props for coming up with the unique experience. 

Boyfriend and I ordered from our waiter who seemed nice enough. I ordered the Teri Chicken because I was a little nervous in trying the ramen because of all the talk going around on how bland and terrible it was. Maybe next time. My boyfriend ordered Tom Yum ramen. 

Food came out at an understandable time. Not crazy busy, but not dead either. The Tom Yum was awfully bland; noodles were overcooked; and tasted watered down. (yes we leeched off of each other's meals to taste) The portions were good. As he calls it, it was ""edible"".

My Teri chicken came with two rolls of crabmeat sushi. Unexpected, considering it came with a light salad, rice, and chicken. Normally when I eat sushi, I would like to eat at an actual sushi restaurant. It was a nice surprise and surprisingly good, fresh. 

Although the presentation was lovely and neatly arranged, the dish's salad was raw with hardly any of the vinaigrette. When I did get what was little of it mixed with a bit of salad, it was delicious. I just felt it was raw veggies tacked on there with the skimpy vinaigrette. Is this what I paid for? The rice tasted a little stale and warm,  and the chicken was unspectacular. It's a usual dish with quality you can find anywhere. It was okay, but I was expecting to be wowed a little bit. 

Our waitress seemed upset and very timid. We would thank her for setting down our food or thank her getting us the napkins they may have forgotten earlier, and she would walk away without one word or even smiling. It felt unwelcoming. It must have been a long day, I guess. I liked our waiter much more because he was polite. Both seemed inexperienced though. Not a huge deal, but nobody really checked on us unless we waved them down. 

We are not picky eaters (far from it!), but when we go out to eat, I expect it to be better quality food than what I make at home. Food was decent enough to eat, but not enough to recommend. It was an okay experience. However, the service and quality of the food really detracted from it. It is going to take more than gimmicks and adorable dress-ups for us to come back though. I want to be convinced into coming back or to feel that it was so great the first time that I'd want to come back again. I would give it another chance maybe on a different night.

There is no other place in Toronto that does these as well as Tora (even my mom, but don't tell her please!)

For a few generations, decades before the concept of AYCE, when there were almost no Japanese restaurants or grocery stores in Toronto, where sushi grade fish was non-existent, these were the only kinds of sushi Japanese Canadian families made at home.  It is Japanese Canadian comfort food.

Tora Sushi is not a place for AYCE fans, this is not even a place for those who want different kinds of sushi.  Its very basic here, but very authentic -
 anyone who has had proper sushi, knows the difference between plain rice, and authentic vinegar sushi rice, and Tora does it right.

Some reviewers have wondered why they don't have more sushi available, and why they often won't make it ""on demand"", and that is because they get enough business from the Japanese community, ordering platters or just going in for whatever they have available.

I do agree that the bang to buck ratio especially for all you can eat sushi is incredible here. Shawn isnt kidding at all when he mentions the fish to rice ratio, they don't crop the slice to the rice, instead they leave a giant slice that's long enough to wrap around the rice which is quite a noticeable change as compared to other spots. 

Another thing that impressed me what the Goyemon-like policy on no limitations to how many desserts you can get.

The plum ice cream was by far some of the best ice cream I've had in a sushi joint.

So why a missing star? Well of the things we ordered were sauce heavy, they really sauced up some of the dishes. A few of the appetizers lacked an explanation on the menu but instead said something long the lines of 'hey you! order me i am friggin amazing!' and when it comes it's nothing more than krab (that fake crab that's made from fish paste) in a deep fried shell drizzled with sauce. Not to say it wasnt good, well to me it wasnt that's just due to my hatred of krab with a K, but had i known i would have not ordered it and went for more nigiri. 

definitely on my radar now as an all you can eat sushi joint that has great value for what you get but i'll be steering clear of the sauced items.

They are also always celebrating some kind of anniversary and I swear it is not in any particular order (one year it is their 52nd anniversary and then it's the 49th anniversary the year after).

I usually go for their burger or their burger and quarter rotisserie chicken combo called ""la compagnie"". Each comes with their signature curly shoestring ""Suzy Q"" fries which are cut fresh in store and are always delicious.

The burgers are adequately sized and always juicy and delicious and their rotisserie chicken matches that of Swiss Chalet.

Carpaccio was not a huge portion but the quality and flavour was excellent.  The baked cod with fennel and tomatoes was out of this world and the cooking en papillote caused the fennel flavour to infuse the fish.
Side orders of mushrooms, green beans and potatoes were all winners as was my partner's ribs cooked in wine.  Great bread and good desserts.

The old bank location would be cute but the ""under construction"" decor just doesn't make it.  We sat in the side room which includes a faux balcony with  naked mannequins and a toilet - items that seemed a bit weird for a restaurant.   Additionally, my fish was served in the paper it was baked in leaving me to unceremoniously tear it and dump it on my plate - it should have been removed by the server.

I have had many servers here and everyone is incredibly nice and amazing service with quick refills. Went in today and our server was Eduardo and he was great! 

The Margaritas are great. Strawberry margarita is my favorite. Good size and strong! 

My husband an I come here all the time! We are those people that don't even open the menu because we know exactly what we want. For an appetizer we get the grilled zucchini which is super good and refreshing. For the entree we split a half pound of Cadillac Fajitas which is perfect for the two of us. The steak is juicy, tender, and flavorful. They make the tortillas homemade to order and they are to die for!!! The sizzling apple pie is delicious if you have a sweet tooth. 

A few tips/tricks:
- can order steak medium rare since it cooks more on skillet
- ask for both pepper and onions extra caramelized
- can replace an item on boat with guacamole for no extra charge
- we get no cabbage on boat since it's no use to us. We want more of the goods! Haha you can replace it with shredded lettuce though if you like that.

I ordered both the Francesco (mushroom, mozz, olives, sausage, artichokes, roasted red) and Pepe (calabrese pepper, pepperoni, onion, olives).

I'd probably give both a go again some time to check. Co-workers voiced that they liked North Of Brooklyn better (we also had NoBo's Margh and Puttanesca the same day).

But *I* clearly liked Enzo enough to return.

So, I had the Enza (buffalo mozz, fresh basil) today for lunch and really liked this one. The basil was nice and aromatic, the buffalo mozz was fresh and faintly buttery. Photo: https://twitter.com/foodpr0n/status/328945872253640704/photo/1

The crust: I like. On the thick side of thin and with good chew (more chewy than I think many people may like). The bake is just-toasty, and no significant charred bits. Gives it a nice (and even), crispy, outer shell. Taste of the dough is faintly sweet.

Overall, I like it. I feel the ingredients are good, the dough is tasty, and the cost is moderate (well, on the upper edges of that). Wasn't revelatory as that first bite of Libretto pizza years ago, but it's a good pie. Worth a try if you're in the area.",2013-04-29 19:10:13

It was a touch less spicy than Rama, which could be better or worse depending on who you are. It seems like other reviewers have reported slightly more mild flavors too, so there may be something to that. They also served far less rice than Rama. While they will bring you more rice... Rama will bring you a large bowl and repeatedly ask if you want more. Total rice in the original bowl was about 1 cup. Which maybe I don't know how to properly eat thai, but that is far enough for a whole meal of curry.

I also got the crab puffs, which were freaking awesome.

I went with a vegetarian and they felt that their options were limited. If you are a vegetarian and don't want tofu (like my company) then you can ask for more vegetables in place of the tofu if you want.

Voted best lunch by Creative Loafing, Savor has established themselves as both a reputable lunch and dinner spot nestled right outside the hustle bustle of uptown. Be prepared to wait a few minutes if you are arriving right in the heat of lunchtime.

Savor has their own (very tiny) parking lot that is a pain to get in and out of, yet still better than the uptown parking situation. I usually take my chances and park on the road just outside and have yet to have any issues.

The ambience is low-key and casual with funky and eclectic décor. The wait staff have never impressed, nor disappointed me though I do think they could benefit from a few more staff members.

Because of its convenience and accessibility to uptown, Savor draws an upscale clientele--expect to be accompanied by men and women clad in business suits during lunch.  

I have sampled nearly every item on the lunch menu and am most impressed by the Seared & crack peppered Salmon BLT on focaccia; Mojo marinated chicken breast Sandwich; Adam Bomb Burger and the Grilled Meatloaf. Each sandwich comes with a side--I usually order the casserole of the day and am always pleased.

The dinner is where is gets interesting. Expect to find Pad Thai on the same menu as shrimp & grits and meatloaf as well as many duplicates to the lunch menu, though bigger portions.

Out of all of these I feel especially compelled to talk about the Adam Bomb Burger. 100% grass-fed free-range beef Cajun rubbed and topped with grilled tomatoes, pepper jack cheese and smeared with a roasted red pepper and caramelized onion aioli. I am on a life-long quest to find the world's best cheeseburger (I hear it's somewhere in Paris) and this one just may be the best in Charlotte. Order it. Please.

On the flip side, the shrimp and grits fell flat. It was rather bland with the Andouille sausage gravy commanding the flavor of the entire dish. I typically like to see peppers, pancetta, tasso ham or other ingredients to diversify the flavor but, unfortunately, it was just the same bite over and over.

Though I would recommend lunch over dinner you cannot go wrong at Savor. This is a place that offers many standout dishes, at extremely reasonable prices--expect to leave already planning your next visit, unless you order the shrimp & grits.",2014-02-11 21:44:12

We had originally tried to do this hike a few weeks earlier with my 5 yo nephew, and I'm so glad that we ended up on a different trail that day. Came back out to try and get it right. 

We took a short detour to check out the old abandoned magnesium mine slightly off the path. The trail does get a little bit ""crumbly"" in spots. Very important to make sure you are watching closely. One false step and you may do a little tumbling. There was 5 of us, all mostly moderate hikers so luckily we didn't have any trouble. My friends did scare the crap out of me when I was in the abandoned mine.. but that is beside the point. 

My BF actually showed us up, by hiking all the way up to the bell arch... the rest of us were happy just to get to the overlook and have some lunch. 

I would highly recommend sunscreen and/or a hat. My friend was sunburned and I had massive sun headache no matter how much water I drank. I was doing some complaining going uphill... but my butt will thank me later (was sore for a few days) This one definitely gives you a great workout and the views are pretty awesome. I had left my gloves at home, and definitely would have rather had them on. 

At first I couldn't figure out why the hike was called Liberty Bell... until we got just past the arch and you can totally see the bell, complete with a rock or etc to be the clapper.  It's really pretty cool and I can't even tell you how amazing the Colorado River looks. Once you get to the overlook, I highly recommend taking the extra hike up an over the  to the right.

I was looking for a lab coat and I never thought I would have so many choices. They had lab coats of varying lengths, some with extra pockets, and even some designed to look more like an everyday outerwear coat. I ended up with the Grey's Anatomy brand because it was cut nicely and wasn't big and boxy. To top it off, they have a 10% student discount. As a broke grad student, I can appreciate that.

This store is well-stocked for anything you could possibly need related to the medical industry. They have scrubs of all brands and sizes, medical equipment (stethoscopes, scissors, hemostats, lanyards, etc), and shoes aimed at people who are on their feet all day.

It seemed like their prices were a little more expensive than other scrub retailers, but I think that's because they are a family owned business. But Scrubtastic makes up for it in service. Each time I've stopped in, I've experienced great customer service. Everyone is so helpful and knowledgeable about their items.

Quick tip: they have awesome sales. Last time I was there, they had several racks where you could get various scrub tops/bottoms for as little as $5. Sizes and styles are limited though.",2011-01-25 07:20:08

AZ Margarita- a short glass filled with lots of ice for $9  and not particularly tasty 

 guacamole - eh, I can make tastier guac at home. Nearly $8 for a small dish

Ahi Tuna Agua Chile- $12 enough to share for two as a light appetizer. I was excited for this one... but was completely disappointed after the first taste. I had to ask for a side of limes an doused it with salt to try and give it some flavor, but it remained insipid. We didn't even finish the dish because it was not worth eating. 

The Carne Asada Burrito-  UHHHG. My plate came to the table and I could smell the distinct scent of that plasticy processed store bought tortilla. From the get-go the store bought tortilla smell was going to start this burrito at mediocre level, but then the taste ...:(
It tasted like a chili-cheese hot dog. $9 and I didn't finish this dish either.

At Ehwa, they can flavour it with fruit, which we chose peach, and it was amazing!

The food is pretty standard, nothing extraordinary, but once you've had a few drinks, the Korean bar food (e.g. spicy fried chicken, rice cake, egg drop soup) definitely hits the spot.  

They also have a decent sized patio, probably fits about 30-40 people...great for the summer. 

The only thing I have to warn you is that the service is pretty patchy. It's not that they are rude, but that they are severely understaffed.

The chips were probably the best part--but I can't say the red ketchup sauce is great.  We asked for a chunky salsa that was decent and ended up mixing that with the thick red ketchup sauce they give you.  I ordered a burrito with green sauce with a side of beans and rice.

The sad thing is, like most everyone else out there, the initial disrespect often leads to my 86-ing the business from my credit-card statements permanently. I was very excited about this Best Buy opening, as it was literally just two blocks away from my old pad. What made things even better was that they opened right around the time of HALO 3's release. Regardless of how much of an overhyped mass of whale feces that game is to me now, close to a year ago I was actually considering lining up for it at this Best Buy, since it was so close to the house and all. I get off work, recon the place for the first time. There's stacks and stacks of both the ""Limited Edition"" and regular copies, and an impressive array of LCD and plasma TVs to your right as you enter. The store was very clean and neat (of course, it's Grand Opening, right?) and manned by a veritable army of blue-shirted kaffeinated kidz with bright smiles and oily faces. Much like myself when I was that age. I get my gear, pick up some more stuff, find other things, go back to get a cart, call and check the limit on my CC....

Once I hit the counter, the cashier chic is reading a magazine. I'm the only one there, I have a cart with a minifridge, Limited Edition halo-halo, several software bundles, a USB sound interface, 2 500GB Western Digital HDs, Todd Mcfarlane toyz, and other similar ""you-won't-get-vulva-anytime-soon!"" guarantees.

She stares at me blankly and asks ""Is that it? Did you find everything OK?""

Now I know that's the stock line, but damn. I'm the only one in front of you, it's your Opening Day, I got a car payment's worth of shit in this cart, and you won't even move your stupid magazine over to let me put it on the counter?

She gives me that ""whatever"" look and takes forever getting the ticking spider off my drives. And when I ask why they do that AND have the cavity search at the door too, a la Fry's, she says, very matter-of-factly: ""It's to make sure if you try to run off with anything, security will come after you and take you out.""

I'm not anywhere close to Quentin ""Rampage"" Jackson, or even Michael ""Action"" Jackson. But I was seething, and I wanted to ""pretend swipe"" and calmly walk out the door and see if these fuckers had the sack to take me out, like she said.

I don't even play that damn game any more. Nor have I been back to the store since. Fire your H.R. department, Best Buy. That kind of appalling hiring reeks of  ""So lyke, I knew someone who knew someone.....""

Stuff like that does little to restore my faith in humanity.

Although the restaurant is located in a plaza there is plenty of ambience!  Dim lighting, hushed conversations, candlelight and beautiful place settings pleasantly surprised me when we arrived.  

I know other reviewers described the service as ""slow"" however I found our server to be thoughtful.  She waited at the table until our conversations had stopped so she wouldn't interrupt us.  She was at hand when we needed something but was not like a vulture.  The low lighting added to the romantic mood and the measured service set the tone for a two-hour meal enjoyed by friends.

The parmesan crusted diver scallops that we had as an appetizer were fresh with a crisp carmelized outside and plump sweet flesh.  The bread was hot, delicious and plentiful.  We ordered an Amitage red blend wine that was unique to find on a menu AND reasonably priced.  Delicious!

I ordered the seafood linguini with garlic and oil sauce while my husband ordered the lasagna.  I haven't had sauce like this since my friends from Italy owned a little intimate restaurant in Akron - I didn't think I would ever find this type of sauce again!  Everything tasted homemade and our entire party loved their meals.

I discovered this restaurant through Meetup.

Drink(s): Caipirinha and a shot of the red Sangria to taste
Appetizer: Soup of the Day = Caldo Verde
Entree: Paella - Portugese Style
Dessert: Algarve Mascarpone Roll

The cocktail was so refreshing with the perfect amount of sweet adding tiny bits of lime and lemon in finely blended ice.  As I had to drive home immediately afterwards, I was offered a shot of Lubey's homemade Sangria which is now on my to-drink list when I return for their nightly dancing classes.

The soup of the day was a very tasty kale soup perfected with so much flavor.  If you don't order anything else, you must try this soup. Yum!

Paella is mostly a seafood dish atop saffron rice.  You'll get shrimp, calamari, mussels, chorizo sausage,and chicken flavored to perfection slow cooked with green bell peppers, onions, peas, and tomatoes.

The Mascarpone Roll was a perfect ending - a fluffy ball of vanilla ice cream atop ""three turning fan blades"" of mascarpone and dotted with fresh blueberries and blueberry sauce.

Girlfriend ordered the mac and cheese with bangers, I ordered the fish and chips, as the menu seemed sparse. After ordering, I go outside to do outside things, and sitting on one of the patio tables was a list of ""today's specials"" which probably would have been nice to see. Not that I could really see the menu inside. The lighting is very low, and there is a weird font, and the descriptions are in a shade that blends perfectly in with that lighting. Had I seen the specials menu, I would have gone with the tenderloin. While I was outside, Clifford hobbled past. He asked how I was doing, but didn't ask for money, which was weird. He still seemed angry, but he's just got that disposition I think . When asking people for money, you probably want to be a little bit more friendly, and not come off as a very angry person. 
Go inside and the food comes out. The fish and chips is served with waffle fries. I find this very odd. They were ok, I guess. But I've never had waffle fries with fish and chips. It's supposed to be fries, like... fries fries, not waffle fries. One doesn't drench waffle fries in malt vinegar. It just didn't seem right. The mac and cheese, ordered with bangers, was an accident, she meant rashers, she wanted bacon, not sausage. That's her fault though. I tried some of the bangers, and it seemed way overpowering of ... was that ... rosemary? Well, that was a learning experience for her, rashers, not bangers.

The location is spotless, the toppings fresh and the staff friendly. You can sample any flavor and the staff there will assist you with the samples.   

On my last visit as I was getting ready to decide on my flavors, when these 3 young girls come in (the oldest around 12 and the youngest about 4) sans parental supervision, forcing their way infront of patrons, each shouting for different samples.  No manners, no please or thank you.  The man working the floor was more patient than I would have been in his position.  

Sneeking past these little girls I reach in for some Vanilla and a twist of mango and tart (I love tart!).  Working my way through the toppings I was surprised.  These are not the frozen saucy hyper red strawberries and sugary sweet blueberries....these were fresh real fruit.   Of course I had to add a little Mochi,  a piece of baklavah, 5 cheese cake bits (yes I counted them) and a drizzle of butterscotch over the vanilla.  They have several topping choices it is easy to go overboard since they give you such a big cup.  

I would have liked to try some of the winter seasonal flavors they still had up like gingerbread and oatmeal cookie....but ehh maybe those girls did me a favor.",2011-01-25 18:02:32

It was so good that I went back the day after just to get my hands on some cheap udon. I went for lunch, and with half of my meal left, I was already thinking of coming back for dinner. It goes to show you how much I'm obsessed with Cafe Sanuki.

I was definitely a little confused when I first walked in, but there was a staff member who came up to us and explained how the ordering works. You order your base udon (hot, cold, with broth, without broth, carbonara, etc) and wait for them to make your udon bowl. Once you get it, you move on to the tempura area where there's 8-10 different types of tempura (shrimp, pumpkin, chicken, fish cakes, etc). Each tempura is a different price which is demarcated above the respective tempura. Grab your tempura, onigiri, etc and make your way to the register. 

I got the kamatama (udon, egg yolk, and the broth/sauce?) with scallions, ginger, shrimp tempura (2), and tempura fish cake. The udon was chewy and well cooked, and the yolk was a bright orange/yellow with a ton of flavor. The eggs really made the dish rich and added that extra dimension of flavor that made it stand out.

My favorite thing was the tempura. The batter is lightly salted, so you can actually taste the tempura. Some other places don't have a great batter so you end up with a flavorless crunch. Cafe Sanuki definitely did a great job with the tempura. It's crunchy, flavorful, and fresh!

With our Yelp check in, we got a free drink which is refillable. I got the peach tea and added some syrup sweetener from the drink area. It was pretty standard until I tried the lemonade. I'm a big fan of sweet lemonade that isn't overly sour/tart and Cafe Sanuki delivered. It's sweet but you can still taste the lemon behind all that sweetness.

Overall, it's a great udon joint that I really enjoy. It's slowly becoming my favorite udon place in Vegas. If you haven't already or are thinking of trying it out, don't hesitate and go check it out for yourself. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink!",2017-12-09 21:09:07

I decided to try this place based on location, atmosphere, food and reviews about the service from the Yelpers.  It did not disappoint. 

When you enter the restaurant, you come into the ""wine shop"" where you first select your wine/beer of choice.  From the moment we walked in we were helped with wine selection. I heard about the Poison Red Zin and chose it for dinner.  It was very light and satisfying. I also chose a Prosecco and the guys chose the ""Rolls Royce of Beers"" (as the waiter called it) think its spelled ""Chimay"".  

We chose to sit out on the patio but it was covered with the plastic so that was a bummer. We did have a space heater and the waiter was courteous to adjust the heat accordingly.  

They sat us in a corner and my view was of a door and some candles-which was the only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating-because when I called for the reservation I asked for a ""really good table"".  If this is the hostess' definition of a good table...then she needs to be re-trained.   The tables in front of the fireplace would have fit the bill. Inside was really nice too, but it felt more casual outside and less stuffy-so we were fine with that. 

Live music-female singer-wonderful really provided some nice ambiance. She sang Adele, Nora Jones, etc.  So 5-star for the entertainment.

Food was very good, I can't say I was full-since I didn't order side dishes but we ordered mussels and the shrimp with grits (creole) and very tasty.  Keep in mind this is a French restaurant so portions were small and you have to order Al a Carte for veggies/ mashed potatoes, etc. 

I ordered the duck-very good, my husband had the shrimp which he said was fabulous, the trout was also served as well as the lobster ravioli-everyone raved about their dishes.  They also bring out a little bread and butter basket and the baguettes were marvelous. You need to order side dishes to feel satisfied.

I think what impressed all of us the most was the service!  That is definitely a five star rating!!!  Waiters were friendly, accommodating, gracious, polite, professional, I could go on and on. We were pretty loud-laughing the whole night and we felt like we had the whole restaurant to ourselves-it was a fabulous fun night.  

We had reservations at 5:45 and stayed until 10 pm so you never felt rushed to leave.

This place was pricey and the portions are just too small to justify the price. Maybe I'll try lunch next time.",2012-01-29 18:04:17

I received the Beats by Dr. Dre Pill for Christmas from my Uncle. For those of you who don't know what this it, it's basically a blue tooth speaker system. It was working great for about two weeks, but then it stopped connecting to my phone, or anything else I tried to pair it with. So I did my homework, researched online what the issue could be and I found that it's a bug in the system. If you send it back to Beats, then it takes 4 weeks for them to fix it and return. BUT Beats knows of the issue, and the new models that came out at the end of Dec. had been fixed. 

So I went to Best Buy to EXCHANGE my Beats Pill. Let me say that again, I did not want cash, or store credit. I simply wanted to exchange my malfunctioning speakers for ones that worked. It had NO physical damage, or water, NOTHING. It was in perfect condition. So I tried to return it and the employees were SO RUDE. They took it back to the ""Geek Squad"" to see if they could fix it, but all they did was confirm that the Bluetooth wasn't working. Ok, so Bluetooth speakers can't connect by Bluetooth. Awesome. BUT they refused to do anything. Although it was a gift, and I was simply requesting a replacement, they said I had to have a receipt. I'm not sure what they didn't understand by the word GIFT, but apparently the geeks there don't understand simple English. I can see if I wanted cash for this, but I just wanted to exchange it. 

I asked to speak to a manger, and a supervisor came out names Chris. He was seriously the rudest person I have ever spoken to. Not only was he not sympathetic, he was down right rude and said he wouldn't do anything about my issue. He confirmed that it was a bug in the system, and that they do in fact sell the malfunctioning Beats Pill in their store, but he still wouldn't do anything about it. Honestly, it's not like Best Buy is going to take a hit for this. They are going to send it back to Beats. So why on earth would they treat their customers with such little disregard? Because they were never taught customer service, that's why. 

Not only I will NEVER buy anything from Best Buy again, I will make it a point to make sure no one I know goes here either. Apple, Target, Fry's, or ANY OTHER electronics store will get my business. Not only does Best Buy apparently NOT stand behind their product, but they are knowingly selling malfunctioning electronics and don't care. There are SO many places to buy electronics these days, and the fact that Best Buy apparently doesn't care enough to take care of their customers is beyond me. Bad business ethics, and practices DON'T KEEP CUSTOMERS.",2013-02-04 19:25:54

Less bread more chicken please.

Less ice-tea more chicken please.

Look I get that people rave about Raising Cane's, but to be perfectly honest I only believe it to be an okay establishment. It does have its place in many people's chicken strip loving hearts, but my experiences here have been lackluster.

The last time I went I got the 3-strip combo, which comes with 3 chicken strips, french fries, and of course, their tasty bread. I got a Dr. Pepper, because I don't like their sweet iced tea (ohmahgawd! I know.) It's too sweet. It's nothing like my Mother's Texas Tea, and well, she makes it better so she wins, the end.

As for the combo meal, I felt like I had more carbs than anything else. Were the fries good? Ya. Was the bread good? Ya. Were the chicken strips good? Ya. But I felt like I should have had more chicken strips than anything else, and my chicken strips were very much on the small side. If you're going to base your establishment on chicken strips, shouldn't those suckers be BIG, juicy, and plentiful?! 

I also made the mistake of taking an order to go. Don't do it. The take-away box makes everything soggy, especially the fries and bread. Best to just eat there, unless you live less than 5 minutes away.",2012-02-18 17:20:24

Prices are on the higher end but most things come with a soup which was quite decent. As for the main dishes, nothing to write home about. 

Fried Instant Noodle with Pork Chop ($8.99) was very meh. Wasn't as tasty as I had hoped and left more to be desired. I've done better with instant noodles. 

Baked Rice, Double Cheese with Pork Chop ($9.99) looked delicious but I was not a big fan of the nacho cheese. Would much rather have more mozzarella or parmesan. The pork chop and cream sauce was pretty good. I still stand by Keung's baked rice though.

It took a while but eventually got the owners attention.  She apologized, took the kettle and came back.  This time it was sorta hot.  Later on, when I asked for a refill of the kettle ... the water was cold again.  Didn't bother bringing it up again.

Front of the house needs a lot of work.  In my hour or so there, 4 different tables walked out.  Tired or waiting to be recognized.  Tired of waiting to order.  I should have followed them out.

Although tempted to leave as well, I waited patiently and was finally able to order.

Anyhow, an order of tonkatsu comes with a savoury potato soup, pickles and kimchi on the side, along with a variety of salads and (cold) steamed rice. Korean-style tonkatsu was lean and very crispy, while the Japanese-style was juicier inside and still crispy on the outside, and it was paired with a tangier and thicker sauce. I felt the tonkatsu barely made it above being ordinary, and it was the overall experience with the soup and side dishes that convinced me that I got my money's worth.
A lot of thought was put into the dish, however the lateness and the mixed quality of food made me think twice about giving it a four-star rating. However I would not mind coming back to try their other dishes.",2016-03-01 18:28:33

The front desk girl who checked her in, was friendly and got her in right away! It was pretty busy, but they were getting people in and out! 

My sister loves her cut! :) thanks!",2016-08-10 15:34:45

Though, I did give this restaurant another shot with their rice dishes. Ordered the rice with pork chops, steamed egg, shredded pig skin ($6.50). It came loaded with the shredded pig skin, a bite size steamed (burnt) egg, and a small piece of pork chop. And it was loaded with so much rice. 

Never coming back from such an underwhelming experience.",2011-09-04 03:57:23
