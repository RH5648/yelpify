8u04dWyZM8XZzQulA5gv1Q,zsna_iioQVRKVNn3NLUjMA,hgCpzHx5IGvLRzMdFGWl6w,3,0,0,0,"I came here for lunch today because I had some business to attend to and this was the closest eatery around that I thought would be quick in and out.  Also I love a hot bowl of noodles in the winter.  

The seating was really squishy but as expected during the lunch hour.  With a quick look around I can tell that this place is frequented by students from the nearby Seneca campus.  I guess if I was a student there, I would come here too.  It's cheap and the portions of noodles they give you is generous.  I ordered a large bowl of house special pho, but next time IF I ever go back, I will order the small.  There was plenty in the large.  Actually let me clarify, there was plenty of noodles.  The amount of meats was fine and the beef tendon was really soft which was really good. 

Now I can't really comment on the cleanliness of the place.  I don't usually venture into the back and to the washrooms in these joints.  I rather hold it in and use the washroom when I get back to the office.  However from reading the other reviews for this place, it seems like it's subpar when it comes to hygiene.  Good thing I didn't have to go today.  

So in conclusion, my bowl of pho was okay.  However had I seen the inside of the kitchen like the other people that reviewed here, I may have ran out if I saw what they saw.",2014-01-09 22:10:51

You can style and profile all that you want, but I want to eat some delicious food when I go to a restaurant. I do like the Goth girls, but then.....I always find stupidity amusing.
 
* Flavorless whitefish tacos. There are literally dozens of Hispanic restaurants, featuring superior fish tacos, in and around CLT. 

* Weird Cold Corn Salsa with Stale ""Cardboard"" Blue Corn Tortillas. Creative? Yes. Tasty? Mmmm, No. Give me chunky, freshly made at one's tableside, pico de gallo guacamole any day of the week and twice on Sunday. (Served with hot tortilla chips, which doesn't happen here!)

* Difficult parking. YMCA parking lot, and we're walking there.
 
* Expensive. There's no reason for fish tacos to cost this much, and to be so effing mediocre. If the fish were freshly caught that morning off the coast of Charleston, or served somewhere along the PCH, yeah, maybe I could see their prices as realistic. Here, you're just paying for the cool factor of dining in NODA, and screw that.

** Their location nets one star, and they usually have competent waitstaff, which procures the second star.

We came around 6pm on a Saturday and it was packed. I'm taking 20 tables and 2 servers. The Mesa arts center is across street and so this place fills up with show goers. If you just want dinner be sure to come at 7 after the audience has left- way more pleasant.",2015-04-19 03:13:45

We stopped in last night to find they had added additional yogurt machines, so there were 8 or 9 flavors available at once. I filled up my cup and added tons of Oreo crumbs, nuts, sprinkles, and chocolate syrup. Me and my husband's total came to under $9. The same stuff at Cold Stone would have been like $15 at least, considering each topping is an additional charge!

My only small gripe is that the toppings station is always kind of messy, because they are so close together there are often crumbs of other toppings mixed into the wrong bins, and all the toppings are not labeled. They should especially be labeling the products with nuts in them. They also had a can of whipped cream just sitting on the counter, which should be sitting in ice or otherwise chilled, so I just didn't use any of that.

But all in all, the price is right and this place is great.",2011-02-21 23:34:20
Y9zoUSA7MoWsSv9-xgKGrQ,PfpRvMAESbC2bC8FUIMdNg,l6TEtn0bxJlXXVnKhwyeAw,4,0,0,0,This place had the best lobster rolls that I've found in Vegas. The rolls are tiny compared to what you would get in New England but easily accessible. I've tried both the food truck and the location in the Smith's near Rhodes ranch. Definitely better bang for your buck at the restaurant location vs the food truck. The food truck costs more and doesnt give you free tots with your orders. I ordered the lobster grilled cheese and the Connecticut at the Smith's location and both came with tots and was cheaper than the food truck where I ordered the Connecticut and it only came with the roll. All the items at both locations were tasty that I ordered. Will be coming back for my lobster roll cravings.,2018-08-26 18:00:11

It's good, but the cheese curds are like pieces of rubber. I expected the cheese curds to be melty and soft....But then again, I had poutine at a poutine-specialty place in Montreal, and their curds were also like that....I hear that good cheese curds are actually supposed to taste like that. 
The location isn't great, nowhere to sit to eat, and the only place to pout your box of poutine down is the inward-facing ledge by the window, which faces a metal dumpster bin. Why...Why...why is there a dumpster bin in plain view of where I must put down my food. Even if you do takeout, it's not like there's a park or anything nearby to sit down and eat your food. Neighbourhood is pretty ghetto-y as well. 
Poutine wasn't bad, but it was mostly bad location and the dumpster bin that turned me off. I would go to another location if I was really craving poutine, because of the non-food factors that I've mentioned.",2013-07-23 00:00:53

Got a caprese salad to start, the balsamic dressing was really good and the cheese, tomatoes and arugula felt fresh. Then got the Commendatore pasta ($19), it came with spiral pasta ( I do wish they tell you want type of pasta on the menu) It was delicious a mix of ground sausage with lots of pistachios in a cream sauce, it wasn't overly salty and just really hit the spot. The portion was large. You can also ask for a bunch of hot sauces and chili flakes which made it even better.

Would definitely come back to try their other pastas and I really want to try their pizza!

Mediocre food at it's best.... we spent 8 years living in Japan, while the servers and chef definitely appear to be Japanese we felt the food was lacking.   We asked how the curry plate compared to coco ichibanya and she told us it was much better at Yagyu, after the Mr ordered it and pretty well knows it's strait up S&B outta the box he was content with the meal but knows it could have been better.  I had the tonkatsu plate and the sauce was the same that you can buy at any Asian market, the cutlets from both of our meals was way thicker than we are accustomed to but were good.  The 'dressing' on the cabbage salad was SPOT on and really made me smile.  We will be back to try the yakiniku here as the reviews on it are good.

1MoKQ3GPL0fRMGx9mbsvQA,exrhmN7te3DWgay2m6fZBw,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,1,1,1,0,"I hate to give this place one star because the food is great.

 I've been here three times but the reason I'm giving one star is because one, you feel so rushed. Every time I've eaten here 5 different servers come up and ask if you're ready to move on to your next meat or if you're ready for the check. Dude, we still have half of the grill full of meat and we're still eating it, not yet. Might just be overstaffed and servers need to find something to do. Second reason, the first time I came here I ordered the Large beef combo that feeds 3-4 people, I believe it's like 94.99 or something around that price range. Anyways, I ordered it with my friends and the meat we got was great but the portions didn't seem like very much. We were ordering soju and drinking so we weren't paying too close attention but for the second meat (angus short ribs or something) that came out we only got 6 pieces. For the large combo? 6 pieces? I didn't think too much of it because it was my first time and wasn't sure how much meat we were supposed to get. Paid and left satisfied. 
I came here a second time and again ordered a large beef combo again with my family but this time when we got the second type of meat they gave us double than the first time I came here! Got around 10 pieces. 
That means I paid for the large beef combo ($95-$97) the first time and they ripped us off and only gave us the small sized portions ($55)! 
I was really bummed out when I realized it eating here the second.The second time the server was like, ""you got the large combo right?"" When giving us the meat. Meaning not all of them know for sure what kind of combo you have so someone could make an honest mistake and not give enough meat / give too much. 
Wanted to post this review to make sure people pay attention to the amount of meat they're getting if / when they're getting a combo. 
I feel like if you order a combo they should have some type of colored tag on your table or something so the servers and everyone else that works there knows what type of combo you're getting (large or small). Otherwise you might get ripped off.",2017-01-30 00:04:46

I told the hostess that this was our first time and she seated us at the table in front of the area where they make the noodles.  It was neat to watch these guys ply their craft. 

I will agree with some other reviewers that I was expecting there to be more noodle options on the menu since they kind of advertise themselves as having noodles, but after getting past that we dove into the menu to see what we could find.  

We started with the onion pancake with sliced beef.  This was amazing.  The dough was flaky, the beef was juicy and tender and the vegetables rolled inside created the perfect combination of taste and texture.  Our second starter was the pork and veggie wontons.  These were tasty and I liked the spicy sauce but I'm not a huge fan of pork wontons so these were the least memorable part of the experience.  

For main dishes, my wife got the ""dry"" hot spicy wonton noodles and I got the ""Only Sunday Limited"" option of shrimp and loofah soup dumplings.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  I got mine because it was on the menu only once a week and I'm glad I did.  Having never had anything like this before, I ordered blindly but figured if they reserve it for only one day a week, it must be special.  And it was.  The loofah soup went perfect with the shrimp and doughy dumpling.  And with a little bit of freshly sliced ginger, these were absolutely delicious.

It's a woman owned bar (kinda actually rare), and is a cozy bar that is unpretentious. $8 cocktail drinks are not bad pricing either. The beer selection is small, but great with 12 drafts and some bottles, mostly craft beers. 

I got the Blind Willow based on it having sage infused rye. It was pretty good, maybe slightly a bit too sweet but the flavors were generally nice. I had a bit of a headache so I didn't continue on with trying more of the menu as planned. I am a fan that they do infuse many of their base spirits for their cocktails, bringing something different to the table. 

The bar is the place to be since you order up to bartenders. If you're at a seat, you gotta get up and grab your drink at the bar, don't expect a server to be working the room. The bartenders were pretty good about paying attention and didn't have to wait there standing for very long. 

I like the vibe in here, the chairs and the artsy light projectors on the wall. It was a bit loud as it rolled on, but not so that it was extreme that I was gonna get annoyed. 

I get turned around a bit in downtown, and I was thinking this was closer to Fremont Street, but it is not. It's by the Arts district and you can easily hop from here, Bar + Bistro and The Artifice with Lady Silvia not too far either if you want to make a night of it.

The Lady and I went around 7:45ish and parking was a little tight, but we were able to find a spot in the side lot at the very back. We walked in from the door that's on the street...which is apparently not the front door. Weird. Would like to have seen signage for that. We walked down the hallway to the big expanse that is the main room. It's a gorgeous, open space with plenty of greenery hanging from the rafters, and a wrapping outdoor patio that's pretty incredible as well.

We found the hostess (again, at the complete opposite side of the building than we walked in from) and she told us it was going to be about a 30-45 minute wait. Woah. So we found 2 seats at the bar by the ""coffee cage"". It definitely did take some time for somebody to notice us, and there were no drink menus to be found (we had to ask for them twice during the duration of our stay) which was a bit of a frustration, but it didn't bring me down too much. We both ordered beers (Pro Tip: Order by #, it'll make the waiters lives a lot easier!), and then we went on to food. Everything came out fast, which was a giant plus! We got:

Grouper Ceviche: Light, citrisy, a bit spicy, and a great texture. I missed the aromatics, but enjoyed the radish. Might've been nice for a bit more crunch in there, but very good nonetheless.
Charred Shishito Peppers: One of my favorite snacks. There's no way you can mess these up. Killed em in a matter of minutes.
Potato Croquettes: Excellent! Dense, moist, flavorful, and fried. Perfect combo. Loved the tomato and gruyere was a *perfect* cheese choice!
Charcuterie Plate: Big hits and a few qualms. 1) There was only 1 cheese on the board. Granted, one was peppered and one wasn't, but it wasn't very balanced. 2) Meats were cut at very different sizes. 3) Picked onions were sweet and delicious, whole grain mustard felt like it was kicked up with horseradish or wasabi, but both excellent. 4) I learned that duck pate is not my thing. And that's okay. I think it was done very well, but the taste is a bit more refined from what I was in the mood for. It was also strange that the duck fat was hard and on top. Didn't know if I was supposed to eat that or not...

Prices were totally acceptable for the portions that we got (2 drinks and 4 menu items totaled out to just under $50, and we walked away pleasantly full). 

They need to get their roastery started up, as well as release their own beers, and do more with food fermentation. But, in any case, I'm actually really looking forward to seeing Suffolk Punch flourish. They got a good thing going. If nothing else, their 6:30am open time will be *perfect* for early morning coffee sessions :)",2017-08-02 20:56:10

On top of that, when we were in the middle of our order she had answered the phone....... 

After we received our food, the sauce tasted really oily and not good at all. I had gotten the mild. The chicken was hard and very breaded. The fries were soggy and not good at all.

I got the red curry beef, and red curry is the first dish I try to order at Thai places to test their tastiness. I order it 10 stars, or double Thai hot. Yeah, I'm weird, I know. It was very good, but at $10.95, it looked more like the portion I see for lunch everywhere else.

Boyfriend got the beef chow mein, which was a bigger portion and was pretty good. Nothing to yelp about, but he liked it. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for my liking and a bit mushy. The plate was huge, and so I figured they made up for my dish with my friend's. I didn't need to eat that much, anyway.

Others got the spicy basil, which got mixed reviews, the panang curry and the spicy basil with eggplant. The latter was really good from the bites I took, while I think the panang was good but not over the top. Another got the thai barbecued chicken, which must have been good because it was almost gone at the end of dinner. It's on fire when they bring it out, so that's fun. 

I wanted to rate Swaddee a 3.5, but service was great, so here's a 4. Malee's is still the best on my list, followed by Yupha's and then a tie between Lemongrass and Thai Basil.

Not one to turn down Greek food, I turned in and came into the typical, faux-Greek decor, all that was missing was the obligatory fake grapes hanging from the ceiling.

After reading the extensive menu, which reminded me of something printed by an old mimeograph machine, we sat and waited for our meal, roast lamb and spanikopita.  As we waited we were cared for by the staff who were not overly friendly, but pleasant and polite.  The rolls were hot and crisp and just the way we like them and the homemade salad was fresh and tasty.  

Finally, the wait ended and we got our main course.  It wasn't fancy by any means, it seemed more home style and homemade, which to us was a good thing.  In fact, it seemed like we had been invited into a Greek home, by a Greek family to partake in their home cooked dinner.  It was delicious.  We both had green beans that were wonderful and potatoes that were just like a Greek mamma would make them (though the lemon flavor was a bit too tart for my wife, I really liked the roasted lemon flavor of the potato).  

My wife had the Spanikopita and it was crisp and favorable with just the right mix or spinach and feta  and the filo dough was flakey and lovely.  I had the roast lamb, and it seemed that it had been lovingly cooked all day.  It was moist, tender and oh so very, very good!.

We had coffee and a Greek dessert which I really don't know what it was called, but it was flaked filo, with nuts, honey, custard and whipped cream, mmmmm, just right.  (I will admit, I am kind of a coffee snob, and so the weak diner style Cafe Americana disappointed me a bit).  

There was live music at  8 pm and we enjoyed the band of two for a few songs before we called it a night.

Next time I am hungry for Greek food, I have no questions as to where I will point the car...to the corner of Rainbow & Sahara and Opa Restaurant!  Yum, yum, A+, OPA!",2012-10-21 06:27:28

There was a light sprinkle of it on my clam pie even though it was not mentioned in the menu and it was also on the shrimp pie as well as the olive oil gelato in a candied version.  

The clam pie was a little disappointing - I was hoping for something like the ones I've tasted in NYC.  Clams are such subtle things that more needs to be used and I would not mind paying a few more dollars for that.

Our disappointment was quickly redeemed by the wonderfully refreshing and  balanced flavor of the shrimp pie.  The combination of perfectly cooked crunchy shrimp, basil, chili flakes and lemon zest set off fireworks on every part of my palate.  It's something I would definitely go back for.  

The pizza crust has a great contrast of crunch as well as chewiness which reminds me of the crust at Mozza in LA but it does not have the complexity in flavor of Chris Bianco's.  Bianco's probably uses a starter dough that has developed that amazing flavor due to over a decade of use.  That's tough to beat.

The olive oil gelato has a nice creaminess to it but tasted more like sweet cream base with a hint of lemon than olive oil.  My only problem with it was my expectation to taste olive oil but now that I know it's more about the texture, I think I like it more.",2008-06-17 04:25:40

Where have you been during my time in Charlotte?  Why did I pass by you a number of times in my first three years without ever stopping by to bear witness to your gyros?  How did I live so long without experiencing your delicious, greasy gyros, scrumptious Greek salad, and surprisingly decent french fries?

I suppose part of the thing the issue is that your building, while somewhat eye-catching with the white and blue paint, looks pretty small and is located in a slightly run-down area of town.  However, I love the bright colors and simple decor you have going on inside.  Every time I've been, the staff people working have been friendly and helpful too.

Your gyros are definitely where it's at here.  For less than $10, you offer a tasty and good-sized gyro sandwich, with the most amazing tzatziki my mouth has ever tasted, and a generous portion of seasoned french fries.  I love that for a couple of dollars more you can upgrade to a gyro dinner, which has enough meat for two gyros, plus a Greek side salad and fries.  Your Greek salad has plenty of great things, with lots of feta cheese, Greek peppers, delicious Greek dressing, and Kalamata olives (which are not pitted, but still good).

I am sad I never stopped sooner.  But now that I've found you, I won't ever let you go.  I love your cheap prices, delicious food, and convenient location to my work.

Sincerely,
Ana O.",2013-07-06 21:39:34

I'll try to fit in all I can muster about my favorite China Town area restaurant.

My mom's Thai and a really good home cook. But since we're all grown now, she doesn't make huge family style meals anymore. So. This is my go to Thai restaurant.


It's not fancy, it's not over priced, it's not a new take on Thai. It's pretty much the classics done simply and executed well. Plus the price is definitely right. I'm pretty sure nothing is over $10..I think.. Well..  maybe! If you do seafood it might be.

My favorites are definitely the same as most yelpers:

Noodle house style pot stickers are always a good start.

Noodle house Tom yum soup with choice of noodles which I get the fat noodles- spice a 10.

My favorites include: Roasted duck curry 75% of the time, duck Fried rice(ask for chili in it and it makes it even better), the roasted duck soup with egg noodles, fried chicken over fried rice, BBQ park and Chinese sausage fried rice, lad nah, grilled beef salad with a side of sticky rice, their version of pho lol, Tom kah kai, and pretty much everything on their menu.

It's all really good.

My only let down was the pork wonton soup I got tonight with egg noodles. Fresh, but a  pretty bland broth.

A huge plus is they can make their papaya salad LAOS style, which I prefer, and it's actually really good :] 

With Ling Ling as the best server ever and down to the padak on the table as a condiment, this place is pretty authentic and never disappoints me. 

Idk if this is for regulars but the service is always super sweet. If I don't finish something for ANY reason I.e. Being full or saving for later.. The Ling Ling always asks if i enjoyed it or if I need it replaced if I may not have liked it. So nice :]

It's tiny so expect a tiny wait at times, the food is worth it, and try not to sit in that center table when it's sunny..

Random thought:

My favorite thing about eating a Thai meal is that it's usually family style. I wish they had an options of ordering a bowl or pot of some of the dishes.. If that makes any sense :] but I'm sure there's a reason they dont offer that. Limited table space..?",2011-08-08 07:49:50

They weren't busy.  There were only two of us there and I was the only one there when I arrived.
Secondly, the pulled pork seemed to have been sitting around for quite a while.  50 % of the pork was dry and tough.  It also seemed overly salty.

After a morning at the Aviary, we stopped here for lunch before heading over to the Phipps Conservatory. I'd never tried this place before, so I wanted to stop in. Catherine was hungry--she said she could have eaten cardboard at that moment and it still would have tasted good! 

Luckily, she didn't have to go that route and the food here was much better than cardboard! 

We began our lunch by splitting an order of Angry Shrimp. Angry Shrimp is very spicy (as its name implies) and is served over chilled pasta. For my main course, the Apple Raspberry Salad sure was tempting, but my blood sugars were running high (I'm a type-1 diabetic) and I already had my carbs with the pasta. I wanted a burger as a second choice, but their burgers are 1/2 pound and I knew I couldn't finish one. Plus I didn't want to schlep leftovers on the bus. So I opted for a Chicken Cobb Wrap, which was tasty enough. 

For the life of me, I can't remember what Catherine ordered, but she did remark that the food was good. She tried the Penn Pilsner beer, which she loved. I don't drink, but unsweetened brewed ice tea with a little lemon in it really hit the spot.

I generally look online for reviews, but honestly, I was in a bind and needed to be seen quickly, so I went back to the good ol' Sam's Club (first, Serene and Eastern, but after being denied, called the Arroyo location) and called to see if there was any availability for this past weekend.  Luckily, I was able to be seen by Dr. Hui on such short notice--calling for an appointment the day before, but then I kept having to move the appointment back due to some other schedule conflicts.  I finally walked in about 1.5 hours after the initial time that I had scheduled an appointment, but it was still ok.

I signed in as soon as I got there, filled out a questionnaire, then had the routine eye exam.  I asked lots of questions, since I let Dr. Hui know that I'd had LASIK in the past (faint scarring at this point), but my vision was still intact.  Many hours of computer work and some night driving have made the surgery fade, so I'm waiting til I can get that corrected.  However, Dr. Hui made sure to explain every step of the testing and the rationale behind why these tests were necessary/what he was testing for.  I felt pretty comfortable, which is always a good sign, then got a light prescription for glasses (HD vs. non-HD according to the Doc).

I paid at the end, (no insurance, regular exam is $65), took my prescription, and swiped some Easter candy--don't judge, they would've gone to waste, lol.  Then, I went next door to get my prescription filled after thanking Dr. Hui and his front office person.

The couple who own it are really awesome and will even fight in front of customers (but only if you're a regular, I think). This only adds to the charm of Chin's. 

The decor is straight ridiculous. Deep red patterned wallpaper and wood paneling. The booths and chairs are all a nice matching red leather as well. Fish tank complete with algae caking the sides. There is also a ""Lounge"" attached with some seriously cool black and white patterned wallpaper. It's almost goth and I kinda want it for my own home. Sadly, it sold out in 1970something. 

The food here is pretty good. It's better than most other Chinese restaurants in the area that I've tried so far. I really love their soup and they make the craziest chicken wings that are battered and fried and go straight to your ass, I'm sure. Heavenly though, really. And the hot oil they give you? HOTTT.

The staff is also always very accommodating and knowledgeable. 

The Mill location is tucked away in the small plaza just north of the Chipotle by the ASU campus. Very little parking in the front but more in the back. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is the parking, really. 

One of the best things about Meat Market is it's sense of community. They hosted an anniversary party at the shop with a bunch of local restaurants and bands.

She hadn't gone yet, but she had heard good things. I was in the High Park area and heading North, so I decided to stop in and have a quick drink to assess the place before we came back at a later date.

After finding parking I started looking for this place and thankfully I knew the address because the signage is horrible. If that's intentional and their aiming to be the kind of place only those in the know are able to visit, that's a mistake. When I entered, right at lunchtime, the HUGE place had only two people. I don't imagine they'll get too many walk-ins.

Because of the empty cavernous feel, I had the awkward feeling that they weren't open and my hesitancy was noticed by someone who nervously asked me what I wanted. Uh, yeah, I actually had to ask this guy if they were open...and they were. I told him that I was just in for one drink and he seemed disappointed. This isn't a good start to my experience. He then pointed around to the empty place and said...""sit anywhere"". Sure, buddy, I'll just do that...I took a seat beside the other people as close to the door as possible.

Because of the recommendation, I expected an awesome beer menu, but was disappointed with the 12 taps they had on offer. Most were decent Ontario craft brews, but there were no standouts. Disappointed might be too strong a word, I'd happily drink here, but it's not going to be an outright destination for the evening.

I was heading to lunch, so I didn't eat, but the menu looks ambitious and reasonably priced. It seems so varied, that I'm not sure that  I'd return here some day for lunch or for their $5 tapas menu.

I stopped in yesterday for the first time and I got two large pho for takeout.  One was beef meatball pho and the other was everything--rare steak, flank, meatball, tripe, brisket, and tendon.

The soups were packed in two containers both having the meatballs.  In other boxes, there was the other 5 meats for my combo and scallions, cilantro, and sliced onion.  In a separate bag was a large amount of bean sprouts, some sliced jalapeños, and spicy Thai basil.  There was another box that had the two spring rolls I ordered.

While waiting for my take out, the owner gave me a glass of iced tea to enjoy while I sat there.  I also took the time to walk around and take some photos.  It's a very pleasant restaurant.  Everyone was very nice.

The pho was very good.  The broth was good and the meats were good, too.  The thing I learned from take out is to reheat the soup when you get home and get it back to scalding hot and then divide the portions and add your vegetables.  That would more closely match the restaurant version.

This is right on the border of 905 and 416 and I have very fond memories of this area since I used to work up in North York/Thornhill years ago.

This large strip mall complex is directly across the street from Centrepoint Mall near the north west corner of Yonge and Steeles.

If you can imagine this strip mall being a clock, The Schnitzel Hub would be right around 11:30.  This mall is pretty large and has two sides and parking and driving around this complex is done in a counter clockwise direction.  

The restaurant space itself is pretty intimate.  While our party was  a dozen with connected tables, there was only about 3 more tables in the restaurant one of 4 and maybe 2 more of 2 as well as the bar.  The bar itself is a pretty site.  They serve more than a dozen types of infused vodka that are visible along the bottom row of bottles.  The bottles are labeled clearly.

We were a large party that took over more than half the seating of the place.  It's safe to say that it's not the usual thing for a dozen people to take over this space.  Again, it's an intimate place but the seating arrangements were comfortable enough.  

We had ordered but our orders were prepared and served not at all the same time.  It's understandable that a small place isn't capable of serving a dozen dishes at once with only one server for the entire establishment.  Still, I received mine first and between myself and the last to receive theirs I was just about done mine and half of my wife's meal.  Also the other patrons in the establishment would also be affected by our large party.  So as far as for large parties, I'd have to say no it's not that great.  For kids that's probably another no.  It's more of an adult scene and an adult menu.  

The food is good.  In hindsight I wish I had ordered something else however.  My wife and I ordered close to the same thing but it actually ended up being the same thing.  What I mean by that is I had ordered the ""Veal Cordon Bleu"" which is a veal schnitzel stuffed with Emmental cheese and ham.  What I received was actually the same item my wife had ordered which was the ""Veal Tiroler"" which is also a stuffed veal schnitzel with Emmental cheese and wild mushrooms.  I had received a stuffed version which is really a schnitzel which is then rolled so to speak.

While I enjoyed my food I had wish I had received what I had ordered.  I wasn't going to send it back even though I had received mine first and it could have been corrected because the place seemed back logged already.  The side my wife had ordered was spaezle which is like a fried pasta while I had mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes seemed really minute compared to how much spaezle was on my wife's plate.  If you're looking to get full(er) get the spaezle as it also tastes great.  They also came with a side of roasted carrots which were very good.

Overall the food is good.  I have had better and the prices are decent for dinner.  Portion wise I think the non stuffed dishes are a better deal though.  Why?  The servings looked bigger, were less expensive and overall there was more food just by looking at the plates.  The flat schnitzels cover the plate so all the sides are underneath, the rolled schnitzels are on the plate but take up space so it looks and seems like less food overall.  My mashed potatoes was maybe 4 oz by volume (half a cup) which is minute compared to the amount of spaezle my wife received.  My dish had a large lemon wedge on the side which took up even more plate space.  

Compared to the other portions servings, mine IMO was small.  I end up eating half of my wife's anyway because she can never finish.  Still it took me 1.5 meals to feel satiated while others that had only one meal were full.  Yes I can eat a lot but one plate for me wasn't that much, probably because portion size (for the money) mine just seemed like less.

There was a Yelp check in for 1 dollar off one of their German beers.  The beer was good, I had 2 different ones, (pilsner and dark) served in tall stein type glasses and each was 7.50 a piece.  

Overall the food was good, the portion sizes I found to be inconsistent and the service because of the volume of the place was slow.  Value wise, it's ok but a little on the pricier side.  Still it's a big change from your normal everyday fare out there.",2015-02-06 14:04:18

The Patrician was the first stop in what has ended up being a 2 1/2 year long, weekly breakfast get together with friends. We've been to almost 120 different places, all of which qualify as greasy spoons, or they at least offer a greasy spoon style breakfast. Authentic greasy spoons or diners are our priority, but we are running out of those. This update springs from a new perspective...that of someone who has a bit of experience in this department...and over 100 other places to compare it to.

The Patrician is an authentic greasy spoon. Built in the 50's and run by the same family since 1967, this place is great. It's got a lunch counter with an open grill, and a number of booths. Coffee was offered before we were even seated, and the server/owner was very friendly and efficient. The eggs were done perfectly (over easy, and sunny side up) and I'm told by my comrades that the bacon was ""above average"". Average bacon, but cooked perfectly. Crisp, but not dried out...and very flat. The toast was standard, Wonder-style brown bread, home fries pretty good, and the coffee was about average.

It's the authentic vibe that makes this place. If you are trying to find traditional Toronto greasy spoons, add this one to your list.",2012-12-17 20:33:51

I went in today and ended up using another Master Artist (Bane) instead of normal artist (Monsey) since one eye was losing too many lashes and I couldn't wait a week to have a fill with Monsey. She's busy for a reason because she's good. I took a chance and regret that I did. I told Bane that my left eye had less lashes and to even them out so they looked the same (pretty obvious right?) well when my eyes were closed I noticed that she was concentrating more on the wrong eye and not the one that I mentioned but it was obvious which eye had less lashes so I figured she knew what she was doing. Honestly after you've had your eyes closed for an hour and a half and they push their mirror in your face you seriously cannot tell how they look until you get home, stand in a normal mirror and brush them. I was angry to find that she gave me heavier lashes on the wrong eye. it was so obvious my friend asked me what happened and this is my friend that I've been trying to talk into going to this location but after today she wasn't impressed. I spent $150.00 for a fill plus to leave the salon with heavier dark lashes on the right eye and sparse featherized lashes on the left. You could tell right away from a distance and there is no way if she's a Master Artist that she couldn't tell either. The workmanship from today was something an apprentice would do. Now I have to take time out of my Saturday to have them ""fixed"". Bane should have never have had me leave with my lashes like that, it was that obvious without brushing them. I was embarrassed running errands today because my eyelashes didn't match. 

Next time I'll wait for Monsey or Jasmine.

***

Went in for a free fix to make both eyes match and I was happy when I left but unfortunately in the morning I had about 9 lashes on my pillow which meant they didn't stay on so I'm lighter on the one eye again. Whatever glue that was used doesn't work. Spending about $300 a month for lashes to not stay is a complete rip off.",2016-08-27 07:23:49

Another amazing thing, Hubbard will not charge you more if your child's needs 1-1 swimming for special needs. Their instructors are very patient, fun and experiment. 

One of my kids has Epilepsy and I'm always worried about him in the water. Hubbard instructors have done an amazing job in teaching him water safety while keeping him safe. 

My oldest has Autism and we have come A LONG way with swimming lessons. For about 5 years he would not go under water. Hubbard instructors (we have had Many over be years) were always patient with him. My son now is a fish and I give all the credit to Hubbard and it's amazing caring instructors. 

Thank you Hubbard for teaching my kids life long lessons in water safety. I have 4 fishes now because of your hard dedicating team. 

I also find the other families and children attending Hubbard vey friendly and fun. Only one time in 8 years a rude uneducated mother felt the need to try to discipline my son with Autism. This only happened once, never again. We just avoid this lady if she is ever around. But otherwise Hubbard also has amazing families :)

I guess that's because they have not many customers due to their service. Upon walking up to the counter I wait 4-5 mins before asking the two ladies in front of me if anyone came to serve them yet. They advise no and that it looks as if there's only one person working. A few moments later a cashier/employee by the name of Roxana walks from the back and takes all 3 of our orders. I make my special request and she tells me a price of $4.99. She doesn't state my price WITH tax so when I get my change, without a receipt I request the receipt I should have received in the first place. 

My drink at minimum isn't too off. She omitted the banana as requested but didn't add the extra sweetener as I requested. Nothing to complain about since looking at my receipt she didn't charge me extra for it anyway. 

So for my 20+ mins in their store I observed the lonely one cashier take drive thru order, one or two counter orders, make drinks, and wash dishes in the back all by herself.

For me, I see it as an excuse to spout off my opinions about Amazon as a whole.

In some ways, it's amazing to watch how far they've come. I've been an Amazon member since the late 90s, when they were primarily known as an online bookstore, despite selling many other items. ""Amazon Prime"" - which people refer as if it's the actual business name for some odd reason, has actually been around since my college days in 2005.

For the most part, I like Amazon. They offer decent customer service and aside from a few rare exceptions, usually deliver my items both timely and safely. The whole third-party purchasing can be confusing to some, so be sure you look closely upon checkout. Not everything you purchase will come directly from Amazon unless you double-check the source.

I do miss the early days when we would get away with not paying taxes, which came particularly in handy with my high-end gadgetry. There was also a time when I would purchase practically anything on a whim with two-day shipping, even if the item cost as little as five bucks. These days, those cheap items must typically be bulked together in one purchase in order to offset the shipping cost, which kind of puts a damper on the convenience of Prime shipping.

If you're a seller, be sure to behave yourself. Sometimes, even the slightest error can easily result in your account being banned. I had to spend several hours putting together multiple drafts of a legitimate ""improvement plan"" to help restore my girlfriend's account after an inventory mix-up.

Their return policy is decent, but don't get too comfortable. I've received a few e-mails from customer service over the years, calling attention to the fact that I've returned a high number of items (e.g. 3 out of 75 items in six months, apparently?) Anyway, I've read numerous horror stories of customers being permanently banned from using Amazon because of returns, so I try to keep my purchases restricted to ""low-risk"" items that I'm certain that I'll keep. It's for this reason that I'd never buy clothes from them.

Minor complaints aside, there's a reason why they're so popular. And as long as they continue delivering my items on time at prices similar to what I can obtain at traditional retail stories, I'll continue using them.",2017-03-18 22:14:26

I like to scope out all the good pet places on yelp... this store is pretty big, lots of grooming stations. It seems well cleaned. There's a cute selection of dog treats that they make there.... West Paw beds and toys - actually TONS of really fun looking toys. Right now, our pup has waaaay too many, so when we are looking for some new ones, I'd stop by.

The foods they carry: Solid Gold, Orijen, Evangers, Wellness, TOTW, California Naturals, EVO, Innova, Canidae.... prob more. a decent selection of both dry kibble and canned, as well as cat options too. They have quite a selection of harnesses, from step-ins to the super luxe Puppias (a M runs ~ $25 here). From my extensive research - and it IS extensive, the food pricing isn't too bad. It's pretty competitive. Not the cheapest, but not a rip-off. 

What I like: I called to ask about ... duh duh duuuuuhhhhhhhhh.... anal gland expression. And I like what the guy who answered told me! He said they don't do it and don't recommend getting it done by a groomer because it can actually impact the glands - they recommend getting it done by a vet. BRAVO to WNW for being up front and caring about dogs' health first and foremost!

What I didn't like: They weren't too friendly, and for a pet store, didn't seem interested in meeting my little pup. He wasn't offered any samples of the treats, and when I browsed the food, no one asked me if I needed any help or had any questions. It was also a bit messy, with a few bags of food blocking some aisles.

I never want to be that person, so I didn't even ask the waiter for suggestions, but I'm not sure I would have been able to hear her anyway - place is LOUD. Boyfriend and I were there on a Wednesday night at 7pm and we could barely hear each other across the small table. Side note: there was about a 45-minute wait. On a random Wednesday night. It's a popular spot.

And still, you say, Soul deserves 4 stars? Really, Amy? Well, everything we had was absolutely incredible. As mentioned before, I'm an annoying gluten-free bitch. Even though I didn't eat 1/3 of the ingredients in the pork belly tacos (flour tortilla), the other 2/3 (pork belly and watermelon) were delicious enough that I'm still salivating over them 3 weeks later. Holy eff, that combination is deadly. Sweet, salty, indescribably amazing.

Brussel sprouts were some of the best I've ever had. Fries were BANGING. Sushi was decent, but we probably ordered the wrong roll (crunch roll) - some other rolls floating around the restaurant looked better. We only spent about $45 due to the fact that most of the other items had unavoidable gluten. But I can still safely say that I get it, Charlotte. This place is something special.",2018-04-30 15:52:05

This came with four different types of meat - half beef and half pork. It also came with several side dishes - a veggie stew, steamed egg, veggies, melted cheese, small salad, and several dipping sauces. The waiter helped cook all our meat, asking how done we wanted it (medium rare). My two favorites were the Marinated Skirt Steak and Short Ribs: These were amazing. Super flavorful and extremely tender. I would definitely order again. After three meats came out, we were waiting on our fourth (the spicy pork belly). Our waiter seemed to have disappeared and another waiter stepped up to take over. He cooked our spicy pork belly, which was delicious, but I'd definitely order something else next time. (The meat was very thinly sliced and not entirely what we were expecting.) Then, for dessert, we had two different flavors of Rice Pop Ice Cream (mango/strawberry and green tea).

I ordered the chicken rice bowl as always and enjoyed it. I added pinto beans, hot sauce (or salsa) and a little bit of corn. It was tasty and alot of food so I saved the remainder for lunch today. 

I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are all about but I suspect it has to do with the long lines. I feel that most, if not all, of the Chipotle locations that I've been to in different cities always seem to have lines. Long lines means that the business is booming so that is a good problem to have. Right? I think the longest that I've waited in line at this particular location is maybe 10 minutes. 

I don't think I can give a bad review based on wait times. Perhaps if the wait time is 15-20 mins then maybe Chipotle needs to look at hiring more people but so far so good.

This place isn't the best for dine-in, however, their delivery area isn't big enough for us all to enjoy the eat-at-home service.... So I recommend making the trip (cheaper than flying to Chicago to get deep dish this good).

The sauce is orgasmic. I will be having dreams about it for the next few days. Luckily, their smallest pizza is enough to feed me for a few more days. The wait is what you'd expect from good deep dish (40-45 minutes). Do not come here if you are in a hurry (or any pizza place for that matter).

It's good, very good. Why not 5 stars? The little things. Chicago style pizzas... No references to Chicago. WHOLE bunch of Italy though. As big as the pizzas are... It's not built for groups. Lots of carbs, nothing light and refreshing which would be nice to finish off a hefty pizza. All of the appetizers are huge portions. That being said it's also not really good for just 2 people.

The mushroom and truffle spring rolls ($6 for 2 rolls/4 pieces) were delicious.

I wanted something with meat and vegetables, since I was 1 person and didn't want to order a lot of different dishes. The waiter recommended a sizzling hot pot with seafood ($25) or beef and mushroom ($15). Instead I went for the sweet and sour pork ($16). This was probably a mistake, because it's a less authentic dish, but I thought it would be a good test of their skills in the kitchen. It was disappointing to say the least. I was expecting big pieces of veggies, but the bell pepper and pineapple were chopped up in tiny pieces and kind of smoodged into the sauce. The sauce itself had an off-putting flavour, like they used ketchup in the sauce (I don't like ketchup), but the server denied it. There was no garnish, not even some sesame seeds which would have been nice. Not worth the price. Next time I will order something else.

For 1 person, with two glasses of wine, an appetizer and a main, bowl of white rice ($2), with tip and tax came to $50. Ouch.

I am giving them 3 stars. It would be 2 stars, except I need to experience more different dishes to make an informed review. I promised to take my cousin there for dim sum and there is not much else around this area, and I will give them a chance. I would like to try their dim sum.

The food here is average and they have a scale of 1-10 for spiciness. Ask the waiter for reference because the spiciness ratio is different for each dish. A level 5 salad is as spicy as a level 10 curry. It also depends on how much coconut milk is in the curry.

Had been looking forward to trying this spot, and our meal was more hit than miss. The space has a Zen vibe with a fountain, plants and chimes. Wait staff were super friendly and helpful. 

We shared three dishes family style: the much lauded (and rightfully so) crispy, addictive eggplant, ma pao tofu (I'm a huge fan of soft tofu, but I think it needed spice) and curry ""fish"" (we'd ordered black bean but ate it anyway) Here is where the former vegan in me (sooo obnoxious as a Cal undergrad that I would not ingest honey ""because bees worked to make it"" thank goodness I got over myself!) is not a big fan of faux meats, but they seem to be the norm. The ""fish"" had a great sauce with tamarind kick, but texture was somewhat of an issue for all of us. Included in the price was brown (!) rice and a vegetable consommé which was soothing but a little bland. 

For 8$ each, inclusive of tax and tip, we ate well and enjoyed the experience.  Definitely worth another visit and I believe even carnivores will enjoy the food as the preparation shows attention to detail and commitment to vegetarian/vegan eats. 8 is also my favorite & lucky number, so I love how they open at 11:38AM according to front door :))",2012-10-23 05:08:18

Growing up in Charlotte, there used to be a few Korean BBQ joints here (none were AYCE), but over the years they have all closed their doors. As a kid in a blended bicultural family  we would make bulgogi and Kimichi after church on Sundays, so Korean food has always had a special place in my heart. Naturally I decided to go out with friends to Let's Meat for my birthday and to see if this place really lived up to the hype. Let me tell you as a KBBQ fanatic, this place is one of the best I have had in America (yup..that includes LA and San Diego). 

The pros:
* Friendly staff (shout out to Tim for being the best waiter staff ever) - super friendly, helpful, and very talkative. 
*Meat quality  - the meat here is on point - they aren't cutting corners to save a little extra $$$ and I appreciate that! 
* Banchan - all of the banchan was on point! My only compliant was the lack of Sigeumchi Namul and Eomuk Bokkeum. 

Tips for KBBQ newbies - 
*Ask for half orders - if you want to try something, but you aren't sure you will like it ask for a smaller order. 
*Don't be shy to ask for help - grilling takes practice ( p.s those scissors are there to cut the meat) 
* Use the Lime/Lemon to clean the grill 
*Ask for lettuce and wrap your meat in lettuce with some radish and soy bean paste! 
* Not a first date spot- who wants to stuff their face in front of a new date? But, definitely a place that I would go before getting serious with someone. If they can't get down with the grilled squid or turn up their nose to kimchi...things aren't looking good for the long haul. 

Honestly can't wait to go back. Alcohol is a bit pricey, so if you're looking to relive your days in Seoul - pregame before coming to eat and then rent a Karaoke room next door.",2018-07-13 00:36:01

Looking at the menu, I saw the typical diner-style offerings that were common in joints owned by Greek families when I was a kid growing up in Charlotte.

Here, you will find a huge selection including sandwiches, salads, burgers, or a vast selection of entrees including the traditional ""meat & 2"" offerings (including baked or fried chicken, thanksgiving dinner, fried catfish or flounder, meatloaf, etc...).  The entrees are served with your choice of a roll or cornbread. 

The side dish options include such southern staples as fried okra, mac & cheese, green beans, collard greens, mashed potatoes, Lima beans, corn fries, onion rings, rice, fried squash, candied yams, banana pudding, and many more traditional southern favorites.  There were so many yummy sides that on my next visit, I may have to go for a veggie plate (you can choose a veggie plate with 3 or 4 sides). 

For my lunch, I decided on the baked chicken (you get to specify whether you want white meat or dark meat), corn bread, mac & cheese and fried okra.  Everything was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The mac & cheese wasn't as good as grandma's - but it as close as you can get in a restaurant! 

2 of the folks at my table ordered dessert, so I got to try a bite of each.  First the pecan pie - I would not order this. It is nothing like grandma's - too much mushy filling and not enough pecans. Disappointing... it seemed to be ""commercial grade pie"" rather than ""home-made pie"" in my opinion.  

Next up was the peach cobbler - our server really talked this one up, but again, it fell short of my expectations. It was better than the pecan pie, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.  (Maybe they can do a better job on this when fresh peaches are available?)  In any case, next time I'll just have to order my own dessert and of course, it will be the banana pudding.

All in all, this place serves up good honest food - nothing fancy - but just yummy.  I really wish there were places like this closer to my neighborhood!",2013-02-04 20:57:18

He really wanted Chinese food but we couldn't go to the place he wanted because he had lots of school work to finish. So I ordered our meal to be delivered from Dragon Pearl instead after reading the Yelp reviews.

I was happy that they did deliver since not many places do now however it took them almost 2 hours to bring our order and I phoned right when they opened at 5 pm. I was not pleased it was almost 7 pm before our meal arrived and we were all very hungry by this point. I don't even live very far but I had already changed into my sleep wear after my long day of work and did not feel like driving anywhere. 

When we ate our food I have to say I've had better and much cheaper. The ginger beef didn't have that kick we were looking for and the fried rice was surprisingly bland. The Wor Won Ton soup was very good however the broth wasn't salty like most broths are and there was a nice helping of vegetables in there as well. I was however impressed by the dumplings most places they are dry and very heavy and you feel like you swallowed a ball of rubber but these were very good we finished off the order in no time. 

I would for sure stop in and eat the won ton soup or the dumplings any day because they were really good. However the food didn't wow me. I felt like some of the dishes were missing something.

The only good things I can say about Victoria's Wedding Chapel is the Food tasted good and my cake was yummy (but lacked in the looks department) 

I was married here on 12/12/09 and of course we only had so much money to work with. I came across this place and it seem OK for the price. The package we got was $3,500 and when asked if we can reduce the price because we weren't using their flowers (bringing our own) and was hiring a second photographer (our package only included the photographer for the ceremony) they wouldn't. Saying ""It's a package"" 

Cake: As for my cake the 3 options that came with the package were kind of ugly I paid the extra $200 for a better cake. Pretty piping, flowers cascading down the side...I told them I wanted no flowers on the cake and that I would be bring in my topper. I brought in my topper as requested the day before and the day of my wedding when I arrived early to check everything out I go to the kitchen to look at my cake and it was HORRIBLE. It looked nothing like the photo they advertise, the black piping was running and it was all shaky. They didn't even put my topper on the cake, they said ""It was too heavy"" but if they had a Real Baker there they would know they need to put cardboard under the frosting to hold it. So they just left the top empty (instead of calling and asking/stating what my alternative would be) and placed the Topper next to the cake at the bottom on the table. We had them put flowers on the top to hide the empty. 

The staff: At times seem as if they didn't know what they were talking about! My package only included the photographer for the ceremony and some shots after. I hired a second photographer for the Getting ready part and reception. I asked them if there would be any problems w/ my photographer being there before the wedding started and they said ""No that is fine"". My second shooter even called and ask the Chapel as well they told her the same thing. The day of my wedding they are telling us she cant be here until the reception and when I corrected them; they told us ""Just have her out of here (bride's room) before their photographer gets there or he'll be mad.""

They have Iams and Purina pet food.  Tidy Cats litter is at least comparable to Walmart.  Scratch poles and doggy bones, collars and leashes, pet treats, pet beds - this store had TONS;  I think I even wanted a few to make as my own bed.

Ordered: black sesame sweet soup and taro and coconut with sago dessert (see pictures)
My boyfriend specifically asked if they use powder or real grounded black sesame powder to make their dessert and the waitress told us they use real sesame here. When we got it, my boyfriend said it was made from powder packets you can buy at supermarkets. I honestly can't tell the difference but if you've been to sweet culture before, you would probably guessed that they weren't at the back grinding up real black sesame seeds for your dessert. In fact, most if not all dessert places just serve powdered goodness. However, we both enjoyed our desserts and the portion sizes were good and has stayed the same over the years. I got my taro and coconut sago cold. Very few pieces of taro and they were quite hard which I don't like. Other than that, it was good. Preferred the black sesame over mine. 
Our friends ordered a mix of black sesame and walnut paste and they both agreed Thad they liked the black sesame more as well so I guess if you're there, give it a try...even though it's one of those boring old timey Chinese desserts.

Chose 1 pasta set that came with soup of the day (potato) and a salad to go along with our smoked salmon vodka and shrimp okonomiyaka with a virgin berry muddle on the side! The set also came with a slice of cake for dessert!

Location: 5/5

Located a bit east of Woodbine on Steeles, this Japanese restaurant fits right in JTown! With ample parking, anyone who loves Japanese food and culture can also shop before or after in this cute area. Convenient for those that live in Markham and Scarborough area as it is right on the border.

Decor/Ambience: 5/5

Modern, hip and lovely jazzy background music. This place is romantic, clean and simple; perfect for young couples and/or young families, which is about 90% of the guests dining here during the duration of our lunch. Their wooden decor in flooring, wooden tables, wooden chairs with black plush seats, wooden circular hanging lights really matches their leafy logo and namesake.

Service: 4/5

Staff here are pretty friendly and they greeted us politely with a pleasant smile. Timely service.

Food quality: 5/5

All the items we ordered were divine!

Set came with a potato bisque and a slice of cake. The soup du jour was creamy, light and the chunks of potatoes added to the texture as they melt into your mouth!

Their curry poutine is a must try here! I would come back just to eat this single item! First off, I love Japanese curry in general and poutine is so Canadian! What a great cultural mix! This guilty pleasure was bold in flavours from the curry and the fries literally just melted in my mouth! I think I went to a dream land and back!

Virgin berry mocktail tasted like a cocktail with alcohol and almost a quarter of the classy drink was full of diced strawberries and blueberries. So refreshing and fruity!

My beau's shrimp okonomiyaka had a nice smoked bacon bites infused with a hint of Japanese mayonnaise that reminded me of takoyaki!

Topped with fish roes, my smoked salmon vodka was incredibly delicious!! The vodka was infused into the creamy sauce.

All their pastas come with a small lettuce salad with sliced carrots and a slice of garlic bread!

Their set came with a slice of cake and we had a choice of tiramisu, chocolate mousse or green tea red bean and I chose the latter for the two of us to share.

Light and tasty, the slice had 3 tiers of green tea and one tier of red beans with cream in between each layer. 

Everything was spot on! Presentation was on point, too! Truly enjoyed my lunch here!

Typically, I'm not one to indulge in the carnal sins of sausage, but seeing that I'd planned an event involving the beefy visuals of the film Magic Mike, it only made sense to finish said event with face time involving real hot meat!

 WVRST is a beer and sausage drink-a-teria for lack of a better description.  It's three or four looong rows of picnic table style communal tables.  You place your order at the front desk where the uncooked sausages are on display in a showcase and you take a number sit back down at your table and wait for the staff to bring it up to you.  My hubby was dissappointed that the girls working here weren't wearing those ridiculous Tyrolean outfits  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmGjaqi74qo  but I'll say the girls at WVRST aren't at all bad looking.

Truthfully, I am not a fan of sausage or hotdogs as I don't consume pork.  I was initially pegged to order the veggie dog, but upon seeing and savouring the aroma of Chris P's artichoke/chicken decided to order that instead and it was the best sausage I've had!!! Nicely seasoned and neither too hard (and charred) or too limp!  The bun that encases the weiner is soft and pleasantly chewy,and the sauteed saurkraut and peppers was the perfect accompaniment to the meat package.

Thanks to Kris, Johnny, and Chris for letting us dip into, if not ravage their decadent duck fat fry reserves, fries do taste better when they are Bogarted off someone else of course!

Good to know: For those who are squeamish at the thought of pork and game, WVRST also serves vegetarian sausages which are tofu based and uses bread  instead of casing to solidify it's ""sausage-esque"" shape.  Also if you're not a beer drinker WVRST has a selection of refined sodas from Boylan and Belvoir fruit farms.

Big up to whomever puts together the musical playlist here as I had an earful of welcome proper oldschool  rap tunes from the likes of EPMD and Eric B & Rakim to chill with, while I enjoyed my sausage.

A big thank-you to all those who showed up to get a banger in the mouth and special thanks to WVRST staffer Stephanie for reserving the sexy corner table for our 'Sausage Party"" and I will definitely be returning here to update on the veggie banger.",2012-09-19 16:06:30

First, I must note that this eatery is a chain and is also located in Philadelphia and a few other states.

The menu is above the ordering area and well lit. You place your order, given a buzzer so that you can pick up your order when ready. They have a condiment as well as various sauces station where you can add things such as onions or spicy sauces to your item of choice.

My husband and I sat in the downstairs seating area but I did notice additional seating upstairs. I ordered the Choolaah lamb perfect balance bowl which comes with your choice of rice, veggie masala, and Tandoori veggies. My husband ordered the veggie croquet chopped salad with tam ginger. We did spring an extra $1.50 for a slice of wheat naan which we shared.

We were parked in the lot that gives you 45 minutes of free parking but as a word of advice-consider parking elsewhere because with the wait time and having to eat your food in hurry there is no way you can be out of there within that time frame. If that is not an issue to you, then the next tier is $3.00 and cards only are accepted for payment. Also, within that garage are a few spaces earmarked for 20 minutes just for pickup only.

We got our food in a reasonable amount of time and while I can say it was good it was most certainly on par with what I would expect from a fast casual restaurant. However, I found that the wheat naan was very soft, moist, and paired well with our meals. It could be used for dipping. I did taste part of my husband's vegetable croquet but it was breaded and seemed to lack flavor.

My lamb meal was good and wasn't overly spicy. I did try one of the sauces that you can fill in a small cup and believe me they are hot. I liked the decor of the place and  the cute way they tell you how you can BYOB from a nearby wine store. 

I was amazed as we were getting ready to leave how packed this place got even on a Sunday! It's probably because it recently opened and the novelty hasn't worn off yet.

When you are finished eating there is a disposal station where you can recycle or trash your stuff. They even have an area where you can automatically clean your hands. A very nifty idea!

In my opinion this place is good but lacks the quality of a true Indian restaurant much like Panera Bread lacks the quality of a descent sit down American restaurant. Still, they do cater and if you want to try a fast casual approach to Indian food you would do well here. Prices are reasonable and I would definitely recommend you spend the extra $1.50 for the naan which is like a wrap bread. You can also get it as white naan if you prefer to go gluten free.

Located right on the East Liberty/Shadyside border they have an arrow outside directing you to the parking garage I mentioned on Centre Ave.",2018-02-04 21:18:09

They have very limited seating, and they're usually pretty busy, so on the weekends and at lunch time during the weekdays, be prepared to wait awhile. They have a variety of appetizers and dumplings (steamed or fried), noodle and rice dishes as well. 

I love their Hot & Sour Soup, as the hot and sour ratio is just perfect. I love the fact that it has tons of ingredients in it like crunchy bamboo shoots, sliced bean curd, as well as Chinese mushrooms. It went well with their Green Onion Pancake which almost every table had an order of. One of my favorites dishes here is the Fried Chive and Egg Pancake, which is loaded with vermicelli, Chive and egg and is super crispy on the outside. 

The Pan Fried Dumplings were okay, I would've like them more if the bottom had more of a crunch.

I have not been here in a while...now I know why...the only reason I went back because I wanted to try the new ""All Natural Burger"" So I got it as a low carb option...which means no bun...I also got the Lo carb Jalapeno burger. 

First lets talk about price...All I got was the two burgers...NO drink...NO Fries...with no buns...so basically burgers wrapped in lettuce...$15.14...Rip OFF!!!!! 

Seriously for the price I paid I could of bought a head of lettuce, the meat and all the fixings and fed a family of 6. 

Secondly...this place is dirty...as I walked in, there were two Little Ceasers pizza boxes sitting on top of the bushes next to the Redbox dvd rental machines, along with a few empty drinking containers...and in general allot of trash. Once you get inside it's not much better. 

I made my order, seriously almost shit myself when the girl told me the price. Thinking this better be the best burger I have ever eaten. The girl gave me my little table number tent and I then proceeded to sit down...most of the tables were dirty...not sure how they can't keep up on this stuff it was 8:40pm...and besides me there were only 3 other people in the building, a couple and what appeared to be a homeless guy in the back maybe drinking coffee.

My food was brought out on a tray by a girl...first thing I noticed is my napkin dispenser at the table is empty, so I had to get up to get them at another table...and the tray she brought it to me on was warped...so it didn't sit on the table flat...seriously why wouldn't you throw this thing out?? 

Let's talk about taste...the all natural burger...literally looked like a piece of flattened grilled dog food, and was so greasy...I mean like literally left a puddle of grease in my hamburger box... and it tasted bad...like it may of possibly been bad...but I thought to myself...maybe it was just because it was all natural. I was wrong...let's just say...the last few days I have been sick to my stomach felt like I was getting stabbed with razor blades and I had the worst fever. I am sure this food was the cause, it was all I had eaten that day, and all I had except for an iced tea from Starbucks. 

I will never go back to this location. It's dirty on all accounts. Gross. Don't pay attention to the review below saying that this place is good, I honestly think that was written by someone that works there. So bad.

GjtEoiJuup3brFiixmqipg,QPJJohtGqkMkaN0Gt3TRIg,308f__iS3Qw_qhnda6IVPw,2,11,4,1,"Heard from a client that the omakase at Hiro is 'really good!', so my fiancé and I have decided to check it out last night. Unfortunately, it was just a whole BIG disappointment from beginning to end. Really NOT worth the time and money.

There was only one sushi chef in the house and the restaurant is full... so most of the time, we are just waiting and waiting for the food to come. Omakase was priced at $70 and up per person. Ended up paying a total over $200 before tax and tips.

Food was really not up to par. I think I had salt overdose. They put so much salt and seasoning in the cooked foods and even had rock salt on my sashimi (to enhance flavours... but seriously, it's just too much salt intake overall)! Also, I literally had a wasabi brain freeze and my jaw became numb. Chef used way too much wasabi in the sushi, it is extremely spicy and I had to pick them out. Be sure to ask the chef to go lighter on the wasabi when you order. But the chef was drinking beer and was in his zone. I don't think he gives a shit of what you think.

By the time we had the 7th course, our waitress asked if we had enough food. We said we would like one more plate of sushi. The chef whipped up some half ass job sushi as our 8th course with sashimi we already had, sweet Chinese mushroom (bad choice) and a maki roll with sour vinaigrette, mint leaf and white radish roots (extremely bad choice). This combination tasted like soap. Yes, soap. Not soup, but soap. The impression we got from the chef was 'Get outta here'.

During this whole omakase experience, we did not get uni or hamachi or raw scallops or whatever fancy things out there. My fiancé loves hamachi, so after that horrible 8th course, we specifically asked the chef to make us a hamachi hand roll. I'm sure everyone knows what a hand roll is, but instead, we got a hamachi maki log. Should've taken a photo of it. The impression we got from the chef after the log was 'Really, get da F outta here'.

So we have decided to call it a night and asked for dessert. 'Homemade' black sesame ice cream was definitely not homemade. They should seriously take note from Zen Japanese Restaurant of what homemade black sesame ice cream is. Apple and pear sorbet was just flavored crushed ice rolled into a ball. Ice cream and sorbet cost $5 each, just in case you were wondering. I can't believe they charged us extra for dessert during a dinner omakase. For $5, I can get better stuff at Ed's Real Scoop. 

Overall, it's just bad. But kudos to our waitress... she was so busy running around helping out the restaurant (which seemed short staffed) and trying to keep all the customers happy. Not the best omakase in Toronto for sure.",2014-09-14 16:52:55

We had and I suggest making a reservation, even if you're planning on dining during the week. It was quite busy for a Thursday at 7pm. 

Upon arrival, we were promptly seated toward the back of the restaurant. Our sever, Autumn, greeted us and gave us ample time to review the drink and food menu.

In addition to a fun selection of cocktails, they also have a large wine menu. We each ordered a glass of wine ($10).

We decided to order an appetizer and chose the calamari. I always like calamari, but I always think it tastes the same. Which leads me to ask, why do I order it? Anyway, instead of a traditional marinara on the side, they served theirs with a yummy, green sauce. Slightly spicy tangy, but delicious. The calamari wasn't super greasy (a plus).

For our entrees, I ordered the fish tacos (grilled, not crispy) ($18), and the other two ordered the fried chicken special ($18) and a fancy burger (can't remember exactly what made it so special). The tacos, something I've had many times before are just wonderful. The kitchen doesn't skimp here, packing each with a nice portion of fish, coleslaw and dressing. The fried chicken platter looked amazing. Keep in mind that they only serve the fried chicken on Thursday nights (perhaps that's why it was so busy?). My friend noted that the chicken was super delicious (it looked it!).

We didn't stick around for dessert because we were so full.

The venue is sick--every detail is well thought out, from the Edison bulb ceiling lights to the soft core porn octopus wall murals.  It was really cool to get a glimpse into their impressively tiny glass-walled kitchen, and the service couldn't have been better.  But to me, Tako is not a restaurant--it's a bar.  

The DJ keeps the pop music loud, and on a Thursday night, we struggled to hear the other end of our table of 5.  The Mushroom Tacos and on special Pork Belly Tacos we ordered were delicious, with all their components really sync, but the tacos themselves were the only delicious items on the menu.  Our group also tried the Kale and the Street Corn and made-our-own Guac, and none of them impressed.  The salad was tiny and lackluster, with the sesame seeds being the singular standout ingredient, and the chopped roasted poblano bits in the guacamole made every bite of the (small) dish bitter.  

Sad starters aside, the customer left with very few desirable menu items, and the focus really does seem to be on the drinks.  That being said, this isn't necessarily bad if that's what you're looking for.  I wasn't.  

The bottom line--come thirsty but not hungry, pass on the appetizers, and expect to pay $18 for a pair of their signature Tako tacos (You might hope that these are larger than your standard sized $2 street tacos.  They're not.).  It was a decent enough experience for a Thursday night, and I definitely understand all the hype, but I probably won't be back.  Would I have chosen  this place for an obnoxious screamfest reunion with my sorority sisters?  Sure.  Would I make another reservation 3 weeks out for a nice dinner with my fiancee?  Def not.

This is AZ and this is an outdoor venue, brace your sweat glands by hydrating! Under LiveNation, you can get pretty decent seats even last minute. I've sat at all the options for several concerts and it's up to your pocketbook. There is a section covered with fans to cool you off unless you are in the VIP area. Lawn is great if you aren't a diva and you want to mingle with other concert goers. You'll get the same crisp sound from back there. Acoustics are pretty awesome, I felt Jack was whispering his classics in my ear. As we know behind every favorite song, there's an untold story.  

I can't complain about parking since I Lyfted there. A designated spot for Lyft/Uber drivers on the west side is easy to direct your driver so you won't have to fret where they should pick you up.

If you're on a budget, I suggest hitting up Westgate Entertainment District to pregame. For me, what's a concert experience though without a drink or souvenir from the venue?!!?! An average beer is $17 but go for the gusto and get the souvenir fishbowl vodka drinks for $3 more. It'll help cool you off waiting for the band to start.

The Dragon Roll is a California roll with eel and eel sauce on top.  I was cracking up because my son was eating the eel first, and then popping the rest in his mouth.  He loved it!

Gary's Special is a plethora of goodness, starting with spicy soft shell crab, spice tuna,  spicy crab, spicy scallop, and if that's not enough it's topped with yellowtail and salmon.  OMG.  My poor son, we were all digging in and trying this one.

Quick tip:  when you get it to-go, the sauce is served separately in a little plastic container (I love that!  Keeps thing from getting soggy).  Be sure to mix it up good, because I didn't and had too much oil, while my husband had the foresight to mix it up better and enjoyed a citrus note.

ChocoMinty - Contains nutmilk, banana, cacao, agave & peppermint. Had a nice taste to this and I liked that we weren't taking in too much calories whilst drinking this. 
Sweet Potato Fritters - interesting dish. The fritters were crunchy and a little hard to chew at first. It was definitely better with the chipotle sauce! 
Pad Thai - this is a popular dish at Rawlicious, but imho something was lacking...at least in the beginning, as we needed to mix the sauce more with the zucchini & kelp noodles better. This was a nice dish though but don't except it to be the traditional pad thai. 
Bolognese - loved the zucchini noodles with tomato marinara. I could definitely taste the pesto in there. Loved it! It was odd at first cuz this dish is normally cooked and I was eating this raw. Very convincing. I am definitely ordering this again next time

The place is clean, and the booths are comfy and modern. I got fresh shrimp rolls, and a large rare beef and beef brisket pho. I also got a coconut, non-diary bubble tea with tapioca.

The shrimp rolls were yummy. The dipping sauce had peanuts, so I was in heaven. Everything was fresh and tasty. 

I normally don't do a large pho. I'mbglad that I did. I was hungry. The pho was good. You get a lot of meat! Normally, I don't get the brisket, because it's hit or miss. This one was decent. Not a ton of fat that makes me gag, but enough to keep the pho flavourful. 

The coconut bubble tea was yummy. I got it without dairy. I was a happy camper, except when I sucked down a tapioca ball too fast. It made me cough, but it wasn't serious. 

I'm glad that Ajax had a pho place. Staff are friendly, and speak both Vietnamese and Cantonese. I'd come back to try my usual -- rare beef and beef ball pho.

Yup. Everytime. Unusual name, but it's kinda cute. I have been here twice now and most recently today for a client work lunch. Agreeably both times were quite enjoyable and overall the food was amazing!

We were late for our reso but all the same, greeted with warm smiles and seated immediately. A server quickly took our drink orders and explained the special for lunch which was an appie something, main something and a HOMEMADE DONUT (you can see what part caught my attention). Drinks arrive and after an excruciating 15 minutes of trying to decide across a number of great vegetarian options (unusual) I went with the gnocchi, which was created from a multitude of vegetables and accompanied with mushrooms and truffle. I also got a ""green garlic"" puree soup. Of course such an option was debated at the table because WHO KNOWS WHAT GREEN GARLIC IS? We are of the assumption it's the snape? (*I just goggled this now and we're wrong.. it's an ""immature"" garlic and resembles a green onion perfectly*). 

Appies arrive and the watermelon three ways is a picture book of plating perfection with square inch size watermelon cubes, wrapped in cucumber invisibly thin and mint on top. Like little presents really. The tuna is deliciously seasoned, the wontons with eggplant and goat cheese were ridiculously good and the truffle fries... YESSS!! Truffle fries. I hate to overshadow the chef creations with excitement for fries - but seriously, good. The soup was also really delicious and contained fiddleheads - my first on these and I quite liked. My main dish - the gnocchi might have been some of the best I have ever had. It was super fresh and hand made, multi colored based on differing vegetables, lots of mushrooms on the side and a rich sauce that I could have drank straight (likely butter I believe). It was also lightly truffled and not too overpowering. Portion size was perfect which was great with a rich meal for lunch.

Finally - the grand finale. DESSERTS! The foreshadowing of the aforementioned donut was of course ordered. This thing was outstanding. Hot and fresh (think crispy cream - but not as ... ""cheap""), glazed with an amazing chocolate and topped with cookie crumbs. Below on the plate was a dollop of house made caramel that was salted. The warm combo was ...  was... well it disappeared REALLY FAST. Another? Ugh.. if only I had time, and more space in my belly, and will power.

Our experience was great. Service was impeccable, food was amazing, and the restaurant itself was pretty cool. I do have to mention that a super winning point for me here is the chef's ability to truly CREATE unique and well paired food dishes. Nothing is like anything you get elsewhere, and nothing is a ""staple"". It's all very handmade, fresh, unique, tasty, interesting and well prepared. I am a huge fan of this and any foodie should definitely visit ASAP!",2013-06-07 03:00:20

They have a wide shoe selection and unlike Winners, it's much easier to find your size as they are all in boxes. At times they have shoes on clearance as well. Recently, I scored a pair of sandals there for $20 marked down from $35 which is a pretty great steal.

The clothes are a hit or miss. The best time to go is usually the beginning of each season, especially during fall time as they are have a lot of sweaters and cardigans for around $30-40. If you are petite, there are also great finds in the junior section as well.

The hair and skin care section is another section that you can score good deals. They often have chi hair products at a discounted price and other brand name skin care products such as Bliss.

The only drawback would be the home section as they lack variety and many times the packaging is damaged. The prices I find are also not a great deal.

Now, I'm not sure if standards changed along with the venue but there is quite a difference that I felt that I should not have. To begin, I made a reservation only to go in to an additional 30 mintue wait. Why did I even bother calling in advance? Then, once seated I felt rushed by the waiter to get a drink order other than water. He did not seem content with the possiblity of my not ordering a glass of wine. Which of course I did because I happen to love wine. The few that the waiter suggested were of course the higher priced ones. I am assuming he was trying to up his check average that night or something. The one I chose was very bold and so flavorful (and decently priced) that I ended up with a second glass fairly soon after the first. This was pretty much the only part I enjoyed. Throughtout dinner, I felt as though there was just a sea of white hackets walking around with nothing to do. They all seemed to want to be busy but the fact that too many people were working made me feel a bit overwhelmed. There is such a thing as over service.

The appetizer crab cake that I ordered was ill seasoned and under preparred. Not to mention that I actually had some type of shell that I bit down upon and got stuck in my gums. (yuck) Needless to say I was losing my appetite quickly. Then there was of course a long pause before the entrees actually arrived. The dish that I ordered was surprisingly flavorless. The fish was supposed to be moist and light and delicious. It was bland, dry and overcooked. Needless to say I was not expecting anything to be done. However, the manager did come over and appologize and offered me something else. I kindly declined only to be pushed into getting something else. I still kindly declined and said I was no longer hungry. So we sat there for about 10 minutes before the server automatically brought out a dessert I neither asked for nor wanted. He kept trying to tell me I would like it if I only tried it.

I understand that they tried, but there is such a thing as trying too hard and improperly. Then, to end my lovely evening, the dish which I did not eat was still on the check! I decided to stay quiet this time and just pay.

Decided to do the ""Tasting Whole Menu"" for $65, which was a bit misleading because when it came to dessert, we were told to only choose one of the two.

I didn't like that Tasting Menu for multiple people came on shared plates instead of per person plating.

The menu is very inventive and not your typical Asian fusion dining. In general, all the food was delicious, with the meat dishes being fantastic!

My favorites were the:
1. Pork jowl, doenjang, heirloom carrot, fingerling potato, lotus root, perilla, yuzu, gochujang: Very thick cut of jowl grilled with some charring on top, which I appreciated as the char added a bit of extra flavor.

2. Duck breast, duck confit, foie gras, mandoo, duck jus, persimmon, red chili, hazelnut, cauliflower puree: The duck breast was perfectly cooked, flavourful and went so well with the sauce.

The concept is a simple. Pick a cookie, brownie or glazed donut for the 'bread' of your sandwich (you can also pick a cookie/brownie combo - no one initially told me this). Then pick your ice cream. You can also split flavors there (again I made this gem of a discovery on my own). Personally, I like the chocolate chip cookies, with half strawberry cheesecake ice cream and half cookie dough ice cream. Lastly, you pick your topping (for me, it is Fruity Pebbles for life). Once your sandwich is in your possession, you take your IG photo(s) and grub. 

It's definitely legit. My first visit, I chuckled as there were 4 Coldstone employees in line in front of me. Kind of like seeing 4 Burger King employees in line at McD's.

Especially since it is pretty much connected and right next door to the convention center it's hard to avoid. From it's days as the original Las Vegas Hilton to it's current incarnation as the LVH there is still not much for me here to really embellish on or recommend. It's one of the most boring casino properties in Vegas.

When I was here a few weeks ago I did notice some things in the casino area and bar areas had been redecorated, with a bunch of new digital slots machines on the floor, but it still has an empty drab feel to it. They used to house the Star Trek Experience here and had a space age casino designed and dedicated to it, but that is long gone and yet the shell of the casino still remains. It looks kind of weird and unfinished. The regular main casino floor is large enough with a good amount of table games along with a decently sized sports book, but there is no buzz here at all. It's like this place is still stuck in the 80's and the new regime here has it stuck in neutral. 

The times I have stayed here overnight were no big shakes either. The rooms are big enough but kind of plain. Clean but nothing to write home about. Along those lines the restaurants here are a total snoozefest. Benihana is their ""high end"" eatery - haha! Along with a lame Asian place and an even blander buffet it seems the best option to eat is their Paradise diner/cafe. Don't even ask about the almost non-existant nightlife here. The one big plus is that the monorail is close by to jump on and head to the strip with it's multitude of casino's and entertainment options.

It seems that the LVH is around mainly for convention travelers with it's convenience next to the convention center, and is normally the home base for many of the attendees and exhibitors. Still, why stay here when there are so many options along the strip in the same price point and a state of the art monorail system that can easily bring you back and forth within minutes?",2012-05-04 03:28:38

Service

The busser was very attentive and kept our salsa, chips and water filled. Our server probably could've used a little more personality (he just seemed tired), but really he was doing his job and didn't mess anything up - so no problem here. 

Menu

The guacamole was excellent, although a little overpriced. 

They offer an a la carte menu as well if you don't want sides, which I think is fair. 

Our food came out quickly and it was tasty - we ordered chimichangas. I don't eat food with lard in it (i.e. the refried beans), so I had a side of whole beans which were flavorful. 

We left feeling full and satisfied. 

Atmosphere

Like a time we came here recently, it took us a while to get seated. There wasn't anyone actually standing at the host/hostess stand when we came in, and it felt a bit awkward. We waited about five minutes until we were acknowledged and seated. 

The restaurant is huge - and feels a little uneasy when you walk in to a room full of empty chairs. There were probably 3 other families in our section and we felt like we had the room to ourselves - at dinnertime on a Saturday night. Unfortunately this might make people feel uneasy that it isn't a good restaurant - but really-  the food - at least the food we've had-  is excellent. 

My advice: section off the restaurant and only seat patrons in one or two areas. I think that'll help make the atmosphere feel fuller and more welcoming.  

Finally, the mariachi band was lovely. There's a nice little stage in the middle of the dining area where they play.

Is it the best restaurant in town, no, but who doesn't want to ride a bull after dinner?  Add the fact that they have an amazingly friendly staff and I'll go ahead and throw out that 5th star.

I've been here a couple times, but never wrote a review.  It was always for an event, so I didn't know if my experience was a genuine experience.  It is the epicenter, so expect a diverse crowd.  A general mix of what Charlotte and the surrounding area is, eclectic to say the least.

On to the food.  I was surprised, like REALLY surprised.  I expected normal bar food.  I think it might just be a current special, but they have these little potato cake things, kind of a latke meets hashbrowns maybe?  Obviously fresh made and then they cover them with a gravy and scallions.  Friggin delcious!  Thanks to a heads up from Nikki W.(not the CM one) I ordered up some buffalo dip with chicken that was a great way to get some wing flavor without all the mess.  I had a cute date and was trying to show some manners.

What really gave it the 5th star was the service though.  Although quite young, our server seemed to have an attentive smiling face seemingly no matter what else was going on.  Plus, the manager on duty, a dark haired, smiling, young lady even came over to ask how everything was.  Not something you normally see in a bar situation.

As far as the decor goes, there is a mechanical bull, what else could you ask for.  Lava lamps all over one of the bars?  Cowhide on the back of the barstools?  Does it all work?  Thats up to you I guess, but it gave me plenty to look at.

I don't know that this will be my first choice in bars in Charlotte, but it will always be there as an option, especially when entertaining out of towners.  There's a non-chain feel to the place that is hard to come by these days.",2015-12-10 19:17:05

Was looking forward to my visit, which was encouraged only because of a one direction movie.  Only certain theaters and locations had this movie and anyone with a tween understands ""the need"" to see this movie.

So...I suppose I have been spoiled by Harkins.  Guess what, popcorn and sodas dont cost an arm and a let at Harkins and I now remember why I dont go to AMC.  If you have the loyalty cup drinks are only 1.50 at Harkins and popcorn is basically free after you purchase the tshirt....which is $20 bucks and lasts a year.  While at AMC, I purchased 2 soft pretzels and 2 drinks and it cost $25.- and the pretzels was stale and burnt. I also noticed on the menu a deal for chicken nuggets, fries and a drink= $18.50 .   CRAZY   this might all be normal or average but I prefer my 1.50 (2.50 if I upgrade to the refillable popcorn) snack bar bill.

Ok enough about the food :)   

While in the theater, keep in mind this was a One Direction Concert Movie, the audience was all young screaming girls (and assorted moms-along for the ride).    During the movie, which was basically a concert on film, a particular song played that typically calls for everyone getting their phones out -flashlight mode and the sway above the head thing...you know- just like at concerts.  I was beyond SHOCKED when  and employee came and told anyone (basically everyone) that had their phone out to put them away or they would be kicked out of the theater.  I was with 4 tweens and they were actually scared by the threat.  EVERYONE was doing this and it in no way ruined the movie experience.  A fellow mom I was with went to management and she was told that only people who were filming the movie were told to put them away....ummmm not true.  I saw my group of tweens being told and not one of them was filming the movie.  

I guess I would say to AMC, I get it- normally, but in this circumstance- really??  

Tickets for this limited engagement cost me $34 plus the $25 for food.....

Within 2-3 minutes of telling them what I was looking for, I was at the register paying for it.

As it was explained adamantly by my waiter , it is a global fusion that brings together the flavors of Japan, Thailand, Chinese and American cuisine ( I guess that meant no Pu-Pu platter for two). With our no Chinese food explanation at the fore front of our minds Simone and I set upon the task of looking over the not so Chinese menu.  All items on the menu are meant to be eaten family style and shared -much like in China (oops). At the suggestion of our waiter we started our fusion journey with the not Chinese Beef and Scallion Dumplings. The dumplings were soft and pillow like, filled with minced tender beef and chopped scallions and served with a micro green salad on top and of a pool of spicy sauce. Alone, they were bland but eating them in a 5 alarm pool of soy, ginger chili sauce took care of that problem nicely. After downing an entire glass of water to ease the fiery pain , we then decided to choose our entree. 
Our entree choice was the not Japanese Sake Marinated Drunken Chicken, served with a sweet Hoison laced Ponzu sauce and Bok Choy slaw with crispy onions, and for our side a not Chinese Duck Fried Rice.  The chicken arrived whole, but already cut for our convenience. It was excellent,  the sweet Sake marinade combined with the natural juices of the chicken kept every bite moist and full of intense flavor. The slaw was crunchy and vinegary and was a nice compliment to the dish. The side of duck fried rice was good also. The rice was very lightly fried with sesame and soy but not overwhelming in salt or oil. The shredded duck was rather dry, but the overall flavor of the rice was very good. We finished the entire bird and rice and still had some room for Deep Fried Cheesecake for dessert. Cream Cheese filled fried wontons arrived with  a five spice chocolate dipping sauce, assorted fruit and Mango Raspberry puree. The chocolate was rich and spicy with ginger overtones, and the Mango puree was fresh and sweet.. Both were great with the wontons.

We enjoyed their fish tacos. It was good portion size and the fish was fresh. The fish was battered and fried nicely that it was not dry or too oily. The slaw was crunchy which gave the tacos a good texture. Only thing to complain about is there was barely any pico di gallo on our tacos. 

We tried their truffle oil mac n cheese because we heard good things about it. Lightly breaded on top and you can distinctly taste the truffle oil in the mac n cheese. It was aromatic and had great flavours. They used penne for the mac n cheese and it was a little bit undercooked.

Their pulled pork burger was ok, not amazing. It was good portion size. Their fries were also ok. 

For dessert we ordered a strawberry donut. It tasted like a donut that has been out for too long, covered in whip cream and drizzled with strawberry syrup..... would not recommend this and not worth it.

There are many products here that you just can't find anywhere else and so I keep coming back.  Clothing is a hit and miss, but if you see something you think you might like...

It's heavy with ingredients which I think many people may like. So you get lots of meat or veggies but dough not so much.

So it's not for me, I tried a slice & pop $7 which I think is reasonable considering the amount of ingredients in a slice. The crust surprisingly holds up and you could pick it up and bite it.

I was stationed at Luke AFB and my boss out there was friends with the gentleman who owned the place and his wife, who was from Thailand.  It was my first exposure to the joys and wonders of Thai food and I have been hooked every since. Sadly, I did not go back after my friend left Luke and it was over 25 years since I last stepped foot into the place.  I have eaten at several other places which were mediocre at best, and I said many times to my family, ""You know, we should go to the Siam"".  We did not, only because it is a bit of a drive.  I went back last night.  WHY DID I STAY AWAY SO LONG!!  It has not changed from the way I remember it.  The service was first class, the food was out in less than 15 minutes, piping hot and was by far THE BEST Thai food I have had outside of Thailand - I have been in Thailand several times and eaten off the street vendors. The egg rolls were crispy and fresh and tasty and hot.   I had Thai spicy rice noodles with fresh basil and the flavor was amazing, it was fresh and dripping with flavors.  My son had the pad Thai and was in love.  The portions were large, and for two of us with full bellies it was $26 and some change.  I will be taking my wife there really soon.

We came in around lunch time. it wasn't busy at all, there were 3 tables in the whole restaurant. I think it was slow because it was cinco de mayo, and who eats KBBQ at lunch ?! I DO !! 

We were greeted by the hostess, and got seated quickly. Our server, Dabin was awesome! It was our first time there, she showed us recommendations, from the meats to the drinks. and we took it all. Everything was delicious! We don't cook the meat, the server does.. so I feel like it's a hard job to keep conversations with the table for a period of time, but Dabin did fantastic! It wasn't awkward at all! 
One thing I didn't like was the brisket.. maybe we kept it on the fire for too long, it didn't have flavor and it was dry. It's also the thinnest meat you can get. Probably won't get that again. 

I can't even remember the drinks that we had .. but it was a smooth sake and Korean beer and another beer my boyfriend got. It goes hand in hand while eating Korean food ! And the beer and sake goes well together ! They didn't have the actual beer that my boyfriend wanted.. but he liked what he had.

I've been to the Queen St location and the Yonge location, and both were good. The service at Queen St I find a bit better, but both are good. I like the set up at Queen St better as it's more open and you can see the street, but neither one is bad.

The All You Can Eat option is the way to go, without a doubt! The ribs, sausage, and more ribs are the best of the meats. Chicken is good, but takes too long to cook. Beef is also good when doused in the soy sauce seasoning. Arrives with a bunch of small side dishes which are tasty as well. The potatoes are one of the better options as is the tofu. After a few rounds (and that's probably where you should stop anyhow), it's time to change the grill as it gets pretty charred. Staff take care of this on the spot.

One of the things I like better about KGH is the fact that unlike other AYCE places, they don't stop bringing you food until you tell them to. For me, that's a huge bonus as it always irks me when you're wanting one more plate and they wait until it's too late.The price is also a plus. Not too bad for a dinner of good food. Important to keep the bowls of white rice on the table as the shear volume of grease you have on the go will make it the only thing between you and an inevitable coronary.

Soda is unlimited refills and beer is a good price.

1.Got the Philadelphia roll, minus the salmon , add shrimp. It was soooooooo good. I never thought id ever get to order a philly roll cause most have stuff I cannot eat.
2.Whats your name roll. FANTASTIC!!  so spicy and good, Double soft shell crab!
3.Avocado roll.. So beautiful. The most avocado I have ever had in an avocado roll.
4. cucumber and creamcheese roll. So cute! and just 1.95! Thats crazy! Thats how it should be!
5.some nigiri- octopus and shrimp. Both fresh and fantastic, the octopus was cut nice and thick.

It was April 2-2014 around 7pm.

So we came for lunch a few days later.

First, there is very little seating.  Be prepared to carry out.  We arrived five minutes before the place filled, so we got a table.  We ordered two different empanadas, two different soups, and then got the chocolate dessert empanada.

First the ""cubano"".  That empanada was really good.  It comes with an orange sauce that clearly has mustard in it, but also some other stuff.  I don't like mustard, but the other stuff made it OK.  It works with the cubano, but you don't need it.  The cubano is very tasty all by itself.  I probably ate half with the sauce and half plain.

Then the green chile pork empanada...it comes with a green chile sauce.  It needs it.  Without that sauce it's just pork.  It's good pork, but nothing special.  Add the sauce and it's pretty good.

My soup was the minestrone.  Here is where they fall down.  It was not very flavorful at all.  I still haven't managed to place the smell...like dishwater maybe?  Dunno.  Not very appetizing.  The soup itself had lots of vegetables in it, and was certainly edible.  But the lack of flavor was very disappointing.  The broth was almost clear, also.  Which is odd for minestrone.

They other soup ordered was the Yucatan pork stew.  It was good.  I know this better as pozole.  It tasted exactly like pozole.  Which is fine.  But I'm not sure why they didn't just call it pozole.

The chocolate creme empanada was fine.  A reasonable amount of chocolate in there.  Hard to go wrong with chocolate.

I want to give them four stars.  I really do.  The empanadas were tasty, though the pork one had to have its sauce.  The crusts were light and flaky.  Good.  The minestrone was definitely 2 stars, the pozole was three.  They just didn't ""wow"" me enough to go to four stars.  Maybe 3.5, but Yelp won't let me do that.

I can see coming back if we want some empanadas.  They sell them frozen to take home.  We'd probably do that.  The breakfast empanadas look intriguing, but as we didn't order any I can't comment on them beyond that.",2016-07-17 00:52:20

Spicy TanTan with extra pork belly is by far the best I've ever tasted! My boyfriend and I were craving a spicy, warm bowl of ramen and a bunch of our friends always mentioned this place!

Had to try the Chicken karaage for starters and it was OK, nothing special. It was full of flavor but the crispy texture wasn't there. 

The spicy TanTan on the other hand is out of this world!!!! Mind you this is limited throughout the day. We were so happy when they said they still had some. We added an extra pork belly! This ramen bowl is perfection! Right amount of spice, and saltiness, not over powering... The vegetables were tasty and soaked with the golden broth, the pork belly is hella tender, the eggs were cooked perfectly. I still dream about this ramen! I usually don't finish my bowl of ramen but I cleaned this bowl out!!!

They don't have the LLBO licence and according to them should have it by the weekend. The outdoor seating area is huge and it lies in front of their old store.
Service was great and the server took his time explaining the menu.
I wanted to try oysters as its Diana's after all a name synonymous with good oysters in Toronto.
I ordered half dozen and let the server pick  them for me while I waited for my Yelp Eating Buddy (YEB) We had 2 Kusshi, Lucky Lime and Cotuit. There were 3 kind of accompaniments hot sauce, cocktail and Mennonite.
I am more of purists so just dabbed them condiments a little bit on 3 oysters just to try them and rest I ate with lemon juice and horse radish.Condiments were good too.
All the oysters were fresh and were close to perfection
Kusshi really stood out. 
So far 5 Stars for the oysters.
By this time my YEB had arrived and she ordered the same set for herself. She liked them as well and she is a connoisseur of oysters. 
For mains I ordered the lobster club and she went with the halibut sandwich. They arrived shortly. The sandwiches looked good. The Halibut was actually quite big. We split half and half so could try both items.
Lobster Sandwich was OK  with meat being great and sustaining the delicate flavour of lobster meat. The bread to meat ratio was off overall 3 stars
Halibut sandwich was good. Nice ratio for bread and meat, this sandwich is done just right (pan fried to perfection)
Negative so far was the side of Salad that YEB ordered and the fries were your run of the mill stuff. 
This is a bit of odd location for this kind of restaurant but I am sure it will get traffic when people get the wind of it.
4 Stars over all and 5 Stars if you want to try Oysters.
Wine list is ok with some wines in the 30$+  for the bottle and available by glass. Some in the 50+ range. I can't comment on the selection as I have to try them first.  
I will be back again for oysters.",2011-08-31 21:44:03

I made a reservation for 5PM on a Friday night weeks in advance, and hoped that we would be in and out in less than an hour and a half as we had a Raptors game to go to at 7. 

As soon as we stepped through the door, we were greeted warmly and led to our seat. Our server came over and asked us if it was our first time at Buca and offered us suggestions and recommendations for our meal. Their menu is designed ""sharing-style"" which to me basically means that portion sizes are smaller and they want you to order more. I decided to order on behalf of both of us, and settled on Nodini (bread knots) and Parmiagiana di Melanzane (a take on eggplant parmesan) to start, followed by a meat pizza (for him) and a vegetarian pasta dish (for me) as our mains (which I believe was eggplant ravioli, although my memory seems to fail me now). 

Our apps came out fairly promptly - I thought the Nodini was good, but not spectacular; the real standout was the eggplant which was incredible and I wish that I could eat every single day of my life. After the apps came the pizza...and then we waited...and waited...and waited. Apparently our server had assumed that we would be sharing both the pizza and the pasta and told the kitchen not to fire the pasta yet. When we informed him of his error he was EXTREMELY apologetic (I think he actually came over on 5 separate occasions to apologize) and the pasta came out shortly after. We were even offered a complimentary dessert to make up for the misunderstanding! We were offered a choice of chocolatey or fruity, and after emphatically requesting something rich and chocolatey, we were brought over Buca's Tiramisu, which was really fantastic. I'm no Tiramisu connoisseur, but it was hands-down the best Tiramisu I've ever tasted. In fact, the flavour profiles of everything we ate during our meal was really spot-on, and I was quite pleased with the food. 

Not only was the food great, the service was also very good - water glasses always topped up, etc. Our server wasn't exactly the warmest or friendliest, but was efficient and did his job well. As one reviewer already mentioned, the leather aprons the servers wear seem a bit strange, and at one point I looked over and there was a line of servers standing in a row in front of the kitchen just staring out at the diners, which was a little creepy...

Anyway, Buca is on the pricier end as far as restaurants go, but a lovely special occasion restaurant - I hope to be back soon!

We arrived at about 4:30 pm, and most tables were empty. There is no cover charge or fee - you only have to purchase something and then can sit there for as long as you want. There's no time limit for the table. We purchased a latte, a fruity tea (free water refills) and the Japanese popcorn. The prices on the coffees were quite reasonable, but I thought $3 for tea was pretty steep (haha). I didn't mind at all though, since there is no cover charge - they have to make money somehow!

We sat down at a booth with a TV. We first played a few board games, but then got the Wii hooked up and played Mario Kart (soooo fun). They have a great selection of board games, video game consoles and video games. The staff come to the table and set up the gaming console for you. We also played Mario Party, and had so much fun. I thought the price was REALLY reasonable for the amount of time we spent there and the amount of fun we had. We will definitely be back. 

A few things to note. One thing I really like about Snakes + Lattes that Riddle Room lacks, is someone coming around to explain the games to you or recommend a game. This isn't the end of the world, considering the difference in price, but just something to note. I also wish there was better selection of snacks. They have paninis, chips and popcorn and that's it. It would be nice if there were more easy food options. It was also quite cold by the end of our playing time since the front door was open.

hESedhEKvz6_uPCMcySJgg,yoF8kxQTH4qCDijyKMm1KA,fJtjIiT8nW3rnC1GMVA68g,3,3,0,1,"Was in the mood to try something new and different for lunch on Sunday, so decided to check out what was new on Yelp and that is where I came across a place called ""Island Thyme - A Calypso Grill & Pub"".  Hmmm, I thought, how timely, given that I will be heading to the Caribbean next week, and one of my most favorite things about traveling there is the amazing food I get to sample on the islands.  Given the fact that the place noted on their website that they are locally and family owned, I considered that a huge plus as I am always looking to support original places, as while I am not anti-franchise, I enjoy the variety and diversity that local original concepts offer, especially here in South Charlotte where that can be lacking at times.

In terms of location, you really have to be looking for it to find it, as it is located in the back section of the Fountains at Ardrey Kell.  The actual location is in the spot that I personally consider the Bermuda Triangle of restaurants as I am pretty sure that 4 or 5 other places have failed to last more than a year or two in this very same spot.

Outside, the decor definitely tries to give off that island vibe as all the expected accompaniments can be found including porch chairs, colorful signage and even a tropical feel cornhole set which is a nice touch.  Plenty of outdoor seating is available, but no awnings at present to keep the sun out of your eyes, so probably best to choose inside unless you are dining later in the evening, although I should point out that they close at 7pm on Sundays and at 10pm during the week and on the weekends, which is disappointing considering they have a full bar and could potentially be a fun spot to have a few drinks on a Friday or Saturday night.

Started off with a Pina Colada which was not good at all as it was very heavy on the pineapple juice to the point of being orange in color.  No coconut flavor at all even after I pointed out that the drink was very heavy on the juice.  Menu says it is made with rum, cream of coconut and pineapple juice, but unfortunately it tasted like an $8 dollar glass of Dole, so was very disappointed especially considering the ""island theme"" of the restaurant.  Strawberry Mojito was similarly disappointing as it tasted more of Strawberry juice/syrup than anything else, although I do give them credit for the use of fresh mint, as many places these days seem to think that Mint is an optional ingredient in Mojitos, so kudos for not skimping on the mint.  Again however, for $8, it is disappointing to have a drink taste like fruit juice as even the mint couldn't save this one.

As far as the food goes, some hits and some misses...  

The jerk chicken was very good with an authentic Jamaican jerk flavor and nice spice level throughout, so definitely a nice job there in terms of overall presentation.  

The Yucca fries on the other hand were not good at all, as they were too reliant on breading instead of letting the natural flavor shine through.  Yucca is a very underrated side in my opinion as it has some health benefits and a great flavor, but lathering on the breading makes it just like any other ""fry"" in my opinion.  I think the Yucca would be much better served in it's natural state vs the breaded and fried route, as the wonderful flavor of Yucca is enough to stand out on it's own without a bunch of breading.

The Crab Cake Sandwich had an abundance of crab meat inside which was a pleasant surprise as far too often, places rely on a large amount of filler, but no so here, so nice job in that respect.  Unfortunately, again the breading is the culprit, as the heavy reliance on Panko breading actually takes away from the flavor of the crab meat and takes the sandwich down a notch, whereas if a different lighter type of breading were used, this sandwich could have really stood out as the crab meat tasted very fresh.

The West Indies BBQ Shrimp was served in a sauce that the server described as sweet with some heat, but unfortunately the sauce was underwhelming to say the least, but the shrimp were very fresh and juicy, as I could tell that they take their commitment to fresh seafood seriously, which will definitely serve them well moving forward.  

Overall, as much as I want to support local establishments, I also am aware that there are way too many other options out there to just give a place a pass simply because they are not a franchise.  The drinks were not good at all and the food was ok, but at the price points charged, weren't really a great value, although the jerk chicken was very good and worth giving a try if you have never experienced it before.  I would probably be willing to give it another shot, but wouldn't go out of my way as we have so many restaurants here in South Charlotte that a new place really needs to differentiate itself more than just in name only to get added to the rotation.  With all that said, I really hope they succeed as variety is the spice of life.",2018-07-29 17:32:15

This place is the real deal and a must-go!  They have a little burger form (best form you'll ever fill out) with the biggest variety of sauces/patties/freebies/additions/anything you could ever want.  My perfect burger:
- a brioche bun 
- an angel dust rub on my beef (salt/pepper)
- arugula (they have at least 3 diff spins on typical lettuce-iceberg, arugula, romaine, etc)
- tomato
- bacon
- fried egg
- guacamole
+ crispy homemade potato chips (and bbq flavored too)

This was a very tall glass of burger.  You can also have it different ways as my other friends did - topless ( no bun on top), full monty (no bun at all), or with a salad (healthy!).  The chips were perfect, crispy, warm, and flavorful.

Shabu means Shabu Shabu (or hot pot). Congbul () means bean sprout cooking. Shabu Shabu is not hard to find in the GTA, but this is the ONLY place to get Congbul so that's what we got. Looking at what other tables got, we were pretty happy we found this place. 

Congbul is basically lots of bean sprouts+ your choice of toppings. You can have bean sprouts + pork, or bean sprouts + seafood. We went with the pork. When the order comes, you'll notice that it looks really big, but don't worry, bean sprout is mostly made of water. It'll shrink as it gets cooked. If you don't know how to cook, don't worry, one of the severs will help you. 

In terms of taste, this is a spicy dish (looks red). I like it. Price wise, it was about $10 per serving + tax and tip so it ended up under $30 for 2 people. Pretty good as we were full afterwards. The best part is that this is a very healthy way of cooking. Bean sprouts are healthy and you're cooking without oil. 

I looked at their menu. If you want more mainstream Korean foods like stone pot rice or cold noodles, they have those too. But if you come to this place for the first time, I insist that you try congbul as it's the ONLY restaurant I know that serves this.",2012-11-19 01:04:45

While I appreciate the novelty of vegan ice cream (which, most store bought brands are better) with various mix-ins, and vegan baked goods, there is a lot to complain about.

Their facebook touts Hot Fudge Sundays in which affogatos and hot fudge sundaes are $2. We went there and asked for a hot fudge sundae and were met with confusion by the barista who brought over the other girl who explained that they ""do not have sundaes but we can put hot fudge on an ice cream cup."" 

What? Is that not a sundae?! Did you not have this posted on your facebook as a special? They're doing a poor job of making their staff aware. 

Additionally, the more I get tsoynamis, the more they're screwed up. They often will leave out ingredients or sometimes change them completely.

O1yZakD9fU1OPuhFKUiVvQ,9OofA8DV80h2ykCVQmb5cg,XgRljuEUyaHBKIpIz-PRAA,5,0,0,0,"""GREAT burger but overpriced for a small portion. Load up on the side of fries if you're looking to be full(er). 5-star for flavor, 3-star for price to portion"" 

You order at the counter and there are a variety of burger options (for vegetarians and omnivores) although some additional toppings are limited for vegetarians (i.e. The Seoul burger which has bacon fries kimchi and no option to remove the bacon). I got the Quinoa Black Bean Veggie Burger with a side of the Quinoa salad. 

Everything about the burger is amazing. The sauce is on point with the cheese and the sweetened pickles adds a nice flavor to it. The BUN is the best part! It's so soft and fluffy. No complaints at all on how it tasted. Not too salty either. 

I'd say the only downside is that for $9.5 you get a burger the size of your fist. It's small...and at Cowbells you can definitely get larger portions for about the same price. I'm not sure why it's that expensive for a veggie burger (not using organic ingredients either) but would consider lowering the price. I hesitate on giving it a 4-star because it's just so good. 5-star for the flavor, 3-star for the price to portion ratio.",2016-03-11 19:27:42

However after being to Japan this is authentic Japanese comfort food think Dennys for us, this is for them.  It is a no frills reasonably priced, hearty meal, good flavors for what it is.  However it is a bit to basic for me.  If you are a Japanese curry fan then this is a must it is authentic I however do not prefer it.  This place reminded me of my trip, which I enjoyed but I enjoy more seasoning, flavor and spice.  The specialty drink is a refreshing Yuzu Soda quite good may go back for that.

The decor is awesome and as another reviewer said earlier it reminded me of sitting at a cafe on a side street of Tokyo.  The service was quick and pleasant the bill reasonable.

I've tried the teriyaki bowl and it was mediocre... I guess for the price it wasn't bad, but the overall taste was bland. Seems like I could have gotten the same food quality from a microwavable teriyaki dinner. 

I think the boba is above average, if that. I always get the coconut milk tea with boba. It's really cheap in comparison to other boba places where their small sizes are the same prices as the HUGE size you get at BeeGee, though the milk tea is a bit watered down. Really I keep going here because it's a pit stop before heading to work and the drive-thru makes it very convenient to satisfy my boba cravings on the go.

I'm not quite sure what to say about service. They aren't really friendly, but they've never been rude either.

Here are the highlights because just about everything to say has already been said on here:

* Tuna Tartar - very good 
* Caesar Salad - excellent and enough to share 
* Ribeye - this was probably the best ribeye I've ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and wasn't too fatty.

The only negatives of this place are the sides.  They are small, over-priced for their size, and not memorable at all.  Next time I'm going to try the french fries and/or the mashed potatoes.

* Gnocchi - the gnocchi themselves were excellent, but the sauce was just eh.  It was just a regular pasta sauce it seemed like
* Maccaroni - not good at all.  They used weird cheese and big pieces of ham or something.
* Potato Gratin  - just eh
* Carrots and Asparagus -  these 2 sides were very good and I would order them again.

I contacted them and three other companies on the museum's list of preferred caterers, and they beat the competition. They responded to my request and sent several sample menus with pricing. Their per person cost was higher than Fabulous Food, but the total cost was a good $2,000 lower. That's because they don't add on additional fees for labor, setup, etc.

Lauren was a joy to work with. She responded to all my questions professionally and in a timely manner. She was patient with me through multiple menu changes. They even let us customize the menu with our own recipes. In the final walkthrough, Lauren thought of several details and clearly had a vision of what needed to happen. She helped brainstorm clever ways to keep rental costs down. I felt like she was on our side throughout the whole process.

The tasting we attended was a group tasting at the Tempe Center for the Arts. That meant we didn't get to try the food on our exact menu, but it was a sampling of what they provide. We weren't all that impressed with the tasting--it tasted like pretty standard catering fare--but the food at the actual wedding was amazing. The stuffed chicken breast with spinach and fontina was divine.  The presentation was beautiful (see photo of the buffet), and the staff were very accommodating. At the reception my dad and I decided to give the leftovers to Meals on Wheels, and they were happy to make the switch.

When we arrived, Olivier took the time to explain to us the menu and answered any questions that we have.  He is one of the friendliest and most hospitable owner I have ever encountered.  Olivier and the staff provided exceptional service.

I went with a heavenly cup of cream of potato infused w prosciutto ham and truffle oil and a delectable 1/2 a brie chicken pannini.  My boyfriend had the hearty quiche, which came with a side of refreshing salad.  We went with the 24 oz green tea infused with citrus, in which we intended to share, but were pleasantly surprise that staff had divided the tea into two smaller cups, with lovely curly straw wrapper around the straw.  Ok, some of you might say ""who cares"" for the curly straw wrapper, but let me tell you...it was simple yet intricate, portrays how detailed, innovative and creative the team at Baguette Cafe is.  After seeing that creativity, sipping the tea was truly an ""aaahhhaaa"" moment.  My goodness it was so refreshingly yummy, even w/o sugar!

Knowing that I will be full on lunch, I asked for the chocolate torte to-go, and Olivier made sure that I am not to pick it up until I am ready to leave because it should be refrigerated until ready to be consumed.  Another instance to show how much Olivier care about his customer...food/dessert at the right temperature, right texture, so that they be at their best when eaten.  I was debating between the chocolate au pain crossaint and the chocolate torte, but right when Olivier said that the chocolate torte is the prefer choice for the chocolate connoisseur, I had to pick that dessert.   

My plan was to taste a bit of it when I get home and save it for later, but those bits added up and next thing you know, I devoured it along with the chocolate au pain crossaint (that's right, after seeing my big googly eyes staring down the crossaint and the torte, finally choosing the latter, Olivier surprised me with the crossaint).

I will be back to try many other items on the menu.  Awesome food, Awesome owner, Awesome staff =5 Stars!  Highly recommend!

What's most admirable about the brewery is that it hosts an annual charity BBQ to raise funds for the Franklin Horner Community Centre, an organization that provides programs for residents in Etobicoke.  

One more thing to mention is that it also holds ""Food Trust Fridays"" for lunch in the summer, with a different vendor every week. You can buy lunch and a beer and sit outside on one of the picnic tables!",2016-08-16 14:32:58

My first time there was ok but it's pretty expensive, especially if you want the disc with all the photos. However, even if you have a great photo session or a terrible one with hardly any photos the price of the disc is still the same. So I would always suggest checking their website or groupon for promos to save a bit.

My most recent visit was just two Friday's ago, I made an appointment for 12 that day for my 3 boys and my SIL was in town, so we wanted pictures of all 4 of our kiddos together.
I'm glad I was able to use their ""Father's Day"" promo, because we arrived and had to wait 30 min before they got us in for my 12pm appointment & to top it off, we had about a 20 min session and only got about 10 pictures that were decent. If we had been able to start pictures when my appointment was scheduled for, our kids who are 4,2,1 &1 would have been better. But while dealing with toddlers and babies, things need to move quick. Our kids were antsy and were not cooperative once we get in there. I was extremely frustrated about that.

We finished and then had to wait about 20 min to view our pictures on their viewing screens and after we decided what we wanted which was a ""Father's Day 8x10 print for ""free"""", I was able to get the disc for 40% off which it was still $105 before tax and we ordered a sheet of 8 wallets  $12, a sheet of 2 5x7's $12. Well, we ended up waiting another 15-20 min and our kids were so ready to be out of there... One of our kids hit their face on their side table in the sitting area and they didn't care or show any sort of worry for the situation.

We finally get the pics, We finally leave to load the kids up and I compare the pictures to the frames I had for 5x7's and they messed up and gave us 4x6's. I had to go back in and at first the lady tried to take the pictures from me and I flat out said, ""No, this was not my mistake, we had an appointment, we got started late and then hardly got any pictures on my disc that I paid for, I asked for wallets and 5x7 sheet to take home, we waited and waited on y'all and my son even hit his head while we were waiting, so no, for the inconvenience I'm going to keep these and please fix the mistake and get my 5x7's that I paid for.""

She handled it and I only had to wait about 10 more minutes for the reprint...

So now today, I am uploading the disc to my computer so I can email the pictures to my SIL who left back to GA. And we are missing pictures from the session?!!! One in particular was my SIL holding my niece up and get are looking face to face and it was adorable. I'm instantly frustrated and considering calling their HQ about this whole deal, my SIL is upset because she knows how much I spent to get us these pictures and I can definitely say I won't be giving them another chance. It was just one mess up after another and for as much as I spent, I expect better service. 

If you go here, don't be surprised if there are mess ups and pictures missing from your disc you paid over $100 for.",2016-06-26 22:54:55

Love the aesthetic of this downtown lounge. Sexy library. With booze. There were TV's showing Magnum P.I. reruns too. Kinda random, but I love a good mustache any time.

As I mentioned before, it takes awhile for any new spot to get into a groove and the drinks here are no exception - was warned ahead of time not to order anything too crazy. Cranberry and vodka it is! Served up cold and strong, just the way I like it. Bartenders were friendly, too.

Looks like they'll be set up for video poker soon. Not sure if that's really necessary since it seems to be a perfectly lovely spot to hang out without gambling. But hey, I'm not a local, nor a betting woman.

I am admittedly quite picky, you see I've had the real thing in Greece and it was so delicious and effortless that I refuse to settle for fake American alternatives. This is definitely the pinnacle of Greek food in Las Vegas!

This cute little mom and pop shop is spotless. The decor is surprisingly simple with a few Greek finishes. They have the typical menu and are very friendly. I got a traditional beef/lamb gyro and made it a combo to include a greek salad and a drink. The greek salad was delicious. I am not a huge fan of olives and onions, so I gave half of the salad to my husband, but I was sure to clean up the huge chunks of cucumber and a good portion of the lettuce and tomato. 

The gyro was gigantic! The meat and the tzatziki sauce were delicious and complimented perfectly by the soft pita bread and the tomato, feta, and lettuce. I couldn't have been happier. While it definitely looked impossible to eat the entire thing, it was exactly what I did. I cleaned my plate and stole a few of my husband's feta fries. The feta fries have melted feta and herbs and were pretty good, but I have definitely had better. Unfortunately, for the amount of cheese on them they didn't have much flavor at all, in fact I had to dip them in ketchup which seemed like a real shame. The fries were rather thick, perhaps it would have been executed better with shoe string style fries. Other than that, this place is fantastic!

Formerly Shibuya at the MGM, this expansive contemporary restaurant is destination worthy.  I'll let the food do the talking.

The Sushi:  The weakest link but if you must...

Very fresh seafood but just top 20 standards you expect.  Sensible slices, flavor and quality as expected.  the  $100 chef's combination sashimi plate, well presented, perfect for sharing.  Sushi itself uses well seasoned, good quality rice, with good compaction.  Slices are appropriate.  Correctly graded otoro, and tender Japanese wagyu.  Don't expect fancy garnishes.  Don't expect too many strange Vegas rolls.  Bottom line, it won't topple the best sushi restaurants.  Save room for Morimoto's creativity.

Modern Morimoto:  Play with your food...

Morimoto sashimi, a seafood napoleon of hamachi, tuna, fatty salmon, oily anago, and seared toro served with eyedroppers of different sauces (squeeze the contents of the eyedroppers in different parts of the plate and smear the towers of goodness through them.  Without giving anything away, experiment.  Sauces bring out different flavors of the fish in the ""stack"".  Brilliant.

The fatty toro tartare is the canvas atop a glass sheet.  Using ""brushes"" choose to apply wasabi, sour cream, caviar, nori paste, chives, guacamole and bubu arare to it and enjoy.  Fresh and fun.

Oyster foie gras is an incredibly delicious, rich bite.  Barely cooked through oysters, melting foie, creamy uni all bathed in a teriyaki sauce thinned by the oyster's natural jus.  Served in shell, one delicious mouth full.

The 10 hour braised kakuni rivals that served in the best Izakayas of Japan.  Meltingly soft, soy flavors throughout, fat well rendered.  Sits atop a bed of creamy rice porridge that is totally unnecessary.

Teppanyaki:  Reservations made...

Service is surprisingly good considering the newness.  Friendly, efficient, but lacking slightly in confidence.

Very good selection of Japanese whisky, sake, shochu.  Typical Vegas resort pricing.

Excellent addition to the MGM offerings.",2016-11-27 01:06:03

Let me just say, I appreciate any places that offer half price happy hour... it's easy on the wallet and a perfect early dinner option.

I do have a small complaint regarding Kickstand's menu.  They have a very small appetizer section, since they put wings and flatbread in their own categories.  And they don't count soup as appetizer (even though it's listed IN the appetizer section). It is sort of confusing... I don't think straight when I'm hungry you know.

I ordered the sliders (mushroom & swiss).  I love sliders, they look oh-so-adorable, don't they? Better yet, this place has tiny buns that the patties stick out from... all the naked juiciness exposed, calling my name, asking me to ravage them (Is it me or it's hot in here, whew!  Sorry for a little R-rated narration lol).  Back to the sliders... the burger has flavor, the mushroom was plentiful for this size of a burger.  And don't underestimate these little babies, they can be filling.

But just as I ordered the sliders, my eyes wondered to another item called ""fried grits.""  Not being a big grits fan, I overlooked this item at first, but then something caught my eyes... did I see SAUSAGE & SHRIMP & GRAVY!?!  Holy Molly, it has ""Peggy"" written all over that.  So as much as I know I'm over-ordering, I got one of this bad boy and man, it was yummy.  The grits was slightly fried to give just a little crunch.  But it's mostly covered in this savory brown gravy with just a little chopped sausage and 2 shrimps (well... the shrimps were kind of tasteless) and chopped green onions.  It's not a big portion, and I almost picked up the plate to lick it clean.

The service was decent as well.  I sat at the bar, reading my magazine, and the bartender checked on me enough.  I ended up with a bill of just over $10 (after tax, before tips), that also included an ice cold Oktoberfest beer.  May I say Budget Friendly?!",2011-10-04 15:07:13

There were a few large parties upstairs and it was loud - which we like! The one disappointing thing is that they were out of two items we all really wanted to order. One was the polenta fries and the other was the burrata. I hope they stock extra of those ingredients in the future as they are super popular!
We ordered lots of different things to try. Being a vegetarian this isn't the most veggie friendly place but they certainly made accommodations for me. For example, I ordered the salt roasted beets it usually comes on a board but I asked if they could add extra greens and put it in a bowl like a salad. It was really good! 
We ordered:
Frog Legs  - the guys LOVED these - a definite order!
Lamb Stuffed Calamari $16 - sounds so crazy but it was actually calamari stuffed with lamb (3 pieces)
Salt Roasted Beets $9 - made into a salad :)
Lamb Meatballs $14

Roasted Cauliflower $12 - it was a lot of cheese - probably wouldn't order again

It's a nice little spot located on the second floor of the Asian Town Center. I was expecting grill tables (a la Seoul Hot Pot) due to the namesake (Korean BBQ) but was left a little disappointed when not one was in sight. The place was packed to the brim on a Saturday night, and the service was very friendly although not very dependable.

We made reservations but still had to wait about 20 minutes, which wasn't much of an issue since most of our party was late. Our table had a nifty little button on it that allowed us to summon our server. It wasn't as effective as we hoped because it took a while for the server to get to us, but it's nice to know they give customers the ability.  We had a big party so our server was a little confused with our orders and we had to go around a number of times. They also missed one of our orders.

We had a decent array of banchan, most of which tasted very good, but still can't hold a candle to the wide selection Seoul Garden offers.  We started off with ""Gu Man Du"" (fried dumplings), which tasted phenomenal. For the main entree, I ended up ordering Bok Eum (octopus, squid, veggies in a VERY spicy sauce). I was a little disappointed they didn't offer Tteokbokki, which I thought was a traditional dish and figured this would be similar. I will just say that this dish is EXTREMELY spicy with not much other flavor to it at all. I love spicy Korean but if it just feels like I'm putting spoonfuls of red chili paste in my mouth then it's not much of a meal. I was sweating and my mouth was on fire. I wouldn't order it again.

- Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap, which did taste great
- some spicy pork dish I can't remember the name of, but it tasted JUST like my dish except with pork
- noodles in a stir fried black bean paste, which was a bit different to me but accurately prepared according to the one who ordered it and loved it

Overall, I wasn't impressed but didn't think it was too bad. I would go back but I wouldn't be in any rush. They have some menu items that I am interested in trying still, such as their japchae, bulgogi, Korean pancake, and galbi.

I walked into Ticoz with the same perception as everyone else; 'This place is popular because it looks like a cool place to be seen""  And like many places in Phoenix/Scottsdale, the trendy swank restaurants are more hype than substance. I walked in here thinking this is another place that could serve dog shit but if they dress it up with a nice drinks, good looking people and a Crate and Barrel catalog, it will get 5 stars.

So my wife and I chose to eat here in the afternoon when it wasn't busy. We actually ordered food in addition to drinks. I was shocked. The food was actually delicious....not, not good....delicious. The food has a lot of flavor and is well prepared without it being heavy.  At the same time, the food is still well grounded in Mexican ingredients so you are not eating fru frue eclectic dishes that are designed to be different just for the sake of being so.  Therefore, you won't see Octopus tacos with cinammon salsa...no nothing like that.  I had a wondefully slow cooked  pork that was served in a spicy sauce over cheese enchilada.   They have a fresh citrus Paella that is fragrant and flavorful without being too greasy. The margaritas were disappointing. They were strong with no flavor.  It was like drinking lemon flavored tequila.  HOWEVER, the mojitos were out of this world.

Finally, to the reviewer below who had an issue with the gay staff....what were you thinking when you entered the place...that they had a waiter sitting on the bench that they recruited from Black Angus just for people like you?  Would the food and drinks taste better if a dude ""with testicles"" served you?",2008-12-31 06:32:31

I work near their Tempe location, but live near this Scottsdale location, so on Free Salad Day, 25Jun15, I went to 1 location for lunch, and for dinner I went to this location. It was after 7pm, but there was still a line wrapped around the corner.  There were water misters (my hair wasn't happy about that) blowing on the crowd to keep them cool and they also had flavored water dispensers to keep you hydrated in the heat. 
Employees were nice, helpful, and the free-day was a well-organized event. 

I ended up getting the same dish that I had at the other location, because I liked it so much. It was a veganized Don Quixote (and if ONE more person mispronounced his name in that line, I was gonna scream!): baby greens, Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu (instead of meat), roasted corn, avocado (with MAD spice), mango, green onions (instead of cheese), and the Roasted Red Pepper Dressing (instead of the non-vegan creamy ""something"" that came with it).   I ended up saving it for lunch the next day, and I agree with the other Yelper about the wilting greens.  It was definitely soupy the next day, but it had been swimming in dressing (plus, I requested a lot of dressing) 16 hours so I won't complain.  Everything was still tasty the next day, and the avocados were still green (you know an avocado will turn on you quickly).  

VEGANS:
For protein options, they have...

1 - Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu - These are chunks of firm tofu (with a slight squish factor), but the taste is excellent (and I am no tofu fan). I was told that they marinate their organic tofu for 24 hours; this is what gives it such great flavor.

2 - Grilled Portobellos (if mushrooms are your thang).

3 - Warm Quinoa.

There are lots of fruits, veggies, and nuts as well. 

Avoid the Paninis! The bread is not vegan (their sourdough bread contains whey).

VEGAN SALAD DRESSINGS - There is a print out by the dressings which shows you which ones are vegan. Note: if it says ""Vegan*"" -WITH an asterisk sign, that means the dressing has honey. Pure vegan dressings will not have the asterisk. I suggest checking out their online interactive ""allergen"" menu; you can click everything that you want to omit and they'll produce a qualifying list of items. You can then click on each to see exactly what ingredients are used. Know before you go! (The Balsamic Vinaigrette, Sherry Molasses Vinaigrette, and Roasted Red Pepper are among the pure vegan options.)

Lastly, keep your eyes on your bowl as they add ingredients.  I told the guy at the cash register that I was vegan so I'd be swapping non-vegan items for vegan items in my salad.  I watched the girl and as soon as I saw her go for the cheese I started waving my hands profusely and saying, ""No, no NO!"" Too late. Cheese in the bowl.  ""I told him vegan..."" I said with a sad face. She was like, ""No worries."" She tossed that bowl, told cashier-guy what he should add to the ticket for vegans, then she got me a brand new bowl and re-made my salad.  No attitude. No bother.  THAT was refreshing. 

I don't always want to eat a salad, but when I do, I'll think of MAD Greens!",2015-06-27 17:58:58

The pineapple drink came inside an actual pineapple. If you want a refill of this drink, it's 25% cheaper. It's better to share one drink and then get a refill. 

As for the food, we took the shrimps wrapped in noodles as an appetizer. It was crunchy and delicious. For the main, we tried the red curry with seafood and some spicy pork. Both were ok but if you're used to eating spicy stuff, it's not really spicy. The waiter warned us about how spicy the food is and to be careful but I was a bit disappointed. Look for the pepper signs. 

For us spicy food lover:
1 pepper: nothing at all. Just sweet. 
2 peppers: ok i feel some tingle...
3 peppers and more: yeah ok now we're talking

The service is awesome. The bartender was very friendly and nice and gave us a free shot for waiting. The deco is dark but perfect for hanging out.

It's a little stall with no seating, run by the cutest little elderly couple (at least when I was there today.) 

They have a pretty extensive menu with drinks and shakes, but the main thing that draws people here is their soft serve, which can be topped with a variety of things. They offer the ice cream in two flavours - Japanese green tea, and tiffany vanilla, which is a beautiful tiffany blue colour but apparently just tastes like plain old vanilla. You can also get a twist version which is a mixture of the two flavours.

I got the Japanese green tea ice cream with honey comb. I originally also ordered cotton candy topping for an extra $1 because I wanted my Instagram photo to look SUPER impressive, but alas their machine was broken. I still enjoyed my ice cream though (probably even more than I would have with the cotton candy.) The green tea flavour is not super strong, but is definitely still there. I liked that it was not too sweet by itself, but the honey comb added a bit of extra sweetness which made it more delicious - plus I didn't feel guilty for the added sugar because it was natural! From a honey comb! (Don't correct me if I'm wrong.) I will say that the portion ended up being too much for me to eat in one sitting - I wish I had friends to share it with #foreveralone

I paid $8 for my ice cream after tax, but considering the portion size and taste I thought it was worth it. I actually liked this place better than Tsujiri's (downtown), mostly because there wasn't a ridiculous wait time and I really really liked the honey comb. There were pine nuts at the bottom of the sundae, and I liked those better than the brown rice I had at Tsujiri's too. I can see how some of the other ice cream combos might be a letdown, especially the tiffany vanilla ice cream if people were expecting something special, but I'd definitely recommend the green tea ice cream with honey comb!

I've been to John's a dozen times - over a period of several years.  He's got history.  John used to be the ""main man"" at the Gus' Sir Beef that used to reside right across the street from where John's is on Westinghouse (near Hwy 49).  Apparently Gus & John had a falling out, and John left to open his own eatery across the street.  Gus' is now long gone.  

John was (is?) famous for his marinated beef tips.  At $10.25, it seems a bit much for lunch at a meat-and-two-veggies kind of restaurant, so I ordered the roast beef w/gravy, mashed potatoes and tossed salad.

The salad came right away.  With some brown mushy chunks of what had once been lettuce staring me in the face through a coating of a weak excuse for thousand island dressing, I pushed it away after a couple bites.  With that my entree arrived.

The plate was literally swimming in brown chemical gravy (more like an au jus).  All the gravy in the place won't make up for dry meat.  The potatoes weren't creamy or fluffy; they were watery.  It was as if the potatoes had not been thoroughly drained before they were mashed.

The waitress stopped by to ask me how it was, and I honestly replied that I was disappointed.  I pointed out the rotten lettuce, which she quickly whisked away, and the lame excuse for potatoes.  She was genuinlely concerned and wanted to bring me something else, anything.  I declined.  

She said she was going to being me replacement potatoes, which she did.  Of course, it was the same thing.  Unless they go back to the potato, there's nothing they can do to ""fix"" it!  Adding milk or butter to watery potatoes won't help!

She circled back to see if the replacement potatoes were any better, I just asked for my check.  She insisted that, since she couldn't satistfy me and I didn't enjoy it, she was going to show the manager and I shouldn't have to pay.

I left a tip (after all it wasn't her fault, and she did everything in her power to make it right), and as I approached the register she took my check  and said it was taken care of.  She practically begged me to come back and give them another try.

The octopus was fresh and had a great flavor especially with the pesto sauce.  This was pared with Seascape Vineyard Chardonnay 2012, very clean, crisp and some lemon-lime overtones, no oakiness to this chardonnay.  The next course was the salad; this was Farro (similar to quinoa--a wheat/barley grain) sorrels, pea tendrils, with aged prosciutto and Pecorino Romano cheese all presented with a beautiful charred shallot vinaigrette. The salad was pared with Velvet Sisters Vineyard, Anderson Valley Pinot Noir 2013-- Aged in 37% new oak, blue-fruited Pinot Noir with notes of spring flowers, blueberries, blackberries, Asian plum sauce and forest floor, in a full-bodied, gorgeously textured and opulent style. Rated 96 points in Robert Parker's The Wine Advocate, October 2015.  The middle course consisted of a wonderful Duck Breast A l' Orange, accompanied with pistachio puree, cherry and pinot glaze/reduction this was my favorite of the entire dinner.  The wine pared with this course was Jennifer's Russian River Pinot Noir 2012.  Stephen Tanzer's International Wine Cellar, May/June 2014 gave 91 points, Vivid ruby. Fresh dark berries and cherry-cola on the nose, with smoky spice and lavender notes adding complexity. Supple and broad on entry, then tighter in the mid-palate, offering bitter cherry and anise flavors, and a touch of succulent herbs. Lingers with appealing sweetness, supple tannins and excellent nervy persistence. This was one of my favorite wines of the evening.  The main course was Kona (coffee) crusted Prime Hanger Steak, accompanied with potato puree, spring baby vegetables and a Zinfandel Reduction sauce.  The steak was surprisingly tender and prepared extremely well.  This course was pared with Highwire Vineyard Russian River Old Vine Zinfandel 2012. Robert Parker, Wine Advocate, December 2013 gave 95 points, a dense ruby/purple color is followed by a rich, full-bodied wine displaying lots of boysenberry, black raspberry and cherry fruit intermixed with hints of incense and Asian spice. Supple tannins and a big, pedal-to-the-metal, juicy, succulent style.  And the dessert course was a bittersweet chocolate mousse with vanilla bean cremeux accompanied with passion gelee and chocolate crumbles. This was pared with Fannucchi Wood Road vineyard Russian River Old Vine Zinfandel 2011. This wine displays ripe blackberry, boysenberry and black raspberry aromas and flavors along with silky chocolate notes on the finish. Robert Parker review was listed at 91 points.

My boyfriend had received a gift card for Casey's so we decided to go before meeting up with some friends.  There are no Casey's restaurants in South Mississauga, so getting to any location is a bit of a hike.  

We both ordered off the seasonal menu.  I ordered the pork medallions with sweet potato mash and TM ordered the lobster mac and cheese.  I enjoyed my meal.  The meat and red wine sauce were great (especially since it was a chain bar/restaurant) and I'm a sucker for anything with sweet potato.  TM on the other hand had the opposite experience.  He couldn't even finish half of his meal as it started to make him gag.  Personally, I didn't blame him.  The sauce was more cream than cheese and the lobster was tasteless with an odd texture - somewhere between rubbery and moist.  There was a breadcrumb topping, but it lacked flavour as well.  The only thing edible about it was the side salad it came with.

Now, I can forgive a bad dish, especially when the other was good.  Sometimes things happen.  What I can't forgive is slow service, especially in a half empty restaurant.  We waiting close to 30 minutes for our food and another 20 minutes after eating for the bill.  Once we were all ready to pay, I had to hunt down our waiter to process the payment because he failed to come back to us.  I found him chatting with a friend of his.

I've tried both the pad gra prao and the khao soi. The pad gra prao is simply ground pork, some vegetables, sliced cucumbers, and an egg. It comes with a sauce on the side that I highly recommend adding to the dish. The one difference between the dish here and the one at Khao San Road is that the KSR egg is fried while the one at Little Khao is sous vide. The food is so simple yet so flavorful and delicious.

The khao soi is just as spectacular as the one at KSR. It consists of fried egg noodles rising out of a rich curry broth with huge chunks of beef. The broth is everything -- rich, creamy, spicy, and flavorful. The noodles are tasty and goes extremely well with the curry broth. It just soaks up all of the broth.

Beer - Had a few craft beers on tap so that's not too bad.

[Bad]
Food - Not everything was bad but it mostly was not great.  Calamari starter was fine.  Dry ribs you can probably skip.  The pieces tasted ok but there were so few pieces that it just looked really sad on the plate.  It came out on a long rectangular dish but there was no pile or anything.  Just loose pieces of slightly hard and dark meat sliding around.

Had their fish and chips Thursday special because I figure it's a British pub so can't go wrong with a staple.  Well I guess I did go wrong.  The fish batter was too thick and hard.  Fish was not very flaky.  Chips were average, slightly soggy to start.  At least they had malt vinegar that I could douse all the food in.

Also had ghost pepper wings that were pretty standard.  Not really going to set me on fire and tasted more like Frank's Red Hot.

I decided to play some of my favorite games and won over $89 on an 80 cent bet. I was on a roll. and I won ever casino I played that day. I quadrupled the money I started out with. 

I went back to this casino a few months later right before we left Vegas and the rennovation came out great. It looks awesome. All new games everywhere so new I dont think half of them were even turned on yet. but they expanded, added new bars, looks very hip and trendy (especially for downtown) it looks fantastic!

There was a hawaiian party going on upstairs and looked like they were having a great time. I've never been a guest here but I would stay here. They also have the newly opened Hash House a GO-Go. looks like not many knew that its in there so they really got to step up the advertising there.

We also ordered  three other vegetarian dishes: brown lentils (6), ground peas (10), and yellow split peas (12) . The only vegetarian dish we didn't end up trying was timatim fitfit (13). It just didn't appeal to either of us. My favorites were the brown lentils and the string beans. The brown lentils are served cold which may not appeal to some people; however, I thought the flavors were delightful- vinegary with lots of spices. The string beans tasted a lot like the Greek-style green beans I've had at Greek festivals. I would get both of those again. My least favorites were the ground peas and the collards. Whatever the dominant spice was in the ground peas, I didn't like it.  The collards just lacked overall flavor.  

Everything is served with plenty of injera. It's basically a crepe and very...squishy. Towards the end of my meal the texture of the injera was not appealing to me. I did like that it was sourdough, though. 

The staff is friendly enough and helpful if you don't know what to order. The overall appearance of the restaurant could use some work. The main dining area was carpeted and a bit dirty; the bathroom is a bit of an eye-sore.  

Note for VEGANS or DAIRY-SENSITIVE people: My boyfriend and I are both vegan, and based on the descriptions, everything on the vegetarian menu is vegan. I should have double-checked with the waitress, since I ended up with a stomach ache (usually happens when I end up eating dairy).

It was my second time dining at an all-you-can-eat Brazilian grill. It is pricey, but the food, service, and just the whole experience is worth it...once in a blue moon.

Our group of 12 dined at Copacabana to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The moment I stepped inside, I noticed the upbeat atmosphere. It was very lively with a lot of chatter and the music was a little too loud for any decent conversation with the person sitting two seats away. That is part of the whole Brazilian steakhouse experience, I suppose. 

The service was excellent. We had made a reservation for 5:30, but due to traffic, half the guests did not arrive until 6:15. The server did everything she could to keep the meats coming until the very end of our meal; it was nice that she took specific requests. There was a bit of a show toward the end of our meal (as they give you a 2-hour limit), where two dancers took the stage for what-seemed-like less than 5 minutes.

There is a small salad bar with some bread and cheese too. Rice, mashed potatoes, butter mushrooms, salmon, mussels (mmm...), and fried casava were available too. Some freshly baked goods like cornbread and cheese buns were brought to the table as well, but I only tried the cornbread and it was really good.

Onto the more important items though... I loved the picanha Brazil, parmesan prime rib, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, flank steak, and Moroccan chicken. I asked for medium rare for all the red meat, and everything tasted amazing. 

I was not a fan of the skirt steak dry rub, chimichurri steak, or the beef ribs. All of these were too dry. As for the beef ribs, I expected...ribs, not a roast. 

As for dessert, the roasted pineapple is THE best! I helped myself to five big slices at the end of my meal. :) They also have fried bananas. I do not eat bananas, but my friends loved that, too -- not more than the roasted pineapple though. ;)

My boyfriend and I have dined at Brasa in Niagara Falls. He says he enjoyed Brasa a lot more. Bigger, more spacious, larger variety of cold foods to choose from, and the meat never stopped coming.

As a fan of schlock, horror and musicals I had high hopes for this production. It just misses the mark. The actors are a hard working bunch. 
Doesn't quite honor the movie as I had hoped it would. The use of  'blood' is obvious and not really worked into the script, just more of an actor with a blood bag and a thirsty audience. 
The script needs to be tightened up a bit and the production value increased. Again, the performers work their tails off - so - thank you to the cast.",2014-12-22 15:40:57

Our group had a reservation and the hostess failed to notice that two of our party had already arrived and was seated.  Instead, we were told to wait while our table was being set up.  What the...?
When this was finally sorted out and we sat down, we all came to realize how loud it was on the second floor (and likely everywhere).  I went home with a hoarse voice.  AND, it was extremely noticeable that many young ladies were there for dinner, but their girly bits were out for some air as well.  Our entire party was stunned at how many outlandishly short skirts and dresses were in the room.  We even noticed that the male servers were totally distracted.  I'm sure we looked like a bunch of old fogies harshly judging these ladies, but it was ridiculous.  Good eye candy for men who appreciate that kind of look, that's for sure.

Now down to business.  Ordering may difficult for people with decision making disorder.  I know because my spouse is one of them and it took him forever to figure out what to do.  

We tried the Buffalo Mozzarella.  Not worth it.  Now, the spaghetti ""Lille e Il Vagabondo"" is total insanity and you must order it for the sheer size.  It's got some heat and is absolutely delicious.  It also makes for great leftovers.  I ate the entire Pan-Seared Wild White Shrimp dish myself.  It was fabulous.  The pistachios and golden raisins give it some great flavor.  I tried a slice of my friend's pizza and I think it was the Wild Boar Bacon.  That was very flavorful too.  I ordered the Bellini and it was disappointing, unfortunately.  It didn't taste like much of anything.

Overall, the food I ate was delicious but the loud, crazy atmosphere and weird confusion early in the evening threw me off and I wouldn't go back by choice.  Definitely not a place for a romantic dinner or a group larger than six if you actually want to visit.",2013-07-22 02:35:50

There are also always plenty of chairs and places to sit around the pool. 

The community is secured by a gate and sometimes the gate can be a pain. They are very strict about who can/can't come in and often times it seems extreme. However, I don't mind this security because I believe it keeps the community safer all together.

Perhaps it is simply the doctor we dealt with who made our experience memorably awful. Dr. Sandra Romero was on call with Healing Hearts when our son was born and paid him a visit in the hospital (Mercy Gilbert). She began her visit by looking at his nether region and telling us that it was abnormal and he would have to see a urologist at six months for a circumcision....that HH wouldn't do this routine procedure before we left the hospital. 

The worst part was how hard she pushed us to feed him formula due to his slightly low/boarderline blood sugar. My husband and I made it VERY clear verbally and in our birth plan that we did not want any formula, as I planned to solely breastfeed and we didn't want to confuse him or complicate the journey. We agreed to a sugar water IV drip since they had already inserted an IV. Even after our son's glucose level was well within the normal range, she still pushed formula and went as far as to verbally guilt me about my milk production (which a lactation consultant praised for only two days post-partum) and asked if I cared about my son's health. We felt that she was rude, impatient and did not provide adequate reasoning for her recommended actions.  If we had not had the support of a doula and medical advice of another doctor and our midwife, my husband and I would have felt very defeated, bullied and likely caved in. I am so glad that we stood our ground for the sake of our baby.

We switched pediatrician offices immediately upon being discharged and during our first visit at the new office, two doctors looked at his privates and said it was completely normal (performed circumcision, in-office the next week) and that there was no reason for them to check blood glucose due to his weight, feeding schedule and the amount of dirty diapers. We were also told that blood sugar is best improved and checked based on his normal feedings long-term, which do not include sugar water or formula...which we pointed out to Dr. Romero numerous times. It is too bad that you can't choose which doctor would be looking after your baby in the hospital because our story could be much different with a more compassionate doctor who considers family wishes and determines common sense medical care for your newborn. Just remember that this is your journey and your child. As long as your actions don't endanger your child, you have a choice of treatments. Good luck!",2013-03-01 19:17:29

I had the pulled pork grilled cheese on both occasions (only because nothing else on the menu seemed even the least bit appetizing but I should have learned my lesson the first time). It was pretty bad on both accounts. I found it so incredibly greasy. My side salad came dressed with so much dressing that the leaves were dripping. It was completely inedible. I had the fries as a side the second time, they were good but being able to make something fried in duck fat taste good is kind of a no brainer.

The others at the table thought the food was mediocre to okay, at best, but when you call yourself a gastropub and charge for food like a gastropub - then the food should be more than the local pub down the street. I found it to be significantly overpriced, way too greasy and generally just not very good. Any hint of satisfaction our table had with the food was quickly dashed when we saw the bill. You've got to be kidding me. 

One of the members of our party was a vegetarian. When asked about the limited veggie options the server simply replied that she could have anything on the menu made just without meat. Which basically narrowed her choices down to a grilled cheese or a quesadilla. Good thing she wasn't a vegan. 

Our server so incredibly fake nice and did little to show that she actually cared about her job or our experience at the restaurant. The encounters I had with other staff members were the same - fake and uncomfortable. 

As time goes on I still hear people rave about the place for some reason that I don't really understand. It seems to be fairly busy so I guess it probably has some redeeming qualities. The service and the atmosphere surely aren't the reason, so i suppose it's the food? I'd love to say I'll try it again, next time at dinner, but I don't want to risk wasting money on such disappointing greasy food.

But most like I, would come here for the wood oven pizza! We shared three different pizzas amongst the group and all agreed, that the crust was perfectly thin and chewy, and the toppings were perfection! We all raved about the Parma in Bianco; this pizza was topped with prosciutto, roquette and parmesan cheese and although it was simple, was flavourful and savoury, perfectly balanced with the sauce. 

The venue itself is nice and informal, with stone walls and an industrial decor, and highly popular with the tourists. It can get a little loud due to DJs playing music later at night, but the friendly service and good cocktails would soon make you forget the noise.",2017-08-20 21:51:08

I'm all for any restaurant that has a designated gluten-free menu and features Arizona wines. I had to wait a few weeks for a Beckett's trip to fit into my schedule (since they're closed Mondays), but it was totally worth it. 

I would first recommend to follow their Facebook and Twitter to figure out their specials before you go. I had eye-balled their cherry pork tacos before I went, and asked the server with puppy-dog eyes if they were gluten free. Thankfully they were. The waiter was super adorable, and has a family full of celiacs, so he totally gets the diet and was really sweet about my ""situation."" I was also called ""dear"" several times, which was mildly endearing and warmed me up to ordering a second glass of wine. 

My also adorable date had the fire roasted green chile pork stew, and although it looked slightly tasty - isn't really my thing, and wasn't gluten-free. Neither were the cheddar biscuits that were served with the meal, but there's no harm in smelling them while your eyes roll back in your head and drool. Unless other celiacs say that this isn't part of the diet. 

The cherry pork tacos, although not part of their summer menu, were mind-blowingly good. They were so simple, yet so tasty. I can't believe that the special cherries made the meal, it's definitely the talent seen here. Dear American comfort food, I love you.

The wine list is extensive and offers lots of Arizona wines that are just too good to all have in one sitting (unless you're into that). The cocktails are...interesting. Although none of them are really my ""thing,"" I appreciate a menu with a great cocktail list. 

Prices are, eh, prices that you would expect from this sort of restaurant. Entree prices are comparable to that of True Food, and I think their wines were priced fairly. As a celiac, I would say these two are really good date restaurants or girlfriend night away. 

I would make a reservation, even though some nights are apparently slow. Better safe than sorry, especially if you could enjoy Beckett's food. 

I will definitely come back here. Again, I would recommend this for any celiac on an adorable date. Or even non-adorable date. Or just alone eating pork tacos at the bar which I may end up doing very soon.

Also, since I always include a bathroom review on here: they are very nice individual bathrooms. They even have light-up make-up mirrors. That's the type of small additions that can really make a restaurant. Nice one.",2011-07-13 19:09:37

It's nice to have an old-fashioned butcher still in Lakewood for when you want some meat that tastes better and is prepared better than the supermarket.  
However, I have to say I'm not a fan of whatever contraption they use to heat the sandwiches.  It is some kind of a steamer and it makes the sandwich including the bread a bit mushier than I like it.  If you want some Italian sausage from here, buy it, take it home and grill it yourself with the appropriate peppers and onions - it just doesn't taste quite right out of the steamer.

First of all, they bake their own bread and fresh pastries are available for breakfast everyday. My favorite is the cheese (gruyere) croissant because it is so flaky. It literally melts in my mouth. My coworker called it high class junk food but I call this good stuff. Sometimes, when I felt lazy to go to lunch, I would just buy a loaf of bread and eat that with a cup of coffee. The zufte or zoft, which is a Swiss specialty bread is amazing. It is fresh and out of the oven by 11am during school days. I have not seen other places in the area that sell zufte but the bread is really worth trying. Oh, if you have cravings for day old bread, they sell them at half price.

They also have a wonderful selection for dinner. Daily specials change quite often but they have their regular dinner menu. I usually go with the daily special. This place also has fondue, both cheese and chocolate. I had both and I have to say that they are pretty stingy with their cheese and chocolate. I had barely enough to cover the fruit or bread. Do expect $12-$17 for entrees and about $10 for fondue. By the way, they sell cheeses too in the day.

They have pretty good service but the people do not seem to smile a lot during the day, especially the owner. They should be happy because of the wonderful smell of fresh bread. The decor is a little European and has a fireplace at the corner which makes the place extra cozy in the evening. Anyhows, this place is highly recommended.

So the service is great and I mean it, both times I was there the service was top 5 stars. The ambiance is great too, whether you are seated inside or outside on their lovely terrace. 

The food? Since I'm not a big fan of pizza, I decided to order something completely different. First time I had the fish and it was perfectly cooked, just as it should be. On my second time I decided to try their lamb and I was pleasantly surprised, even impressed with how good it tasted and how pretty it looked on my plate. I think it was served on mash potato, but it tasted completely different, delicious.

So my verdict? I like it! It's definitely a cool spot to bring your friend, colleague, significant other. I can't say much about their pizzas since I haven't tasted it, but there are definitely few good things on their menu for those people like myself that not that into pizza.

The prices are a bit better for more than one bagel, but in my head I have a certain limit I'm paying for a bagel. For 6 bagels, the damage was about 9 bucks and change. Add $4 if you wanted a cream cheese pint. This part of Phoenix is not that high-end, so the high prices are a bit confusing.

We walked in through the back and saw a lot of open tables outside that haven't been cleared so we walked to the front to find a hostess.  She was friendly but sat us at a dirty table.  She cleaned it off fairly quickly and thats where our service ends.

Our waiter was super awesome and very charming - he had this dry sense of humor that really worked especially with a big group.  My favorite line that came from him was when we were asking about heat levels and someone had mentioned they wanted a ""kick"".... and he responded with a dead-serious look on his face:  ""flying kick"" or ""regular kick"".... I was rolling on the floor laughing and it took a couple of my friends a repeat of what was just said to get them on board with my flailing of hands and obnoxious laughter.

Not sure if every table gets this, but we were a table of six and we got a basket of regular Naan with 3 different dipping sauces.  Super delicious.

I was feeling very adventurous that night and saw that the first course selections had a ""Soup of the Day"".... I totally ordered it without asking what it was.  Our waiter replied that the soup was Tomato.... and I was a bit saddened, but still ordered it anyway.  Later he came back and said he was mistaken and the soup was a coconut bell pepper soup.  Sounded great, and was a great surprise.  Best accidental soup of the day ordering ever.  When the soup came, I had to let everyone try it because it was just THAT good.  It was everything that the name promised and more.

My main course was the Saunfiya Kesri Chicken which was on the ""modern"" section.  Who wouldn't pick it based on its description alone?:  Saffron-Fennel Roasted Chicken Breast, Fennel-Chive Creme, Mixed Vegetables!!!!!!  There was a heavy hand of black pepper on the veggies that I really really really really enjoyed and it went perfect with the chicken.  I wanted to fill an Olympic-sized pool with the creme sauce and do laps in it.

Having a really good time with the food, I convinced my friend to split a dessert with me and we partook in the ""Three Excuses""... they had great dessert names on the menu.  The excuses included a flour-less ""Callibaut"" chocolate torte, gulab jamun, baileys kulfi.  ALL WERE GREAT and a nice way to end the meal.

Felt a little guilty when the check came - I had 2 glasses of wine with my meal and probably spent way more than I should for one person for one dinner, but I enjoyed it tremendously.

The breadsticks were soft and chewy, but they had a really weird chemical aftertaste. The weirdest part were the inconsistencies between the marinara dipping sauce brought with both. We were warned that the breadsticks had new sauce that was just heated up so would be hot. This explained why the mozzarella marinara was a weird dark color and liquid less. It was the consistency of mashed potatoes instead of a sauce. For the cost of eating there, I'd expect the food to be better.

My guess is they find some Inuit kid, post him up at one of those Alaskan rivers, paying the little bastard big bucks to snatch a salmon from the mouth of a hungry grizzly. Subsequently, due to the kld's funeral costs and reparations to his family, they have to jack-up the cost of the salmon.

I had no idea what to expect. It's not in the best part of town, that's for sure. Everything around it resembled a ghost town.

3 things came to mind the first moment I walked into the hotel. OLD, CHEAP and GHETTO!! Don't know how to explain it but there was no positive aura about this place at all. It was ghetto. From the elevators to the carpet, this place looked like it was ready to fall apart. 

Once, we got into our room, we noticed the faucet leaking loudly! Plus the room was by the elevator so it was very noisy. The room itself was pretty decent sized, but everything looked old, except for the flatscreen tv. I called the front desk to be transferred to another room and told them the situation, the gal said to go to the next room. I told her it was too noisy. She said the hotel was really full(really?). She said to come down to the front desk and they would find me another room.

So we dragged all of our luggage back down. The dude that helped me was an idiot. As we specifically told him about the leaking and how they needed to fix it, he kept saying ""I'm sure they will fix it."" He looked agitated and wouldn't give eye contact. I don't know who trained him, but he doesn't want any responsiblity for the hotel's guests complaints. He should have said, "" I'll look into it and make sure that the problem is corrected."" Not ""I'm sure they'll fix it."" Does he even know when the leak started? Yesterday, a week ago, a year ago? Who's gonna fix it? Housekeeping? Roto Rooter? It's because of workers like him this hotel is under forclosure. I asked him for a room away from the elevator. He said they had one room left, as the hotel was really full(really again? sure didn't look like it). As we entered the room , I swore I smelled smoke but the room was non smoking. It was smaller than the first room and I questioned the cleanliness. My wife said the toilet paper in the bathroom was one that was damp, that dried up. Did someone drop it in the toilet or drop it on a wet floor? Is this place so cheap, that housekeeping won't even replace that? 

Normally, you would expect that if there is problem with a room, the guest's room should be upgraded, not downgraded like us. Long story short, you could not pay me to sleep here again.

Arrive, but the whole delivery took about 38 minutes from the moment I placed my order, to the tome it arrived.

The portion is larger than the usual standard, I order a thin crust which was made really great..and since this was my first time, I went a little far with the toppings and they all tasted so well and worked all together.

They have the obvious choice of different meats for grilling such as ribeye, brisket, chicken, and other but they also have a pretty extensive menu of other items as well. We decided to go with the ribeye to bbq and a dumpling soup to try as well. The flavor of the broth was very good and tasted like spring onion. The dumplings were ok I felt like they lacked some flavor. The ribeye our server brought out looked like very good quality and she started the cooking process for us. They serve it with lettuce, rice, and various other ingredients to add to the flavor of the beef. It was a really fun experience and one I would recommend to people who are picky about trying new foods since the flavors are pretty basic with the bbq.

However, when I got there, the place wasn't even busy. Apparently, the male worker with curly dark hair and glasses wasn't being particularly nice about it.

To be honest, I thought it would be a cooler event but it was just a bunch of colouring print-outs of Drake and Queen Latifah. Everyone was left to colour (or not colour), as there wasn't a host engaging with the crowd. Since there was DJ Charlie playing some pretty good throwbacks, I felt some jokes and raffle tickets may have enhanced the experience. There is no point having a themed night if there's nothing different from a typical night.

Food-wise, the fried chicken and waffles ($15.95) is decent but not the best fried chicken in town. With a Red Stripe, the bill came up to $32.50 after tips and taxes.

For an appetizer, my party shared a ""Giant Yorkshire Pudding"".  My mother had a British boyfriend when I was young and she made him Yorkshire pudding. This one was better than some I've had, but not as good as ""Mom used to make"". But since those weren't authentically ""Authentic"" it's tough to deduct points for it.  They got cold quick, but that was probably because of the ""Giantness"" 

Probably the best Scotch Eggs I've ever had are here. And you can get them cold OR warm (I personally recommend warm).

I also had the Fish and Chips (Since I was going for ""The Classic"" British Style) and they were good.  Just one fish, but it was a pretty big fillet, so no complaints.

We finished it off with Sticky Toffee Pudding which was great!

Through all of this, the ONE waitress kept on top of a pretty busy place.  Considering she was the only one waiting tables her performance was extraordinary. Though as an understandable side effect, service was a bit slow and a member of the party never got the coffee she ordered with the Pudding.

I wish I was in Vegas more often so I could stop in more often. I do hope to come back the next time I'm in town.

One other side note.. They do have a ""Pet Friendly Patio"" so you can bring your pet for a meal outside.

In fact, the last time I traveled out of this airport, the people were so friendly it took me aback.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  While the airport is pretty efficient and run by friendly folks, it can be a little rough looking; especially in the older concourses.  The food selection is also pretty limited.  However...  

Other reviews here suggest that the lack of quality food at this airport is some sort of indicator that Cleveland natives are scary folk.  While I might take that stance for any number of other reasons (hey, I'm a Cleveland native!) I certainly wouldn't because of the airport food service.  

The food at this airport is definitely limited, but that's no indicator that the people of Cleveland are.  Spend a little time in Cleveland and I'll show you a host of places with good vegetarian choices.  Just 'cuz you don't dig the food choices at our airport doesn't mean we're all a bunch of dunderheads.

I have several prescriptions that have co-pay assistance.  After repeated issues with having them run the script through my insurance first and the co-pay assistance second, they finally told me that I would have to call every single time I filled one of those scripts and have them manually run it through the co-pay assistance.  

This was unacceptable so I moved all of my regular scripts to an independent pharmacy (Valley of the Sun Pharmacy) and my experience there has been stellar.  

I've continued to fill one-off scripts there for convenience sake but service has still been terrible.  On Monday, I picked up two scripts.  They had run one through my insurance but not the other.  (WHY????).  Yesterday, I picked up two scripts and they had run NEITHER of them through my insurance.  

This morning, I had to pick up something else and I stood there visibly and passive aggressively jangling my keys while employees bustled behind the counter, helped drive through customers and did everything but look to see if a customer was waiting.

Starter soups included a Melon Soup and a Borscht.  The Borscht was predominantly sweet, and I tasted like I was drinking diluted ketchup.  The Melon Soup was not a flavourful soup either.

I tasted the Macau-Style Seafood Bake with rice, as well as Curried Beef Brisket with rice.  Seafood Bake came with a battered tilapia, 2 shrimps, 1 mussel over a cream sauce.  The Curried Beef Brisket was okay but nothing special.  Not overly spicy but it still packed a kick to it.  I found the beef brisket could've been a bit more tender.

Lunch specials also come with a hot beverage.  I opted for the ""Yeen Yeung"" which is HK-Style Tea and Coffee.  They definitely use an instant powdered coffee mix which includes the whitener, and then steep it with the tea.  I could tell in an instant it was not brewed coffee.

Verdict:

With tax and tip the total came to about $21.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor.  Instead of the typical KTVs playing in the background, they play retro Chinese movies from the 80s.

The man at the restaurant was so nice and courteous, very helpful. The restaurant itself feels very intimate yet spacious. Clean interior but a bit outdated.

The food was hot and spicy - just what I wanted. I'm only giving 2 stars because it's very pricey.

In my seemingly never-ending quest for a high-quality, non-casino, AYCE Chinese buffet somewhere in the Valley, I drifted in here while on West Sahara on business with one of my jewelers. 

This is pretty bland food-as-fuel, nothing more. 

The waitress was polite and her service was adequately attentive.

The buffet offered an entire steamer-station full of just seafood choices. For-real, not-imitation, crab legs was the clear draw, but there were various other, somewhat odd, choices such as stuffed mussels. I avoided all of that, until the venue 'earned my trust,' so to speak. Except I did slightly sample the salt&pepper calamari. Meh.

And while there were a lot of choices, the buffet seemed somewhat light on the traditional entrees one might expect to find in such a place. You know, the usual suspects: Beef w/ Broccoli, Kung Pao chicken, et. al. Just not many of those guys in the house.

So, in the end, I stuck close to the soups, the teriyaki chicken-on-the-really-pointy-stick, the crab Rangoon, egg rolls, lo mein noodles and such. Removing the dried-up, baked-on chicken from the stick was dangerous enough to be a mission for Special Forces. There wasn't a single item I could describe as desirable enough to want to return. 

Again, in a word, bland.

And I wasn't entirely surprised that my tummy was somewhat queasy for at least a couple of days afterwards. And every time it groaned, I heard it saying 'sayonara' to this joint for sure.

I shouda guessed. I suppose I was KRAZY to go in there in the first place. The quest continues.",2017-08-01 13:14:10

It's a smallish, colorful place though quite nondescript from the outside. I went on a warm Sunday back in March (on a day like today, it seems like eons ago), when almost everybody was out on the streets. 

The food is decent, though not as great as our server made it out to be. He breathlessly mentioned best-mexican-in-toronto and arcade fire and a whole bunch of other bands that eat there.

Complimentary tortilla chips and salsa were brought very promptly to our table, and then refilled very promptly too.

Our server  was great at explaining the menu, which is pretty extensive. One in our party is vegetarian, and the server was thoughtful enough to mention that the burrito contained mayo which contained eggs. The mayo was removed, of course!

Our food was tasty and filling, but not very Mexican tasting. The vegetarian burritos were ginormous, with a large core of lettuce. Almost like eating a tortilla salad! The meat burritos were pretty decent. Is a burrito even a Mexican thing, or it just a white-person's- mexican creation, a la chicken tikka masala? 

Special mention to the piddly bowl of hot salsa, that was really, really spicy.

I ordered a side of potatoes, that were very tasty, but again not sure if that's an authentic Mexican creation.

The alcoholic creations were a hit: the margaritas were very strong. Muy Bueno! 

Milagro doesn't split bills, which is a bit annoying but thank god for my mental math skills and to everyone else who deigned to whip out their phone calculators despite the food coma.

I found it!!!! Urban Beans is my Easter egg. I was scared this might be one of those ultra modern, cold, coffee shops but while the decor is minimal, the impact it made felt like a firm hand shake that said, ""Come in, stay for a while."" And that's exactly what I did. 

There are so many tables here. No couches, which I thought I would miss, but I actually don't mind. All the chairs are different at every table which gives it an organized antique look. The area rugs bring warmth to it as well. I am set up next to a window, watching people and cars pass by as I ""work.""

There is also a covered patio for nice days. I can't wait for the weather to warm up a bit so I can try that out.

I ordered a toffee nut mocha and bought some home made toffee. The coffee came to me with a cute foam feather and a tasty coffee too. Not sweet and was a strong coffee. Exactly what I needed.

Construction on the street is still ongoing.

Big parking lot, plenty of space for parking.
Outside looks more like a hole in the wall.
But the inside is super spacious and looks like it used to be a bar and grill restaurant.

Clean environment with dim lighting.
Maybe three to four workers for the whole place.

When you walk in, make sure that they see you are in so they can come and assist you. Otherwise if they are in the back, they won't see you.

Food
I got the spring roll and pho Tai
Spring roll is $3.95
Pho was $9.75 for large

Plentiful amount of noodle. They are not Cutting back with it in the large bowl. I like the thin sliced beef that they have over here. The beef is actually a pretty good quality. The thin sliced makes it even better, as opposed to other places that has the thick and lower quality beef that gets chewy overtime in the broth.

The broth self is also decent, lots of red onions that bring out the sweetness to it. Again, you don't get the medicine bag broth over here. At least it doesn't taste like it.
The broth hits the spot on a cold day and also especially when you are sick.

Comes with the regular side of bean sprout, jalapeno, and lime.

Overall decent pho for the right reasonable price.

As for the spring roll, it's about average to other places. Nothing spectacular. Comes with two pieces cut into four bites with a side of the peanut sauce. Peanut sauce was done right. Inside the spring roll has the shrimp pork lettuce cilantro and maybe mint.

Service was pretty quick after they see that you are a new customer. The waitress was really friendly and attentive.

Restroom was clean as well. They do have a shower curtain that separates the urinal from the toilet. Interesting but whatever works.

This place will probably be my go-to pho place for now. As it's really close to Gilbert.

So they run this place with a lab theme, all the way to calling your name Starbucks-esque with the prefix ""Dr"", like ""Dr. Michelle"". So that was cute. The staff had lab coats and were helping customers decide which tubes/syringes they wanted. They kept the place pretty well-stocked even in the busy hour of 6pm on a Saturday. 

So here's how it works. You grab a hot or cold cup. Syringes hold syrups, and test tubes hold powders. You canNOT mix syringes and tubes together. Syrups are for tea bases (oolong, black, green), and powders are for milk tea. Hot drinks require just one tube or one syringe. Cold drinks require two. 

So you make your selection, put it on a metal tray, and then you move down the line. You can even select regular sugar, brown sugar, or maple syrup sugar (that's +$1). 

Price chart is in the pics.

You add toppings at the end, and they have a whole lot of different ones!! They have jellies and pearls of different flavours.

Taste was mad fresh and I loved it. I loved how my dude described it as looking ""radioactive"". 

My combo was: oolong tea base with peach and lychee syrups, green apple jelly and yogurt pearls.

GET PEARLS. Pearls pop when you bite into them and you literally get an explosion of flavour. 

So why 3*? Because you don't actually get to inject syrups into your drink. You hand off your tray to the staff and they make it for you, then they call you up when your drink is ready. Also, my drink cost $7. Yikes.",2018-04-06 22:31:58

I6zsgYSxHPuLUP2UPGFnWQ,VKgu2AoBHLbOY2zSfphvpA,gtg8Hld2EyJrFoB-272SIg,4,0,0,0,"Overall: Freshest fish in the area (along with Sushi Asia Gourmet), but average sushi rice (Sakura is still the best in that department). I have been coming here more and more for my Chirashi to get away from the crowds at Sakura. I am a bit surprised that this place doesn't attract more of a crowd.

Food: I am a creature of habit. If I am at a sushi restaurant, I am ordering one thing and one thing only: the Chirashi.  Bigeye's Chirashi eeks out Sakura's by a hair just because the fish is consistently fresher. However, there could be some improvement in the sushi rice department. It is not very well-seasoned. They also only provide you with enough for about 4 pieces of sashimi (maybe 6 if I ask for extra, and 8 if I ask for extra and stretch it). I like my rice. Can you tell?

Service: I have been served by the same waiter the last couple of times, who also appears to be the host and perhaps manager. He is nice and attentive, but can come off as ingratiating and definitely doesn't remember faces. I was a bit put off when I stopped in for a takeout order and he told the hostess that was helping me that the happy hour prices didn't apply to takeout . . . not that it mattered, but he could have looked me in the eye and said it politely instead of just instructing the hostess and ignoring me, the customer who has patronized this establishment  a lot of times.

Atmosphere: Dark, intimate decor. However, generally empty, perhaps because the strip where it's located doesn't get a lot of traffic in general (it's next to a Talbots and BMV . . .)",2015-11-11 04:43:11

The bar staff was very attentive, and we enjoyed their infused sake recommendations. While the place was crowded, we never felt boxed in at the bar. 

The atmosphere is very hip and fun, and I'd  be interested in doing karaoke there. They have it in the main area on Sundays, and you can rent private karaoke rooms others times, too.

Finally made my first visit today.  Funny- I told the greeter that I'd been waiting to try Perk for years, yet I added the bookmark just last year.  May 8, 2011, to be exact.  Anyhoo, the restaurant looked better than a roadstop diner- a lot better.  After reading a few reviews, I was expecting worse.  There were actually some nice pieces of wall art.  Overall, I liked the energy inside, even though there were only two or three other diners present at the time.  

Since I'd already checked out the menu online, I had two choices in mind to try (French toast or pancakes), which would depend on what the daily/weekly special was, and what the ""nut"" was in their caramelized banana nut topping for the pancakes, French toast, and waffles.  Since the special ""for a few days"" was Pumpkin pecan pancakes and pecans were the only nuts on hand, and I've a pecan allergy, I was reduced down to the fresh berries topping, and so I ordered the French toast combo, with soft-scrambled eggs, spicy chorizo ($7.99 menu price) and a cappuccino ($2.99).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw?select=U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQ#U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQ

Was excited to try another organic eatery since there are only a few in town, but I'm a bit disappointed on this first visit to Perk Eatery.  The eggs were fine, and the spicy chorizo complemented them well.  (The salt in the chorizo created a nice balance with the unseasoned eggs!)  The French toast had a nice crisp to them and were not at all greasy, but I guess I was just expecting more.  It didn't have enough custard for me, and I suppose I'm used to a little bit more decadence... mascarpone cream, caramel, creme fraiche, or just plain butter, even.  At least the pancake syrup was 100% maple.  (Can't recall if it's organic, though.)  The eggs served here are local Hickman Farms cage-free, so that's a plus.  Would love to see this updated to organic in the future.  The cappuccino was made with organic Passport coffee, and it was good, but I'm not used to seeing such a stark white froth, and so thick!  No matter- I got over it  quickly.  :)

Restaurant and women's restroom were clean and organized.  Service was friendly, and I liked the frequency in which Daniel and other employees (owner/managers?) came by to check up on things.  I thought it cool that someone (he struck me as a manager, or co-manager) handed me another napkin just a couple of seconds after maple syrup dripped from my plate onto the napkin on my lap.  Good eye!  While the French toast was, to me, underwhelming, it hasn't stopped me from following Perk Eatery on Twitter to try the Lemon-ricotta pancakes when they're on special.

Note to Perk: Please update your breakfast menus to reflect the price change of the French toast combo.  A $2 upcharge for a one-person ticket is no big deal, especially if everything on the menu is organic, but I don't know if I'd be as nonchalant about it if I brought in a larger party and the ticket reflected a higher discrepancy...",2012-05-10 20:39:03

The hours and days are weird for a Vegas buffet. They only do brunch and dinner Fri, Sat, and Sunday. The prices are decent especially if you have a Nevada ID and sign up for the CODE card, 2 for 1 prices.

The interior is nice very nice. The selection and presentation of the food are also nice however some of the food seemed like it was sitting out for awhile. The plates are small. 

The crepe station was nice except it was poorly made. The fresh made waffles were nice except the guy making them didn't know how to use the waffle maker, it was funny watching him break the machine and see the batter spill out. The fresh made donuts were also nice but when it's slow, which it was, seemed like they made to much and when I wanted them they were cold and hard. Liked the seafood selection there were oysters, shrimp, crab, various salmons, sushi, etc. They had dim sum served in individual steamers. The meats weren't the greatest but they had a good selection prime rib, ribs, chicken, etc. During brunch they have fresh made to order omelets.

Our seats in the middle section of the Palazzo Theatre about 2/3 of the way back were comfortable, and sight lines were very good. 

Plots aside, costumes and lighting were very colorful; a pair of professional dancers were terrific; and all of the several lead singers sang recognizable hit songs with voices that were of Broadway caliber.  Sometimes I was thrown off by the position of the maestro, who pulled everything together like a circus ringmaster much of the time, but veered off into other roles at other times, like when he was suddenly identified temporarily as Juliet's dad.

Anyway wasn't sure if they all shared sections because we had at least 4-5 different employees coming to check up on us. It was just weird that when we needed service no one came to us but when we didn't need service they all came around. Hmm maybe just a bad rotation or circulation on the floor.

I didn't know what to expect. It doesn't look like much from the outside. I'm sure many people avoid it because there's just a little door and you have know idea what's going on inside. This is one of those situations where you shouldn't judge a book by its cover (or door.) 

When I entered, I was surprised to see a very clean and comfortable atmosphere, and the place was almost full with working people. It's like a secret high-quality hideout. I was even greeted upon entering, which is saying a lot these days. 

I foolishly sought traditional Chinese and Japanese food items (that's how we Americans are trained), but found none. It felt risky to order grilled chicken and rice because grilled chicken often tastes dry to me. But I took a shot.

The bad news is that I had to wait 15 minutes, but you get what you wait for. Since it was takeout, I took the food home not knowing what to expect. It looked appetizing when I opened the box, but that doesn't mean much (well, maybe it does). Either way, visual appeal was a good start. Then I dug in ... and I couldn't believe what I was eating. 

You don't often find clean and tasty at the same time. In most cases, clean is boring and tasty is dirty. But this is one of those rare exceptions. The grilled chicken with rice was excellent. And the salad could not have been fresher.

---

I've had this place on my Vegas foodie radar as it was well known for their brunch menu. No1DP and I wanted to grab brunch nearby before my scheduled pickup to the aiport.

CONCEPT: Bistro fare from Thomas Keller, known for his restaurants at The French Laundry in Yountville and Per Se in New York.

VENUE: Located in the Venezia Tower you have to take an elevator from the Venetian to get to a bridge that will take you to the entrance of the restaurant. Though you can look out from the bridge there isn't much of a view of the outside.

SERVICE: When the No1DP and I arrived at 1:00ish there wasn't much of a wait. Approximate wait was ~25-30 minutes and I gave my phone number to text when our seats were ready. Bar was open seating and we went to actually eat at the bar but 5 minutes later I got a text alert saying our table was ready. 

At the beginning of the meal your server will tell you about the daily specials, but for reference there are blackboards scattered all across the restaurant that lists what those specials are. Service throughout the meal was good.

FOOD
After your order, you get epi bread along with butter and jam. The epi bread was a bit tough on the outside yet slightly soft on the inside. Butter was very smooth and creamy and was close in composition to the butter I had at The French Laundry. 

As the waiter was reading off the specials the No1DP and I heard about a special that caught our eye - the rock shrimp hash. Shrimps came with a poached egg and more importantly the brioche bread that Bouchon is also known for. 
-Poached egg was PERFECT. Sauce was creamy but not heavy, the egg is SOFT and yolky but not RUNNY so that your hash won't turn into a total mess.
-Shrimps were soft and flavorful. 
-Hash was full of vegetables and little potato. This ended up being one of the lightest hash dishes I've eaten. I really like a hash when it doesn't make me feel too stuffed due to the potato.
-Brioche bread was a bit crispy but it was slightly chewy on the center and buttery, similar to the brioche I've had at The French Laundry (which was the best brioche I've ever had).

No1DP and I also had freshly squeezed orange juice. The amount of pulp was just right.

After a sub-par dinner experience I would like to come back here to try more of their brunch dishes, especially the croque madame and chicken and waffles. This is also a must-stop if you are staying at the Venetian or Palazzo.",2013-11-19 21:14:11

With that said, I do enjoy this location immensely.  They have great staff and the room is definitely set up for those that are working (great wifi, outlets at most every table, etc.)  Bonus is that they have garage doors that they open, when warm, with a small patio.

There's a wide variety of merchandise, but the layout is confusing and there are some truly horrible things for sale there.  Like, offensively bad.  The price points are very steep- even basic, worn-out men's t-shirts top the $10 range because they have the logo of some bowling team from 1997 on them.  

My biggest complaint is how difficult it is to sell anything to them.  I'd previously taken some furniture there, as well as a collection of promotional materials from paper and candy companies.  The last time I walked in, I had a mid-century spice rack under my arm.  I didn't even finish my sentence when the guy behind the counter rudely cut me off, saying only ""not interested.""  He didn't even look all the way up!  I asked him if he knew of any other dealers in the store who might be interested, and he got real smug and said ""it's not our style,"" like I was trying to sell him a beat-up thrift store bathroom rug.

This week, I decided to try the Drake Corner Cafe. The side patio is lovely on a sunny day with lots of umbrellas for those who prefer the shade. We arrived at 11:30 and were seated right away. 

I started with some fresh mango juice - refreshing and sugary sweet. Then my DC and I shared a plate of those famous blueberry scones. Believe the hype. They were divine -- everything a scone should be: warm, soft, a bit of crispness on the outside, granulated sugar sprinkled on top, dense but not dough-y, and triangular. The 4 mini scones were served with strawberry jam, butter, and clotted cream. It felt like going for high tea. I also had the yogurt and homemade granola with honey and fruit to round out the meal. The yogurt was plain yogurt (I would've preferred vanilla), but the granola was surprisingly crisp and flavourful with a variety of nuts. 

Service was smooth and swift, no complaints. I would come back to try the rest of the menu. The breakfast burrito, especially, sounds really good. I was also intrigued by the make-your-own mimosas and caesars on the menu.",2011-07-10 18:47:34

This was my latest stop.....Tempe Diablo Stadium. I really liked the entrance to the stadium....looks a little bit like the Big ""A"" in Anaheim. The concourse is large and I really like the green line they have painted with the statement ""No Standing Please"" it really keeps the concourse free of people just standing around and crowding the concourse. There are great views of the stadium no matter where you sit and the hills that surround the mountain are pretty awesome. I don't know why they don't allow people to sit on those hills and watch the games....but I would really like to see that one day. The food is average and is not to terribly expensive....however a 16oz can of beer will run 8 buck this year. I was told it was 7.25 a year ago....but since I don't drink it didn't really matter to me....LOL. 

The parking is just okay...just make sure you get there early or you will have a long walk to the stadium...by the way parking is 5 bucks. Now the only reason I didn't give this locale 5 stars was because it doesn't really have a spring training feel like some of the other parks I have been to.....the fans are very subdued.....and the atmosphere is kind of bland. I was extremely shocked by this too because the Angels are expected to contend this year for the World Championship....so you would think the fans would be a little more excited. I was also disappointed with the ""Lawn"" it is perhaps the smallest I have seen at any other park....and the ""Lawn"" is suppose to be the highlight really of any spring training park.

All in All this is good stadium and I definitely will return again in the future....but just another FYI....autographs are hard to come by here.....so don't really expect to get many unless you catch the players when they are leaving the ballpark.

The place is nice inside, really fancy, gives a romantic ambience. We were given our menu in a physical form as well as on an ipad, a freaking IPAD lol.

The prices were WAY to high for my usual commitment to food costs, and honestly the food didnt wow me, but i guess they have to pay for the cost of those ""ipad"" menu's lol. The service here was ABSOLUTELY horrible, we waited an hour for seating, then another hour and a half for food, the waiter alone took 25 minutes to bring out our drinks. This put me in a bad mood for the rest of my meal.

I had a smothered s'mores waffle, the name alone gave me a cavity. It was drenched in marshmallow, so unfortunately that was all i tasted. it was way too sweet for me, and a waffle that cost me $10 i should be able to enjoy all the flavorings.

My husband tried the adega omelet (tomato, serrano, bacon, arugula etc) which took a good 40 minutes to come out, and it was cold, and you could tell it was probably sitting waiting to come out for a while. 

While the omelet was good, the principle of us waiting forever for it make it seem less desirable.

Zinburger is a lovely decorated restaurant with a shabby chic feel.  It is an open air concept with a nice outdoor patio and a large dining room that has windows that can completely open to the outside for that open air feel so even if you aren't outside, you feel as though you are.  The bar is nice and large and I can see coming here to spend time at the bar as well.  

The burgers here are what I would call a gourmet burger without being stuffy.  I am really picky about my burgers but these are really good.  The taste is just right and there isn't any gristle.  The fries are hand cut and tasty as well and can be shared.  The only thing I thought it lacked was a little presentation.  The burger was literally on the plate with nothing else.  It looked lonely.

First off, the food is okay. Certain things are done well, while others are definitely things I would steer clear. There is a Taro and Lap Cheung Fried Rice that was really well done. Good amount of ingredients in the rice, and tasted delicious. They also have good Fried Octopus Tentacles.
However, the Sticky Rice Rolls are impossible to eat. They are completely stuck together to the point that you can even take them apart to eat. You'd essentially have to rip them apart. Also, the desserts here are a bit lacklustre. Everything is mediocre in terms of taste, except the Mango Pudding. 

Service is not too bad, food does come rather quickly to the table, but there are small things that could be changed. The order sheets are beautifully printed on glossy paper, but when you want order another round (or two), they don't give you a new sheet!

Bookmarking Vila a few weeks back I finally got here to an empty restaurant! I thought it was a little strange, that was until we met the Lubka!!! That's where our experience took off!!! After being sat and shown the menus we decided to go with all recommendations from the waitress and owner.

Starting off with some great house made sangria we ordered the Portuguese Chorizo and Snails! Wow..... These 2 starters we're simply brilliant, full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended!!!

For our mains we ordered Portuguese Steak and Paella Portuguese style. Both were great, my favorite  had to be the Paella. It seemed a little like a southern style dish I've had before just with out the spice.

Now this is where Vila Algarve shines from the menu Desert: Mascarpone and Home Make Cake.... I don't know how to explain these 2, other than Epic!!!! I'm dead serious Epic!!! Texture, flavor and simply outstanding!! 

I would also like to say Vila is a very kid friendly restaurant with High chairs and a small menu for kids. The staff were fantastic with my one year old. Also they said they encourage people to bring along there little ones.

Also after 8pm they have some nice love music. I did say at the start of this review it was empty, once 7p came around the place started filling up quick.

This restaurant is going to take off!!! Having a very international staff and grounding in what it takes to make genuine European food, Vila Algarve is high end food with group and family like atmosphere...

- their bannocos were perfect for lunch for me. I'm not a big eater so I was looking for something light that wasn't a salad. two tacos and a refreshing cucumber apple salad totally hit the spot. The tacos had a great balance of textures and flavours and was only messy to the point where you'd just laugh (as opposed to messy to the point where you're frustrated... I can't be the only person to have experience that before...)
- their specials are on point! My friends ordered the brunch special (a fricassee that came with a balance of meat, eggs, and fresh greens) and it came heaping on a plate. The portions for them put a big smile on their faces.

The not-so-awesomeness:
- the server advertised a few fresh juices, so my friends picked the maple lemonade, and I went for the strawberry lemonade. Someone later came back to tell me that they were all out of the strawberry lemondade (it was 11:30am). I was a sad panda.

While this one was just as tasty, it was super duper thick and reminded me of a soup that's been on a pot for a loooong time. Flavour wise it was still good but texture wise it made me feel as though it wasn't very fresh.

Our server was fantastic, she checked up on us often and my water was never past half-empty. As we were about to leave, they called after us as a friend forgot his glasses on the table (again showing how they're always on the ball with service).

So we are all familiar with LaRocca cakes, but what makes this cafe special and worth visiting is that the taste and quality of the cakes made here and NOT THE SAME as the factory cakes made down the street, which get shipped to shops and grocery stores that we all know them for. 

Example: The original creation from Pastry Chef Martin, ""The Caramel Crunch"", tastes great and you wouldn't think that it could be any better. But try one made here at this cafe and you will understand what I am raving about. Here, it's real fresh cream, no stabilizers that are needed for the grocery stores, as some need to be frozen to preserve their proper form for arrival and into the display case. So it really brings the cake from a 5 to at least a 6! The texture of the fresh cream, the lightness and mouth feel is different and makes it that much tastier. You can't believe me until you taste it.


There's lots of free parking in this plaza, beautiful clean and modern cafe with lots of seating for couples to groups, big windows at the front entrance to watch the action happen in the kitchen. They serve illy espresso and itialian sodas and have a unique line of tea as well. The pastry case is made daily and always a surprising seasonal treat that you must try before you miss the chance later(fig & pear I will find you again one day). Thank goodness for the glass case to keep back the fans, really like the open concept of the kitchen floor, really neat to watch the chefs work and create. 

Tips:
- Buy 6 items then tax is exempt.
- 48 hrs for cake orders
- Sometimes they have bogo deals, the cashier didn't know how/when they decide, so I will keep visiting until I find out that algorithm. 
- caramel crunch eclair is less sweet than the cake",2017-12-08 05:14:47
J75kkL5sv4I6QK0gXuKWhg,orh0HRUNCWuQMt9Iia_osg,QNfh79NwsNnl-AngRhg2ww,4,0,0,1,"Huge fan of their lunch specials. We had three different lunch specials, and one of them was okay for the price, but the other two I was quite impressed with. We made a reservation and had to change the details several times, and they were very willing to accommodate for that. They also hold their reservations for 15 minutes, which I appreciate.

Had:

Tan tan ramen and kage don? - Something like that. Spicy minced pork ramen and a bowl of chicken karage with sauce on rice. Chicken karaage with sauce on rice was delicious. Chicken was tender. Sauce was lovely. Minced pork ramen was not particularly impressive. I wouldn't have ordered it at all had my grandfather not wanted something spicy. It wasn't particularly spicy either. Mildly spicy.

Chef's choice of 2 kinds of daily grilled fish ($14.80) - Yesterday's daily grilled fishes were horse mackerel and yellowfin tuna. For that price, I was very impressed with the portions of fish they gave us. The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. The flesh was moist and the skin was crispy. The sauce that came with it was slightly sweet, salty, and tangy. I'm not sure whether the mountain yam was supposed to be a palate cleanser, but it works well as one. Served with rice.

Kingyo's assorted delux bento ($17) - Their most expensive lunch set, and for good reason. According to their menu, they only serve 10 of these sets every day. This was the reason I went to Kingyo. I desperately wanted one of these bentos. The picture of this on their menu beautiful. I was hoping that reality lived up to the picture. When I made my reservation, I asked if I could reserve these bentos. They said yes! I reserved 3 (we had 5 people). When it came, I was actually so excited. Including the rice and the standard side dishes, there were 12 dishes on that lunch tray! There was a small dish of spicy salmon salad (I wish this was chunkier, and less of a mushy consistency), a slice of rolled omelette with sweet sauce (the one that came with all the other lunch sets did not have sweet sauce), a slice of braised pork belly atop what seemed to be thin mashed potatoes mixed with some incredible tasting sauce, a mixed greens salad with pickled daikon shreds and a few slices of red radish, two huge pieces of chicken karaage, a single fried shrimp (tempura style, but not the long tempura shrimp), two slices of beef tataki atop mixed greens and fried garlic chips (one of the best pieces of beef tataki I've ever had), and two deep fried mashed potato balls. Given the assortment of dishes and the quality of each dish, I'd rather eat this over eating AYCE. So many things to try!

*All lunch specials come with with pickled radish and carrot, a slice of steamed egg omelette, and a small dish of marinated baby bok choy. All save for the tan tan ramen were served with miso soup as well.*

Service was pretty good. They have a 3rd anniversary event going on where each $10 we spent we got 1 chance to play their lottery wheel. Each chance wins (even if it's a sample pack of shampoo and conditioner). We got a lot of those.

I'll be back. Yum.",2015-12-26 16:27:09

First off, we had to wait over 20 minutes to have a waitress coming over and ask is if we wanted something to drink. We had time to even select our food since his waiting was so long!

Even if we asked to the waitress if the foie gras and the Brie were sweet and she answered by the negative, we could not imagine anything sweeter than those 2 appetizers. Watch out if you are diabetic! 

On top of that, she got one of our 2 simple appetizer wrong and they brought us a wrong one.

After we complained about the extremely sweet dishes we had, we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. Both of my husband and I have felt sick to our stomach the entire evening following our visit at One! Imagine paying a 200$ bill and be sick? Hats unacceptable!

I have never eaten here and I will just review the first 2 shows to begin with during my visits...
I first came here in November 2013 when the 1st-generation Los Angeles band, X, came to town to perform their punk music hits they released since the 1970s, with fellow punkers, The Blasters, as their opening act.  The following year, I came back to watch the 3 local bands on one night: Cherie Cherie, Man Hands, and French Girls.  Every one of them all gave a solid true professional performance each.  I believe, again, the way a venue treats a band influences the bands' level of conducts when performing a gig.  The ticket prices were fair.  The shows started on time (thanks for not being too loud).  The staff was professional and organized.  Security was there (for 'X') but not that sorely needed (there was this one guy who kept trying to get people to move a bit out of the way, as if he's worried about fire exits- one attendee did get a bit mad at him for repeatedly touching him to move.  Putting down a rope like in a movie theater might've avoided this hassle).  I am impressed that everyone was well-behaved and got along(!)  This makes my evenings leaving me feeling pleasant and relaxed- which is why I go out, to have a nice time away from the everyday antics (wink).  The bleachers were a cool idea (my preference, too, instead of on the floor/pit for my safety's sake), and I stood on it to take great photos, as well as so I could see the performers more.  They usually leave tables / chairs for small acts, but for the larger ones, you only have the bleachers if you want to sit, and of course, if you sat down, it is very unlikely you would view the stage since attendees on the pit are standing (and dancing and cheering).
I especially appreciate that upon entering the eatery/venue, that it smelled good- either food or 'sweet' like liqueur and not dirty or old.  A bonus is no smoking is permitted.  I do not drink either so I bring in my own water bottle.  I also appreciate that we're not being searched upon entry like the bigger venues- it's like visiting a club owned by a family or relative.  My paternal grandparents owned an Italian bar & restaurant, so it almost felt like the venue used to belong to them before they retired and sold to Crescent.  And, the fact that Crescent is located downtown and near the light rail stop is convenient for most.
I still return when I get invited, and I hope I continue getting A+ treatment each time (wink again).  Maybe I'll even sample the food.  Thanks for the good times Crescent and band members (thanks for enabling me to take great photos and also for the sample CD(French Girls)).  See you again soon...",2015-07-20 01:17:13

Well it was less than spectacular when it arrived at our table. Didn't look anything like the gigantic burgers covered with bacon and cheese in the photos. The burger didn't even cover the bun. Disappointment #2. HoHum! Now there were some good things about the place. The seating is very comfortable! Love the table chairs! The service was very good!

mQeOaUshKpjcfXq75POr8g,7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,4,6,3,2,"Shabu/Hotpot has always been an iffy for me due to the illusion of 'all you can eat'. Is it really 'all you can eat' if you gotta wait for reloads of meat and veggie plates? Yes and No. Sure they'll bring you plate after plate after plate but you're at the establishment's mercy.

Enter Shabu Grill. 

Aside from specialty items and desserts which i'll go into later the setup is truely all you can eat but you're still at the establishment's mercy for a few items. 

I like the way this place is setup. Three (i think) food services grade fridges are stocked with meat, seafood, and veggies as well as a carton of eggs for your impending gluttony. No more asking for that 18th plate of rib eye just to see how small the portion sizes are coming and spare the server's feet he/she's been walking all damn day. That's replace with three big-ass fridges that are kept stocked with food. I'd love to see a little more variety when it comes to the veggies but that's just me nitpicking. 

The sauce station is well stocked but VERY overwhelming. There's just so many damn choices. If you dont know what you're doing, you'll end up with some weird 'little bit of everything' sauce that tastes like a nightmare. Would be extremely if they posted a sign for recommended combinations.

Alright so now the reason for the three stars. Honestly i'd give this place a solid 3.5 if possible. Everything you need to get hot potted out the door is readily available to you at limitless quantities. Now the specialty items as well as the desserts are limited and some just need to go back to the drawing board. 

The lamb chops are a hit or miss. One person at our table didnt like them but i ended up loving them. The seasonings arent that great but the lamb itself is on the gamey side which i like. Meat stuffed mushrooms...yeah go ahead and pass on these. Fried tofu was good, not too oily, still soft and tender on the inside.

Okay i forgot what they're called but they're little fish that have been deep fried and you eat them head to tail whole. They contain roe which is why you order them. ORDER THEM! Order these tasty sons of bitches. Order six. They wont let you? Order six anyway. The manager is coming out? Good that means more hands to carry the TWELVE orders of these mofos. They called the police? Good! Have them stop by the seafood market and pick up a few more boxes of these tasty pregnant fish.

So overall go for the limitless option of hot pot, dont expect much from the specialties menu except for them fish i was talking about, and for dessert just go for the ice cream, either strawberry or vanilla. Other options are lacking. Like the coconut rice and mango i've been hearing about...lacking as in it wasnt even on the menu at time of dining.

*EDIT*
Just bumped them up one star. Saw the transaction on my card for how much this place costs. Not too shabby once the food to cost ratio is factored in.

With that said I was disappointed with the new location (yes, you might not share my feeling if you are a new customer).
First, the price is high. No, I don't expect it to be cheap but did anyone else feel that the price is still way too high for the quantity and even quality? One gets the feeling that we are paying for the move and new furniture. They like to push the seasonal menu which is fixed price. only later did we notice that they still sell sushi by menu item because a table requested that other menu.
Also, the location is boring. Also, the inside is very sterile. With the fluorescent lighting one feels like it is a hospital. I mean who wants to eat sushi under walmart lighting? They really need to soften the lighting. They should make it welcoming.
Service is OK nothing special a little slow and then rushed.
Look, one cannot take away from the sushi but value and feeling? Room for improvement if they want me back.",2015-12-24 01:36:46

The set up is a little confusing. I didn't realize that you have to order at Nami, but have the choice of sitting there or at Green next door. We opted to sit at Green, since there's much more space. One of my friends who is a strict vegan, suggested the biscuits and gravy-and almost everyone in my party ordered it. I haven't had biscuits and gravy since going meat free a few years ago so I was pretty excited about it! I also ordered their pumpkin spice mocha. It tasted like a holiday in a cup. So, so delicious.

Our order arrived not long after we got our table at Green, so service was quite quick! Our food was quite tasty! They have the market cornered on that dish! I can't find another place that has a vegetarian friendly b&g! Even my boyfriend who is a big meat eater thought it tasted good! The scramble was alright, I think I expected it to taste more like eggs than the veggie taco meat that I make at home (we're probably using the same seasonings-who knows!) It was still good, just not what I was expecting. The potatoes were phenom! Perfectly crisp on the outside! Yum.

Admittedly I have no ties to Poland whatsoever, but I've had enough Polish food in my life to know the Arizona Polish Festival must be on my to do list.  The parking lot of a Polish church in west Phoenix is the setting for this annual festival of food, beer, song and dance, families and tradition.  The atmosphere is festive, the smells are divine, and the Polish-Americans & Polish ex-pats are here on a mission to party.  My kind of crowd.

No charge for admission at this event which takes place at the Our Lady of Czestochowa (don't ask me to pronounce it) Parish on 28th Ave and Country Gables (about halfway between Greenway and Thunderbird).  Best way to get here is to go southbound on the I-17 frontage road from Greenway until you run into Country Gables.  The church is in a mostly residential neighborhood so rather than jockey amongst the residents, they encourage you to use the free shuttle service (which I did).  Park at the business complex on the northeast corner of 29th Ave and Greenway, where shuttles are coming by to take people to and from the event every 5 minutes.  They drop you off at the front entrance where you walk in and then go nuts!

Food and drinks are sold by tickets, so you'll need to get tickets at one of the many ticket booths at the event.  $1 dollar per ticket so $20 bought me 20 tickets.  The food and drink menu is prominently displayed at various spots throughout the event (including the ticket booths) so you know how many tickets you'll need in advance.  

One item on the menu at this event stood out to me (and apparently most everyone else) more than any other.  The combo platter.  Can't decide between Polish sausage, pierogis, potato pancake, or cabbage roll?  Well don't.  Just get the platter.  Total cost for this mountain of food was 14 tickets (or $14).  We're talking a GIANT polish sausage, 3 potato pierogis, a huge potato pancake with apple sauce and sour cream, and a hearty meat and rice cabbage roll all on one plate.  Trust me, this is a steal for $14.  Fantastic, hearty, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food.  The sausage and the pierogis were fantastic, and cabbage roll was ridiculously tender.  And what Polish meal would be complete without some Polish beer?  In this case, its Okocim Brewery (a brewery in Poland of course) dishing out their Polish Pilsner.  Goes down smooth and you can order by the cup or by the pitcher here.  A cup of that smooth pils worked quite nicely for me thank you very much.  And finally the desserts.  Admittedly I probably screwed this up as there were so many choices I didn't know what to pick.  I saw some warm homemade raspberry danish they'd just put on the table so I couldn't say no to that.  Next time I'll probably get the sernik (a Polish style cheesecake), or maybe the jablecznik (a Polish style apple cake).  All in all, a delicious hearty meal that left me fat and happy.

The main stage was filled with lots of singing and dancing with a Polish band belting out Polish tunes, dancers in traditional Polish attire, and what I think was even some Polish poetry reciting at times.  I had no idea what any of them were saying since I don't speak Polish, but the energy on stage (and on the dance floor where festival goers can cut loose) was contagious.  The church does their best to cram in as many seats (with as much shade) as they can squeeze into this parking lot, but I'll admit finding seating can be tough when its packed.  My advice would be to look for seating (or for one of the stand up tables) around the beer garden area.  I would also probably get here at opening on Saturday or Sunday.  I came mid afternoon at 2:30pm on Saturday and it was definitely busy.

Great event with great culinary treats and great energy.  The proceeds from the event benefit the church and for the valley's Polish community you can tell this event is like the Super Bowl for them.  And like I said, $20 should be enough for just about anyone to come have a good time and with a good meal.  If that sounds like a good use of a weekend in late February to you, I invite you to make the trip to the Polish fest.  Polska, Bialoczerwoni!",2017-02-25 23:27:43

I ordered a small vanilla gelato, rice ball with sauce, chocolate eclair and a chocolate Canolli for about 9 dollars (pretty good eh?) . I got there around 8 I clock so they didn't have any Portuguese tarts or plain Canollis left :( 

Now on to my review. The girl at the counter was pretty knowledgeable and didn't mind my question about the pastries and fillings. My gelato was delicious. Creamy, smooth and not overly sweet. The price for the size was perfect treat. The pastries were good as well better than others I've tried but still not the best. The rice ball tastes good. It has. Nice home made sauce and was stuffed with cheese and meat. I think the rice ball could use more meat and cheese. It was served to me at room temperature so I went home and warmed it up. I also added fresh cracked pepper and salt and a bit of chilli garlic hit sauce for some heat and it yummy.

And of course we need to order their famous SPECIAL ($3.90)! which is a grilled beef salami and beef bologna sandwich with mustard on a kaiser roll, pressed flat from the grill!

As the sign in the restaurant announces:

""When ordering a Special,
you should know a thing or two.
It is always served with mustard;
it is never cut in two.
Don't ask us why; just understand
that this is nothing new.
This is the way that it's been done
since 1932.""

So we ended up having our own SPECIAL since it is the way it has to be and luckily I love mustard!!

The Special is great for a snack and it is so hot!! So be careful when you bite into it!

The made to order fountain drinks with quite a few different flavours: even a chocolate one!! definitely worth ordering and believe me would go well with your sandwich!

I've tried to replicate this salad because really, it's pretty simple as far as ingredients go:  kale, romaine hearts, currants, cashews, (farro I leave out b/c I have no idea where to get it), and salmon.  See, simple.  

Two things:  the dressing and the salmon are what set it over the edge. The champagne vinaigrette is outstanding.  Side note:  they sometimes allow you to buy a cup of salad dressing to go.  
The salmon.  I don't are what I do, I can't replicate the richness of their salmon.  I just can't.

This was topped with chocolate syrup, chopped skors bars,  and cinnamon toast crunch.

Most recently, my partner and I stopped by Kennedy's on a Wednesday evening for dinner and a few drinks.  We were seated on the patio - there were maybe 4 other tables with people at them.  It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to finally approach us - and then we had a long wait between placing beer orders and actually receiving the drinks.  It wasn't busy, she knew we were there - I have no explanation for why were sitting there so long.   Unfortunately, this level of service continued throughout the dinner.

For food, we both ordered salads.  My salad came out with the wrong dressing and the chicken not prepared the way I asked.  The server who dropped off our food did just that - dropped it off and left.

The front desk staff, particularly Austin, was extremely helpful and very nice. However, I requested and informed through email and over the phone that it was my husband's birthday, as well as our six month anniversary during our stay, and was informed that there would be something waiting for us. There was nothing even mentioned by any of the staff, let alone anything waiting. Normally I would not care about this, but we intentionally did not bring any wine or champagne to celebrate, and upon arrival, had to leave the hotel to go retrieve some in order for us to celebrate our six month anniversary. Like I said, this would not have been a problem had I been informed that the resort does not celebrate things like that, and we would have been prepared on our own.

Also, the bellman Mike, was very rude to us. We rented a bicycle from the resort in the early morning, rode around Old Town most of the day, and then returned the bike to our room before we had to leave for dinner. After we got back from dinner, we took the bike back up to the front, and my husband decided to ride it instead of walking next to it. At this point, it was around 8:30 pm, and we had had a couple of celebratory drinks at dinner. My husband accidentally hit the curb, resulting in no damage to the bicycle, and instead of Mike asking if he was okay, he said loudly enough for all guests waiting outside for their cars, ""That's why we tell you to return the bikes by 6 pm."" I made sure my husband was okay, and then told him that we were not informed it needed to be back by 6 pm. He said, ""Well that's not my problem."" Now, I understand that Mike and the other bellmen have to deal with plenty of people who have been drinking, but this is absolutely no way that we should have been treated. My husband said he did not want to stay here again, solely because of Mike, if that is who FireSky employs. We are spending our hard-earned money there, choosing to stay at your resort over the many others that are available in Old Town.

The property is beautiful and we really enjoyed having our dogs with us one of the nights that we stayed there, but these simple things are things that matter to customers, specifically us. That simple interaction between Mike and us gave us a horrible taste in our mouths for this resort. We would have recommended the resort to others, but now I am not sure that I would send my friends there if they are going to have the same interaction as us.""

That was an email that I sent to a general manager after we received an email from her asking about our stay, which is why it is extremely in detail about the situations we had.

Like I said in the email, Austin and the rest of the front desk staff were fabulous. They were extremely nice and even more helpful. I would have given 5 stars had the situation with the bellman not happened. The property is great, with a fire pit and large pool area for their guests. The rooms were good, not great, but we also may have been where only dogs are allowed, as we had our two dogs with us. Which was really great since we had no one to care for them for one night of our stay. They have plenty of area for the dogs to use the restrooms, and most other guests are happy to see the dogs around.

Overall, we may be back, but it will just depend on the situation, like if we are bringing the dogs. I will update my review if I get an email back from the manager.",2014-11-04 22:03:50

They have containers that hold plastic bags to pick up dog waste, but it didn't seem as though the town supplied the bags- the containers were filled with plastic shopping bags from Fresh N Easy, Safeway, Fry's, etc so maybe the patrons bring a supply each time they come to pitch in?

The Valet was easy to use as long as you don't lose your ticket.

There was a faint smell of horse/farm animal you just couldn't escape even inside and I had to wonder if that is just a side effect of having some many cowboy events there but after a few hours my nose got used to it and I was able to enjoy my time there.

It gets really loud when they're singing, so if you're a conversational type you'll prefer other venues for sure.

It broke my heart to see the bird WALKING around the fenced in dog area so I picked it up and brought it home with me. I did a search for veterinarians that take in wild animals. The first place I called said that they don't do it and gave me the name of this place. I called and was able to bring in the bird right away. After the veterinarian (I didn't catch her name) performed a free exam, she said the bird didn't have any injuries, just loss of feathers, and would be okay to release back into the wild. I really appreciate a vet that actually cares about animals and not just about money. I've always taken my dog to a different vet a few miles up the road but plan on switching to this one when my dog needs her next exam or treatment.",2015-09-29 02:21:21

i went to parlour based on a friends recommendation and though i was skeptical it would be another artsy fartsy pretentious hair salon where i'd get half my hair shaved off, it turned out to be the opposite. it's conveniently located at queen st. west & ossington, 20 seconds from the streetcar stop. from the outside you'd think parlour was a small salon but it's actually quite large, extending to the back. very spacious and modern, great decor and a very friendly, personable receptionist.

my appointment was with Jay. i explained my situation to him and he was understanding in relating to my haircut anxiety and inexperience with hairdressers. i was worried that my hair would turn out too short but what Jay did was actually quite wonderful. he layered my hair in such a manner that gave not only my hair shape but made features of my face stand out, like my eyes and cheekbones. his execution was immaculate in that he took his time (an hour for medium length hair!) with each section of my hair to perfect the cut. he was also very down-to-earth and friendly, very easy to communicate with. overall, we had a great time and he explained to me how to upkeep my hair and when to get it re-cut.

after i paid (which was reasonable) i felt really good about my new hair. i was slightly worried that if i washed my hair and didn't style it like Jay did it wouldn't be such a great haircut. however, it's been weeks and my hair is still wonderful. i don't have to invest a lot of time to get it to look good or ""co-operate"" as some people would put. i can blowdry my hair and walk out of the house without my layers looking wavy or mullet-like. it's a nice haircut and i will definitely be seeing Jay again.

I don't frequent it that often, but when I do, it sure feels like a mini-class reunion.  Always good to catch up with those you have known for more years than one cares to count.

My recent trip to the Taproom is one I hope to repeat over and over.  Thursday is Blues Night.  I had no idea what to expect, but the music and musicians were so vibrant, and engaging. It was almost impossible not to be drawn into the soul reaching energy they were expressing and exposing so powerfully.   The smooth connections these musicians have with one another is so beautifully displayed and performed.

If you love the blues, and appreciate fine talent, then clear your calendar for Thursday nights at the Taproom.  I know I certainly plan to do so.  Sorry my schedule didn't allow me to know about it sooner.",2017-07-01 03:03:54

Others have pointed out the decor, so I won't beat a dead horse, but I will say that Windsor stands out from the modern-meets-rustic vibe that seems to characterize many of the newer additions to Phoenix (Parlor, St. Francis, etc.). While it has some similar design elements, it has some unique touches that make it a striking spot - I'm particular fond of the vivid green color used on the bar and the wall of cassette tapes (remember those?) leading up to the bathroom. 

While I'm glad it was happy hour when we arrived (around 1:30pm), I have to say that the Postino HH window (11-5) isn't a good fit for a place that has a full bar. Since Windsor has drinks, I would hope that they would introduce a more post-work-appropriate happy hour at some point soon. That said, again, I was very thrilled to be able to get $5 Bloody Marys and they were made absolutely perfectly. 

Our food was also very enjoyable, especially the mac and cheese. Gourmet mac and cheese has become about as exciting and unique as bruschetta but this mac and cheese was perfection with the perfect combination of savory cheeses and a savory crispy topping. I also thought the halibut banh mi was delicious (although I can't help but think of the Vietnamese joints where you can get a sandwich like this for ~$8 bucks) and the kale Caesar was crisp and had great texture. 

The only real food disappointment was the deviled egg dip which had bacon mixed in, despite not indicating that on the menu. Sorry, but in this day and age, you really need to clearly label if your food items contain meat, especially if it's pork product. 

Finally, I thought the service was enthusiastic but spotty. There were some things we wanted but didn't get in a timely fashion, so some improvement could definitely be made there. All in all, though, I really liked my experience at Windsor and will definitely be back.",2011-08-30 05:01:14

I lived in the South Side for a few years, and I would eat at Michael's every weekend.

Even after I moved to the North Side, I would still try to make the trip for the best pizza in Pittsburgh. 

While the restaurant itself isn't fancy, modern, or fussy (although they underwent some minor renovations in the past 2 years), the food is crave worthy. As appetizers go, it's hard to go wrong with the twistees. Ahhh, the twistees. Michael's delicious dough twisted into golden ribbons, dusted with Parmesan and baked until perfect. Served with the best pizza sauce I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. The hockey puck is also a pretty excellent prelude to your pizza. A seasoned, golden brown fried chunk of deliciousness shaped like a...well, you get the idea.  The pizza is perfection. The sauce is outrageously good, the cheese is a great quality, creamy blend, and the dough is consistently perfectly cooked. I could eat a whole pizza, it's THAT good.

Since the very first interaction, the office staff was rude and condescending. 

We scheduled a visit after a sport-related injury for my husband. The day before, we received the ER diagnosis that stated my husband had a partially torn Achilles' tendon but we had no X-Rays documentation because the ER rep forgot to include them in our packet.

The office insisted that we take X-ray again to provide the proper diagnosis (again).  Since we have insurance and it was only $15 we agreed.

They took my husband in an office while he waited for what we thought was going to be the X-ray examination but they never took X-rays; the doctor walked in and, without the Xray, told my husband his tendon was completely torn (although the foot moved when he pulled the tendon) and advised surgery right away to prevent issues. 

Since most doctors push for unnecessary surgeries so they can bill big money through insurance companies (especially ours, which is a premium plan and we would have to pay very little money), my husband started asking questions regarding pros and cons. 

Long story short, the cons ALL outweighed the pros, but the doctor still insisted on scheduling surgery, while the doctor at the ER the night before stated it was not going to be necessary. 

Some staff members were shouting profanities in Spanish (thinking we don't understand? why would assume so on the West side of the USA?) and overall their demeanor was disrespectful. My husband's foot was placed in a boot and none gave us instructions on what to do. They scheduled a follow-up for three weeks. If the surgery was necessary, would you schedule a follow up almost a month later?

Given the awful circumstances, we decided to get a second opinion. 

Since I had left my husband for a while while paying the copays, prepping other paperwork, and restroom break, I had assumed they had taken the X-rays. But then my husband informed me that no, despite a whole lot of fuss and pressure on their part, none took care of that. 

I went back inside and asked them why I had been charged for X-rays they never ended up taking so the only person who had a brain and some manners, Michelle, refunded the card and apologized.

Whether he needs surgery or not, I would never put my husband's foot in their ... feet, because that's apparently how they run this office",2016-04-14 22:52:57

This restaurant is a case of trying to be too much at once IMO.

Yu Seafood is a mix of a dim sum restaurant, seafood place, and a fish market all at once. It's certainly on the upscale end, and it shows with the price you pay here.

I went here for dim sum on a Sunday afternoon and there was about a 15-20 min wait. Their dim sum menu isn't extensive at all, with items such as curry squid noticeably absent. Some items I ordered include the typical har gow and siu mai, as well as beef balls, omasum, shrimp rice roll, and beef rice rolls.

Nothing really stood out to be honest, both good or bad. It was a passable place with a lot of neat decor and food that's good but nothing to write home about. A little unfortunate given the price paid unfortunately.

The washrooms here are quite unique. It's upstairs and there's a bunch of individual stalls instead of a common gender washroom. Quite similar to Japan if you think of it that way.

Service is, as documented from previous reviews, poor and disorganized. The servers kept forgetting to bring us various items ranging from teapots to chopsticks. Also some servers speak Mandarin and others Cantonese, so you do have to keep an eye if you only speak one of the two languages.

I'll probably not return here unless asked to, there are better dim sum places for the same price (or even lower). Maybe I'll come for dinner though...",2017-09-15 03:58:28

We've eaten there twice and the first time around everything was a hit. No issues with the food or the service.  The second time around... the food was still pretty good. The grilled chicken nachos were pretty greasy. the chicken... although flavorful was fatty and this set the tone for the rest of the meal.  Wasn't horrible.. just could have been better.

We started with a tasting of three sakes and three appetizers from Sasa, which were all interesting and very delish! The variety of the sake ranged from dry to sweet and milky. The finger foods were matched well and the perfect treat. We then walked through the exhibit and thoroughly enjoyed reading the history behind this genre of art and history we had not previously studied.

I want to because I want to make popping in my mouth - I can get that for .35 at the store. 

I get that sushi restaurants feel like they HAVE to have crazy rolls to bridge the gap for those who do not eat sushi, but they should just let their sushi speak for itself. Not hide it behind bells and whistles which is how I felt with their rolls here.

I know, how could I forget?? This place is really nice and if cake didn't mean a ton of calories I would be here more often! :D

Located near Finch station, this is a little cafe and cake shop above a korean restaurant. You need to go up a short set of stairs and then you have arrived...in a very princess-y, royal-looking, cutesy place! They have a few couches for the bigger groups and then tables for the smaller groups. Pretty clean and neat place.

They have a few cake selections available and also a ton of other drinks and desserts in their menu. For a small place I think it's still nice to have a good amount of variety and this place does, if not, more. So far, with the cakes I have tried, I don't have any complaints :) drinks are decent as well!

I have never had any issues with service. Or maybe I'm just lucky to always come at a time when it isn't busy. Waiters and waitresses are nice, they do their job and check back on you occassionally.

Once they were done we both decided to order a quesadilla each.  There was a younger boy and and another guy in in his 20's working behind the counter.  Both of them were super slow while preparing our meals.  The younger guy was quite literally the slowest person I've ever had serve me, with no sense of urgency. As my friend's quesadilla was being made by the older boy, she had questions about her meal and the guy behind the counter was rude to her.  A few times he responded and she asked him to repeat himself and he seemed upset. His whole demeanor was as if he didn't want us there at all. I understand that they might have been slow because they were waiting on an ingredient, but neither of the two ever said that. The two behind the counter seemed like they didn't know what they were doing either.

After they finally finished preparing our quesadillas the manager came out and said that the machine to cook the quesadilla would take about 20 minutes to complete, and that because of their systems being down our meals would be on them. We decided since their machines were down and we had only half of our orders that we would come back to pick them up in a few minutes. 

Of course, we had to wait for them to make another couple of quesadillas for us with the same crappy service.  (I understand their reasoning for making another one - food-born illness and letting food get too warm or too cold) 

We found out after receiving our lunch that all Qdobos are closing their doors in a short amount of time, but that shouldn't negate even the smallest amount of service.  The manager was the only person in that restaurant who actually cared about her customers. I wish her well after the closing of this store, but I have to give this location only two stars based on the horrible customer service of the two guys behind the counter, and the fact that they comped our meal.",2016-07-19 04:02:59

Plenty of staff were manning the counters during a recent visit with my boyfriend, so our food was prepared in a timely fashion.  However, 2 different employees made our burritos, and I'd say that there was some inconsistency in technique: his was flat and floppy, mine was stout and compact.  I see the same differences at other made-to-order places (like Subway), so that might not be a fair criticism.

In terms of complaints from other Yelpers about time and efficiency, I admit that Chipotle edges out Panchero's, but the additional minute or two required to put together a burrito didn't seem unreasonable.  The time delay might be more problematic during meal crunch times; not sure that Chipotle is much better considering their lines of 20+ students when school is in session.

I can't complain about food quality, especially for fast food.  Tortillas are pressed and cooked at the time of your order, which is kind of fun to watch.  I think their rice differs from the lime-cilantro recipe, but I couldn't discern any specific flavor, either.  The grilled meats and veggies are tasty, and you are offered your choice of standard toppings: pico de gallo, corn salsa, tomato salsa, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  When I requested a little more rice or salsa, employees loaded up my burrito without complaint or extra charges.   Before wrapping up your burrito, they use small spatulas to mix together ingredients so that each bite is a ""perfect"" mix of everything.

For local folk who don't have the patience for the student crowds in campustown, Panchero's is a fine alternative to Chipotle.  Prices, food quality, and environment are comparable.  Their fresh-made tortillas are a nice touch, but I'm not sure they make much of a difference in terms of flavor.",2011-07-09 15:45:44

On Friday ~7:00pm, we waited about 15 minutes to get seated. I absolutely love the smell of Korean BBQ. We ordered Family Combo #2 (non-marinated meat) and I was in meatlovers heaven. I'm pretty OCD about cooking Korean BBQ but the service here was so good that I didn't even have to lift a finger.

We started with the brisket, which cooks so quickly and is perfect when you're getting hangry. They served it with sushi rice and wasabi, which I found to be quite interesting and delicious as well. Next was the outside skirt, an average cut in my opinion. By this point, the steamed egg and bean paste stew had also arrived. The stew was so good!

The best meats were next - pork belly and pork jowl. The pork belly was cut fairly thick and had a little bit of dry seasoning. Both types of pork took a while to cook and was cooked with a sprig of rosemary. I've had pork belly many times in my life and this was a very memorable time. It server cooked it to level of crispiness that I like. It was everything I could've hoped for with pork belly.

We were so stuffed at this point and the combo also includes dessert. We each had half of large rice pop green tea ice cream sandwich. What a great ending to an awesome meal.",2017-05-30 22:59:27

KaKa is in beta testing. 

I went to the Markham location hoping for a familiar experience downtown. 

I came here wanting to binge on aburi (blowtorched) sushi, and the restaurant delivered. Compared with my last visit to the Markham location, I can say that objectively, the quality of the food is better.  The sashimi came in nice large chunks and they didn't skimp on ingredients for the sushi.  However, keep in mind that the menus are a bit different and there are fewer items available downtown. 

The service is where things felt glitchy: some of our ordered were duplicated, they were missing some items from the menu, we asked for tea and received hot water instead, and some orders took a long time. Surprisingly, it was the aburi sushi that came out the quickest. 

Overall, this restaurant has a lot of potential. I'll definitely be back once they've ironed out the k",2018-04-08 21:58:26

Yeah I know steak at a seafood place strange right?  Well she forgot my sides to go with my steak, so that made me upset but I went on with it and waited until I got everything that I ordered with my meal.

I really liked the mungbean ""soup"" that they served instead of water, it supposedly helps cool your body. The soup was served cold, not too sweet, very refreshing. 

My sister wanted to try the intestine noodle which they said were sold out, then she wanted the short rib noodle which was also sold out. So she decided on beef noodle which she really enjoyed. Said noodle was chewy and tasted fresh, broth was flavorful. I was not in the mood for spicy food so I got the wontons which I really liked. The soup was plain, not bland, plain...which tasted very healthy, perfect for late meal. The wontons were flavorful so I thought the overall dish was great, the plain broth complimented the flavorful wonton. I would definitely come back for more and to try other dishes. 

Cons:
- They did not have the two dishes that my sister came to try (I personally feel that when you are new you want to be on point and have your most interesting items in stock all the time so everyone who comes in can try your best items)
- The menu was wrong all over the place, they have the same description for different dishes which is misleading when it is your first time there and is trying to know the menu

The plate of veggies/aromatics had no Jalapeños and no Basil. Instead there was fresh Cilantro on the plate - I've eaten Pho at a lot of places - I've never seen that. I asked for Jalapeños and Basil - apparently they serve neither. The lady who was serving me seemed confused, I told her that the vast majority of Pho places I go to serve/offer both of those items with Pho. About 5 minutes later she comes out with a small bowl with some sliced chilies - they looked like they were some sort of Thai or Serrano chile pepper. Whatever they were - they were very spicy! Just the way I like it! She seemed surprised that I took the entire amount she brought and dumped it into the broth.

The broth was very different than most of the Pho I am used to eating. I could characterize it as being somewhat ""rustic."" Not bad - just different. Chicken was tender. Noodles were not clumped. Cilantro, Bean Sprouts, and Lime - all appeared fresh.

Cons:
- No Jalapeños and no Basil
- The bottle of Sriracha sauce was obviously stored in a refrigerator. I prefer my Sriracha to be room temperature. There really isn't any reason to refrigerate Sriracha IMHO.
- I hope 35 minutes is not the average to get a bowl of Pho here. That's a long wait for a bowl of Pho!",2011-11-06 21:28:45

The wait wasn't terribly long, and while we waited we were served drinks--clever idea. The restaurant itself is small, probably better suited for a fast food joint; this is is probably why it's appears so full. There is an outdoor patio, but it doesn't add a whole lot to the limited space.

Anywho, I'm not the biggest fan of pizza/pasta joints; but for my first Arizona pizza, this place was top notch. We ordered the antipasto (my tablet autocorrected that to angioplasty, lmao) and 18 inch half numero one-o and pepperoni pizza. I can't stand pepperoni pizza, but this was the best one I ever tried. It had the perfect crust, cheese, and right amount of sauce without the pepperoni overwhelming everything. My boyfriend is picky about his salad, but he gobbled up quite a bit of the antipasto. The baked cookie dessert was yummy and a great size for four stuffed people just to cleanse the palate a little.  With plenty of leftovers, our bill came out to under $50 (not including drinks from the wait). Good deal.",2013-11-02 22:48:33

The Pavilion is actually on the top floor of the parking garage, which is definitely a unique place to put rooms! The bad - the exterior looks like a Soviet bunker / Goldeneye level (complete with massive honking boxy CCTV cameras from the 90s) and you're not getting a view of anything you'd want to see. The good - the actual room interiors are pretty nice and, most importantly, all that parking garage concrete makes it QUIET. No Stompy McFeet above you and a nice layer in between you and the next rooms. You're far enough off Fremont to not get blasted out by the Experience speakers, though during my stay there was intermittent really loud bass from some building on the OTHER side of the property until around 10 PM, though I dunno if that was just like a one-time concert/party or a regular nightly thing. 

There is a resort fee, something like $13-15, about half what the big properties ask now. That gets you good wifi, a mini-fridge, two small water bottles and a variety of mints on your pillow. Probably a pool somewhere, I don't think there was a fitness center. The rooms have Keurig machines but you're billed $5 for opening the pack of three cups they leave -- nothing stopping you from bringing your own though! 

Now, this definitely isn't for a plush Vegas getaway, as the rooms are basic and the casino itself is an older, locals-focused smokey property with not a lot to do or for dining options. But for a cheap place to sleep at the right rate? Right on.

Tip for those interested in the free weekly NFL pick ems around town, though I don't know if this will carry over to next season - Station Casinos runs the sportsbook here, though they don't own the El Cortez itself and the property still has its own player's card. Station put a few of their NFL pick 'em kiosks in here, but they don't seem to tie into the other Station properties as they don't accept Station cards ... you have to use your El Cortez card and it's a completely new entry! I discovered this late in the season and wasn't sure if dual entries would jam you up somehow, so I left it alone, but it looks like you can maybe have two different entries in the Station contest by doing one here and one at their mainstream properties?",2016-12-08 00:39:52

I really want to love this place, but something seems a tiny bit off. I'm confused by the demographic they're trying to cater to. Is it the ASU crowd? Professional crowd? Laid back? Fun?

Positives:
GREAT beer selection
Really good food
Bartenders are really nice
Cool layout, except for the area where they allow dogs (outside)
Awesome patio/deck area
Service is pretty good

Negatives:
Mixed drinks are a bit expensive for what you get (very small portions). Of course it's a brewery, so maybe that's why
Deck/patio is awesome but they allow cigar smoking, so it's not fun trying to eat your delicious meal with smelly cigar wafting in your face
The outside game area where dogs are allowed smells like dog piss

Also, the last time I went, my husband and I stopped in for a quick meal with our toddler. We ordered a bunch of food and our bill was pretty high. I noticed when we were leaving that the manager ran over to our table and checked to make sure we paid (he grabbed the leather check holder) and didn't walk out on our check. That was a bit annoying and insulting. 

Overall:
It's a good place to eat/drink, but I'd recommend waiting for cooler weather and enjoying their amazing front patio - back patio is smoking. Plan on ordering beer (great selection) unless you want to overpay for cocktails that are small and a bit watered down. Try the mac n cheese for a nice spin on an old recipe.",2015-08-11 03:38:24

Great Happy Hour and great Happy Hour prices. I opted for the Moroccan Salmon which was also a large portion.

I made reservations via Bellagio's website and under special comments/notes, I wrote ""celebrating a 21st birthday."" Prime is kind of hard to get to if you're taking the tram from Monte Carlo/Aria. Ladies, it's a bit of a walk in heels. It's not so bad if you're coming off the main street from Caesar's Palace. The view of the fountain from inside the restaurant is amazing.

+/- the wedge and the Caesar salad is nothing special
+ peach salad with goat cheese (pretty interesting combination)
+ corn bisque (with popcorn lobster, odd but it worked)
- porterhouse (unfortunately I had been waiting all week for this cut of meat, but it let me down. The NY strip was so dry and there was so much butter on it. The filet however, was good.)
+ bone-in filet (I wish I ordered this special because it looked so good)
+/- ribeye (standard)
+ truffle mash potatoes (it's as good as the hype)
- crunchy potatoes (really? I need to reread who recommended this, it's definitely not worth your money)
+ fritters
+ broccoli
+ creamed corn (OMG so good)
+ free birthday lava cake and ice cream :)

* You don't have to dress up. Jeans and a polo shirt will do. On their website it says business casual and at the door it says jacket preferred, but if you call them, they'll confirm jeans and polo shirt is fine (even on a Saturday night.)

Super salty + the fries themselves were slightly over fried (on extreme high heat OR old oil) The flavour was okay but the presentation for both was underwhelming.

I'd walked by this joint many, many times before, but on this particular day I was messing around with the Ritual app and noticed a listing for Tacorrito. Done.

I decided to go with a medium pulled pork burrito, which I had stuffed with lime cilantro rice, black beans, sautéed vegetables, hot salsa, and guacamole. (The latter of which I had to pay extra for. Sigh.)

I'll admit the first couple of bites were quite impressive. The hot-all-the-way-through burrito seemed to have a good amount of each component, and the pulled pork was quite tender and tasty. But as I got further and further into the wrapped concoction, I began to notice a preponderance of the aforementioned lime cilantro rice and my enthusiasm began to wane considerably. There were a few bites there that seemed to be only rice, and the burrito itself began to fall apart in the middle due to an overuse of this particular ingredient.

It's a shame, really, because this did have the potential to become an above-average example of food item that's long-since saturated the Toronto market. (I especially enjoyed the sautéed veggies, which should totally be a more prominent element within these types of burritos.)",2017-06-22 16:20:24

I'm not sure if there's any numbers to back it up, but they've got to be one of the fastest reviewed placed in Vegas this year. Only 2 months in to being open, they've gotten well over 100 reviews, and nearly every one is positive. Rightfully so though. My check-ins will show I've probably been here way too much, and we've already started working on our 4th stamp card. I imagine that's nothing compared to some people though, as this place is almost always packed!

Aside from having an excellent product, BTB has some of the best service you can find in this city, by far. Sou, Louis and Dennis are not only extremely passionate about their product, but are dedicated to providing outstanding customer service. It didn't take but a couple times of us coming in here before they knew all of our names, and remembered both mine and Deegan's drink. I know for a fact they are seeing a bunch of people everyday, so little things like that are what people are going to remember. They may not be from Vegas, but they are making this a locals spot like no other. 

As I mentioned, we've been here a lot and been able to try a good amount from the menu. There are a few things though that I really can't stay away from. The cold brew is absolutely delicious, and BTB is definitely not afraid to make it strong. I've gotten it on it's own to take home, and while it's not the best by itself, the addition of sea salt creme makes it incredibly addicting. Thankfully I don't have near the sensitivity to caffeine as most do and can down a large one of these, with less ice of course, no problem. I like the bold coffee flavor that has virtually no bitterness from being cold brewed, and the addition of sea salt and honey boba makes for what I think is one of the most perfectly balanced boba drinks in town. 

That's not to say there other drinks aren't equally as good though. Deegan's favorite drink is the Hokkaido Milk Tea, which is extremely creamy with a caramel/toffee flavor. Their Okinawa Milk Tea and Coffee Milk Tea are two of my other favorites, and I'm even more of a fan of their other Lattes, specifically the Black Tea and Oolong Tea varieties. 

So far, there hasn't been anything I've tried that I didn't like. And if that just so happens to be the case with your drink, it won't matter much as the guys at BTB will remake it for you anyway. They proudly stand behind their product 100% and if you don't like what you got, they will either adjust it, or get you a new drink without blinking an eye. 

If you're not a fan boba or tea fan, BTB also has fresh made to order crepes. You can watch your crepe being made right after you order it, and while we've only tried one, the ""PB"", it was delicious and recommended. It's packed full of peanut butter, banana and strawberry. The crepe is light, sweet and is even better with an iced cold tea alongside it. You can also customize your crepe like you can the drinks, and make it just how you like.

Fish fry night. Under $10. How can that be passed up on? 

The cod was firm yet tender. The breading was near perfect. Not heavy. Not oily. And it had to be more than a pound! The fries were nothing special. 

Server was very attentive and polite.

They had a live band playing. The acoustics in here are not the best. But, the band was decent. And, there were many couples having a blast out on the dance floor. Good for them. It made it fun to hang out and chill.

Not really a young person hang out. Most of the dancers were easily 40+. One guy cutting a rug on almost every song had to be at least 80. That man had moves.

Dessert was offered (read my other reviews) so, of course we had to reward the effort. Chocolate cobbler. Two words that I didn't think went together. Boy was I wrong. Amazing flavor. Nice texture. A bit lean with the scoop of ice cream. But, for $6 this rivals the pizza cookies popular in a lot of restaurants.

The soup bases are all very flavorful, and the noodles have great texture, not to mention the unlimited noodle refill. Great for a student budget. 

I usually get the shredded pork and pickled cabbage soup. Usually, the meatiness of the soup would be covered by the pickled cabbage taste, but here, you can distinctively taste the pork, and it's delicious. I've also tried the spicy and sour soup, but that one tasted a bit more artificial. You get a standard set of toppings in little dishes that you mix into the boiling cauldron of soup first, followed by the bowl of noodles. The noodles gradually soak up the flavors from the soup. One order of noodles is more than enough to satisfy most people. The popcorn chicken and smashed cucumber in garlic sauce are good choices for sides.

I admit that my visit began with a twinge of disappointment.  My first two visits in previous years included an amazing grilled-cheese and bacon sandwich that seemed to be absent from the new (to me) menu.  However, I decided to be open to change, and give the half-size mac and cheese with bacon (OK, maybe not THAT open to change) a go.

While waiting, I ordered a whisky sour and my boyfriend ordered a pint of Creemore.  Unfortunately for me, the whisky sour was a little too light on the whisky and a little too heavy on the sour.  I might as well have been drinking straight bar lime.  If ordering drinks, stick to beer or wine, because this isn't the first time I've found the mixed-drink experience to be kind of sub-par.

Our food arrived promptly, and looked wonderful.  My boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of fries, and it arrived on a wooden tray with a really neat sandwich rack resting on top.  My mac and cheese came in a miniature casserole dish and smelled heavenly.

As for taste?  It was out of this world.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and each bite was cheesy and creamy and bread-crumby and oh so delicious.  They put shallots in their mac and cheese, so there is a distinct onion flavour, but it doesn't overpower the other flavours of the dish.  They did not skimp on the bacon, which is plus considering that it costs $3 to add to the dish.  The half size was the exact right amount of food, and I left feeling full but not uncomfortably stuffed. 

Before tip, the bill for two entrees and two drinks came to $48, which is reasonable for food of this caliber.

The restaurant is comfortable, and in the good weather the front windows are thrown wide open leaving the front few tables exposed to the sites and sounds of Queen Street East.  The downside?  My boyfriend and I are both really sensitive to cigarette smoke.  As pleasant as it would be to sit and watch the world go by while we enjoyed the delicious meal that Prohibition offered, we had to make sure to sit as far back as we could, away aroma that lingers throughout the front of the restaurant.

The service was good, but nothing to write home about.  I found we were sitting around for a long time after finishing, and eventually had to flag down a waiter to wrap up our leftovers and bring us our bill.

The Good
- Great looking spot in the esplanade, right off the ground-level parking behind the escalators
- Comfortable seating (we sat at a two-top)
- Nice, dim lighting
- Excellent food.  His chicken street and my barbacoa short rib tacos were outstanding
- Free homemade chips and salsa
- Nice happy hour pricing

The Bad
- The red sangria was horrid. There wasn't any fruit in my friend's glass.  The wine tasted cheap and not at all fruity like a sangria should.
- The music belonged in a nightclub, not a casual establishment in CenPho.  Like my friend said, they need to create an identity for this place and play music that suits it, not just blast some loud house crap.
- The music was WAY TOO LOUD.

  When my appetite is burning for a delicious hero, Firehouse extinguishes the fire. Just this weekend alone when I was spending a lot of time in the Sunset Station area, I visited the local Firehouse.

   This Firehouse is in the far end of the Mark's Street Walmart Supercenter Shopping Center. The upshot is that parking could be an annoyance. The parking lot is busy. On the other hand, inside Firehouse was busy on Friday night where it was dead on Sunday afternoon. Regardless, they make the sandwich from scratch and it takes a few minutes. If your the kind of person that gets fired up about waiting, the neat firehouse theme might put some water on the flame. Firehouse was started by real firemen. And that fact shows in the attention to detail from the wall to the trash can. There is even a donation jar for firemen. Besides, if you order a combo you can snack on the chips, brownie, or cookie. Firehouse features the Coke Freestyle machine.

  At Firehouse you can get the combo medium or large. Regardless of size, the price is slightly large. For close to $10, they really should serve the large size. With that said, a half star deduction for a price that would be too high with a large upgrade. Similar to the price, the taste and amount is large. I ordered the meat ball sub on Friday and the Engineers Club on Sunday. The meatball sub smoked away the sub I recently chowed down in New York -New York and is a few steps up the ladder above Subway's meatball marinara. The texture, temperature, and quality was just right. Over and above the meatball sub, I appreciated the Engineer's Club. This is a delicious sub with the same wheat or white bread option that Firehouse offers. The Engineer's Club is loaded with turkey, swiss cheese, mushrooms with tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, and other ingredients. 

  When it comes to the sub industry, the fires always been burning. People love subs and the landscape is full of sub shops. Firehouse is one of the better sub chains. When I am chowing down an Engineer's Club, I can honestly say ""My taste buds are on fire.""",2015-07-20 04:37:10

I still haven't worked up the confidence to dine alone, so I opted to call for take out. I checked their menu out online, and I noticed that they have made some changes and I was excited about all the new additions. I decided to order the Steak & Sushi, as well as the Apple Pie for dessert. I arrived to pick it up (around 10PM) and waited about 5 minutes for the hostess to grab the food. In that time, I had 2 separate people ask me if I had been helped, which was nice, as I am used to JOEY having pretty awful service. When I got home I was delighted. The steak was cut into strips, which made it super easy to eat. It had a soy/teriyaki type of glaze, and was cooked to medium rare perfection. The sushi was their rainbow roll, and was extremely fresh and plentiful. I worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but I was wrong, it was very filling. I wish they would have provided chopsticks, but not a big deal - I already had some at home. The Apple Pie was HUGE. I could only eat half, but it was sooo good. A bit too much puff pastry, but it was very good. I was really impressed, take out only took 20 minutes and cost $30 (a little steep but I was feeling indulgent). I feel like JOEY is working on their service and their food, so I'll be back to give them another try - perhaps to face my fear and dine alone!",2013-02-27 18:25:25

It has an art gallery INSIDE and I thought I saw a small auditorium. This library is 2 stories, upstairs has the kid's reading section and adult fiction. Non-fiction was downstairs.

I took their orders Thursday night and rolled into work early Friday to place the order for delivery. Free delivery, I might add. Our order arrived right on time. Combined, we had the corned beef hash, an omelet, two orders of eggs, the bacon and their turkey sausage; the four of us split an order of pumpkin pancakes I ordered the corned beef and was expecting the masticated variety common in greasy spoons, so I was a little in a ""huh"" moment. However, the cubed corned beef was very filling but there were green peppers in the potatoes and I always belch those up for hours. My coworkers all indicated their food was good. While we also were very excited about the pancake, it wasn't quite are amazing as we expected--half of the pancake was borderline burnt. Perhaps if we'd eaten that first it would have been better? I'll still be trying that again.

We pull up in ONE car and asked where we can park. We were told it was valet. This is incorrect as there IS self parking.  Valet is $25 a day and there is ALSO a resort fee (ours was waived due to a special, but seriously? Without that special you need to factor in  an extra $50).  The goofy kid at valet takes BOTH of our names and puts it on the car tag.  We specifically stated that the other person was the owner of the car.  He still puts both of our names on it.  
??

I go to check us both out of our (separate) rooms. They charged both of us for parking.  I note that we came together and only had one car,  hers, and that the parking needed to be taken off my bill. 
Rather than saying, no problem, the girl at the front desk had to ""check with the valet manager.""  Seriously?  I'm lying?! I point to the car we came in as it was in view of the desk through the windows.

The valet managers approaches, I explain, and he cuts me off.  Now it is ON. ""ma'am, we are just trying to figure out the charges.""

He then proceeds to ask me whose Altima is on my folio. No idea. I stayed alone and came in the white Mercedes, which I point to.  Is this Altima yours?  Uh, no. My car is a Corolla and it's sitting IN MY GARAGE.
He then asks who ""Sara (and the last name of my friend)"" is. I explain, the last name is correct but her first name is L...; regardless, there IS no Sara on my tab, there is only one person with the last name of H.... and it's the WHITE MERCEDES I came in and should be on her tab. 

Essentially they put someone else's car on my bill, with my other friend's last name.  None of this makes a lick of sense. So if it was the same last name, you still charged TWO rooms for one person.  

I essentially had to explain to them that they could either take the charge off or I could make a 5 minute phone call to Citibank and report fraud and it would be off.  

I was disgusted by the arguments given to me by the front desk employee and the valet manager.  Nice customer service.

the Pool:  horrible service.  Water in 100+ temps?  forget it.  Want a drink?  you'll be waaiting.  The pool is relatively small for what the size of the property will eventually be and they already can't keep up.  Towels everywhere and you don't know if the chairs have been abandoned or are still being used because of the disarray.

The rooms:  actually really nice. However, be sure that you request a room that has a frosted glass shower.  The shower is all glass around all three sides so you are completely exposed. if you are with a friend who you don't want to see you naked, they are trapped behind the curtains in the main part of the room.  They cannot even use the bathroom. It's bizarre.

Want ice?  YOu have to text for it.  Yes, they are modern and edgy.  However, we'd much have preferrred NOT to wait 20 minutes for ice.  Put a damn ice machine in the hallways and let us get it ourselves!

In all, this was a hot mess.  We frequent the properties and this has a lot of improvement if we'd ever come back.",2017-07-10 00:34:12

It was almost like we had to beg for service as he dropped off our drinks and then ignored us.

A little while later the food shows up, we eat and continue to work on our drinks... we never see Rob until we flag him down for the bill. When we get the bill we notice he has charged us for our drinks and ask him why? He proceeds to throw out all kinds of attitude and says you weren't playing... only people who play get drinks comped. He then says my friend was only betting 1 credit at a time and thats not enough. Maybe if he had checked on us once in a while he would have seen that we both had money in the machine and were playing the whole time...I know I lost $40 that should more than cover the 1 beer I drank. The sad thing is that if he would not have acted like a major jerk I would not be so upset. When you work on tips your service is what makes you money. Yelp says I have checked into PT's 33 times...

I've been here a number of times over the years and have had a delicious experience each time. The key is to get there before 11:00AM so you don't have a long wait. Any time after 11:15AM pretty much guarantees the place will be packed to the brim.  Also, they run out of snowballs after 11:00AM and that is pretty much the most awesome pastry ever. PPB has loads of carts roaming around so you are never without food, and the prices are great. Obviously the bigger your party the lower your bill will be, no matter how much more you order.

1.  Clean and brightly lit: All three locations are tidy, and the staff does a good job at maintaining the orderliness of the store's items, but the other two locations always made me feel like I was shopping in a cave.

2. Spacious; Improved setup: I was always stricken with claustrophobia and the fear that I'd break something while wandering down the aisles at the two other stores, which are jammed pack with all sorts of goods. At this location, I felt like there was more room to move around.  Furthermore, the organization of items makes it easier to find particular things. 

3. Variety of Items: All three locations sell cosmetics,  food (soups, GREEN TEA KIT KATS, seasonings, dried seaweed, etc.), traditional Japanese items (robes, sake sets, Kokeshi dolls, etc.), and the usual ""sUpEr KaWaii"" stuff (Sanrio, Totoro, etc.). 

4. As with all the locations, the staff here is also helpful and friendly. 

If there's a con about this place, it's that their quantities for items -- such as, their tableware -- are less than the Fort Apache location.

The whole ambiance is zen, and they have a surprisingly strong collection of sake.  I opted for the 5-course omakase (keep in mind you have to call the day before):

- Course 1 - Kampachi with truffle oil.  Fairly classic opening, but set the tone due to the surprising freshness

- Course 2 - Very well done sashimi platter.  This was more eclectic than usual, and perhaps the standout of the meal.  There were a number of items, ranging from firefly quid, Hokkaido scallop with truffle, Tuna Tartar with some in-house baked wafer, amaebi (with the fried head), and a salmon rolled into cucumber.  Fresh wasabi on a number of items gave a great pop along with the yuzu sauce

- Course 3 - mushroom and clam soup.  5 different types of mushrooms.  Huge bowl.  Very filling and warm.  Interesting course

- Course 4 - cooked alaskan black cod in miso sauce and japanese radish.  This is a classic Nobu dish, but ShinBay did it up with a larger portion.  Absolutely delicious

- Couse 5 -  sushi course was 6 pieces of fresh, inventive sushi.  Everything was pre-sauced, and veered to the sea salt and yuzu side.  Reminded me a lot of Nobu, again.  Fresh ginger was good

- Course 6 - dessert course was surprisingly fun, and thankfully light.  It was an egg custard with fresh berries and some sweet sauce.  Nice, smallish portion was a pleasant way to end the meal

Overall, I'd highly recommend ShinBay over the numerous ""roll factories"" that hold down Phoenix's sushi scene.  The fish, apparently, is flown in fresh from Tokyo's fish market, and the staff is knowledgeable and pleasant.

Believe me it is a bit difficult to find since it an entire blue painted building. The only way you'll know this is the coffee bar is that there is a small sign by the entrance and engraving on the door.

I stopped in here just to get a cup of coffee after a very filling lunch in the Southside followed by a huge Sundae at an ice cream stand. I glanced at the baked goods and they looked inviting and very familiar to me. Yes, they are supplied by Mediterra baked goods where I have been a number of times and  was very pleased with their breads and scones.

In addition to coffee, you can get lattes, pour overs, teas, smoothies, health juices, as well as a cold bar where you can get cold brews or nitro drinks. In addition they serve a few items for breakfast or lunch including soup. Oh yes, I noticed a sign where they are planning a high tea but don't have any other information on it.

They suggested I try the Brighton brew which is their favorite. When I got it I was disappointed with the fact that it tasted bitter to me. They, upon request gave me a fresh cup but again found it too strong for my tastes.I decided just to finish it regardless. You can either stay downstairs where they have bar stools or go upstairs into what seems like a cozy living room environment complete with a fake fireplace. The do offer free WiFi here and they will give you the pass-code upon request.  They also have interesting art work scattered around.

They  have a grab and go refrigerated beverage section on the first floor as well if you prefer water or soft drinks. Outdoor seating is also available.

I was a little disappointed with the fact that they don't supply you with those tiny plastic keep warm hole fillers for your cup nor was there any trash receptacle on the 2nd floor. I finished my coffee and left. As I was leaving I noticed that on their side of the street is pay parking. I was parked on the other side of the street so I'm not sure if that applies to both sides since I did not see one of those meters on that side. Please be aware of this when you come.

They offer burritos , salads, burgers, and chicken breast. My hubbie and I ordered the Glendale burger a burger with bacon, cheese, a mild horseradish , barbecue and mushrooms. It came out promptly. The burger was good, meat was tender and smokey. I felt the patty was a little thin and agree with the previous review that it's 1/4"" thick. The bun was soft which my hubbie enjoyed. Between the burger and fries it was a 5 napkin night. I asked for a side of ranch and was given what I think was the cilantro ranch- it was surprisingly good! My fries were ok- came out barely warm but tasted good. I later was told by my husband his was warm and perfect. The inside does look like Chipoltle . They have brewed tea which is a big plus in my eyes and have Coke products. So all in all good. I would return. The staff checked on us twice and made us feel welcome. They have a frequent diner program. I wish the burgers were more beefy and lettuce was not shredded. Next time I'm trying the salad as I love the mesquite and want to try the carne asada.

Housed in an older building, Crazy Jim's is in a so-so neighborhood, and while I felt comfortable walking from the back parking lot alone, I probably wouldn't do so after dark. It's a small place with wooden tables (carved with Crazy Jim's logo) situated rather close to one another. Luckily I was there late afternoon and didn't need to deal with a large lunch or dinner crowd. 

I had the basic Greek salad with home made creamy Greek dressing. I'm often disappointed by salad dressing, but not this time...it was great! The portion size was large enough for an entree, but could suffice for two or more to share as a side. Many restaurants skimp on everything but iceberg, but this salad had several pieces of kalamata olives and the feta was piled high! 

The highlight of the meal had to be the pita. Served warm and cut into quarters, it was probably the most flavorful I've ever had! Too bad I didn't ask for extra to go.

Menu:
They offer a huge selection of New York style foods. They also offer a lunch menu and happy hour menu. 

I lucky made it just before the end of lunch and ordered a slice of pizza and wings. My pizza was so yum that I wanted another slice. They also offer 2 slice lunch special but I opted for one.

So yes, there's just a sidedoor south of St Catherine that leads to a basement, and then there's black stairs down to a dark room with red couches and it's a tad worrisome at first. The chairs and tables remind me of a bar/cafe place I used to hang out at when I was around high school age (but legal, obvi) and I thought maaaan, I would hang out here all the time if I was a kid these days, and as a kid at heart I'll be back for sure. 

The fries were skinny and salty, the staff was totally nice and bilingual without even a hint of the snark I sometimes associate (to my error, clearly) with high level nerdom. There were 2 interesting beers on tap and lots of funny fruity cocktails with geek-referential names. The games are free so we could play some racing game (and by ""racing"" I do mean spinning endlessly in circles and driving into walls) and Mortal Kombat (which a friend had when I was a kid and brings out a not-entirely-attractive murderous glee in me) and then hang out with a bigger group and play Cards Against Humantity.

You may think BC is located at some plaza past this center but no....it's in here!!

He explained what specials he had for the day, what soups were available, and what are some of the popular items.

I ordered the half soup, half sandwich combo. One of the soups of the day was Potato Leek. It was perfect for the chilly weather. Soup came out pippin hot! I loved it. The sandwich was good but nothing special. I've honestly had better sandwiches at Panera Bread. My meal cost me about $7 and some change. Pretty typical for soup and sandwich combo (just like Panera) but the portions were more on the small side. It BARELY got me full and I normally have a small appetite. So I can't imagine a grown man getting full off of this. Maybe if you order two entrees then yeah.... I really don't get what's the hype about this place. It's simply A-Ok.

She is my father's celebrity crush and when we found out she was debuting her show the last night he was in town, I got tickets during the pre-sale.  We got in line about 30 minutes before the show, which starts at 7:30 PM.  This is the same showroom that features Donny & Marie and George Wallace.

While waiting in line, I realized I was perhaps 3 decades younger than everyone else, but what the heck!  We had balcony seats at a table.  We sat with a couple from Ontario, Canada.  Olivia was very conversational with the audience and had a band complete with a percussionist, bassist, drummer, and back-up vocalists, one of which played a variety of instruments including the fabulous flute, saxophone, and even harmonica.

The female back-up vocalist also helped Olivia with the majority of her on-stage costume changes, which was changing jackets primarily.  She only did one costume change at the end of the show before a 2-song finale, wearing head-to-toe gold sequins.

She sang songs from all aspects of her career, pre-Grease and post-Grease.  She is an Aussie who moved to England at 18 and sang in lounges.  She sang songs she was inspired by, like ""Cry Me a River"" by Julie London (in V for Vendetta for my generation).  Olivia sang from Xanadu, from her country hits in her early days, songs from her 90s album Gaia, and of course...PHYSICAL!

The most excitement for the crowd came from her 4 minute montage of her life early in the show, with pictures hinting at the order of her career, and the nod to Grease.  She started with a tease of ""Look at me I'm Sandra Dee"" and then broke into songs from Grease with her back-up singers: You're the One That I Want, Hopelessly Devoted to You, Summer Nights, and We Go Together.  The crowd went wild!  Sure, there were songs throughout the show I did not know, but I did not grow up with ONJ so I was just thrilled to see my dad so happy.

I had a cup full of orange sorbet mixed with their newest addition of hawaiian delight sorbet. Then I had mine topped off with mangos, pineapples, cherries, and blackberries. Lil Man wasn't sure about getting one because he left Yogurtland the last time with a not such a great taste and a bad impression of yogurts, but as soon as I convinced him to try the hawaiian delight sorbet, he was hooked. So, he went and got a cup and filled it up as well with, of course, hawaiian delight sorbet, vanilla, and some others... he went on his own to make his own recipe. I was able to see what his recipe was because I had to hold the cup while he added cherries, cherries, and more cherries with strawberries and more strawberries. He is a fruit addict like his mama.

They had someone available and I was helped immediately.

I was greeted by Shasty I believe her name was and she was super friendly and talkative. 

She seemed to take a lot of pride in her work and seems to really care about her customers. 

The whole polish change from beginning to end took about almost 20 minutes. I'm not sure if polish changes take that long, but she was super thorough. 

She cleared the old polish then added a clear coat then 2 costs of red polish then a fourth top clear coat and my nails came out looking amazing! 

I gotta say that the service here is pretty darn impressive from what I can tell from this first time experience.

I asked how much it was to get a pedicure and I was told $40 or $45 which seems a bit high for me, but they spend 1 hour with you so I guess that's worth it.

Maybe some day I'll give it shot and see if I like it.

I moved here from Northern California last year for school and I was in desperate need of quality ice cream. If you know Northern California, there are quality creameries everywhere and I needed something here in Arizona.

This place is a local, small business, that produces top quality ice cream. I think they make all the ice cream at the main store on Shea and then deliver it to their store on 16th and the one at the airport. They are rated in multiple national rankings of ice cream and I can't get enough. 

Their flavors rotate around so you never know what you're going to get when you walk in so I recommend going there. A LOT. They do a lot of seasonal flavors too so some of the flavors are only available for a month or so. Also, all of their toppings like the fudge and whip cream are made in store. 

Some of my favorite flavors: Horchata, Brownie Swirl, Jameson Irish Cream, Cherry Yuzu Cream Cheese, Peaberry Espresso, Madagascar Vanilla, Milk and Cookies, Salted Butter Caramel, Brown Butter Pecan, Huckleberry, Mayan Chocolate, Fleur de Sel Caramel, and Pumpkin Spice.

The rest of the time, nami is fine. Everything is ok to good, such as the drinks, pastries, and tsoynamis. The donuts I've had there (besides the zeppole tend to get stale very quickly.)

My friends and I were looking for a relaxed place to just sit, chat and have a few drinks on a Friday night. We found a great spot away from the bar and settled in for the night. The place was quite lively and full, but it wasn't overly crowded or loud. What a great balance.

The service was excellent, they were quick and helpful and always ready with refills for whatever we were drinking and the drinks were cheap, bonus points!

When we started getting a little hungry our waitress was quick to grab a food server to help us out. I have to say all the beer battered yummyness was pretty fantastic. Piping hot and fresh out of the fryer. The food was cheap as well, double bonus points!

All in all great experience, we'll definitely be back!",2011-01-21 02:28:49

The burger was great, the fries were good, and the margarita was crap. 

I don't remember what burger I got because it was devoured.  The fries were good, but in general I prefer a thicker fry (meh). 

The problem I had was with the drink.  I had a margarita that was INCREDIBLY BORING. No pizzaz, just blah.  The salt on my rim was gone immediately for some semblance of flavor.

One restaurant's dining experience screams luxury (duh...it's Yorkville), they take care of details you don't expect that makes the dining experience special: complimentary coat check, a personal chair for your purse and a ""Happy Anniversary"" script on our desserts because I tapped that extra button on OpenTable.
Service was generally quite attentive, but I do find it hard to locate our server when it got busy. 
Maybe because of Winterlicious, dishes run small and I was not super filled at the end of 3 courses. I felt the mains plating could have been better, since they lacked the finesse you'd see in a restaurant of that caliber. Only the ""bacon and eggs"" app blew us away with a wonderful marriage of mellowness from the egg component and bold flavours from the ""bacon"" and onions (dish not on regular menu). Everything else was a bit of a blur after a couple of days so I felt the food left so much more to be desired.
I also felt slightly uncomfortable dining here, since the restaurant seemed filled with business executives and the wealthy. I wouldn't say there was anything from the service that actively contributed to this. We received equally as good service but even when we dressed well, ordered alcohol/items outside of the licious menu, tipped well, overall atmosphere felt unwelcoming and pretentious even compared to restaurants in the Financial district.",2018-02-06 23:55:13

I had a shrimp sandwich and added a side of avocado. The sandwich was absolutely amazing! The bread was soft and gooey. The shrimp was grilled and seasoned beautifully and the toppings and sauce gave the sandwich a delicious flavour. It was one of the best sandwiches I have had in the city.

Got a few prescriptions. Asked if they can fax it, so it's faster and saves me time. They said it will take 2 weeks to fax in the prescription. Are you joking me. Went to get the prescription filled. 

My insurance doesn't cover the one the doc wrote. The pharmacy called them and told them to change it. I also call them and ask them to change it too. They didn't change it until 3 weeks later. Meanwhile I have called them right after I left the Pharmacy which was an hour after I left their office. 1 week later called to tell them I still need new RX. They said they never got the request. Yes you did. CVS is great about sending request. So asked CVS to resend it to them again.

Called to asked if I can get a letter from the doc for my children for school. The doc will get back to you ok. Called again and left a message. They didn't called me back until ONE month later, asking if I still need a letter. You must JOKING right. You think I'm going to be waiting a month for your stupid letter and playing phone tags.

0FUFyDNQqOlOK_J2vgpePQ,lNDoRrMrdrK-Gd8Yllgpkg,Pthe4qk5xh4n-ef-9bvMSg,3,2,2,1,"Prologue:
My girlfriend and I decided to dine out on Christmas Eve and we were in the mood for something different than the traditional holiday fare.
It had been awhile since we last dined out for Thai cuisine, so after reading several good reviews on Yelp, we decided to give this place a try.

The Plot:
We started by sharing an order of Papaya Salad, followed by the Pad Gratium Pik Tai Beef and the Pla Lui Soun.

The Scene:
The portion sizes were good and, for the most part, were plenty for the two of us.

We ordered the Papaya Salad *hot* (mid-range on their spicy scale), which was on the verge of being unbearable for me and just what I wanted. There was plenty of papaya with the standard assortment of veggies, etc., and enough sauce to cause a nice after-burn in my mouth.

We ordered the Pla Lui Soun *medium*, which featured a nice balance of the familiar combination of spicy and sweet flavors that is the hallmark of Thai cuisine. The texture of the julienned mango was just right, not too soft or crunchy, and well complimented the texture of the fish.

We also ordered the Pad Gratium Pik Tai Beef *medium*, which was the star of the meal. The beef was tender, flavorful, with just the right amount of spice, and it went together very well with the white rice.

The Rest of the Story:
The first thing we noticed was the ubiquitous presence of locally grown produce and the virtual absence of any Asian vegetables. For example, all of the dishes included carrots and chopped iceberg lettuce, the Papaya Salad included string beans that were not Asian, and the Pad Gratium Pik Tai Beef included broccoli and zucchini.

My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, remarked that there was not much to distinguish the majority of the ingredients in the entrees from Chinese cuisine and I had to agree that what we were served was not distinctly Thai based on my own previous dining experiences.

I'm fairly certain that the fish fillet in the Pla Lui Soun came out of the freezer, it wasn't crispy, and it was buried inside of a mound of julienned mango so that the dish was more like a mango salad with fish rather than the other way around.

I like Thai sticky rice very much, however the rice we were served with our meal was steamed like the kind you usually get with Chinese food.

Epilogue:
The service was prompt and courteous and the prices were on par for this type of restaurant.
Although the food was reasonably good, it did not live up to our expectations for authentic Thai cuisine.

I round up to 4 stars for anyplace that serves pozole all week long.  Plus they are SUPER nice in there and place is clean and new and family run - so why not give them a bit of a break? 

We both got sopapillas (really just a large tostada using a large, flat fry bread as the base):  one red chile and one green.  The fry bread base itself was five star great.  The flavored chile and beef and refried bean toppings were solid four stars.  But then to bury all that tasty goodness with a heaping mound of shredded iceberg lettuce and lots a poor quality, unmelted, pre-shredded yellow cheese?  I hate that!   I wanted to scrap off all that lettuce and 'cheese' (I don't like to call those pre-shredded yellow bits by anything other than their real food name, which is 'TYC':  tasteless yellow crap - you know - as in they put TYC on everything at Taco Bell - I hate TYC and I hate Taco Bell).

My other critique is with their squeeze bottle red and green sauces brought to the table.  The green sauce separates with the heavier parts sinking down to the bottom of the squeeze bottle and the watery liquid rising to the top - so what comes out us mostly watery green liquid.  That is WHY you scoop out salsa verde and serve it in a little bowl rather than stick it in a plastic squeeze bottle.  These folks are not serving it correctly  - the sauces are too watery out of the bottle.  Plus - the squeeze bottle red sauce is too vinegary for my tastes (I prefer more of a chile or smokey flavor for my red sauce).

I hope the menudo and pozole are solid (I'll make a point of checking them out in the fall when it's slightly less than 160 degrees outside) - as I would like to support these folks.  But I can't get behind food items buried in shredded lettuce and TYC.",2016-06-17 23:26:27

They do not offer free tap water here. If you want water, your only choice is pay for bottled water. This is the only restaurant that I know of in Markham or the GTA that charges for water. I dislike bottled water; our tap water is perfectly safe and a better alternative for the environment.

It would be nice to have a free glass of water next to a pitcher of beer to wash down all the salt and grease that come with the burgers and wings. 
The wing order came with fresh veggie sticks and blue cheese dip. My friend didn't like blue cheese so she asked for a substitution.... This also costs $1 extra.

The wait staff was friendly but really not helpful. We ordered the Grilled Pork Rice Paper Rolls, the Bo Tom Nuong Vi (I thought everyone would like grilling their own food) and asked for an appetizer portion of noodles with meat that the waiter suggested for my children. We specifically told the waiter we did not care for squid (Muc) and only wanted beef and shrimp. I was excited to try a ""33"", Vietnamese beer.

As we were sitting in a booth with not much room, the waiter suggested and helped us move to a bigger table. The staff set up the grill, brought out the proteins and a semicircular bowl of hot water. A waitress asked if this was the first time we had ordered this and we said ""yes"". Sitting on top of the beef and shrimp was a large amount of squid. At the bottom of the hot water bowl were some dead gnats/bugs, as pointed out to me by my spouse; I chose not to mention it. No one told us what the bowl was for or gave us any instructions/tips on how to proceed even after they asked and knew this was our first time. We decided to just avoid the water container altogether. 

Next came a full size portion of crunchy noodles with shrimp on top, not an appetizer portion. Now a waitress had officially taken over for our waiter. We mentioned that the portion was way bigger than we ordered, asked if kids ate this dish and pointed out there was squid on top of our other food. She apologized and said that she had never seen kids eat those kind of noodles (too difficult to eat) and she would have recommended small bowls of Pho. She said that the cook hadn't listened and made some mistakes (don't you write these things down when we order). We picked the squid off and placed it in a bowl. It would have been really nice and professional if someone had offered to replace the squid with more of the beef or shrimp we had originally ordered; no one did.  The Rice Paper Rolls were just okay. To her credit, the waitress was very apologetic but apologies only go so far. We were not charged for the crunchy noodles (which no one ate) and the bill was still $40+. $26 for a few slices of beef and shrimp ended up feeling way overpriced and not as much fun as I had thought. On the way out she said we should come back and try the Pho. If Pho is one page of an almost eight page menu, maybe your menu is too large...

On the way out, employees were sitting cross legged on the sidewalk smoking...

I was greeted enthusiastically by the middle-aged man who owns the restaurant.  He quickly guided me through the menu and offered suggestions.  I told him I just ordered food from Kaiju but I'd be back.

I kept my promise and returned a few days later with a gamjatang (pork bone soup) craving to satisfy.  

I haven't searched too hard, but this is amongst the cheapest gamjatang you can get downtown at $8.50.  The gamjatang itself was of average quality and average quantity - 3 large pieces.

In addition to the cheap gamjatang, the other thing that stood out about this place was the nice old couple running this place.  Much like Kaiju's owners, they seemed like good people just trying to make the most out of the unfortunate location of their business.

One suggestion I have is that they offer free sides.  I feel like this would put the value of the meal over top and would entice more customers.

Ordered through Uber Eats last year and was really disappointed by the carbonara and salsiccia pizza.  It had arrived cold and the quality really dampered the experience.  However, I blamed it on the delivery issues we were having with Uber Eats. 

After this one take out experience, my boyfriend continued to hype up the restaurant, and I decided to give it another chance.   

We came in on a weekday evening, and the restaurant was a quarter full.  It's slightly odd to see this restaurant among classic Chinese restaurants, but adds to the evolving landscape/community.

No one was even around, and a line of cars started to form behind mine.... The man behind me called inside, and bitched out the staff to come out.... Minutes later they did, blaming it on the building's ""window placement""... Even if that was true, I had an appointment.... So, someone knew I was coming.

I waited  two and a half hours for my car to have an oil change. 

When they pulled my car up from being ""washed"" it was hideous. It had spots all over it, and run marks. They didn't even bother to wipe it down... At least when I used to go to Jiffy lube, they would vacuum my carpet. I called the service manager, Kevin Blackwell and complained. He said that the service was lack luster because he was off site at a meeting..

So, let me get this straight, because you aren't there, the entire service team falls apart.... SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED NEW EMPLOYEES.

Kevin said that if I was unsatisfied with the wash on my car, that I could always tell them to resend it through... So I can sit longer....? NO THANKS.


I don't understand the point of making an appointment, because I am there for hours, every time. I am told that it is the car wash that gets ""held up""... I can't really understand why, because my car looks like junk every time they wash it. So, is it an hour for an oil change/inspection, and then an hour for you to wash my car...?

I didn't think so.


Last time I was there, they told me that it was going to be $160 visit next time for my 15,000 mile upkeep...... This $160 is for a $20 air filter. I told the technician that it was a silly price, and that I would do it myself...for just the price of the filter. I also have to sign the paper, so that I ""acknowledge"" these fees. 

He then got sassy with me, and said something to the effect of ""well, when your filter gets clogged, and your car stops, and you and your baby are out in the heat, you'll think twice.""........Seriously....?

 Attitude adjustment please.

It took a decent amount of time for our food to come out despite it not being busy and the sauces we asked for were not brought. We had to ask a second time for them. And even at that the waiter went off and did other things before finally bringing them. He even stated, I forgot again. We had a heck of a time getting his attention for refills and for the check.  It was just very apparent that we were not a top priority at the time and the waiter even commented that he had a lot of other work to do. It really took away from an otherwise excellent experience because the food was fantastic!  I highly recommend the Blackened Chicken Po'Boy with a side of Cajun Aioli sauce for the fries. It was so good. And with a $9 price tag it was a good value. And the Buford Size Chicken Tender Platter was massive!  I just wish the service could live up to the food.

When we arrived we were told it was just shift change and they needed a second to clean a table. No big deal. We didn't even wait a whole minute before we were seated... Drinks ordered and arrived quickly. We were a little slow ordering. We were trying to decide on the 2 for $20/$25 deal or something else. Fajitas disappeared from the menu, but they still serve them. Once I found that out, we were ready to order.

Now I wonder if mentioning shift change was a pre-excuse for the horrible service we were about to get...

We ordered what used to be labeled as the Bottomless Chips and Salsa. Price is up by a $1. Thanks, Obamacare! It used to come out on their big round raised plate/tray with a semi-small bowl of salsa. That was OK because they always come back to the table often enough to keep you deep in salsa. Now it comes out on a much smaller tray with a tiny cup of salsa and a few chewy, stale chips... We thought, well, they'll be running their buts off filling that cup... That might have been so if we had seen our server even once before our food arrived. Actually, our server wasn't the one that brought our food so we didn't see her for a while afterward.

Our food had come and our drinks (an iced tea and a water) had been sitting empty for a while. When our server finally made an appearance, she still didn't notice our drinks. We had to mention it to her. I know that sounds a little entitled, but there are expectations of service that used to be standard. You always refill a drink u[ to and while food is on the table or AT LEAST ask to. Half way into our meals we lost interest in the $4 chips and salsa sample.

The entrees were great. At the very least the kitchen is still staffed be good people. I always order the steak fajitas, medium rare, and I eat the steak like a steak and then make veggie tacos out of the rest. I fricken love it. This time I was not disappointed. The steak was not medium rare (they never get that right) but it was still delicious. My dinner companion had a 7oz sirloin and it too was mouth-watering and juicy. Also not cooked as ordered (medium) but that meant I got the redder portions so, no complaint from me there...

We actually got asked if we wanted another refill before we completed our meals. That was nice. However, after we had finished out food we had the desert/drink menu in hand and the waitress walks up and plops the check down and walks away. I may have some strong ideas about service but I don't know any manager that would train tyheir staff to miss an opportunity to offer drinks and deserts. That's not how you sell.

So, it may have been mean but, we left no tip and stopped at DQ for a cone on the way home.

We've already blacklisted the Applebee's on Baseline at 24th St. because of similar service, getting orders and drinks completely wrong, and billing us for things we did not order. This one is going on the list as well. Next time we'll drive all the way out to Baseline and 51st Ave. They seem to still understand customer service out there.",2015-04-20 02:24:53

Great place in the winter or summer. Gated patio for the warmer months.
Flat screen tvs are nestled in corners to watch games, but not so obtrusive that they annoy non-game watchers like myself. 

Atmosphere is constructed like a big old Irish or London pub. High backed booths, big  round tables in the back for groups,  high chairs wrapped around the long bar.

I enjoy the impressive draught beer list featuring selections from England, Scotland, Europe, Ireland and America. You can get a sampler if you are indecisive like me. They also have a pretty solid wine,specialty drink menu, and feature single malt scotchs.

The food menu changes seasonally while maintaining a few regular items. The curry chips, steak fries with a selection of curry dipping sauces, are a must try  and a year round staple menu The  Classic pub fare fish and chips are quite good and a hearty portion. The pub pretzel bun is another favorite.

There are limited vegetarian options. There's a portobello sandwich that sounds like it's given some thought.

Love the close location, parking, vast menu, and last-but-really-FIRST is Susie. I mostly come here for Susie.  She is an amazing server and I know her days on and off.

I suppose what prompted me to write a Yelp review, after all this time, is the big, verbose note that was/is pasted on the front door when I arrived today.  It's REALLLLLYYYY long.  

Note to the manager -- no one wants to stand out in triple digit, humid weather and read the long story.  What it boils down to, is that they are now closed on Mondays.  No big deal!!  Apparently, current economic conditions dictate that being closed on Mondays is the best business decision for right now.

I'm certain you are running off customers and discouraging business with this long, laborious note.  In fact, that is rather proven because someone hand wrote at the bottom of the note, ""We are only closing on Mondays!"".

These are the reasons that employee likely felt compelled to add that statement to the bottom of the tome.  When you post a written diatribe on your door that is that long, people don't read it all and they automatically think:

1. They haven't paid their rent, and the landlord locked them out.
2. The Board of Health has shut them down.
3. They are on vacation, or otherwise, closing for the rest of the summer.

.......and they turn on their heel and leave for someplace else, perhaps never to return.

If you want to keep all your customers, just write a simple note that indicates, ""We are currently closed on Mondays. Thank you to all our awesome customers for your ongoing loyalty.""  That's it! Make it easy for us, OK?",2017-08-11 22:43:14

It is not a place that I am rushing out to eat at but it is not a place that I am actively avoiding. If I am in Squirrel Hill (and I am there at least 2 days a week), I am hungry (which is always), and I want something quick, I will always pick NU. They are A-OK. 

The prices are are little high. $12.00 for a sandwich, even if it comes with a side is a little too much for me. But I will say they taste amazing. 

The Sabich: Crispy fried eggplant, Israeli salad,fried egg, tahini & amba sauce, served in fresh pita. I have had this twice. I really love this sandwich. The fried eggplant were a big draw for me to order this sandwich. I love eggplant and these are crispy and fried to perfection. I asked for extra sauce since I like my sandwiches on the sloppier side. I do not know how they originally come but asking for the extra sauce made the sandwich perfect!

JEWBANO: Smoked meat, roasted brisket, pickles, swiss cheese & mustard, pressed on a bulkie. TO DIE FOR. This is the one order that I just was hungry and said, ""eh"" to the price and went for it. This sandwich was so big that I could only eat half. HALF!!! I probably could have eaten all of it but didn't want to look like a porker and wanted my fiance to try a bit of it. The smoked meat was so flavorful and juicy. There was not a dry part to any of the bites that I tried. Roasted brisket!!! BRISKET!! This is one of my favorite meats. I really love it. How can you not enjoy a sandwich with brisket in it! I am not a fan of the pickles. I do not know why! I love pickles but these ones are just not for me. I eat them....sometimes but I do not grab for them. And if you know me, I am a pickled vegetable grabber (I don't know how that makes me look...). This sandwich is a must if you come here. So good. 

I always take my food to go. During the less than 5 minute walk to my second job the food stays perfect. It does not get mushy, it does not get that weird ""cooking in the wrapper"" taste to it. It stays just as it should. 

I have yet to try any desserts. Or the noshes. I would like to experience NU as a sit down with friends dinner or lunch. I think that it would really expand my idea and view of the place. 

I would suggest, if you are thinking about it, to at least try it out.",2015-11-24 21:57:34

What I also love most about this place compared to  other Vietnamese dessert places is how I can modify it to pretty much whatever I want without major up-charges. I always get my #10 (red tapioca, grass and pandan jelly and ADD longan and basil seeds).  I can choose to not add additional sweetener into it as the other ingredients naturally are cooked in a little sweetener already. So its perfectly and lightly sweetened even if you don't add any more to it.

Parking: 
This place can be hard to find as its in a corner of a street next to Hot & Juicy Crawfish which I LOVE to go to as well. It parking is VERY small but since there isn't much people to knows about the place or normally come to this location, I never had trouble finding a space.

The description of it being an Asian gastropub really throws u for a loop.  I was really excited to eat at an Asian gastropub, but the menu didn't seem gastropub enough.  It did have some small and large plates, but didnt have that gastropub feel.  We had a good meal nonetheless.  

Started with a few small plates. Sweet pea soup which is a cold soup.  Very smooth and creamy with a wonderful pea flavor.  It was poured table side.  Crispy pork dumplings which were like Gyoza.  The filling had a wonderful flavor and the sauce really complemented the dumpling. Amma's homemade tomato soup.  It was okay, a little sweet.  Not one of my favorites. Caesar salad with yuzu dressing.  Very good salad, the dressing was good and if I remember right I believe it had some fish pieces in it.  It was very good all together. Tuna deviled eggs were the best dish of the night.  Chopped tuna next to chopped eggs with an oil if I'm not mistaken.  Odd combination but it worked. 

Next we all had large plates. I had the shrimp and grits.  The grits were made with coconut milk.  It was great at first but as you continued to eat it it became really sweet. The shrimp were cooked perfectly though.  Roasted chicken, the chicken had a lot of flavor but the vegetables served with it were just okay.  You expect a little more, it was a boring plate. Crispy pork belly was awesome.  Pork belly was crispy and sauce was outstanding.  Miso salmon with shishito peppers was just so-so.  The salmon was cooked perfectly but the plate was just bland.  We also had the kimchi fried rice.  The fried rice needed a lot more flavor, very bland.  Almost like they didn't add any spices or salt.

I went here two days in a row because I've been in the area for jury duty. I would come here even more if it were closer to home but I will be back when I'm in the neighborhood. 

I walked in and was kindly greeted by a worker who was ready to take my order. I told him its my first time but I had my heart set on the Bizness. I like to see how different restaurants prepare kale salads. I love kale but haven't mastered how to make it tasty at home. I asked him for suggestions for sides. He said the broccoli with hemp hearts (great choice!), the curried quinoa (loved it!) and the last was eggplant dip which came with pita bread. The dip was served separately and not on the salad.

I really went all out and also ordered a cheddar jalapeño scone per the employee's suggestion and Oh My Yumminess this was perfection! The green tea matcha smoothie with almond milk has a nice amount of sweetness (not too much). 

I did get a ginger cookie for later and it was small which wouldn't matter if it was good but for me it didn't have a strong enough ginger taste. It wasn't the taste you expect when wanting a ginger cookie. I'm also not a fan of crunchy cookies but I get that it was supposed to be like a ginger snap. I just prefer soft chewy cookies. 

On my second visit I got the Bizness with broccoli again (yum), beet quinoa (yum) and lentil salad. This lentil salad was very thick and hearty and took over the kale and every other flavor in the salad. I could not mix it because all I would taste is the lentil salad so instead I ate it all first to get it off of my salad. I think its better off on the side but not mixed in with a light salad.

I also got a Vegan banana bread square and although it was fairly moist the flavor was lacking for me. I make my own Vegan desserts at home and this banana bread just didn't hit the spot. I decided I don't think I will be ordering Vegan desserts here anymore. I might try the cheesecake since it's not a baked item.
I am excited to go back but I need to rip myself away from the Bizness and try a sandwich. 

I think it's a great idea to serve the salad in a to go box so you won't need to ask for a to go box if you want one, but I've been eating there and it is a bit difficult eating out of that box. The side flaps stand straight up and won't bend down so each time I dip my fork in I hit the side of the box and I'm not sure if it's the box or the table but something is slippery and the box slides around the table. It would be nice to be served on a plate if you are eating there. 

The workers here are all happy and in a good mood and that makes me happy coming here. They also seem to love the food and be really excited about telling me suggestions. I appreciate that too! Some places it seems like the workers don't seem to have a passion for the food there and this is not the case here.",2014-03-21 13:58:24

I would equate this place to the Chinese buffet of sushi restaurants. The only reason I'm even okay with it is because it was only $20. If I had paid their ""standard"" $28 a person, I might have been pretty upset. The food just was not good; it wasn't well made, and the quality was subpar.

The service was fine and our drinks were refilled in standard time intervals. The atmosphere is slightly hipster with wood benches and thin cushions. Honestly, I liked everything but the food here. If I had to describe the flavors, it would be as if you handed me a recipe for sushi and I went to the local Food4Less to get my fish and tried to make the dish I home.

The highlight of the eating experience was definitely the first item on my menu -- a sweet corn and chipotle bisque that I could have eaten a lot more of.  I tried the roast beef sandwich.  It was tasty, if a little fatty, and the jus was on the salty side.  A good basic and about what I'd expect for the price.  Finally, the creme brulee.  Tasty custard, but texture and temperature suggested it had been bruleed some time before we received it.

A note about spicy food:  As Thai restaurants go, this one is on the hotter end.  Though I typically order my food ""Thai Hot"" at other restaurants, I typically stick to ""Very Hot"" here because it's sooo hot.  Just a note of caution :)

The service is occasionally at a slower pace than I would like, but I attribute this mostly to their crowds of customers rather than inefficiency.

Chef/Owner Jonathon Sawyer was voted Cleveland's top new chef last year, and Greenhouse has been featured in publications outside of Cleveland as one of the most exciting restaurants anywhere.

We arrived a few minutes prior to our 7 o'clock reservation and took a seat at the bar.  My first impression of Greenhouse Tavern was the disparity of decor between the two long walls (the restaurant is no more than 20 feet wide and probably 100 feet deep).  On one wall, behind the bar, were miles of bottles - wine, beer, and liquor - nestled in what appeared to be reclaimed wood shelves.  On the other side of the restaurant, miles of  monochromatic paint.  It was oddly dull in contrast with the fun bar side.

My wife and I ordered a draft cider and a brown ale respectively, while we waited for the rest of our party.  Our bartender was friendly and attentive.

When it did come time to sit down to dinner, we were walked to the back of the main floor so that we could ascend some stairs.  Most of the dining tables here are on the second level, in a small section in the very front, and a similarly small section in the very back.  To get to our section in the back, we went up what appeared to be a fire escape.  Metal stairs with metal railing.  The walls were painted red to help make it appear more finished, but this was not a finished space.  As we entered the fire escape, I saw two members of the kitchen staff dragging a huge bus tub of uneaten food scraps, across the ground just outside.  Not an appetizing sight.

We were seated along one of the long walls, the ladies in what looked to be a reclaimed Church pew, and the men in chairs.  I had to be asked to scoot in at least a dozen times to make room for wait staff and patrons to get between my chair and the person's behind me.  The layout of tables required this.  This is just unacceptable when you are dining at a restaurant that is supposed to be one of the best in Cleveland.

On to the food... I can talk about quite a bit of food, as we are a share-happy group.  And some of it was quite good.  I was moderately impressed with the chicken wings and the devils on horseback (bacon wrapped dates).  Less impressive but still perfectly good were the foie gras clams, the fifth quarter (mac 'n' cheese w/ chicken livers), and the Bread and Butter - just grilled bread with butter.

Unacceptable, though, were two of the entrees, the steak frites and the pork chop.  The steak was something out of a Denny's or Waffle House.  No more than 3/4"" thick, slightly overcooked (it's tough to cook a steak this thin mid-rare), stringy, and flavorless.  The buerre rouge was good, but I shouldn't have to dip my steak into a flavored melted butter in order to enjoy it.  The pork chops were even worse.  1/3"" thick, dry, like crackers.  The frites were just fries.  No salt on them, and no salt on the table.  Yet, there was probably an entire teaspoon of rock salt in my wife's pot du creme.  

The final straw was the couple next to us.  The ""gentleman"" who was sitting next to me, one table over, had his left foot up on the ""Church Pew"" that my wife and this guy's gal were both sitting on.  His shoe was completely filthy, untied, and disgusting.  One reason you go to a restaurant that costs some money is to avoid the riff-raff.  Not so, here.

The pot du creme was good, by the way.  The salt was well placed.  My Jeni's ice cream, which was cognac soaked figs in goat cheese ice cream, was very unique and delicious.  

But overall, our dining experience came up far short of expectations.  I mean, it wasn't even close.  I have had dozens of better meals at far less ""exciting"" restaurants.

In summary, I can't help but to think that Greenhouse Tavern is just riding the hype wave, and that a lot of Clevelanders have bought into that hype.  Our friends had been here two other times, and their most recent visit (before this one) was terrible.  They thought it was just an anomaly, but it wasn't.  Greenhouse Tavern's approach is a display of arrogant environmentalism.  Their mission statement is more concerned with sustainability than it is with good food - you can read it for yourself.  A restaurant's mission must always first be great food.  That Jonathon Sawyer thinks otherwise is evident in his mediocre food.

A huge, huge disappointment.  So many better options around town.",2010-10-17 20:17:12

First of all, our friends told us it would be ""No problem getting in"" - PFFFFFFFFFFFFT. Wrong. The bouncers we in full douchmode, and we ended up having to wait a good 15 minutes until our party inside came to retrieve us.. I was with some ridiculously good looking people too, and these m-f-ers weren't having it. In fact, at one point I asked if it was a damn gay bar because of the amount of dudes they were letting in before us. Dick to chick ratio was really off. To make things more annoying, they decided to have yet ANOTHER set of ropes and bouncers waiting for you to get up the stairs. So again. More fucking waiting. Why they do this, I have no clue, but its retarded.

Once we finally got upstairs, we were bombarded with your typical Scottsdale crowd.. Dudes grabbing at you, girls calling you a f-ing c*** and queening out for slightly bumping into them, silicone, blonde's, bros, steroids, oompa-loompa skin tones.. etc. It just reminded me why, it is, that I really dislike hanging out there. Dressing like a stripper is not my thing, so I felt a little out of place, but whatever... my Betsy Johnson dress was just fine. The only bar that accepts credit/debit is the one next to the entrance, so if you only have plastic, enjoy waiting another 15 minutes for a weak gin & tonic. The other bars up there are cash only, so be prepared. 

The pool is pretty cool, equipped with windows on the bottom so people can see the action from below, and vice versa. Lots of cabanas and shit to sit on.. wouldn't mind taking a dip here someday, but its not exactly on top of my list. 

I think we stayed for a whopping 30 minutes before escaping to a real bar. Although some of you may really be into this trendy type scene, it's not exactly my cup of tea. The venue itself is pretty sweet, its just the crowd that isn't doing it for me. I also hate waiting. For anything.. blame it on impatience if you will, but at 11:30pm on Saturday, I want to drink.. not sit around waiting and watching people slide in ahead.",2009-08-16 21:45:35

Well I decided to check it out once opened...so here I am after getting a taste of the goods :)

First of all the place has a massive menu! I mean MASSIVE in every sense of the word! lol

It was almost impossible to decide on what to try, as I reviewed one item after another, each became more desirable and so on.

Decided to do the lunch specials since we were there between 10-3pm why not plus we can try multiple things and not break the bank! lol All lunch specials are $5.

We ordered three lunch specials and split them between the two of us.

1. small pep pizza, can't go to Happy's pizza and not order a pizza pie!
2. Jumbo fried shrimp dinner w/fries and coleslaw
3. any 6 inch sub and fries, we tried the Italian which came with a yummy Italian dressing! Mmmmm yum!

Three lunch specials at $5x3 plus two drinks our total was change short of a $20!

The pizza was good, a nice sweet sauce, fresh, cheesy and the crust was chewy and good.

The Italian sub was great, good flavor.

The fried shrimp were good, makes for a nice appetizer.

They have good french fries, enjoyed them lots.

Their coleslaw is different and delicious! I suggest trying it!

The pita was pretty good.  More like a gyro than an actual pita as pictured on the website.  Not sure if they gave me the wrong one or if that is how it is done here.  The flavors were pretty good.  Veggies seemed fresh.  However, the meat was a bit dry and seemed precooked a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.  Same with the kabobs.  The flavor was pretty good but the meat was dry and also tasted precooked long before I placed my order.

I like fresh food but don't call it fresh and not make it fresh.  I got a real problem with the flagrant use of the word fresh by the food industry.  We seriously need better regulation.  

That aside, this place reminds me of a Pita Jungle with 7 pages less of a menu and about the same rate of food.

Came here for a family dinner.

Decor: Lots of gold and white. Gaudy yet tacky. 

Service: Unorganized and awkward with food servers needing to wait for your waiter to come to your table to help them make space to put your food down. So the food would show up in some guy's hands and he'd stand there and stare at you while you eat until someone came to help him put it down. The servers have almost no social skills. When you thank them they ignore you.

Cleanliness: When we first sat down we had to replace a dish because it was so oily. I grabbed a plate from another empty table and it had food bits all over it, so I had to snag yet another one. My bowl was chipped and dinged up too. When dessert came the forks had food bits still left on it. One bit looked like a large piece of tomato skin.

Food: Very underwhelming. We had the peking duck which had almost no meat, just skins and they didn't cut it in front of you which tells me they likely don't make it in their kitchen. The wraps were cold. The flavour was okay though. Texture was dry, not crispy.

The mixed mushroom stir fry was very bland except the oyster mushroom that was very flavourful.

The deep fried oysters with honey pepper sauce was pretty good. It comes with 8 pieces of large oysters and a few broccoli. 

Dessert: Well Chinese dessert in my opinion is a culinary failure. Such weird combinations. We had green mung bean soup which I've had at other places before and didn't mind it but this place seems to have a non sweet and barf look-a-like version.

With Chatime, CoCo, Boba Boy, Sharetea, Royal Tea, and a few more spots in the same small area competing, how does The Alley fare?

With hundreds of bubble tea spots in Toronto, one thing allows the biggest names, Chatime and Gong Cha, to stand out; uniqueness. Their standard black milk teas have a great, distinct flavour that distinguishes them from the rest. After about 4 visits to The Alley, I think it's safe to say that they have the same unique quality as its biggest competitors. Their Royal No. 9 tea adds a hint of blueberry that completely changes the game. 

This specific location at Midland and Finch is quite small, albeit cozy. The décor is quite nice and provides a natural feeling environment. It's a perfect place to have a quick tea break with a buddy.

Good choice to have a quiet brunch at the Venetian. Located next to the pool so you can tell who's coming from the restaurant and who's coming from fun in the sun. 

Get the sourdough waffles -- do not get the french toast (it's not actually toast). Enjoy the rest of your day at Vegas!",2015-07-08 09:55:34

I have always had a soft spot for Jerusalem Shawarma, since they opened their first location in Country hills I have visited each location as they opened and although they are all pretty consistent this one holds a special place in my heart.  Royal Oak is a close second.  I have stopped going in to the country hills landing location because it is just too small and seldom find seating during the rush, the staff there with exception to the tall manager there are not on their game and find the portions there are actually smaller.  They don't cram the same amount of meat as the other locations do in it their wraps here.   I will drive out of my way to 16th Ave. to get my shawarma fix.

Centrally located, same group of guys running it and same top notch quality food. Every. Single. Time.  They are so generous and always have the platters flowing abundantly, easily enough food to serve 2 people.  Yes, the skewers do take 15-20 min longer than the meats on the spit but you can call in and pre-order!  There were one or two instances where there was some miscommunication with the phone order vs. when I got there but they took care of things efficiently and the free baklava always helps :)  The guys there know us now and always remember us and our order, some friendly conversation and and good vibes is always welcome.  

Love the hummus, love the potatoes, love the garlic sauce.  Yes, there may be slight differences in the food from location to location but generally overall, this one remains the most consistent among the other locations, word on the street is they may have a south location in the works. 

The only negative and reason they don't get a 5 star was bc the music was really loud and top 40,  (some traditional Arabic music would be more suited here), garlic sauce although good has been tweaked and not as pungent as it once was and their fatoush dressing needs to be adjusted, it does not taste like a traditional fatoush but it's still pretty good and for about $14, its the best lunch value out there.",2017-05-17 18:25:19
sRtCAqtewNeu3XLSwItNqA,BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,A9qmduhmrTZxSg7uTOnzYg,4,3,0,2,"I was pretty excited when I saw that a Menchie's frozen yogurt shop was opening in my neck of the woods. I had never heard of the franchise before and I was excited to try it out since I read they have a variety of no sugar added AND low carb yogurt flavors. I asked the owner about their Atkins-friendly options (and I thanked him for offering a healthy alternative!), and he said each store features a different flavor of low carb and no sugar added yogurt. Since the yogurt is made at the store, the flavors will vary at different shops. At our location, the first two machines are the low carb varieties and they change a couple of times a week. 

There are lots of yummy toppings you can add to your yogurt, including a few low-carb options: fresh strawberries, peanuts, almonds, coconut flakes, fresh bluberries, raspberries, and the best -- sugar free hot fudge! Of course you have to have amazing willpower to not load up with the sugar-laden toppings like cookie dough, Oreo crumbles, gummi bears, whipped cream etc., but it's easy to stick to a low carb eating plan if you are careful. 

I opted for a swirl of the low carb and the no sugar added flavors the night I was there. The low carb flavor was toasted almond and the no sugar added flavor was mud pie. You can do either flavor individually or swirl them together. On other visits, the low carb flavors I've had were New York Cheesecake, Vanilla Malt and Capuccino. I did not try any of the other no sugar added flavors. I topped my yogurt with almonds and strawberries. 

You fix your own cup of yogurt so you can get as much or as little as you want. You pay by the ounce. This isn't a treat that you shoud go crazy with but it's a nice sweet treat for those of us who follow a low carb lifestyle. I am a big fan of Menchie's and I wanted to share it with other lowcarbers out there. One issue with this location: the late crew seems to like to ""close up shop"" a little early. While the store is supposedly open 'til 11 pm, when we were there last week around 10, the employee had already mopped the floor and moved all the chairs so there was nowhere to sit. He even shut off the OPEN sign more than 30 minutes before the posted closing time.",2013-03-25 23:18:03

Their soon tofu and their ja jang myun! Soon tofu because it's literally packed with tofu in the stone pot!! And it's really delicious with jalapeño. Where can you find the soon tofu with sliced jalapeño to add the kick this dish needs? Not common in other Korean restaurants. Their ja jang myun is a good deal if you order two! You get two for the price of $10 which means it's $5 each. What a steal! We ordered their set dinner menu and we thought it was a good idea since you get quite a bit of food for a great value instead of ordering separately. The only downside is that set dinners are set, and may not have all the dishes you want. 

Last tip?

Can't emphasize enough, try their set dinner menu if you have more than 3 ppl in your party. They have different offerings depending on how many ppl are in your party so you can choose from a variety of set menus. And try their specials of the day too.",2017-05-29 14:25:24

From distilleries to now cideries, I love the options that I have on any given night. Red Clay is a great addition to the local Charlotte scene and boasts non-typical ciders for all tastes along with tons of other local drinking choices.

Normally I'm one to stick to my basic bar orders. Local stouts and porters for the winter, local pale ales and IPA's for the summer, and a top shelf neat whiskey if I'm trying to impress my friends and grow hair on my chest. If you are like me, then thoughts of ciders bring into your mind over-sweetened beverages that are favored by the fairer sex during fall tailgate season. However, don't be fooled! Red Clay Ciderworks is putting out some high quality ciders that do not have any sugar added. My personal favorite is the Hoppin good Thyme, which as the name suggests, is dry hopped and infused with thyme giving it a crisp and bitter finish that I really enjoyed. My wife got a mix of the queen city common (their base cider) and ginger kombucha for a nice tangy kick! Be sure to watch yourself when consuming ciders, as most of their flagships are over 7%.

I also appreciate that this place nods to all local crafts and taste buds. In addition to a solid selection of local guest draft beer, they also have wine, coffee on nitro (pure intentions!), and kombucha from Lenny Boy. This can make this a unique local destination if you have a diverse crowd of drinkers. The taproom is comfortable and rustic, and they do a great job turning their parking lot into a useful outdoor space. Some additional outdoor seating would be welcome, so don't hesitate to bring some camping chairs. All in all - I look forward to going back and expanding my tasting horizions.",2016-03-22 01:25:27

I am surprised, since I have been to Beckett's multiple times, and I have pretty much wanted to Yelp about this place literally as I was eating the chocolate-covered bacon S'mores for the first time... which was when the restaurant opened over a year ago.

......So it's pretty obvious what my favorite (espcially for uniqueness and flavor) food item is at Beckett's.  But I have to say that the ribs are ridiculous as well.  I try to order other things, but I always go back to the ribs.  However, I have tried the chicken and dumplings and the pan-seared chicken too, and I have loved both.  There are only two items I haven't loved on the menu and that is the mac-n-cheese-- I think the cheese is a little runny-- and the cheddar biscuits.  They are very bland to me.

Other good things about Beckett's:
1.  The cocktails.
2.  The ambiance (it really is warm and inviting).  Personally, I love the decor a lot.
3.  The service.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely personable.  They are always happy to give a recommendation, and they never seem rushed to get to another table, even when it's busy.
4.  The location and parking.  Relatively centrally located, not off a major freeway, ample parking.

**Speaking of service, I want to mention a situation that happened between me and Beckett's Table this summer.  I had reservations for a Friday night dinner, and I received a call from Beckett's on that Friday that their electricity had gone out, so they had to close down for the day.  (In fact, the electricity had gone out for all the businesses in a 2-block radius that day.)  The manager then offered to squeeze us in either the following day (a busy Saturday) or any time later in the week... at 50% off our total bill!  Not only did this display exemplary customer service, but I was even more impressed that Beckett's provided this service when the electricity problem was definitely not through any fault of their own.

If I could assign the perfect rating to Beckett's, it would be 4.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't have that option.  I usually only reserve 5 stars for ""true"" perfection... which I have given to only 4 restaurants in Arizona throughout my Yelp career. ;)   However, the customer service (which is really a huge part about eating out in the first place) kicked Beckett's up to a 5-star rating.

Just go there.  Just do it.  Take friends from out of town.  Order an awesome old-timey cocktail.  Sit outside by the unique and cool fireplace.  Eat the S'mores until your stomach is going to explode... and then go home happy.  :)",2011-11-09 17:56:34

If you get the opportunity to come, the tamales (corn and shrimp) and his margaritas (if you like alcohol) are the two MUSTS. Both were really good. I usually don't like tamales (no offense, maybe I've only had bad ones) because they are always so dry, but this one was moist and full of flavor. The corn was the perfect accompaniment too. As for the margarita, you can custom-create your own from their list of tequilas or choose a concocted mix. I had the white peach margarita which was fantastic.

We had the chicken with sweet potato hash and the steak and egg. The first is very unique and very Bobby. It's a little spicy, and it is basically two huge mounds of chicken and hash mixed together. Very creative. The steak and egg was more traditional; you pretty much just make your own fajitas from guacamole, sour cream, egg, peppers, etc. Also good (although not spectacular) because of the fresh ingredients.

Although the burger is only served during happy hour, they made an exception or is that a facade too just like their ""fries compliments of the chef"" line? Who cares they're both good. 

The ""kobe"" beef burger. It would take a team of detectives to find out if it's actually kobe because the taste itself could fool you into thinking it is. The best burger meat I've ever had. A perfect medium rare. The meat could have been put in between burnt toast and it would of still killed it. That's all there is to say. Did I forget what the bread tasted like? And the other ingredients? Yes...but that meat got added to the list of things that I can think of and still savor. 

The complimentary fries were better than the ones that come with the burger. I wish they gave you an option of getting a different side on the count that the ""chef"" gives out free fries like casinos give out free drinks. The sauces and different styles of them were perfect beer pairings.

The service was cool. I feel bad I really do, everyone ordering steaks and starters and round after round of drinks and there I was having a burger at 630pm. But hey I had to do it for the yelp.

I actually only gave this place a shot because my best friend said the food here is really good, and sometimes you can't judge a place for yourself without actually trying it, despite the experiences that other patrons have had. So a few weekends ago when she suggested to eat there since we were in that plaza anyway, I figured I""ll give it a shot and see how it is. 

I was quite surprised at how good the food tasted. Granted I only tried two of the dishes they serve here so it's hard to say whether everything on the entire menu was good, but the fact that we had to line up and get a number ticket in order to get a seat tells you how busy the place is for Saturday lunch. We got a table about 15 mins later, and I like that for a chinese cafe they didn't rush us to order food.

In the end we ordered spaghetti with bolognese sauce and cheese (chinese style) and fried rice noodles with beef (with swiss style soy sauce). Both dishes were great! They were tasty and delicious. I always liked spaghetti and bolognese (chinese style) so usually that's one of the first things I try at chinese cafes to see if they are any good. This place did it pretty well :) The sauce wasn't too runny, it was sticky enough that it would hang onto the noodles so I din't thave to scoop sauce afterwards. Not too salty, and the taste reminds me very much of the spaghetti and bolognese that they serve in HK cafes. Next, my biggest surprise was actually fried irce noodles with beef. Not a lot of places do a good job of making this dish, despite how popular it is in chinese cafes and even food courts. the soy sauce they used was very good. My fiance (who was also with us) loves this dish, and he said that this is probably one of the best renditions he has ever had. The noodles were fried perfectly, not too mushy because you can easily do that to rice noodles, just the right texture allowing you to chew on. The beef was seasoned nicely and overall the entire dish did not feel overly oily (another problem with this dish in a lot of chinese places when they use wayyy too much oil) and so it didn't feel greasy when we were eating this dish. I would come back to this restaurant just to eat this dish again because I can honestly say that I haven't had much better ones in the other chinese cafes I""ve eaten in.

Anyway would definitely like to come back again sometimes but perhaps not during SAturday lunch coz it's so busy. But I would say if you like these two dishes it's worth coming here and checking it out :)",2015-12-14 15:32:59

I have eaten at a few of his restaurants in town and have always had great food and a wonderful experience. I completely respect his talent in this industry. That being said, if you asked me to chose between B Spot and Flip Side for a burger - I would chose Flip Side. 

I have been to both the Hudson and Chagrin Falls locations and have always had a wonderful meal. The burgers are seasoned and cooked perfectly. It's what you wished your burger tasted like when you attempt to make a gourmet burger at home. The buns used for the burger are the best, you know they are there but they are far from being overbearing hunks of bread that take over the whole burger. The selection of burgers is great. Something for everyone (including some chicken and fish options). And the turkey burger? Tastes way too close to an actual burger. Delicious!

Both fries and onion rings are a great choice. You can't go wrong with either. And our picky toddler loves their Mac and Cheese.

The reasons I give it 4 and not 5 stars are 1. Both the Hudson and CF locations are small. For such great food and the crowd it draws, you wish there was more space.  I am getting the impression this is intentional based on the similar layouts. Get there early or plan to wait. But it is worth the wait. 2. Our service at CF was okay. It wasn't horrible and didn't ruin the meal, but it was clear that the waiter forgot our orders of fries and onion rings - so we had to wait a bit for those. And we had asked for shakes to arrive after the burgers were served, and he clearly forgot that too. Again, nothing that ruined the meal, but it is clear they are working out some kinks at the CF location.

D'ailleurs, point de plus pour le café servis dehors pendant l'attente ! Bref, le menu est REMPLI de choix qui ont tous l'air meilleur que l'autre! il est donc très ardu de faire un choix ! J'ai opté pour les crêpes banane et nutella et mon copain a pris l'assiette avec les oeufs pochés et le veau effiloché. Les deux étaient fabuleuses et l'extra creton vaut vraiment le 4$ ! 

Par contre, le service laisse à désirer. Il a fallu près de 40 minutes pour avoir notre assiette, et les assiettes sont arrivés à 10 minutes d'intervalle. La serveuse est venue nous voir seulement lors des commandes et aucun refil d'eau ou de café nous a été proposé.

It's basically a sandwich, salad, coffee and pastry kind of place. There is a good bit of in and out traffic here, but we were seated immediately by one of the servers. The group ordered the following sandwiches: crab and shrimp, Cajun chicken, Cuban and vegan (with tofu). Every sandwich was better than the next. The crab and shrimp was light and very fresh tasting, while the Cajun was just the right spice with some fresh mango on it, which was a delicious surprise. I am not a big pastry fan, but they were all great (blueberry tart, caramel bar and pecan chocolate cookie) and the expresso was strong. Who could ask for anything more?

I chose tandem diving, where you're strapped to an instructor. This requires very limited training, and seems a lot safer to me (as I told the instructor, ""if I go, you go!""). The instructors are a little quirky, ranging from humorous to socially challenged, but I have no quarrel with their careful attention to safety. Jumping (well, actually kind of leaning) out of the plane is plenty scary, but free falling isn't scary at all - it's wonderful. Once the parachute opens, it takes about five minutes to land. As one who did this to get over a fear of heights (along with bungy jumping, rock climbing, and other crazy pursuits), I can heartily recommend it to all.

Hints: if you're even slightly prone to motion sickness, take something beforehand; if you're not prone to motion sickness, choose the greatest altitude (around 15,000 feet), as that gives you the most free fall time; make sure to go to the bathroom right before donning your flight suit, lest you go to the bathroom during your jump.",2007-06-21 03:58:25

But for $50/person, you get a pre-fixed menu that benefits Three Square. I get to eat and I'm helping with charity! Wins all around. 

We made a reservation for 745 pm, but due to a hair malfunction on my part, we were running about 10 minutes late. We called them to make sure they could still seat us and they said everything was all good. We finally get to the restaurant and it wasn't busy at all. Probably about 4 other parties there. What annoyed me was that even with the place being empty, they sat us at this small ass table right next to another couple. For reals??? I know you are trying to rotate server sections, but come on! Right next to someone?? The whole time I was listening to the other couple's convo too!! I could have asked for another table but I didn't want to be a b*atch about it. 

Ok time for food. Whenever they brought your dish to the table, they explained the dish so you know what was in it. It was a nice touch but I just didn't feel like hearing it since I was so hungry. 

Apps:
-Mini fish tacos: crispy taro shell with raw fish, salsa and a dab of guacamole. They were a one-bit taco. Good seasoning on the fish and the shell was crispy. 
-chips and guacamole: big, thin and crispy potato chips. I liked the chips a lot better than the guacamole. This was just ok.

Main dishes:
-Cornish game hen and waffles: two thin waffles held together by cheese. Sounds weird but it was really good with the honey glaze the dish was served with. The chicken was ok, but I wasn't fond of it being in the honey glaze. Chicken shouldn't be that sweet. 
-salmon and cous cous. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Flaky and moist and flavored nicely. The cous cous was amazing! Awesome seasoning and it came with pieces of octopus. 

Dessert:
Peach cobbler with ice cream: I would say pass on this. Ice cream melted quickly so it was this big goopy mess
-tiramisu with coffee ice cream: moist and not too sweet, just like tiramisu is supposed to taste.

Like I said I was pretty annoyed that they sat us right next to someone else so it just put a whole damper on my dinner to begin with. Our server was nice, but I used to serve back in the day and it just felt plastic. It took forever for our desserts to arrive, so by the time they did come, I was pretty restless and wanted to just leave.

Our server was a pro - I'll give him that much. The ambiance is cool, but the food was just ""try too hard."" Pretentious and snobby. I can make better guacamole in my own kitchen. It was bland and creamy. 

I ordered something that our server said is ""our take on fajitas."" How about we just skip ""your take"" and just serve fajitas like they're supposed to be. Cauliflower just isn't meant to be served in fajitas. Small portions leave you walking away hungry. 

The nervous manager that was walking around had a constant look of concern on his face. It's like they know they are trying so hard to be trendy and scared they're missing it. There's a vibe of insecurity within the staff. 

I can go to a humble mom and pop place (Restaurant El Rey) a mile away and enjoy way better Mexican food for a fraction of the price.

Secondly, there is not a huge selection compared to your other traditional donut shops, but they do have some huge donuts, literally.  See the pics of the cinnamon twist and glazed donut that I took:  BIG!  And let me tell you that the cinnamon twist is not only big in size, but it's big in taste.  Anyone who knows me well knows that I love cinnamon and this may have been the best cinnamon twist I've had in a long time.  You want to know how good it is?  I ate the WHOLE thing by myself, in the car, on my way to work.  There was no shame in my donut game that morning.  I would go out of my way just to get another one knowing how good that twist was.

We ordered right asap as we were all starving. For appetizers, the group got the melting spring artichoke and goat cheese dip and the buttermilk battered onion rings. The two were pretty much inhaled by group. The winner of the two was definitely the artichoke and goat cheese dip. The onions rings were good but it didn't stand out.

For me, I ordered a pint of Creemore with their lamb burger topped with goat cheese, tomato, lettuce and red onion which all come standard with the burger. The orders came out in a timely fashion even with the large crowd they were handling that night. My girlfriend ordered the mac and cheese with smoked bacon. I know I looked at her with a raised eyebrow when she told me what she was ordering. But she did say that it's good here and she felt like it for dinner. I guess let's hope for the best. =P

I got my lamb burger with caesar salad and the salad was quite disappointing. There wasn't enough dressing and my biggest complaint would be the amount of water on the bottom of the bowl. I felt like they washed it quickly and tossed it once or twice. The burger which was recommended by a friend on the table, didn't meet my expectations. I mean the burger was alright, but the amount of meat given was far too little. The meat patty was quite a bit smaller than the bun and the amount of cheese given appeared to be the same size or thicker than the patty itself. The lamb burger was cooked alright and there were still moisture in the patty. Which when cooking a lamb or turkey burger, overcooking and making the patty dry is something most of us worry about. The girlfriend's mac and cheese was okay. She enjoyed it and surprisingly filled her. She even had remains. But as expected with mac and cheese, try and eat it sooner than later as the overall experience drops dramatically once it gets a little colder. For dessert, the gf and I shared the chocolate masquise and it was once again, alright nothing special here.

Overall, I can't say I really liked Oliver and Bonacini - Cafe and Bar. I mean it was alright pretty much across the board except for maybe the appetizer area. But then the question comes, would you really want to go to Oliver and Bonacini just for drinks and apps? I don't think I would. I mean a friend also recommended the ribs, but I wasn't in the mood nor do I feel this is the place for killer ribs. So for this price category I would probably pick another place.

We saw she was having issues with the people sitting on our right when she forgot to bring their brats. Then the people on the left side had issues with her because she lost their order and Of course we were not the exception. We placed our order and our burger came back without the guacamole even though we were charged with it. We were still waiting for our chicken wings, but they never arrived. When we asked her about it she was very rude and told us that she didn't see the back of the order sheet. She then told us she was going to put in the order for us. We waited for 40 minutes and she came back telling us that she decided not to serve us food because we had issues with her. Everyone around us was shocked to learn this because they were all witnesses of the poor service she provided. We raised our concerns with an older gentlemen but I'm not sure if they really cared!! It's sad to have such a bad experience at this bar because not everyone was this way.

Looking back, I am stoked my social group had a night here. My first thought was ""Mill Ave bar""? Totally not on that spectrum of Mill. It's your classic dimly-lit dive bar with good drink specials and entertainment abound (board games, tv, pool, etc). 
The bartender and waitresses did a great job keeping everyone's cups/shots full, and the bartender was a great conversation. The karaoke DJ is a character! He looks like a certain X-Men and kept us entertained with the most-interesting music selection in-between performances. If you tip him in bills or alcohol, you have a much better shot at not waiting forever in-between songs. On a typical Saturday night, it could be as long as an hour to wait without tipping him.

Anyway after 5mins on hold I decided just to drive over there as I live close by and indeed they were closed for the holiday. Now they could have changed the machine message or posted something on their site, but hey I get lazy too sometime, and actually doing that takes a bit of time and everyone is entitled to a holiday. I was more disappointed than peeved, as my wife and I had drooled over the menu and had taken the time to decide what we would order before we actually tried calling. Plus I was a tad Hangry so there was that too.
For what it's worth,  the Fresh N easy next door is open 24/7 so I went in there and grabbed 2 DiGiornno  frozen pizzas for 12 bucks and after 20min in the oven were FANTASTIC!! Frozen za has come a long way! So if you are ever at Rustic and they are closed, grab some DiGiorno! It's tastes like delivery! It really does!
Last night, we decided to try Rustic pizza again and so we ordered a half pepperoni/sausage add mushrooms and half Green and White. We also added a bakers dozen of their baked chicken wings. The order came promptly, and we were pleasantly surprised that it was a woman driver. Our first one ever!
The food from Giant Rustic Pizza was AWESOME! The pizza was HUGE and the topping were bountiful and tasty. The crust was thin and bubbly and crispy, the cheese rich, the sauce delicate and delightful! The chicken wings were also really good and baked to perfection!

The liquor selection is diverse and (for the most part) the bartenders are well versed in making anything your heart desires. Tell them a color and a scent and they'll often make you something that's pretty spot on. I'd feel better if I were able to give 3 1/2 stars because I've notice a huge shift (a negative shift) in the skills and professionalism of some new bartenders. Colin, a former bartender, and another or two have left and have been replaced by not so great individuals. Allie (blonde) remains and is super awesome, friendly and makes stellar drinks.

The itamae behind the sushi counter are highly skilled and have my utmost respect. I could just watch them make the sushi for hours. If it's your first visit, I highly recommend selecting the omakase and letting these skilled chefs craft your dinner with the freshest sushi of the day.

Recommendations include (well, everything, but especially) the Uni Ikura Kani (Sea Urchin, Salmon Roe, Crabmeat) and Kamo/Foie/Ume (Duck, Foie, salted plum), and of course, the otoro (usually only served with the omakase, I believe).",2012-09-25 17:45:06

There was one table for two vacant and since it seemed a little too close for comfort with other diners, we sat at the bar.

The bar portion was manned by a tag team of Paul and Wilson, they were quite personable from the get go.  The waitress' seemed a bit scattered and maybe a bit too much in your business at the bar.  We asked Paul for the beer list again and  she chimed in with the count making some lame comment about him not knowing what they had.  I'm taking one star off for service but i'm sure that kink will be worked out in the ensuing months. 

The order:
3 Malpaque Oysters $4.74
3 Kumo O. $8.34
3 Fanny Bay  $5.64

All shucked at the bar by Wilson, fantastically fresh with grated horseradish & a condiment tray containing: mignonette, scotch bonnett hot sauce & the regular old seafood sauce.  I will be  back to have oysters again & Paul mentioned that after the newbie kinks are worked out they will be doing some kind of oyster night special. 

We also shared the Clam Chowder soup, creamy clammy with a smattered of dice carrotts drizzled with truffle oil and tiny garlic croutons.  Soo tasty and filling.  $8

The main was a grilled Swordfish served atop crispy haricot verts w/roast mini pototoes and crispy leeks.  No Sauce needed.  This was the daily fish special and it was very special indeed.  Loved it. $17

We did get a Ceasar Salad that was pretty good considering it's a seafood place.  The anchovies came thru in the dressing just wished there was a tad more on it. $8

The restaurant for noonish on a saturday was busy enough, and the service over time will be more smooth.  A definite add on my list of restos to visit.

Total with Tax (including 2 beers & Pop)  $73.70 + $20 tip.

ordering tip:  when we asked to have the salad & soup first then the swordfish. the soup and salad arrived then a runner brought the swordfish immediately following. our waiter told her to bring in back to kitchen as we wanted it after soup/salad, it was going to go back and sit under the hot lamp.  We took it since you want it as fresh from pan to plate as possible.  So, i would recommend that you order the oysters, eat them then order what you are having for main so that nothing gets left under the lamps.

**and of course we bought fish to take home from Diana`s Seafood Shop next store...more oysters!!",2011-11-05 18:33:53

My friend experienced the same thing. Granted, these ""Chicago-style dogs"" were not on the menu and had to be improvised, (which I am shocked they were not on the menu...) and they were also missing some key ingredients. 

It was an average to below average hot dog that I could have done better at home. I would take a Sonoran style hotdog or a Chicago dog from a little road/parking lot stand any day over these hotdogs.

The crayfish is seasonal though so they gave one more of each instead. Got the Captain's Boil sauce, medium, and switched to udon instead of rice ($1 extra).

The udon itself was quite bland, the teriyaki sauce that you pour over disappears, so it's good there was plenty of sauce from the seafood. The seafood itself was mediocre, the shrimp and clams don't seem particularly fresh. Mussels were the best because of largest surface area for sauce and ease of eating.

My stomach was growling and I wasn't feeling Chinese or anything too ""grubby."" I came here on a Thursday afternoon into a fairly empty store. Like any other downtown restaurant, the space ran deep despite its small storefront. 
The process works like this: order at the cashier, pay, take a seat, the servers bring you your meal. Levetto has a variety of pizzas and pastas. We ordered the Bucatini Pasta and the Pollo Toscano Pizza. The Bucatini contained guanciale, sauteed red onions, chilli flakes, and a spicy tomato sauce. The Pollo Toscano was topped with chicken, sundried tomatoes, tomato pesto, red onion, and fresh basil. After ordering, you collect your utensils - they had both metal and plastic cutlery. 
My friend and I sat right beside the window, the best spot in the house! I like how they brought us a pitcher of water and would refill it when it was empty. 

The food:
-Bucatini pasta: crunch from the guaniacle (Italian cured pork, like prosciutto), pasta had a nice consistency and length per strand. The pasta was coated in a thick tomato sauce that had a perfect blend of spices. 
-Pollo Toscano: everything was good besides the fresh basil. It does look good (especially for photos) but personally, not a fan of eating it.

The party next to me ordered the same thing my wife and I did. Their bill was 15 dollars more? They tried to upcharge her for an extra egg dish which came complementary with the meals. There were four orders, so 4 egg dishes came with the meal. However, they tried to argue with us and said we had only ordered 3 meals. All of us showed our receipts and they realized they were in fact in the wrong. They corrected their mistake, which was good, but initially they were questioning our complaint. The other mistake was we had to remind the waiter(s) about missing items like our tofu soup, which came late, and our rice. Only two of the group orders got their rice, the other two never did. They combined two groups on two of the grills which was a little annoying because other orders got mixed together and we couldn't tell who's meat or items belonged to which party.

The service was friendly and very efficient.  They have a somewhat modern setup where you are given a number after ordering and when your order is ready, your number is called out and displayed on a TV screen.

Since it was busy, it did take a about 20 minutes until our food was ready.

Sultani Kabab Dinner: 1 filet mignon and 1 kofta kabab
Chaplee Kabab Dinner: spicy minced meat patties

The portions of the dinners were very large as there provided a lot of meat and rice with each meal.  The meat was well seasoned and the Chaplee was nice and spicy, however we were disappointed that all the meat servings were very dry.  There were two sauces that came with the dinners, a red sauce which was a purred tomato sauce, and a white which seemed like some sort of ranch dressing.  Both sauces did not really complement the meal

As for the food, we split the indiviidual size mussels from Brussels (sauteed with bleu cheese,mild sauce, and a hint of cream, steamed in belgian ale), added a side of frites, and we split an individual size pizza with hot sausage. The pizza was the more disappointing of the 2 entrees-the sausage was tasty but the sauce and crust could use some attention. I like that the crust was thin style though. The individual was a 4 cut pie and was sufficient in portion size coupled with the mussels and frites. The sauce with the frites tasted like a mayo/mustard-type sauce and the frites were the thick steak frites so i was happy with that. I really liked the preparation of the mussels we ordered, recommended by the bartender. The bleu cheese flavor was not overwhelming at all and she even offered bread for the remainder of the sauce. The mussels were on the small side but there were a lot of them for being an ""individual"" size portion. I, personally, was satisfied with my experience and would come back.",2014-09-15 15:02:16

It is so easy to pass this place as there is not a large sign that reads ""Rasputin Vodka Bar"" on the front but says Try Stoli Here, or something like that (what is it with Queen East that does this). Once you walk in, it's very cozy, not in a bad way. Walking up a few steps takes you to the main bar which is stacked with different types of vodka. The little mini chandeliers hang in between large mirrors. Walking towards the back you notice a Soviet era military coat, love this! There are tons of couches and chairs to lounge on and it was no problem for our large group of 15 or so. 

The vodka selection is extensive but they may not match what is listed on the menu as we were informed that many on the menu had run out. But the bartenders were great! I watched them pour each drink and every one of them was more than an ounce of vodka. More like all vodka, splash of [blank], which is how all drinks should be.

There weren't as many vodkas as competitor vodka bar Pravda has but there are many different kinds. From the organic vodka from Oregon called Square One to the Roberto Cavalli Vodka. 

While seated, our server brought us little snacks. Some pickles, some bread and lots of corn nuts. I love corn nuts! The bread was gross, do not eat it but the pickles and corn nuts were so good, especially with a drink in hand.

Our server was pretty consistent with checking with us and bringing more drinks and remembering individual's tabs. It was a great atmosphere with splashes of USSR, there was even an ancient cash register in the back by the couches. There is a 2nd bar in the back but it only opens on busier nights.

Not an ounce of snottiness or douchebaggery in this place, although I'd have to come on a busier weekend night to really tell. But as far as I'm concerned, this place is better than Pravda, aside from the minimal vodka choices in comparison.",2009-10-30 19:33:00

The battery already died and there is something wrong with the overhead light and perhaps the Bluetooth. There has been a never ending rattling noise coming from the overhead light and a chirping from the corner of the overhead light and the visor over the steering wheel. It is annoying and loud but somehow the techs at Henderson Chevrolet can't hear it. At one point they said it was paper in my glove box, then something I was imagining, and then my garage door clicker! Then at one point they said maybe I could take it to fairway Chevrolet for a fresh set of ears to listen, /but I wasn't able to make the appointment. 
Recently when I took my car in to replace the battery, which had died, a tech named mike looked at it and although he couldn't hear the noise he informed me they could just replace it because my car is still under Warranty. 
Following that appointment I took several videos with my phone where the noise is audible and even the staff can hear it on my phone. Finally they say they will order the part. They never call me when the part comes in and so I call them on Monday, November 14th, and am informed that the part is in. I make an appointment for friday, November 18th with teresa, and hang up. 
Shortly after that teresa calls back to tell me the the director, Roger, has informed her that they won't be doing the repairs.  She says he has already told me to take it elsewhere. And while, yes, he suggested taking it to fairway, he never made it clear that I was going to have to take it somewhere else. And I made an appointment for them to look at the noise and then went back in and had them order the part and was now waiting for the repairs to be made. And only now, once I have the appointment for the actual work to be done, do they tell me they can't. I'm immensely disappointed. This has been an ongoing issue and they simply refuse to try and make it right. I was told to ask Roger about the decision but when I was transferred it went to voice mail and my call was not returned.
Be careful if you get a car here. I now owe more than the car is worth and don't have enough saved up to get another car. 
When I finally get this car paid down and look for another car, it won't be from here and probably won't be a Chevy at all. Thanks Henderson Chevrolet for costing Chevy a customer.....",2016-11-15 05:41:23

We had four people so based on the waitress' suggestion, we ordered the pork combo for four, which is the only combo they have for a group of people. The combo comes with four types of pork meat, a steamed egg and a soup. It's authentic Korean bbq, so they provide unlimited lettuce, sliced garlic and sauces to wrap the meat. 

The pork meat is tender and tasty. The process of making the wraps is fun too. 

The waitresses are well trained. They usually come to provide refills for water and the supplies for the wraps without even asking them.

He's a rescue pup, and came to us a little timid (ok, a LOT timid) of people, dogs bigger than him, and basically anything that moves :) But I love him, and he's my little baby. 

So our first experience was using the self-wash. They give you your first bath free if you have adoption papers! Total plus. We loved it! The fact that the shampoo and conditioner come out with the water is so helpful! And he left smelling so fresh and clean! The best part is that they do the cleaning up! Good for Mom, and Pup!

Then it was time for Rocky to get a hair cut. We had previously taken him to PetSmart, so I knew he was ok with groomers, but I was still a little worried since he really is scared of people, especially men. So I asked for a girl groomer, and they have me Rochelle. She was WONDERFUL! At first we were both worried Rocky wouldn't let her work on him, but I assured her that after I left, he would calm down. (I think he's just super protective of me) - and I was right! After he was done, he was giving her puppy kisses, so I knew she took good care of him! She did an AMAZING job on the cut!!! Seriously, her work is magical. He comes home looking like a little stud muffin, and I have never felt his fur so SOFT!! So we have come back a few times, and every time Rocky and Mom leave happy. 

They also have fresh doggie cookies!! These are Rocky's favorite, so I make sure I always get some when we are in the store. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, and can't say enough great things!!",2011-10-07 15:00:19

It will be worth it though and once your name is on the list you can either get drinks at the bar, or walk down to Thomas Street Tavern or the wine bar just below. 

The setting is intimate and I prefer the booth seating as it feels like you have your own private room for the group. The other tables are fine too, the only seating I do not recommend is at the DJ booth. There is a great view of downtown from the outside balcony, which is also very nice to take in during the Sunday brunch.

I can honestly say they have the atmosphere down and the service was indeed some of the best I have had ever, but the food was subpar. Maybe I ordered wrong, maybe I didn't understand the culinary vision, who knows. Ordered the pork belly tacos- thought they would be on a bun not an undercooked taco shell (seriously a best seller) but I don't get the allure. Difficult to eat with the huge chunks of watermelon, but good caramelization on the meat. The ramen was disgusting - not sure what that was. The nachos were a great idea- fried skins with pimento cheese and pickled okra - OMG get me a cardiologist because there is no way I can say no to that kind of seduction, except for when I could because the pimento cheese lacked seasoning. 

I don't think I will return for the food because to be honest for an innovative tapas place I expect better, but the cucumber mule was amazing especially when they modified it with Gin for me.

Well I do happen to enjoy Panera Bread although it is an ironic modern depiction of what a Café is. They have some pretty tasty almost-homemade soups and sandwiches and some fantastic coffee. A nice bakery to keep your sweet tooth satisfied and your belly full. More specifically though. I despise this location.

I have been to this location a bunch of times (over 20 at least) and every time I go it seems the same kind of disappointing experience. A couple examples:

 First of all the first time I went here in my life I was still in high school and was here just doing some homework. Not one single table was clean so I cleaned it myself. I went to the front and ordered some soup, a coffee, and a water and got to work on some un-important  English paper that I would never remember. The second I opened my laptop to start working, an employee comes over and very rudely says ""how old are you? you can't sit here all night  doing homework."" Keep in mind I had only a few sips from my soup and coffee when she arrived in front of me. 

I look up and say excuse me? So she repeats herself. I said well I am a paying customer and you have free wifi, so if people are welcome to use free wifi and you have coffee and a bakery, what kind of place is this? She proceeded to say that they were a Fast-food Restaurant and that she didn't want to get stuck there after her shift to clean my table. I told her not one of these tables were cleaned when I sat down. She grunted and said ""yeah right"" and trotted away. So, having felt extremely disrespected; packed up my laptop and homework, left my full cup of coffee along with the water and full bowl of soup and walked to the front cash register where her, and her manager were standing. As I walk up I even hear her bitching to her manager about me sitting and doing homework. 

She notices me out of the corner of her eye and immediately stops talking and walks into the back. So I say, ""too late"". I tell the manager I want my money back for what she had just said to me while I was sitting down. I said I did not feel welcome and would like to take my money elsewhere. The manager agreed but only because I had walked up on them talking about me. I got my money back and said I left my entire meal at my table and left. I couldn't believe it.

Quickly 2 others, one for some reason one of the booths was just missing an entire bench. so their replacement was a random chair which I will try to put in the pictures section of this location. Also I just went here today and ordered and just got a very ""hurry up so I can do nothing"" response. No thank you just here is your change and move on.

Always order my favorite:

Chicken Satay $7.95
- These are HUGE. Feels like you almost get a full chicken breast with every piece and the peanut sauce is good!

Crab Wonton $5.95
- Not something I always order when out eating thai but I did here and they were cooked perfectly. I know they are fairly easy to make but I think everyone's had some pretty horribly cooked (burned, no filling, ect.. I know you're thinking of those bad one's right now) CW's and these are not the case here.

Pad Thai $8.50
- 5 spice & tastes like 5 spice. Comes with sprouts, carrot shreds, lime & peanuts on the side for flavoring as desired.

All three of these are plenty of food for two people (this evening it was me -starving & my preggo buddy & there were leftovers!).

The best way to describe this restaurant is that it's a ""no-frills"" sushi restaurant. What you see is what you get; nothing more. There is no menu, and what you see being offered is the extent of what's available. The prices I find are very reasonable for the quality you receive.

Overall this restaurant is good for your cheap, fill-it-up sushi. Of course it depends on what sushi is being offered that day, but I find the fish overall quite fresh and definitely worth trying.

We were so excited to check it out upon opening and would look at the pictures on window in anticipation of having a different option for a quick bite or a nite out to dine. 

We were in the area and actually heading to WholeFood to grab a bite and noticed that this place was now open so we strolled in. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty busy. We tried various items including the pasta seafood dish, the burger and fries and the fish & chips. Everything was ""Meh"". Our teenager stated that she wish we went to Whole Food for her burger. My husband and I wish we went to Dogwood Tavern across the street as they have much better food. 

A BIG plus is the ladies room as they have a clean changing table and also lady personal needs in a nice vase in case one runs out or had a visitor while out (hint hint).

This place could be much better as we had high hopes, in big on giving places a second try so I'll watch the reviews and if I see things are looking up I'll head back for a 2nd chance and see how it goes and update my review accordingly.",2016-10-06 01:55:15

The sashimi is fresh, cut in nice sizes and the sushi is great too since they don't pile on the rice. The specialty rolls were good too except for the black snow roll.. didn't really like the rice paper. And the spicy salmon was a bit too spicy for me but different strokes for different folks! The mississauga roll was especially good..love their cream cheese. I also liked it in the cheese wonton. The mushroom and beef roll was great. The house salad was lacklustre though. Oh well.

The best thing about this place is the service. No, they're not smiley or super-polite but it's decent enough and not very important for AYCE. What was great was that they didn't miss any orders.. a common occurrence in AYCE, and the food came out FAST... so much that we had plates covering the entirety of our table.

(There are more single-occupancy, gendered restrooms upstairs.) You order downstairs and then pick up the food when your buzzer goes off. 

The menu is varied, with rice bowls, salads, wraps, sides, drinks, and desserts. The chicken tiki masala bowl was tasty even without an added sauce, and a respectable portion to boot. Look out: the lamb meatball wrap was surprisingly spicy (not in a bad way, just...in a surprising way). The samosas are small but delectable, and you could totally order the samosa chaat with the mango laasi for a small meal. The vegetarian sloppy joe was​ reportedly good, on something like a potato roll. The biriyani was disappointing, however. While the crust was crunchy like a large, impossibly thin chip (I ate the whole thing), the inside was not particularly moist. Our table also agreed that the naan was a disappointment, having the taste and texture of pizza crust. 

Nevertheless, we are likely to come back when we want a quick meal (this time we were not quick enough to qualify for free parking behind the restaurant; after 45 minutes it's $3).

While my husband and I have always enjoyed Indian food, we haven't had a lot of experience with it in the past. Phoenix probably isn't really the best place for eating authentic Indian Cuisine, anyway. 

However, after living in Japan, they surprisingly had many Indian restaurants in our city that were owned by immigrants from different parts of India. We loved going to these places, and a bonus was that the employees always spoke English!! :P We also visited Thailand, which of course had many incredible Indian restaurants--definitely a good thing since they had a lot of vegetarian options! However, after eating all of this delicious curry and naam from abroad, we couldn't go back to what we were used to... I couldn't even eat the Japanese-style curry anymore.

Naturally, when we got back, I had the urge to eat some curry and naam... so I did a Yelp search to find the best Indian food in the area. Up came India Garden, which I was a bit surprised about because I've driven past it so many times and it didn't look like anything special from the outside. It doesn't look bad at all, but the name and the storefront are rather generic...

I'm so glad we decided to give it a try, though, because inside is awesome!!! They also have a decently-priced lunch buffet, but I hate buffets... I don't like other people breathing over or touching my (potential) food :P I might give it a try though, since they seem very clean at India Garden! Plus, it might be fun to try some new stuff.

We went here for dinner and loved everything we had. Unfortunately, we ordered too much and couldn't finish it all -- this is something I feel really guilty about. We took the leftovers though, but... it's just never the same reheated! :P However, next time we go, I know that the portions are pretty large!!! :) Their drinks were great too. We just had tea (I think... can't remember) but I believe they had a full bar. I can't really remember, though. The staff was also excellent, and it wasn't too busy inside.

This is the sort of place that would quickly sort of feel like family, so very much wish this was a local place for me.  But at least we had a chance to enjoy the hospitality and yummy food during our vacation. 

The interior disinviting and stylish to my take.  We started with some great wine and got down to order interesting things.  Everyone raves about the cauliflower, and rightly so.  This is a nearly perfect treat.  I would order this every time no matter what!  The croquettes are nicely done and a good take on a traditional item.  The scallops were amazing as well. Nicely seared with a puree and lovely crisp and salty pork.  To be honest I can't remember if it was bacon or not, but the trick with the scallops is you need a bit of each item in the dish to make it work.  All three tastes combine make this a special dish, so be sure to eat it that way.  WE also had the short rib terrine which was fine, but not as wow as the other two things.  But this is also about exploring ideas, and sometimes it might not work for everyone, but the courage to try create non-traditional tapas and put them out there is appreciated.  A bowl of yummy chocolate brittle was a perfect way to end the meal.  Just wish I could go back and have more cauliflower and work my way through the menu.

When the place looks like this on the outside , Its no surprise to see an empty establishment on the inside.

Food is absolutely nothing to be desired as the pastas are over priced and just not good. The food came quickly which tells me that the microwave is used frequently to reheat ur food . The same food that's ever so eloquently advertised on the menu as fresh. 
How can it food be so fresh when the place is dead/asleep ... No customers = no turnover = spoiled fast prepared food . 
The staff just looks like they don't want to be there . 
The management just don't care and the owners either are not aware or are of the same mentality. If this place is still around in a year I will eat my shoe.....

The lake itself is nice and accessible on many areas. The park wasn't empty but it didn't feel crowded to say the least. There are plenty of park picnic areas and quite a few benches along the lake side.

The play area for the kids is great and a nice break from the lake.

I recall that the hodo kwajas I used to pick up at a small shop in new kennedy plaza (not sure if it still exists) was better and had a stronger red bean flavour. The hodo kwajas here really are just very sweet.

WRT the hoddeok, since it wasn't fresh (not the stores fault since they were almost closing), there wasn't really a crispy outside and chewy inside that I was hoping for. The dough part was basically just soft and chewy throughout with a gooey black sugar filling, that was a bit too sweet for my personal tastes.

I wanted something on the healthy side, so I ordered their Greek salad with grilled lamb on top, along with a small bowl of their lemon chicken soup (which comes with rice apparently, but they ran out).  The Greek salad was very fresh and the lamb (3 pieces) were grilled to perfection, though not very seasoned.  The lemon chicken soup had plenty of chicken in it and was actually very lemony and sour, which I liked.  The salad dressing is one of the tastier ones I've had at a chain as well.

Of course they are recommended, but we had chosen another venue and changed our minds at the last minute.  The hostess was very nice and accommodating and asked us to wait in the bar for approximately 15 minutes while a table was being readied.  That was great with us.  At the bar we enjoyed a mixed drink each.  Drinks here are about $15 pp.  We were promptly seated near the windows and had a cozy table for two.  The view onto the Strip and the Fountains of Bellagio are fantastic.  Prime is definitely an upscale venue.  We had one primary waiter and two others who assisted.  The menu is a la carte and comprehensive.  I selected the Squash Soup ($15) and it is poured into your bowl at the table.  She selected the baby Iceberg Salad ($18).  There is nothing baby about the salad; it's huge.  You will be full after eating it.  We shared and both were delicious.  For the main course we ordered the 18 oz Ribeye ($64) - just one - and I asked the waiter to split it at the table.  It was more than enough for two.  We also had the roasted Asparagus ($14), the Mushrooms (($16) and Mac and Cheese ($12).  That was too much and I told the waiter it probably was.  All of it was delicious!  The total, without tip, was $164, and that included one more mixed drink for me.

Actually, I thought the venue, service and experience overall was excellent, responsive and courteous.  The prime Ribeye was good, but not the best I've had.  I would rate it 3.5 stars, although it was cooked properly, by the time it was served, it was a bit cool.  I like a steak hot.  This was not.  I did not complain -- it was fine, just not hot.  By the time I had eaten the last morsel, it was definitely cold.  If you like rare, this is perfect for you.  

I agree with the other reviewers that this is a beautiful restaurant overlooking the fountains.  During the weekend, the fountains are active every 15 minutes, so this is quite a show while you dine.  Very romantic.",2014-11-02 14:31:14

Anyway, after a long day of biking and walking around, my sister and I headed over to Kazu for dinner.  We got there at 9:31pm.  It closed at 9:30pm.  Sad...so sad. (N.B. It may been 9:01 and 9:00...but you get it.)

I was hungry.  My sister was hungry.  We no longer cared what we ate.

My sister suggested P.M.  She said it's the only Chinese restaurant in downtown Montreal that she and her friends will eat it.  

When it comes to ambience and environment, a Chinese restaurant is like the average girl.  You do one, you've done them all.  Sorry, was that too brazen? 

P.M. is no different.  It had the usual white table cloth and that subtle clean but unclean feeling.  Nothing some tea can't fix.  Service was just as quick-quick, but friendly.  I ordered up my favourite dish: ""gong chow how woah wow"" (my Chinese friends are REELING right now...I totally butchered their language, meh).  The waiter knew what I was saying - beef fried rice noodles, and eggplant and tofu.

The food was good, a little better than average.  I didn't take photos because when my sister asked if I was going to post about P.M. I said ""no...it's Chinese"".  But then...random friend of a friend asked me if there were good Chinese restaurants in Montreal.  Ding, ding, ding.  I always forget that there are people out there who love them some Chinese. 

For me, the best thing about Chinese restaurants is that you tip small, leave full, and your wallet's still heavy.",2011-08-31 14:57:39

I have not had good luck with nail salons in my area. I have lived around Bell and 43rd for a good 15 years, and FINALLY, I found LK Hand and Foot Spa! (Thanks to Yelp)

My mom and I walked in at 430 on a Tuesday evening. A young lady at the front desk helped us sign in, pick colors and decide what we wanted to do. We were seated in super nice, brand new Message Foot Spa seats. The tub you put your feet in is covered in new plastic for every new customer. They perfect temperature water with floating citrus and flower pedals. There are 2 large chandeliers that hang from the ceiling, and a few more small ones through out. That paired with the Royal Purple curtains and walls makes you feel like you are in a modern Queens Den of luxury. The 2 ladies we had were very nice, professional, and SUPER detailed to everything they were doing. Any kind of tool they took out was wrapped in plastic, used once, and put away to be re-sanitized and put back in new plastic. 

The prices are just right. Very reasonable. 18 for basic Pedicure, 20 for set of Gel, 25 for Gel Manicure, ect... And this place is the CLEANEST nail salon I have ever been in. Not even a spec of dust could I detect. 

I can't believe this place has been located walking distance from my house for over a year and I just found out about them. I'm so happy I did. My nails and feet will continue to be very happy.",2016-05-11 19:26:30

Having tried a couple of Ethiopian restaurants in the area I decided to find something new on Yelp. Blue Nile seemed to have decent reviews.

We ordered the vegetarian combo. The food was definitely more than my mother and I could finish and it was all very tasty. From my visits to other Ethiopian places in Vegas like Axum, I can say this was definitely the best tasting Ethiopian food I have had in the area.

Additionally the wait staff was very friendly. When we came in we were the only people in the restaurant and they treated us very well. They patiently described all the dishes that my mother asked about and made us feel very welcome. In fact later on in the evening during our coffee ceremony some of the wait staff's family came in with some homemade bread they had made. They cut some of it up and offered it to us as well.

This would have been a five star review, but the ambience just wasn't there. Maybe it was because we came so late and no one else was in the restaurant. Regardless this is definitely a restaurant I will be visiting again.",2009-11-05 15:34:20

I'm not normally a huge fan of the Old Port, too many tourists and everything is a little bit more expensive that it should be.  And then there's the fact that it's difficult for an Italian to go out for Italian food, it's never as good as the food your mom or grandma makes.

Bevo delivered!  We were a group of 8, and we were seated very comfortably.  Not too squished together, or too close to the other tables.  The space is quite nice and open.  We started out with beers and a bunch of shared appetizers.  They have a nice selection of both local and import draft beer, which always scores bonus points with me.  The sausage as part of the sausage and rapini dish was the closest I have tasted in restaurant to the sausage my parents make at home (and it's some good stuff!).  All the other apps were quite nice too, including the meat balls, the calamari and the seafood salad.

It's no secret I love pizza.  Cheap pizza.  Expensive pizza.  Fancy pizza. Cheese and carbs and toppings, I like it!  I tried the Emilia Romogna, intrigued by the meat raggu, and yum yum yum!  A really hearty and tasty pizza!  Was it as good as pizza I've had in Italy?  Maaaaaybe.  Was it some pretty good pizza!  Definitely!  Everyone else seemed to really love their pizza as well, whether it was a simple margherita pizza or a more involved pizza.

Bevo got more bonus points when at the end of the meal they brought out a dessert pizza for us to share, on the house!  It was exactly what it sounds like: nutella on a pizza base.  Simple and tasty. 

One thing that Bevo is missing is a good house wine, brought out in big carafes.  It's fine to offer a large wine list, but sometimes you just want an inexpensive and delicious wine to wash everything down, and you don't need a fancy bottle to do that.  A house blend would be perfect.

So overall, I will keep Bevo in mind the next time I want to have a nice yet casual dinner in the Old Port.",2013-10-17 20:18:05

 I'm reviewing this,which is my old location and will be reviewing my new location.
A few years back I was introduced to Community Tire at a festival where they had a booth.Spin the wheel and win a free something or other.
well,who doesn't love a spinning wheel,and I won a free oil change.
So I go.
Great service,friendly staff,incredible management.
Have been a customer at this location for almost 4 years.
Never had a problem,never had any products or services suggested that weren't neccessary,no hard sell.
Fast foward to this year.
Got a new to me car.
A 2010 american car.From the dealership.where they do all the preventive maintenence stuff before they sell it to you.
My first oil change with my new baby.
All new staff.No big,same owner,I'm sure I'm good.
43,000 miles.
""Oh,you need a power steering flush.The fluid is dirty"".
I've owned this car for 3 months...
That's a pricey service.
Guess where I'm going?Right back to Ford to have them take care of it.
Ford shows me and tells me this service wasn't neccessary,however they do the service for me gratis so I can have peace of mind.
Next oil change at 46,000 miles.
""Oh you need new brakes and new tires""
WTF????
At 46,000 miles?????
""Here's the quote""
Tires alone were almost 200..EACH!
Um...No.
I do let them do the brakes as I wanted to upgrade to ceramics anyway,just didn't think I needed them at 46,000 miles...
I tell them hell no on the tires.
Get the car back,drive for a few days and my tire pressure light comes on.
I'm near Discount Tire,so I pull in to have them take a look see.
2 tires are fine,one is underinflated(even though Community claimed to check)then the 4th tire is at 51 psi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My tire is supposed to be at 32....WTF again????
I have sent folks to this location for as long as I've been going.
The ex had similar experiences with ""needing""services once
this new team came on board.So have a few other friends who I've sent there.
We're all asking each other what the hell happened?
So now my car is at a 51,000 mile and guess what,I need an oil change and am dreading going back.I've lost trust,but who can you trust anymore????
I Well,all I know is I ain't going back to that location,I will try another to give this family owned business another shot....",2011-11-09 00:59:03

Ricky, the waiter, was very personable - he was fantastic.  The food was okay.  The appetizers were very good - cheese curds and onion rings.  Tasty.  For dinner, I got the pot roast over noodles.  It sounded like a nice comfort food dish.  When served, it wasn't quite the ""Ma's home cooking"" I thought it would be, but it was alright.  Not quite enough roast, but it tasted fine.  The soups there were pretty decent - nice to get a bowl with each meal.  I tried someone's cole slaw and it too was pretty good.

Overall, the food is what you would expect at a typical diner.  Not the best, but not the worst.  The burgers looked pretty good - I'd probably try one of those next time.  The french dip looked a little dry, which made me think I would have regretted getting the philly, which was my second choice.  The menu has a little bit of everything, so everyone in your party should find something to order.

The ambiance was classic diner.  If you've seen this place from the outside, you should NOT be surprised by the 60's style diner interior.  If you're not up for that, then just stay away.

Would I go back?  Yeah, sure - if something was planned there.  Sun Prairie isn't exactly next door, so something besides the food would have to draw me there.

You place your orders on an iPad, so it's fairly easy if you've got a smallish group. 

Quality is so-so. Rice on the sushi is crumbly and some times falls apart when dipping in soy sauce. Galbi beef is delicious, but it's incredibly fatty. 

Salads, wasabi, and pickled ginger are at the salad bar at the back of the restaurant, so you can help yourself while your order is being made.

But the host still put us into the wine table which is very small and not really convenient to eat dinner cause my table located in the very corner. I ordered Grilled Salmon and the special of the day which is Sirloin Steak. The food was excellent. My grilled salmon was the most delicate and melt-in-your mouth-food that I ever tasted. And the Sirloin steak was great. They cooked it perfectly and as order. Overall I am satisfied with the food but not so much with the service that I got from the front host.

I have gotten the margarita sampler and that was really good. The blood orange one was delicious. 

The guacamole is really fresh and tasty. I like my guacamole spicy and it wasn't really spicy but I am sure if you ask they will adjust it for you. 

They give you a salsa that is mildly spicy but they have a spicy one so if you like spicy food ask for the spicy one. You will not be disappointed.

Leanne C.'s review pretty much sums up our experience there. I got told I could have cake, then the cake was a lie, then there was cake again. Quit playing with my heart! I would've ordered some food to go with the cake if you hadn't taken almost an hour to bring it out of the freezer. My love of dessert for dinner is unrivaled, but this was really crappy cake that I ended up giving away because I couldn't stomach it's frozen sickly sweetness. I suggest that you inform people next time you're serving them cold chocolate cake because I kind of envisioned a warm fluffy moist piece of chocolate yumminess.

Service was awful, bad, below mediocre, crap, pick any negative adjective you like. Sake was ordered at the start of the meal and came out near the end after we had said we didn't want it anymore since it was so late, at least our server realized how big of a mess that was and comped us for it.

It's not terrible, but at best, it's average (slightly better than average on a few items such as their baked beans, salmon cake, and smoked salmon bagel).

Our server didn't seem to notice the char that was supposed to be our toast, in fact, besides taking our order, he didn't speak at all. It was the busboy who inquired if things were okay, and offered to ask the kitchen to change the toast (we declined, as we had finished). The smoothie was quite watered down, and not what you'd expect from a 'supposedly' chic place, although the hot chocolate was not too shabby.

Bh3TzAtFc1FHovCooS7QQA,uJaQMDCrYriQi_ReYKrfag,YrtAT1B8aFp5dKNss1ICbw,5,2,0,0,"This sushi restaurant is close to my new house but I have been coming here off and on for years. Back when I wanted to explore all sushi restaurants in Arizona to pick the best, this place was always at the top of my list. I always refer to Moon, a lady who I think is the owner, as my Japanese mother because she did a lot to make me feel warm, welcome, and loved.

While I don't see Moon much anymore, the atmosphere of that feeling still exists. The people are warm and inviting, although sometimes I wish there were more waiters (you will often be waiting for a seat, a menu, someone to take your order). While this is not overwhelming, it is noticeable. Have yourself some saké (they have a large selection but my favorite has always been Sho Chiku Bai Nigori saké) and deal with it, though. Let yourself unwind from the day and stop being so uptight. Just chill and soak up some atmosphere (the restaurant is beautifully decorated and it has actually opened up in years since I first came here.).

They bring you out miso soup (seaweed and tofu with green onions). If you love miso soup, this is the best from all sushi restaurants I have visited in The Valley. It's flavorful and not too salty (which is a problem a lot of miso soups have). It is not overrun with seaweed or tofu. It's perfect.

In this order I ordered ebi tempura (battered shrimp - see attached picture). The sauce to dip it in is a light soy based (again not too salty) sauce. Honestly, I found myself loving the tempura so much, I rarely used the dip. The shrimp is tender and delicious and the tempura only serves to highlight this. It is also the best tempura I have had in The Valley (did I mention I go to a lot of sushi places?). I'm also quite particular with batter and tempura specifically because it's hard to get it just right. Sometimes it's over-cooked or under-cooked and leaves a lingering aftertaste. That's not the case with this tempura. It's light and literally melts in your mouth. I loved it.

Finally, I order the 911 roll (see attached photo) as my piece  d'resistance. I typically like my sushi rolls fresh with no mayo or sauce or extraneous crap that detracts from the flavor of fish. The chef does a wonderful job of melding the flavors of each fish (tuna, salmon, yellow tail, white fish, crab stick, and shrimp) with the avocado, green onions, and masago (fish eggs). I think that the masago is a bit sparse on this roll for my taste. I feel like more masago would have punched up this roll a bit. Overall, the roll is fresh, not too fishy, covered in ponzu, the flower is actually edible (you should eat it! It's really delicious!), and leaves you happy with your eyes rolling into the back of your head if you are a seafood lover like I am. 

I would recommend Sekai Sushi wholeheartedly. I would consider it a diamond in the rough and something you should include in your sushi repertoire.",2018-03-07 01:57:27

1) Burgers!
2) Gelato!

I've been tempted time and time again by the sign stating:
Burgers! Gelato!

Today, I gave in and I have no regrets.

I really appreciate the fact that all the ingredients are locally sourced.
Even though burgers and gelato might not be the best foods for you, 
Capitano serves up these eats as clean, fresh, and natural as possible.

If you get a regular burger, you can top it as you please.
The price is fair at $4.95 - $5.95.
Beef, chicken, haddock, or soy patty.

I'm pretty lazy when it comes to burger toppings, I generally go with burgers that are dressed up for me.  The dressed burgers range in price ($6.50 to $8.50) 

The Capitan burger was my burger of choice and one of the most popular.
It was $8.50 + $3.50 to make it a combo.
* The burgers are a perfect size
* The fresh baked organic flour bun was fresh and chewy
* The horemone-anitbiotic-free angus beef burger patty itself was tasty but slightly overcooked.
* The deep friend portabello mushroom-cheese patty wasn't as crispy as I would have liked on the outside and not very cheesy but not bad

The gelato is made in-house and it surprised me!
It looked a bit melty in the display, but very thick and firm once cupped.
The pistachio had chunks of nuts, the coconut still had yummy coconut bits.
I like how it wasn't completely smoothly blended.  It was more fun to eat.
The size small is pretty small though.
Gelato has no additives and the fruit flavours are dairy free.

The owner was super friendly and proud of their food.
They mentioned that they want to venture into more adventurous meats, bison and even alligator, but they will see.

Overall, I was very satisfied with my burger...and  I've eaten a lot of burgers.
The poutine here seems promising.

We had been wanting to try this place for awhile and often saw a line out the door as we drove by.  However, the morning that we went was perfect for us and we were actually the only two people in the restaurant in the 15 minutes or so that it took us to order and eat.  The menu is located behind the register and seems to be pretty simple and also very affordable.  They have 5 different waffles and toppings combinations to choose from as well as that you get to pick the toppings.  After looking everything over I decided on having the Bruges and a coffee while my girlfriend decided on the Charleroi.  I received my coffee right after ordering and we went and sat down at one of the small bars around the side of the place.  I would say that it probably could only seat about 8 people at a time.  I then decided to try the coffee and thought that it was ok but not great.  Shortly thereafter our waffles came out.  The Bruges came out as a sugar waffle topped with strawberries and whipped cream, just as I expected while my girlfriends sugar waffle came out with bananas and nutella.  I really enjoyed my waffle with my favorite part surprisingly being the waffle itself.  It had a nice sugary flavor to it which I do not know that I have experienced in a waffle before.  My girlfriend thought the same and also really enjoyed her waffle and toppings.
 
The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future, even for an after meal treat.  The waffles far exceeded my expectations and while I do not think that a single waffle itself is enough for a meal, they are definitely cheap enough that you could buy multiple things without feeling much squeeze on your wallet.",2013-01-08 23:23:39

Came by Poetry for the launch of issue 2 of the Toronto Review of Books (TRB) with some friends. I had heard of this place via BlogTO and we thought it'd be fun to check it out on a night where there was an event. This hidden place is cozy with interesting decor, moody lighting, and groovy beats. There's an upright piano in one corner, plush leather chairs, a beautiful old record player, outdoor sofas (with blankets - it wasn't that cold out, so we actually chilled outside for a bit. the front patio would be awesome come summertime), and drink menus glued into taschen art books. The place is quite small, with a narrow bar area and some tiny tables. Due to the event, the place was crammed. I think it would be a very different experience on a quiet night, and will definitely be back, maybe on a weeknight. Service is friendly but slooooow. I almost thought they forgot our order. I tried the Spanish Sky ($9.50), which is like a mojito, with lots of fresh mint and blueberries and rasberries. It was delish! They have a short list of cocktails, with evocative names like Bette Davis, Back to Black, or Bitches Brew. There are a few beers on tap and a small wine list too.

It's been quite some time since I've had one; until the gang and I stopped at Peanut Butter Jelly Time on the first cold Sunday in December. 

We were immediately greeted with giant smiles and hellos from the staff. I mean, who wouldn't smile all the time if you got to play with peanut butter and jelly all day long? 

Josh got almost everything on the menu. Sushi, sandwiches, animal crackers...the kids wound up with Mom's Classic, just your (not so) standard PB&J, and I ordered the Fluff-a-Nut. Oh, mylanta. It took me right back to my bad perm, grandmas shoulder pads, and all the goodness that comes with the 90's. 

This concept is awesome. I love the ideas and creativity that went into the menu. It's witty and they literally have anything you'd want on a pb&j. 

The only drawback I had was the seating. The gang runs four deep, and they really only have low tables for two. But hey! It's all good when you push the tables together!!

When the shin came out to the table I'm not going to lie I was pretty excited. But after trying it was quickly disappointed. It was Doused in BBQ sauce to the point where you couldn't taste the beef. I was hoping the lobster I ordered would save the day since It was highly recommended by the waiter. Unfortunately they destroyed what seemed to be a beautiful cooked lobster by smothering it with béchamel. In my world that's a crime especially at $58.,2014-11-18 21:07:30

We were lucky to discover Cuttlefish during a Yelp event, and after tasting a few items (like the delectable melts in your-mouth gnocchi - it ), we couldn't wait to go back for a full meal.  We definitely weren't disappointed!  

SERVICE:  From the hostess to the exit, everyone was really nice.  Get a reservation - it gets busy on Friday and Saturday nights, but the service doesn't suffer a bit.  Our server was both pleasant and professional - great jokes but also extremely knowledgeable about the menu (great suggestions, no trips back to the kitchen to verify anything).  Our entire meal was perfectly timed, and every single item was the perfect temperature.  

FOOD/DRINKS:  We chose a Sauvignon Blanc and a Pinot Grigio from the wine list and they were lovely.  We started with the delicious albacore appetizer that was free as a thank you for attending a Yelp event (no, thank You!) - firm, fresh and so nicely prepared!  

Next came the fresh, piping hot rolls with whipped herb butter - pumpernickel and multigrain (I think?).  We tried to eat only a small amount and failed.  

Our favorite item, among wonderful things, was the shrimp and grits - three enormous shrimp with dry-rub, grilled to perfection over creamy polenta and marscapone with a touch of pesto.  Order this!  It's amazing.

For the main meal, they split the Branzino Putanesca onto two plates for us, and it was some of the most beautifully cooked fish I've had - perfection with lovely Italian flavors in the red sauce.  

We also ordered the Dungeness Crab mac n cheese - absolutely delicious, with such excellent crab flavor coming through the gourmet cheeses.

ATMOSPHERE:  The decor is pleasant and upscale, but with touches of flair - their wall accent color is turquoise (to go with the martime theme), and the beautiful oyster bar has vespas for seats!  The booths are comfy, and so are the chairs.  They have Happy Hour (until 8pm!) at their beautiful bar and on the patio.  The servers and bussers are well turned out in white.  

OVERALL:  Eat here!  I'm definitely a stickler for value, and the prices here aren't low, but the standard of excellence exceeds them.  Already dreaming of going back...",2014-03-03 21:28:52

I will give them a pass for the staff shortcomings today; things were a bit hectic for them, with the news crew being on site.

We were there for quite a while, so The Vig provided everyone with a nice ""starter"" of yogurt, granola, and sliced strawberries. It was delicious, and would easily make a great, light, healthy breakfast.

When we were able to order, we chose the french toast, the huevo banco, the Uptown and At 'Em, and one of the childrens dishes. (We shared, and took some home. Don't judge)

The french toast was simply AMAZING! Didn't even use the syrup, as it wasn't needed.

The huevo banco was also fantastic! It was my first experience with sauteed bananas, and I'm definitely a fan!

The pork was juicy and delicious, and the tortilla base was really good.

The orange juice was wonderful. The coffee was nice and hot, but not as readily available as I hoped.

This was my first experience having an actual meal at The Vig Uptown. I will excuse the issues I observed as being the result of the news crew.

In any case, they were not enough to dissuade future visits. In fact, I think The Vig Uptown may soon become a regular haunt for me. I'm hoping to get a good game of bocce ball in.

Thanks again to both The Vig and Up Agency, and especially to Ty, for being such a great guy!

P.S. One of these days I'll get myself over to the original Vig.",2010-08-29 21:17:00

pBVnVq9d4IJI62J_UV6Alg,3Av38uh8aHDvZMV_1eojQA,NFm869_w6cvVaWaNpAzjeA,4,6,3,5,"When my friends told me about this place in Charlotte that had a large variety of food and they started listing out the food, I thought they were just pulling my leg. Literally they were talking about tacos, wings, sushi, ramen, mac and cheese, paninis, and the list goes on. When I heard of all the choices, I thought it must be one of those spots that don't do anything really well so they just go for pure diversity so while I was apprehensive about heading to this joint as my last meal for my final work trip to Charlotte, I decided to be open minded and give it a shot. This joint is located in an area which has apparently gone through a lot of modifications/upgrades over the recent years according to my friend. The spot itself is up a flight of stairs and there are some patio seats outside and the moment you step inside, you see a bar along with a few booths and tables around. 

The spot has a policy of only seating tables when your entire party has arrived so something to keep in mind if you are going with a large group. We were seated quickly given our group was present and we were given menus quickly after. Sure enough this place has a ton of options and while we had a tough time narrowing it down, we went with Asian Glazed pork belly tacos, lamb lollipops, Dirty South Nachos, Shells and Cheese, Korean Chicken Wings, the Cuban panini, and the Red Dragon Roll. We also ordered off the drink menu as the bar had an extensive menu so should be a lot of options for any type of drinker. The Asian Glazed pork belly tacos were out first and they were good. The pork belly was tender and while the watermelon chunks were a bit big, it actually was not overwhelming. A solid fusion starter for sure. The Dirty south Nachos were out next and these were really good although the presentation of it was quite interesting. The pimento cheese fondue was good but it wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for and ended up being just a bit too much cheese for me. The lamb lollipops were by far my least favorite and I would recommend staying away from it. The meat was a bit tough to eat and there wasn't a ton of flavor on this but we ended up ordering enough food to not be starving. The Shells and cheese were good and while I did not think the BBQ pork would go well, it ended up being a solid dish and I was pleasantly surprised. The Korean chicken wings were Good and I bet they are probably considered very good given the lack of Korean restaurants in Charlotte. A good dish for the local market so props to them for it. The Cuban panini was very solid and definitely a crowd pleaser. The meats were tender and it was the right balance of all the ingredients to make it a tasty panini. The roll that we ordered ended up being solid for rolls. I don't eat too many rolls anymore but it tasted like a solid roll and the fish quality was good surprisingly. A hidden surprise and I think something that would do well in the CLT market.

All in all, I think the food was good at this joint. I actually want to give this joint a lot of props for trying a lot of different fusion combinations that while sound weird, actually ended up being Good in the end. I certainly think that it's a solid spot in the CLT dining scene and want to give them props for the risks they are taking for these unique recipes.",2017-11-21 05:14:42

Even though the menu is pretty meat-heavy, there are plenty of vegetarian options, and I always come out feeling like I didn't totally throw my diet away. That being said, they have THE BEST baklava in the city--buttery and sweet, and tastes great washed down with thimble-sized glasses of strong tea or Turkish coffee.

Now, I'm going to get the names of the dishes all messed up...but the plata a la plancha with carnitas was so YUMMY!!

Now, I don't really understand the habanero sauce that was on top of the dish, but the meat was cooked perfectly, so who cares. I didn't touch the accompaniments because I'm on a keto diet...so the meat and veggies were a PERFECT dinner for me. I didn't miss the tortillas, rice and beans at all.

My BF had the habanero shrimp and added steak option. SOOO good.

The food is very fresh and flavorful, and the portions are very generous. The food takes a bit long, but once it comes out hot and fresh, I forgave them immediately!! I got the taco salad in a taco bowl.

We took the elevator down to the main level and the light rail was right there and we walked right on.  It is a great set-up with the trains feeling very clean and modern and it is smart that they didn't put much seating in the trains so everyone has room for their luggage and you simply hold on to the hand rail.  It was only a couple of minutes on the train before the doors opened and we were at Terminal 4.  It was a quick escalator ride and then a short walk through a very modern walkway and we were in Terminal 4!  Very slick.

We went for brunch and it was pretty good. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Harlem Benny. My guy enjoyed his brunch item but I'm a little more picky. I really think instead of serving the sauces in plastic cups, HU might invest in some nice steel cups or even just drizzle the sauces directly on the meal. The plastic cups just make the whole thing look cheap. I have a feeling the gravy served was of the packet variety, homemade gravy tastes a little more fuller than the packaged variety (I could be wrong).

My chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffle was soft and spongy, a nice contrast to the crispy chicken. I really enjoyed the scotch bonnet syrup!

On to the coffee. I ordered a latte and he ordered his regular black drip. His coffee tasted pretty awful, and it was just black drip. My latte was way too milky, not foamed properly and the espresso was weak (as in I didn't taste any).

Service was decent as the restaurant was pretty empty. So hire a better barista (or train staff better) and stop using cheap plastic cups.",2013-12-11 16:56:26

I have had Khmer food before, which is ironic, as my wife is from Vietnam, but never had Khmer food from Cambodia.  She has to come to the USA to experience Khmer food!!  I have eaten Khmer food in San Francisco CA, and in Siem Reap.

Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.  

The Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).  

The Katheaw Cha is also very good.  

I ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!)

My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.  

I really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.

Prices are standard for a grocery, though I've found that their organic items tends to be a tad more pricey than other normal groceries. This Vons has a ""darker"" feel to it, though I think they were going for a natural-light feel.

As mentioned, this Vons location is very close to UNLV. I see students going here often. I usually go after class to pick up some groceries or whatnot. A few times I had went while carrying my backpack. I got some hassle today from an employee there about my backpack. It's just a small backpack, and I wasn't carrying a purse. :\

I noticed today that they had new products in their small gluten free section. I love that they have been rotating their stock, but I noticed that they don't have any Bakery on Main items anymore! That was one of the reasons I went to this Vons location (besides it being near UNLV). They had in the past always carried Bakery on Main's cranberry granola.

First the GOOD:

- Incredible consistent service. Never had a problem on multiple visits. Love that they use your first name. Easily 5 star on the service.... I feel like a VP every time.

- Nice dark calming atmosphere / decor. Great after a busy day at work. Ask to sit by the fireplace on a cold winter day. 

- If your there just for drinks, they provide complimentary kettle chips.

- Gnocchi is excellent... pasta heaven. Priced comparable to a good Italian restaurant at $18.

- I always get the beet salad when they have it. Lighter but packs a flavour punch. Pumpkin seeds on top are a welcomed addition ($18). The watermelon summer salad is also excellent. 

- If you just want a snack to share, go with the flat bread pizza's. 

- Interesting & unique cocktail selections (but please get more beers on tap).

- Beautiful washrooms

and the NOT so Good:

- Only two beers on tap (Mill str. Organic & Mad Tom IPA). They also have 7-8 in bottle.

- Beer is a little pricier compared to my other favourite hotel lounge - The Library Bar at the Royal York. Pints are $10 - $11. 


Highly recommend. The service and ambiance will always bring me back despite the limited beer selection.

What I like best about Jimmy John's is the bread. Growing up in Minnesota my favorite sandwich shop was a place called Erbert and Gerbert's and Jimmy John's bread is almost an exact match. In fact, their subs are a perfect hybrid of E&G and Cousins.

Beyond the tasty sandwich I thought the staff was incredibly friendly and the music was surprisingly bangin'. Might have been Taylor Dayne on the stereo, I can't quite recall.

Their salads are amazing, tacos (soft tempura shrimp tacos are my fav) are out of this world, and their burritos are HUGE!  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients and the flavors blend well.  The one thing that I will say is that one time, I got a beef burrito that contained a lot of fatty meat.

It was just a bunch of dried out meat with teriyaki sauce thrown on top and placed on rice. The rice could've used more sauce or something because it was dry along with the meat.

Quite a change from the old Irish digs, I like what Republic has done with the place. An inventive menu that has some bar food favorites but gourmet'ed up a bit. Crispy buffalo chicken bites, yessir. Perfectly seasoned calamari, yum. A fresh wedge salad on a cute little plate, yay. At happy hour you can have this and more for $4 measly dollars each. They do have drink specials of course but it's hard to steer away from the regular priced liquid joy. Thankfully they kept the Smithwick's around, so tasty. I really love the Chipotle Margarita, but beware, I ran into an ingredient shortage when I last visited which made the drink less than perfect. 

This is a great place for a big group happy hour, especially if you venture upstairs for board games galore. 7pm on a Friday night it was lively but not jammed.

If you've ever been to the T&T at Middlefield/Steeles and had the Korean food there, it's EXTREMELY similar to it. If someone were to put they're two foods in front of me I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

The younger sister to PF. Chang's.  It has more of a pan-asian variety of Thai/Chinese then just straight Chinese cuisine compared Chang's.  The food comes in large portions, nice and hot with plenty of fortune cookies and delicious teas available.

I almost ALWAYS get the pad thai with extra chicken and tofu.  Their cooked tofu is really very good, very flavorful and it actually KEEPS very well in the fridge for a day.

     The first time I ate here was with some friends/coworkers right after work around 8am.  There were four of us total.  Right away I noticed that parking can be an issue because you park in the back of the building and it seemed like there were less than 20 parking spots designated for My Friends so it seems that if they are busy you might not actually find a place to park.  Then there is the street for parking but I have NEVER felt safe parking on the street especially a busy street like Detroit Avenue.  It is actually a very nice and subtle environment to eat.  Breakfast was pleasant and decently priced because all of our breakfast choices were under $10 and that's including coffee for each of us.  My Friends was a nice experience for all of us and a few of us had leftovers to take home.  
     The second time I ate here was around dinner time and it was a much different experience.  The restaurant was not too crowded (just a 4 tables were being used) and I was meeting my cousin from Columbus who I haven't seen in about 4 years.  She LOVES this place and since I had eaten here before I thought it was a great place for us to meet during the holidays as we were both busy and might not be able to meet up again anytime soon.  Right away I felt rushed by our waitress because she literally only gave us 3 minutes to look over the menu and decide.  We needed more time because looking over the menu and pages of choices while talking/catching up was quite a task actually.  She gave us what seemed like another 3 minutes but I do wish I could have looked over the menu more but I was in the mood for a gyro and that looked appealing to me.  Our food was prepared within 10 minutes but seemed so much shorter since we were talking.  I asked the waitress at this point for a menu so I could decide on what to surprise my roommate with.  She came back with a menu then gave me about 3 minutes again (like she was timing it out purposely every time for 3 minutes) and asked if I was ready!?!  I didn't like that but to save time with being interrupted again I asked if they had a liver and onion dish, which they did, and I ordered that to go with clam chowder for a very reasonable $9.99 total.  Overall, the food was good. My gyro was $8.99 for a decent size but I've had larger gyros for cheaper elsewhere and there wasn't anything that made this one stand out so it is a little more expensive than other places but the beef liver and onions with a clam chowder soup for $9.99 was a good deal for my roommate and she really liked it!  
     If the server didn't rush my cousin and I so much I would have really enjoyed this place much more and rated it higher.  The sense of being rushed took away the feeling of a relaxing dinner with my cousin while we caught up with our lives and that took away from the evening.  
     I would eat here again as the food was decent and the environment is pleasant. Next time though I would be more forceful with the servers to give me time to look over the menu and enjoy it.",2016-12-26 06:07:20

Such a hidden location, and so quaint! But man, the food here is GOOD. 

DAY 1:

2 BIG mugs of Thai Iced Tea :)
i especially love the huge beer mug they serve it in.

Combo Appetizer
Love the chicken satay! Mmm... and the onions and cucumbers in the small bowl! Everything else was pretty good. A nice way to start.

Duck Fried Rice
duuuuude, seriously, this was the hook once I opened up that tri-fold menu! It was deeeelicious, and I could not stop raving about how big the pieces of duck were in it!

#S11
The name of the actual dish slips my mind, but my boyfriend and I ordered it medium-spicy thinking it was going to be okay, but IT WAS HOT but not so hot to mask the actual food! I am not used to spice, but I ate it as fast as I could, still enjoying the dish, so as not to torture my inexperienced taste buds.

DAY 2:

Just ONE big mug of Thai Iced Tea

Thai Style Noodle House Pot Stickers
You get 6 of them! They are deep fried and have 3 different sauces on them, something like a sweet mayo, then a teriyaki, and some sriracha all across the tops! Our waitress actually informed us it was the most popular appetizer ordered. Sold. It was a good mixture of sauces! Thought it would be too much, but it was great together.

Seafood Rad-Na with Wonton
Saw this cute little dish hand-drawn/written on a piece of paper on the wall near us! Couldn't resist. This dish was decent, but still enjoyed it!

Three Companions (Pork)
The pork is soft! It's marinated I believe, and the papaya salad and sticky rice it comes with were all good!

Then, a Thai Iced Tea to go.

Okay, so all in all, both days, both bills were under $35! The portions were large! The service is off the hook! And the environment is so friendly! The waitress with the glasses is wonderful! She remembered us from the previous day! The bathrooms are clean, both boys and girls, and we were always checked up on!

Yes, it was obvious that it was madly popular and this made for a crowded inside and outside of the restaurant. We added our name to the list and after  sizable wait saw a couple of two who had come in well after us be seated before us.  I questioned the hostess and she said she had looked for us but couldn't find us. We were standing in the restaurant the entire time and it is a very small place so I found that very hard to believe. She half apologized and said a table should be ready shortly. Upon getting to our table we were told that the only hot breakfast item they had on the menu (an egg dish) was sold out. How do you have only a few staple entree items on the menu and sell out of one of them?  I had the ricotta with honey which was served with toast. It was tasty but more of a side than a main and seemed like a lot of money for something comprised of a handful of ingredients and not even cooked. Our coffee was served without milk and our food was served without utensils.  With that said, the apple turnover was one of the best I have ever had.

This bar is located a little back from the road on Kennedy just South of 14th (in the same plaza as the Dairy Queen/Subway). It's actually in a historic building which is pretty unique for pubs in the area. So rather than the faux-aged look at many of the local pubs, Firkins, etc. you have a building that is authentically old complete with creaky stairs, tight spaces, old wood everywhere, and a great atmosphere.
The food and drink is nothing that out of the ordinary for a pub unfortunately. Other than the friendly, quick service I haven't found much to recommend in terms of this. The multicoloured nachos were pretty plain and standard: lacking in some toppings (cheese) and piled heavily with others (lettuce?). 
This place looks promising for those looking for an aged, worn feeling local pub hangout that's got a ton of character. The food is nothing spectacular, but the drinks are cold, the staff is friendly, and this king of place is pretty unique for the burbs.",2014-03-18 18:07:25

Five of my group of eight decided to go to Blush before heading over to Body English and since we arrived a few minutes after 9, we were the first ones there and didn't pay cover. Mixed drinks will run you about $11 and beers around $9 - standard Vegas pricing.

If you go early in the night, they let you sit at any of the tables which we took advantage of by sitting outside. The outside area is definitely my favorite part of Blush. We stayed at Blush for about an hour and twenty minutes before heading over to Body English and when we left, there were maybe twenty people in the whole venue. 

Again, not a place I would spend a whole night, but it's a great place to start a night out especially if you are over near the Wynn.",2009-06-17 16:53:52

Friendly ladies wearing the well-made stylish & fun fitness/ athleisure wear brand clothing, greeted us, & checked in on us several times, on our most recent visit (and let us know about some other items that might be of interest to me) (*I guess it is the most visible here*, the advertising/ showcasing, but I like it, because then you get to see it on other people, to compare- it's easier to see it person vs. on the website). We were at DT this past saturday; I had intended to use some of my b-day gift $ on something I really wanted (it has to be something I love). I visit the user-friendly site quite often and I am currently a VIP member (select your monthly outfit @ $49.95 or higher, by the 6th or you can opt to skip it). 

I had my eye on the sage coat (it doesn't feel heavy like a coat, it feels more like a cozy and warm sweater, an excellent layering piece, making it an essential, for me. I tried on the Small but it looked and felt a little big. I tried the X-Small and was pleasantly surprised. (I am slimmer on the bottom and bigger on the top; a reverse triangle, I usually wear a size Small in this brand, but usually, I am a Medium or size 8 in other brands.) It is comfortable. The color to be looks to be more of grey/brown, almost, but not quite a greige shade. I love the color grey and brown is my 2nd favorite neutral color to wear. Last weekend, everything was 30% off and if your purchase was over $99, you got a free pair of leggings (Great Promos). I'm glad that I got this piece on sale and was able to get the right size.  

The store is small to medium, but not all the styles you see on the website are available in the stores (I am on the website quite often, it's user-friendly, BTW). It is nice to try on some of the pieces, though if you are unsure about the brand's sizing. I also like the option of Short for the inseam, on the bottoms. The layout of the store is good, as everything is nicely hung up on the racks neatly, nothing is out of place, and the racks are not jam-packed (something I don't like). I didn't go to the dressing room as I just tried on a couple jackets and was able to use the mirror as directed by a clerk. There were other customers but it wasn't crowded or uncomfortable. Overall the store is clean and free of debris.

I love the fresh new styles and the fabrics that the brand uses is pretty comfortable. (For more details, I've reviewed the pieces on the site.) From jackets, pullovers, long-sleeves, tees, tanks, to shorts, dresses, capris, leggings, joggers, and sports bras, too, the brand has many offerings. Some styles are seamless. Other accessories are also sold by the brand. I think that this is the most affordable athleisure brand, as compared to Athleta (the same company owns Banana Republic/ Gap/ Old Navy), as you can get two pieces here for about the same price as a single pair of Athleta leggings.

Checkout was fast & easy. She asked me if I was a VIP member, so I gave her my email address and my card was slid through her hand scanner (or was it a phone?). Cute reusable tote bag too.",2017-12-22 20:44:02

You can tell they really have pride in ageing their meat to perfection.  Seating was quick and pleasant. Atmosphere was nice and quaint. We did not need reservations as it was a weekday on low season for Vegas. My husband and I enjoyed our meal and price was ok. You can't complain for the type of steaks your getting. If your not willing to fork out and spend then don't eat here. But if your looking for quality steak and cooked just to your liking, I highly recommend trying this place out.  I liked the fact that you can't smell the stinky smoke flowing into your area and dampening your dinner meal.  That was a plus because i'm so allergic to the smell of smoke which is what bothered me a lot through the casino floors.   I don't have anything negative to say about this restaurant other then that the service could have been a bit more attentive. I needed some water and had to look for a waiter several times before I got my water filled.

The menu isn't large, but manages to contain a wide variety of food. The is a clear bias towards Caribbean dishes, but simple North American standards are also on offer, including a solid brunch menu that is available anytime.

I had the oxtail and it was a good as other Yelpers have described - tender meat, great flavour, and a solid portion. I ate way more than I should have, but it was worth it. My wife had one of the brunch omelettes and was thoroughly impressed. Our dinner companions has a fish & chips special and meatloaf. Everyone raved about the food.

The staff are wonderful - friendly, chatty (if you're interested), and prompt.

The décor is decent for what they have to work with...it's a fairly small location a half-level below the street. It's very cozy and could quickly start feeling like home if you start going more often! While we were there the staff chatted by a regular they knew by name who enjoyed soup and a main while reading the paper.

Oh, and the prices are very reasonable. Mains are $12-$16 or so.

They don't have the liquor licence yet, but I assume they're working on it.

This place is a basically a freaking grocery store. It is enormous for a Drug Mart. Folks at my work talk about this place all the time and tell me how amazing it is but I never actually believe them. Today I didn't have anything for lunch so I thought I would swing by and see what I could pick up.

I would've taken more pictures but I was kind of in a hurry. The first picture I took was of Randy's Pickles.  This is a local company that is run by some guys I went to high school with. Their pickles are awesome and delicious and it's really neat when you can find them in stores. The selection of items they have in the store is amazing they have fresh fruit and vegetables, frozen section, a refrigerated section, a very large dairy section, they have a deli, they have a bakery, and then they have all the other kinds of things you can find at traditional Drug Mart. 

I did decide to share an old picture of a donut that I had once that came from there. Somebody from work had gotten a dozen donuts to share and they are freaking delicious! If you love good classic donuts and you're in the area this is a great place. The only reason I gave them four stars is because even though they had a bunch of things they didn't have what I was looking for initially and it's something that you can find any gas station so I was kind of annoyed.

Now I'm thinking root canal or implant (which I have had great success with). I had been a patient of Dr. Christiansen at Las Vegas Endodontics in the past so when I had the possible need for a root canal in this tooth (a lower molar) I decided to call his office to schedule an appointment. I learned that Dr. Christiansen had retired and his practice was now under Dr. Chad Hansen. I thought it prudent to check with my dentist as to who I should see before making an appointment. I was told that either Dr. Brizzee or Dr. Hansen would do a fine job. I decided to go with Dr. Hansen and made an appointment for the next day.  Dr. Hansen conducted a complete examination and used x-rays and sensitivity tests to explain my situation and recommend a root canal since the bone structure around the tooth was solid and there was no evidence of a root fracture (dental speak for you don't need an implant). He did a wonderful job! It's now 48 hours post root canal and I am completely pain free. The two roots actually had 4 nerve tunnels so I was really happy that I chose to see an Endodontist and I could not be happier than I am with Dr. Hansen.

Over the past year my opinion of the place has often gone back and forth between ""they're ok"" and ""ugh, never again"". At this point, though, I think I can honestly say after multiple visits and take-out orders that while I enjoy the food here well enough, I just don't love actually eating at Katana itself.

Here are my pros when it comes to Katana - 

*During one meal here with my family, our hibachi grill chef provided us with a fantastic meal overall, and the cook even accommodated a special request that they said they'd never been asked about before. I give credit where credit is due - this was a huge plus.

*Certain sushi selections here are certainly a little less pricey than some other places, so depending on what you order you do get more food for what you're paying then you would elsewhere.

*Many of the rolls I've eaten here have indeed been very tasty and enjoyable, especially their eel ones.

*When I've ordered take-out I've never had a major problem with my food, and the delivery has often been 20 to 30 minutes ahead of the estimated time. They're fast, that's for sure!

However, I must also admit I've also run into many downsides during my experiences with Katana. My in-house dining experiences in particular have been less than stellar:

-During one visit, my dinner companion commented that his red bean ice cream tasted like vanilla ice cream, and that he was not impressed by the crab rangoon (note that I personally thought they were okay - not great, but okay). This same night, our waiter forgot to bring us our appetizers (another one did this for them) and also forgot to subtract our Groupon amount from our check; we were fortunate enough that a manager came by to correct this, because otherwise we would have demanded a new receipt with the correction made before even handing the waiter our credit card. 

-During a different visit, our hibachi chef spent the whole of the meal trying to make my dinner party laugh at horrible jokes that I don't think anyone over a certain age would find particularly entertaining, forcing us to listen to him rather than letting us engage in other conversation. At one point he also began banging his cooking utensils on the grill far more harshly than normal. I still don't know what he was trying to do. Impress us? Scare us? Either way, it was uncalled for; I left the restaurant with a huge headache and sour attitude after that experience.

-In addition to these issues with servers and comments from friends about the food, I've also had a few issues with my orders. Once an order of dumplings had both some cold and some hot dumplings mixed into the plate, as they had not been consistently heated to a specific temperature. In general I've found their appetizers to taste pretty ""meh"" and I admit that I don't particularly like their salads, which are very small and not always as tasty as what I'd find at other sushi restaurants. 

It's hard for me to come up with a final verdict. I do think that when Katana gets it right, they really get it right; the problem is that you have to deal with a few 'meh' items along the way (i.e. tasteless ice cream and not-high-quality eggrolls) and choose carefully from a menu where for every reasonably priced and portioned item, there's another dish that's overpriced and tiny. And given that I've never really had a smooth in-house dining experience here, I personally think I'll be sticking to my favorite items on their delivery menu at this point.

All in all, for their food alone I do think Katana deserved 3 stars. (For my in-house experiences, I'd probably give them a 2-star rating.)",2013-01-06 14:44:17

I've heard many great things about this restaurant, and after reading other Yelp reviews I decided what better time to try this place out than my birthday? And what better way than sitting at the bar, and partaking of some artistically created adult beverages?

For starters this place is located smack in the middle of the Crystals Mall, you can't miss it. It's the big wooden orb shaped thing that seams to be floating in the center of all the action. It's pretty neat, but as other reviews mentioned, I'm not sure I'd want to spend $200+ on a dinner with a mall atmosphere. None the less it's quite a unique experience and they did a great job (at least in the bar area) of making sure their music drowned out most of the mall sounds.

I knew the drinks here would be pricey so I was prepared for it, but for others it may be a shocker. They have an extensive list of specialty drinks starting at $16, but most are $18. I was told their in-house specialty was a lemon drop which came over dry ice, I didn't actually try it though. I did try the Chocolate Martini ($18)- which won me over because of the giant chocolate covered strawberry on the side of the glass. It truly was dessert in a martini glass! Other views were correct, when you order a martini they give you the shaker along with your drink so you can refill your glass, it's almost like 2 drinks in 1. I also tried the Banana Foster ($18), it was delicious but not what I expected. It has whipped cream, I expected it on top but it was shaken inside and gave the drink a bit of a lumpy texture.

The bf tried the Mastro's Mojito (also $18) and it honestly was not very good, it  came served in a tall glass so there was no shaker on the side. I wouldn't recommend ordering this one. His mom tried the Dragon Fire ($18), which as very tasty, but yes it was hot/spicy - not something to quench your thirst. She rounded off her evening with the Flur de Blu ($18), one I was considering as well. She liked it, but after I tried it I was glad I went with the dessert-style drinks instead.

The service was good. The bar wasn't busy so we had as much attention as we wanted. We were able to watch them make our drinks and that was a fun part of the experience. We saw all kinds of great food coming out of the kitchen so we asked for a food menu, we elected not to order anything since we'd already been there a while and run up a tab of $100. However one bar tender offered to bring us a bread basket. The bread was great and the basket came with several different types of bread, and super soft butter. Note to self for next time: ask for the bread basket when you arrive, it's free.

I think I'll drop in some time again, when I'm in the mood for a dessert martini and can afford the $18 drinks.",2014-01-04 18:29:06

Im more mad at myself because I should have known yet I still ate it. I'm never coming here again and I'll explain why. So last Thursday I came for dinner at 6:30 because I was going to watch Star Wars at the theater next door at 7:30. This place had good reviews so I stopped in and it was beautiful! The decor was nice and authentic the staff was friendly and the chefs even said hello. We were seated in a booth and ordered the teriyaki chicken and beef teriyaki. The presentation was beautiful I mean down to the placement. Our entrees came with a green salad and a soup. The salad dressing was amazing but they drenched my salad in it! Literally I finished all my salad and still had a large amount of dressing leftover in the bowl. The miso soup had great flavor but it had a weird little after taste to it. Now let's talk about what made me sick. My chicken teriyaki was THE MOST bland, cold, rubbery, tasted reheated, piece of chicken I have ever eaten. It had grill marks on it but I could tell it was NOT fresh. Imagine a piece of chicken that you grilled then kept in the fridge for a day then microwaved in a few days and left out for a bit. That's what this tasted like. I wish I was making this up. It didn't have any flavor no salt no seasoning absolutely nothing. I drenched it in teriyaki sauce to eat it. While I ate it I felt forced to take bites just to get something in my stomach but I stopped after a while. Why did I eat it and not send it back? 1. It was my first meal of the day and I was starving. 2. I was in a time crunch and didn't want to send it back because it would make me late for the movie. 3. I needed to eat in order to survive a 3 hr movie and didn't want to get food at the theater. I had someone else taste my chicken and they said it was the worst piece of chicken they ever had. Later that night at the movies I started to feel sick. When I got home I felt worse. I don't want to share what kind of sick I got because it's TMI but you can imagine. This place ruined chicken so bad for me I don't think I can ever eat another chicken teriyaki plate without gagging. Also the other person I was with said their beef was cold and tasteless while they were eating it. I don't know what went wrong, maybe they were in a hurry and didn't feel the need to make a fresh piece of chicken but that's something I would expect at McDonald's and not a restaurant like this.",2017-12-19 05:35:44

I never got the guy's name who helped us out, but he was very friendly and accommodating.  There were 5 beers on-tap, I told him what beers I liked, and he offered to crack open a can that wasn't on-tap.

The flight helped my friends and I determine what beers we wanted to buy.  Too bad Swamp Juice wasn't available in a can, but only a $15 growler - actually $10, after the $5 bottle deposit.  

My only criticism is that I wished that there was more seating.  There was a group (people who worked there or friends of people who worked there), already seated at the long table, and there wasn't enough seating for 3 additional people.  There were a couple of small, higher tables, but no chairs.  So I hope that this will change in the future.

I found this place by accident when I was filling up my gas tank and crying over the bill, especially since I have to get premium gas. OUCH!  As I was wiping the tears out of my eyes, I saw a beacon of hope just across the parking lot!  Was I really seeing a snowball joint just 25 feet away?!?! I rubbed my eyes and opened them again and it was still there, with a golden halo surrounding it and angels singing Hallelujah in the background!  No joke, it was a totally, magical moment for me!

Anyway, to my review....Polar Snow is a little travel trailer parked in the Chervon parking lot.  You might not see it from the street, but it is there!  They had about 30 flavors available on the day I was there.  They ranged from your regular flavors like banana, cherry, fruit punch to more exotic ones like Tiger's Blood, as well as special flavors the owners have created.  Definitely a flavor or 2 for anyone who pops by.  The also offer several sizes for really cheap!  The smallest was $2 and the largest was $5.  There were also add in options of sweet cream or ice cream for $.50.  Extra yummy goodness right there!

They also had something called the Polar Soda.  It is like an Italian Soda but even better!  I tried it with half vanilla half strawberry and I was in love!  I think what makes it so special is all of the sweet cream they add to the drink.  It was just awesome and I totally recommend it!  As for the snowball, I went with my all time favorite which is the Orange Dreamsicle.  That thing of beauty is an orange snowball covered in sweet cream.  You then mix it all up and you have a spoonful of heaven.  Awww, pure bliss!

 First tip- research what you are getting into. I'm an adventurous eater, but I don't like breaking protocol so I looked up some videos about eating Ethiopian food and was really warmed by the concept of family truly sharing a meal. Long story short- you eat with your hands, rolling bits of food into pieces you tear off a giant sourdough pancake- injera. And apparently it's totally ok to enthusiastically shove food down your loved ones throats and they have to be ok with it, or you can act hurt for the rest of the evening. 

 So the way it goes is, your food will arrive on a platter. If you order multiple things, they will still arrive on the same plate, so don't go in there saying- Bobby will have chicken and Ruby Sue will have ground beef tar tar. Coordinate. Act as a considerate, caring unit. Agree on a few things everyone wants to eat, and order. You'll be cooperatively eating it off the same plate with your hands anyway. 
 The flavors, in my opinion, have universal appeal. Nothing super weird or terribly spicy,  something for everyone, and they will gladly cook your food the way you like. We always get vegetable platter (spinach is the best) and either fish or beef.
 The portions are enormous. I've been there twice and both times ended up with giant to go containers at the end. Prices are also incredibly reasonable. 
 Liquor left some to be desired. Beer choices are ""light or dark"", all bottles. Mercifully, they have Ethiopian beer, so at least you don't feel like you are better off in the liquor aisle at your local grocery store. I like different! 
 There are some quirks. At the end of the day, it's an ethnic cuisine experience with much of clientele being Ethiopian patrons. Some people said incense smell was strong- I didn't even notice it. My family griped about bathroom cleanliness and the fact that they had no wet napkins provided at the beginning of the meal. Yes, that's a miss. I told them to lick themselves clean. 
 The decor is very casual eatery like, which is fine by me, but don't expect plush couches, silk curtains and belly dancers. It's a family place. Speaking of family, I visited again, this  time with my 11 year olds. Because I like showing them different cultures, and I thought they'd get a kick out of eating with their hands. It went well, my son actually enjoyed it more than my daughter, who's a fussier eater.

 There's also an elaborate coffee ceremony, according so some accounts, but I chose beer ceremony instead. 

 Altogether, a fun experience worth checking out. The world doesn't run on ""build your own pizza"" alone.",2015-09-03 17:44:23

He has been searching EVERYWHERE for a correctly cooked over easy egg - outside of MY kitchen of course ;)   It seemed charming, interesting and the menu was promising.  

The food was just so-so, all of it.  Mostly because it was lukewarm and had a few no-no's.  The benedict was good except for the squishy English muffins that didn't seem toasted.  The hash browns were mushy and cold on both plates.  The strawberry waffle was also cold and had one brown strawberry.  My husband ordered over easy eggs which had raw egg white.  However the eggs were replaced at his request with a better set.  The coffee was really good and the service was as well.  I think the locals love this place, we barely beat the rush...

The food came out quickly, which may have been the problem.  It wasn't more than 5 minutes since we had ordered, and clearly wasn't enough time to cook it fresh or even keep it hot.  

The worst part about all of it was that with some really easy and quick remedies this could have been an amazing breakfast, worth the price we paid.  A toasted muffin, a few more seconds on the heat, a berry tossed into the trash - voila, Saturday morning magic instead of Saturday morning tragic...

Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?

Today wasn't a great day for me w/ regards to Mr. Johnston's two restaurants (see my ""recent"" Coffee Shop review).  I hope my next visit to a Johnston concept yields a happier adventure!",2010-10-23 08:55:02

I also tried the mango roll and the crispy roll.  Both were pretty good, but I prefer my rolls to be bite-sized and these were both gigantic.  I was once told you should eat sushi in one bite, and I managed, but it was a challenge.  Also, the rice in the rolls was a little dry.

So, having been to Japan and back, I can't say this is the best sushi I've ever tasted, but I also wasn't expecting it to be.  What Sushi On Bloor does deliver is excellent value.

""It's all in the sauce."" I don't get it. Are you telling me if someone put ketchup on the best crust in the world it would be the best pizza? Bullfeathers. 

I digress. Around these Yelp parts, Rocco's is touted as being some of the best NY Style pizza in Las Vegas. NY Styles means thin, large slices that tend to collapse in your hands. I have not been eating too much pizza of late, but we were over at Best Buy getting some new pans (not sure who's going to use them!), so I decided to pop in for a slice.

A large part of the charm here is the atmosphere, as you definitely feel as if you have walked into a Bronx pizza joint. Shelves are crowded with pasta and candy; there is a fridge with Italian ice, coconut gelato and Rocco's marinara sauce to go. The lady behind the counter delivers big smiles and charm with a big accent. It all works together to create the ideal environment for scarfing down a slice. We probably came a little late in the day for the freshest slices. By 4pm the premade pizzas looked a little disappointing, but whaddya expect?

Mondays they have a pizza special: large cheese for $10. Good deal, but we weren't ready to commit to a whole pie. I ordered one slice of the vegetarian. The crust was a nice balance of crispy and chewy, and the sauce had a nice sweetness. I must say, however, that for me, a pizza is all about the toppings. Ha! No, that is not my pizza quip. Seriously, I was a little disappointed in the toppings. They were sparse. I like piles of things on my slice. Yes, I am a glutton who is willing to use a fork. Have you seen my cow picture?

Anyways, that is just one little complaint. Overall, Rocco's has a delicious combination of atmosphere, crust and sauce. Way, way, way better than ketchup on a brilliant crust!",2010-03-30 16:07:46

Started with an amazing Caesar, just the right amount of booze and spice.  Had the beans and greens salad to start, nothing too groundbreaking, but a nice basic fresh green salad.

The gentleman who seated my fiance and I was prompt and attentive (for the first part of our visit).  I could not make up my mind so I asked the server for a recommendation.  He suggested the #1.  

It was a variety of meats in a wonderfully flavored beef broth that was very well seasoned.  After a few bites, I bit down on something rather unpleasant...I believe it was tripe.  I would have never thought that tripe was an ingredient (otherwise I would have specified it be omitted).  I quickly take my spoon and fish for as much of the stuff as I can find in my bowl...ick.  I LOVE most foods, but just the thought disgusts me.  Overall, I expect to come back again and attempt this PHO thing once more.  Perhaps make an educated order rather than relying on the gentleman to choose for me.

As for the restaurant, it is in Le Le's market...and once the burn of fish odor cools in your nose, its smooth sailing.

The biggest change is to the rooms.  Most of the furniture was purchased at auction from the Fontainbleau....even the room safes, and bathroom fixtures are from the Fontainbleau!  The only downsides to my room were a slightly noisy AC unit, and a shower/tub area that was not well lit.
My room was in the south tower, and I had fast elevator service every time.  The elevator lobby areas are nicely renovated also.
The renovation funds must have run out before anything could have been done to the pool area, and the parking deck.  The parking deck, with the nastiest elevators you can imagine, is the least pleasant part of The Plaza.  The pool area, with 1970's astroturf used in an effort to soften the look, is rather depressing.

My friend and I got hungry so we searched for places on the yelp app. Found this one and decided to check it out. I read a couple reviews before coming and was determined to get the corned beef and cabbage (since it was at paddys day). The person that wrote the review said the cabbage was not overly soggy like most other places so I was hoping for that but was disappointed when my meal came out. Not only was the cabbage soggy, but so were the carrots and potatoes! I wasn't happy about this. They also had a $3 Irish car bomb or $3 pint of Guinness special going on the day so I ordered a Guinness. I was surprised when it came out... In a can, with a glass. Guinness is a pretty popular drink! Why do they not have this on tap? Would have been so much better but it was only $3. No big deal.

After finishing the meal and our drinks, I felt this place deserved around a 4-5 star rating. My view totally changed after getting the check. I handed our waitress my CC and she took off to close out the transaction. We kept waiting and waiting for her to come back. She was busy tending to a couple other tables around the restaurant so I figured we should keep waiting. 20 minutes went by and I still have yet to see my card or receipt come back so I could sign. We finally got their attention and as it turns out... They forgot!!!! How incredibly annoying. It wasn't even busy as there were only two other tables in the dining area.

On the Caliente, it only comes with one patty so I felt like I was eating a chili sandwich with onions and peppers. They do have really good buns though so that's a plus. 

Maybe my mistake was not getting a double or maybe even a triple burger. It may sound like a lot but the patties are so thin and I just couldn't taste the meat at all.

I ordered the special for the week of cured wild Alaskan Coho salmon with wasabi creme fraiche, salmon roe, micro greens, and naan bread, as well as an Alaska roll in case I want a huge fan of the entree choice. I was a big fan of both, although I could have done with a little less creme fraiche on the salmon, but that's just a taste preference. Being a big fan of presentation, I was also very impressed by how quickly the dishes were coming out, looking very elegant and colorful.

We were looking for something local and unique that was good for lunch, Dublin O'Neil's fit this bill.

There was only a few people in the place around 2pm on MLK day.

The inside is very nice. Dark, pub-style furniture in a somewhat small, but well-decorated room.

No drinks for us this visit, but the drink menu is extensive and has some unique offerings that I will definitely be back to try.

We started with the Irish nachos which were okay, but in my opinion could have used more of the toppings and less of the chips. Still, the made in-house chips were tasty. 

We were disappointed to hear they were out of several key items.

I got the wild boar fennel sausage sandwich and my mother got the reuben. Both sandwiches were very unique. My boar sausage was flavorful and mixed well with the onion and sauce on it. The herb French fries that I got with it were delicious too. My mom really enjoyed her reuben. It was different in that it did not have sauerkraut but rather a pickled pink cabbage instead, which she thought was an interesting take on a traditional sandwich.

Both sandwiches were expensive and perhaps a little skimpy on the portion for being close to $15/plate. I feel that the uniqueness and food quality of the dishes overshadows the portion size and price though.

Well your wrong. Asian Buffet only servers Chinese with a little bit of Japanese.


My experience dropped from a 5 star to a 2.5/3 stars because of two main reasons: all of their food contains MSG even if they have a sign that says ""no MSG"" it still contains it, even their ice cream and dessert contains MSG. How I figured everything contained MSG was that I had to take a sip of water for every bite I took.
Second point was that when I went to their grill and asked for the beef to be cooked well done half way through my dish I found out it was all rare, cooked on the outside but bloody and red on the inside ...like are you trying to kill me and give me salmonella? I specifically asked for well done but I ended up getting raw food. Yeah I know they have a sign that says you'll be charged for leftover food but I'm not paying a penny if I was served raw food in a restaurant that isn't 100% Japanese cuisine, your chefs/cooks aren't properly trained to serve raw food.

My girlfriend forgot her black TNA jacket and when we went back to grab it, they said that there wasn't a black jacket that was left at our table. Wow really? It's one thing to have mediocre food but to be lied to in front of our face that there wasn't a jacket that was left behind was way beyond our expectations. 

Shady.

If you want to try cheap food with MSG all around and a chance of getting raw food then feel free to go to Asian Buffet but make sure you don't leave anything behind or else you won't get it back. 

Overall it looks like we're not coming back and we will not recommend this restaurant since there are other competitors that will serve you cook food and have the money worth, and of course won't be covered in MSG",2016-06-26 15:10:14

I have got a ton of pizza spots bookmarked and rarely get to them. Mainly because I've really got to be in the mood for it and that doesn't happen often. Pop Up was one of those times that being in the mood for pizza was a good thing!

Pop Up is located in the Plaza Hotel just to the right when you exit from the parking garage elevators. It's a fairly small spot but not hard to see at all. All the pizzas are pre-made and displayed at the front for re-heating, unless requested otherwise. 

I went with a slice of The White Chapel and a slice of The Harris Meatball Pie. Even after being reheated, the crust here is fanfriggintastic. If you want to fold it, go ahead...but you're not forced to do so to avoid a sloppy mess all over your hands. In my opinion, it was the perfect texture/consistency, whatever you want to call it, for a pizza crust. The toppings are great too and they aren't skimpy with them either! I'm assuming some of these pizzas may sit here a while sometimes but all the toppings were fresh and full of flavor. Plus, how can you complain about a pizza that's described as being topped with ""dollops"" of ricotta?! I know I can't.

If you're in the Plaza for whatever reason, this is definitely worth the stop! The prices are great too...for 3 slices of pizza, 3 drinks and some garlic knots, we only spent about $18. Pop Up Pizza, you will be seeing me again!",2014-01-25 05:10:08

I had a solid meal here. What I like most is that they have entree+tofu soup combo! And you can choose whatever tofu soup they have! For an Asian, it starts to feel like meal when there's a main dish, some small cold dishes and a soup! Many other places don't have these options. If you want both then get both with full price. But here a small sized soup really makes a difference. 

Even though it's a smaller size soup, the materials were solid. It doesn't feel like a cheap add-on side, but really a smaller version of the real thing. I had seafood tofu soup with egg, mussel, clams and a real size shrimp, not like some other Korean restaurant nowadays that use small shrimpies and substitute mussel with small clams even in a full price soup. The flavors are pretty good. I can't say it's the best or it's outstanding, but the attitude here is better than many. 

I will come back and would recommend it to my friends.",2015-02-08 05:26:13

The avocado toast also had kale, onions and zucchini on top along with two peached eggs and hollandaise sauce! It came with hashbrowns as well so it was a great meal!

At the recommendation of another Yelper, I ordered a pork taco, which was delicious. I also had a cheese enchilada and, coupled with their very hot and fresh chips, tasty salsa and bean dip, my meal was complete.

The food arrives quickly, which is important if you are on a tight schedule or have a tight boss who will flip if you take a 61 minute lunch.

D1yj8_lFGCTnZwsV9t6SVw,DMHPVjHKaUStUBMPH2TjNA,KTOwBIPPIjTckBc4654B6A,1,17,9,6,"So...I work in the club industry as a General Manager of another Scottsdale spot I have been in the Bar, Club and Entertainment scene for 18 years. I would expect more from the management at this place....to say the least the Manager Jeff at this place pretty much needs to take a step back in time and remember that we are in the hospitality industry. 

So for the most part I have heard good things about this place that it was the new hot spot up north. Bigger then Spanish Fly and set up right. 

Well this Sunday me and some friends decided we would check it out and decided we would get a cabana there now granted it was not under my name but it was me and my friends plan to go there and who ever got there first was going to get it.

My friends got there first. So I show up alone in casual dress some basketball shorts and a golf shirt and some nikes...on my way in I get stopped at the door, the bouncer explains to me I can not wear basketball shorts, I explained that me and my friends were getting a Cabana by the pool they were already inside and that I had no plan on hitting the pool with basketball shorts. I mean this is a Cantina Patio Bar & Restaurant right??? 

He still says he can't let me in. So then I pull the industry card, and explain that I am the G.M. of a club in Old Town Scottsdale and even though we have a dress code exceptions can be made usually for celebrities or for VIP's.

 I would consider myself a VIP...since I work the scene I don't go out much but when I do I usually spend money...case in point last tab at El Hefe $200. The Mint $450. So it's not like I am a one or two drink type of customer I will usually buy a bottle or two.  I had already explained that I had a Cabana with friends waiting inside so one would assume that I am there to spend money.

So the bouncer says let me call the Manager Jeff. Who comes up and says pretty much the same thing and that if he were to make an exception for me someone would surely complain and it would not be fair and pretty soon everyone would be coming in out of dress code.
Hello... It's a POOL BAR...dress code...really I can go shirtless...but my shorts are a problem...really??! 

Good thing I wasn't hungry...I am assuming you must need to wear a suit jacket to sit down in the restaurant.

So to make a long story short, I went over to Kierland spent $75 on shorts at Tommy Bahama and went back and got let in.

I went in to check it out and meet my friends. Service sucked...had three different people walk by me at the bar when I first walked in before some nice girl finally saw that I had been waiting at least 10 minutes for a drink.  $8 for a Margarita in a 10oz plastic cup....really $8! Ridiculous!!! 

Then I made my way over to the Cabana my friends were at.  To say the least they explained the Cabana was $300 bucks which seemed descent but after they heard what happened to me. They pretty much all said f*** this place and we packed up all our stuff and left. They had already spent about $160. We probably would have popped some bottles, I know I had planned on that before I got there. And we would of made a go of the place but the manager Jeff dropped the ball on this experience.

This is the hospitality industry buddy!!! To say the least I can guarantee you I will not be back to this location... in fact I would like to say I am boycotting all Old Town Group businesses but unfortunately I love sushi at Stingray Biltmore to much to do this.

The restaurant's facade is cool, it is elegant and refined, yet laid back and calls to mind the island feel of the Caribbean.

We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were invited graciously to sit at the bar.  We promptly obtained drinks from the bartender, and were ushered to our table without issue.  However, our server seemed displeased that we had ordered drinks from the bar thus lessening his sale for our table.  We ordered two of the Tiger shrimp tamales which arrived at an unsettlingly fast pace.  Any hesitation by the ""fast-food"" speed with which they appeared was soon dashed by the overwhelming deliciousness that sprang forth from the plates.  Having eaten at many superb restaurants I feel compelled to say that these are some of the best starters I have yet to experience.

After the table was cleared I sat in anticipation for the main courses to arrive.  Our table had ordered two of the Coffee Rubbed Filets, one of the Black Angus Strips and one Chipotle Glazed Ribeye as well as an order of collard greens, mashed potatoes and, upon recommendation of the server, an order of Brussel sprouts.  My steak arrived and I noted how truly pleasing it was to the eye; however, I was disheartened that such an exquisite piece of meat seemed over powered by the bountiful amount of sauce on the plate.  Once I had cut into my steak and taken a bite I was instantaneously reminded that this was Chef Bobby Flay's house and his cooking was inextricably linked to him.  The protein on my plate was classic and refined and delicious, yet it had been arrogantly and flamboyantly altered to meet the needs of a Chef's personality.  The two sauces on the plate competed with the beef and reminded me of an episode of ""Throwdown"" except no one won, and my palate was an innocent bystander.

I looked for solace in the sides on the table and it was then I noticed that the recommended sprouts were missing.  After some time, we got the server's attention and asked him to forget the sprouts since we probably wouldn't need them or have room for them at this point.  He blatantly disregarded this request and demanded that we try them, because to do so would somehow be a personal affront to him.  We yielded.  When the sprouts arrived they were undercooked and over-seasoned to the point of sheer carelessness.  We each sampled one for the humor of it but left them on the table as a comedic reminder of how far off this meal had gone.

Was that dill I tasted in the sauce?  Mmmmm, it's good.  Piping hot, moist, tender, and I cannot believe I almost ate the whole thing.

Mind you I haven't tasted their full menu only breakfast. I also haven't sampled the waffles and so can not add any more insight as to what has seemed to catch the ire of a few Yelpers. 

I had the Eggs Benny and an Americano. Food arrived promptly which consisted of two eggs Benny-style and a small side of appleslaw salad. It was good, good enough that I easily cleaned my plate within minutes. Eggs were poached perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was delicious and fresh and it all laid nicely upon their own baked version of an English muffin which was quite complementary. The appleslaw salad was also quite tasty though minuscule. For quality and taste of the food I was quite happy with what I got. However, at $9.00 I did feel there should have been a bit more. [Please read update bottom of page] I think there should have been potatoes included as commonly found in the Eggs Benny you get at any other establishment. I mean I can dig a restaurant not wanting to serve Eggs Benny with the sides everyone else serves them with, y'know...Out of a sense of being original. But the side appleslaw was so small it was barely a thought on the plate. So that's $9.00 for essentially two straight up Eggs Benny. For me that's pricey. Aside from the food the Americano I ordered tasted pretty good. Quite strong without being bitter. 

Service was good and friendly so absolutely no issues there. As for decor the place was comfortable enough. For the most part I was happy with the food and my coffee. I enjoyed what I ate and drank. I will return to try out their other menu items.

*Update*
I have just been informed that Goed Eten has upon recommendation decided to add fries to their Eggs Benny, which is great to hear and should make the $9.00 price tag more acceptable.",2010-12-17 01:08:35

As a side note if you sign up the for their phone number reward program if you buy 12 teas you get one free! And I know for certain I will be getting a few free teas....

Their tea menu is now hanging up in my cubicle. I have been checking off the tea that I like and making comments on why and the ones that I hate I have also written the same. Is that crazy?? (Don't answer that.)

I love a few things. 

1.) They currently do not have a minimum amount to use a credit card. A lot of the other places (hint: Chik n Bubbly) have a $5.00 minimum and quite frankly you have to get the larger side and double the bubble sometimes in order to achieve that. The fact that I can slide my card for a $3.00 order is great. I do not carry cash on me all the time so this allows me to get my drink on while getting the size and drink I want. 

2.) You can get your first order of toppings, FOR FREE. Yes ladies and gentleman your first topping order is free. SERIOUSLY. Other places it is .50 per topping. I mean their toppings are pretty straight forward. They have jelly, popping boba, and of course tapioca. I will say that if you go right when they open they might not have the tapioca ready (happened once). They said that it usually takes an hour and a half to make so they had like 10 minutes more and I couldn't wait.  The tapioca were a bit sweet. The sweetness was a bit different from other places that I've had. I would say that if you, like me, do not like super syrupy sweet get the no sweet or the lightly sweetened for your tea. 

3.) Their menu. Their menu is seriously awesome. The hot/cold choices are incredibly varied compared to the other places around Pittsburgh. Their hot tea menu is just really really varied. I cannot wait for a cold Pittsburgh day and for me to order a nice hot cup of tea. 

I love this place. They have snacks to munch on and a nice table to sit at if you want to enjoy your tea there. I love the open windows and the light that makes the room so bright. 

I look forward to my continued checklist of tea tasting. 

So far:

1. Traditional Green Tea: Delish  (I keep on getting these...I really should try different things....But they are so good)
2. Plum Iced Tea: Gross
3. Iced Matcha Latte: Eh  

Toppings:
1. Lychee Jelly- Good but kinda weird. Sweet.
2. Tapioca - Great, but sweet.",2015-11-09 20:00:01

The food was delicious and quite large. To start, we ordered the crab rangoon and fresh spring rolls. The crab rangoons were huge! We thought we would get portion sizes closer to other restaurants we've eaten at (sort of ""can eat in one bite"" sizes). Which made us concerned for all the other food we ordered, especially after the Kang Gai came out. We ordered a serving size for 4 people, because there were 4 in our group. It could have served like 10 people. That is not a shallow hot pot type thing it comes on! Because the spring rolls, crab rangoons, and Kang Gai filled is up, we decided to take the rest of our food to go. I can't remember what my husband and one of our friends ordered, but I did sample our friend's dish and that was just yummy. Our other friend and I ordered Kang Phet with tofu and between the choice of rice or somen noodles, we chose somen noodles. Honestly, the rice would have been a better choice. But we took the somen noodles home and ate it with the rest of the Kang Gai soup.

Drinks: By far thee best latte I've ever had. I used to get my lattes at Starbucks but they always make it so milky that I can hardly taste the espresso so I always resorted to an Americano. In Leone, however, their lattes have the perfect amount of milk that it doesn't drown out the espresso at all. Also, they have a wide variety of hot & cold drinks, including a Nutella cappuccino.

Meat was good but overall for the price I would not ever have it again. I also had the yellowtail appetizer and it was cut too thick and again, was too chewy.

While waiting, I (along with some others) observed a hostess or other female employee inside look out the window of the door, throw her hands up and exclaim, ""Why is there a line outside!  We don't serve breakfast!""  So that wasn't cool.  I almost turned around, got in my car and went somewhere else.  Having people waiting to come in to your restaurant is a good thing, right?  So despite that negative impression, I waited until they opened their doors at exactly 11:00 and ordered a wrap to go.  Took some time, as expected, but the sandwich/wrap itself wasn't bad.

Nothing better than a good old American burger. I've been to quite a few places throughout Canada and the US but I come back to Five Guys when I want to have a decent burger.

There are better burgers from fancy restaurants but I have to admit that Five Guys is the king of the chain restaurants. We have Hero's, South Street, and the standard chains but overall this is my fav.
Get the burger ""All the Way or the Works"" and you won't be disappointed. If you are want fries, get them cajun and don't over order, a medium is extra-large, large is a feast. Since this is American, don't expect gravy or a poutine - nor onion rings! Just a good burger at a fair price.

I came here for restaurant week and whoever prepared the food clearly wasn't Jennifer.

The best dish of the six we tried was the soup and sammich appetizer. The soup had little taste and seemed like half and half with pureed squash that was decorated nicely. The sandwich was tasty Grilled Brioche Bread that was stuffed with quality cheese, local honey and fresh pears. My husband had Arborio Rice that was still hard and not very creamy or tasty it was very flat and dry.

My second Course was Patagonia Salmon over a  Sunchoke Puree  that was getting broken up by a big puddle of oil. The Fish was topped with not so tasty combination of raw tomatoes, and brown chunks of garlic and some fresh basil. The Fish was edible.   My husband's Fresh Pasta Dish seemed like boxed spaghetti  instead of fresh pasta that was prepared mushy and seemed sort of watery.

At this point we were checked on and my husband informed the waiter about Hard Arborio Rice and Mushy Pasta. The waiter seemed sorry about that and walked away.

I was hoping that desserts would be redeeming but for me they were the worst part of the meal.

My favorite dessert is Lemon Meringue Pie so I was hoping the Mason Jar Lemon Meringue would be delicious. The Meringue wasn't Meringue but tasted like that gooey jarred Marshmallow Stuff called ""Fluff"" It was terrible to me. Nobody goes out for dinner and expects to receive  jarred ""Fluff"".My husband was hoping for an apple Tarte Tatin. You can tell by the photo he didn't receive a Tarte Tatin. I didn't taste his dessert because I was too grossed out by the Marshmallow Fluff I just had but he said the dough was really weird. 

Maybe this is a really good sandwich place and not a dinner place? Maybe i hit this place on an off night and it's a possibility you might get a better prepared meal. I don't know.

This was more disappointing to me than the not so fresh sushi I had last week somewhere.

Intermission:  A POPOVER, OMG this is the HIGHLIGHT - Gruyere cheese popover with butter and sea salt, I could eat 15 of these and trust me I took home the recipe they give.

Entree:  Red Snapper and Pork Chops.  I do think the pork chops stole the show, with a nice piece of foi gras on each slice with a decadent sauce.  The red snapper was light and very well cooked.  In fact there are some serious knife skills going on in that kitchen.

Desert:  Best in the valley!!!!  Theme seems to be dessert with a flavored ice cream.  I opted for 2, the cheesecake with ginger ice cream and apple tart with pumpkin ice cream.

Solemner:  This is the first place on the west coat I have see carry Billie-Cart Salmon Rose.  The distributor quit giving to places like total wine and restaurants,  I am not even sure how she got this bottle.  We drank it with great pleasure.

Service:  Perfect, I think they have a great rhythm and they do a main waiter and back waiter.  Timing was perfection and on point

Huge sushi bar with flashy sushi chef wearing a sequins-encrusted NYC hat - greets you when you walk in. We were seated at a table in the main area. The waitress was experienced but more into chatting than serving. She knew the menu and details of the rolls. She was very helpful, when you could catch her. She liked to drop and run. For a place that wasn't very busy either. Happy hour menu is extensive but full of the regular rolls that aren't very interesting. Which is fine, if the full price items are quality - which happily they were. The rolls are huge. We ordered way too much food. For 3 of us, with wine, was $70.  We took more than half home and had it for later. I wouldn't call this a place you could get a quick meal but I would definitely visit here again.  

Garlic edamame sounds good, but don't bother - get plain. It's just garlic powder dusted on the shells then microwaved. Gyoza is good with a spicy dipping sauce.

If I had any complaint, it would be that there is a section for prepared appetizers (dunplings, spring rolls, etc...) that was kind of lacking.  Not much selection, and it looked like it had been sitting out for a while.

Is this place super authentic for you sushi snobs? Definitely no. But it's a fun atmosphere and there are plenty of options for vegetarians, and even non-sushi eaters (everyone loved the chicken teriyaki sliders). The most memorable item of the night for me was a roll featuring crushed fritos. Sounds gross, I know, but with the katsu sauce on it it tasted more like panko breading than corn chips. 

Most importantly, the cocktails are amazing - I could not get enough of my kiwi cocktail (I think it was called the kinky cooler - ignore the name and just try it!)

After dinner, we piled into one of the private karaoke rooms and thanks to our helpful waitress and many sake bombs, we had a wonderful night. They were lacking some randomly important karaoke songs, but we managed to have a good time regardless. I have to say I thought we'd get more use out of the pole in the middle of the room though!

Two very important notes, one good, one not so good:

First, you MUST go to the bathroom. Anyone who's ever been curious about those fancy Japanese toilets will have a blast in the ladies' room (can't speak for the boys' room). I'm surprised they put them in because I bet on busy nights a long line must form as people are testing out all the fun, weird functions on the toilet. 

Second, a note to whoever writes the descriptions for the rolls on the menu: You may not have too many Asians in your life, but next time you're thinking of a way to describe your sushi, saying things like 'you no likey?' and 'herro!' are not appropriate and may be offensive to some!",2011-01-26 15:43:50

This location is near many businesses so they are great at accommodating a lunch hour. Seating was prompt and the waitress was quick to get orders taken. The food is pretty quick and check out is efficient with no problem in getting split checks.

I didn't see anything on the lunch menu that I recognized as a low calorie option from the website. 

The Victoria's filet was pretty tasty and it was prepared as requested. The seasoning was pretty good, but probably high in sodium. The veggie sides were very good for vegetables. The size of the meal was satisfying without being a heavy meal. My coworker ordered Ahi Tuna as an appetizer and insisted that I try it.

Salads and sandwiches are really good, made with good ingredients like Boar's Head.  Their lasagna is also very good, and most stuff comes with these garlic rolls that are oh so good.  They also offer pizza which I haven't tried yet.

If you have kids, take them here.  From then on you'll have a great carrot to incent them with.",2009-11-03 16:05:51

First, I love that there's a non-Asian space in the middle of Chinatown. The space is gorgeous and there's plenty of seating around the kitchen, which I like. They also have chairs with backs on them which is perfect for those at the bar who want to linger around a long meal. There were a few groups here so this might be a good place for a party who wants something relatively affordable downtown. 

WE ATE
We had the caesar salad to start. It's grilled but I felt it had a bit too much mayo on it . It was okay. Dining companion had the pizza. He said simply it was ""good."" I had the fettuccine with mushrooms. I thought I was going to get a creamy sauce. It was basically a bunch of cooked mushrooms and parsley. I kid you not, I was going to cook that up for myself BEFORE I went out for dinner for a snack. I get that this place is ""simple food"" but if I'm paying upwards of $16 to $20 there better be some nonna mafia in the back. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. Though the server did give me the wrong dish, she handled the situation well and got me the dish I wanted while offering me the other dish. I didn't take it. The wine was very good and unlike Buca, the waitress knew which wine to pair with the dish and why. 

That said, I don't think I'd come back here to eat. 
To make it worse, I had everyone from the waitress to the cook in front of me to the owner ask me how my meal was and yes, I lied because I didn't really want to make a big deal out of it. It's a lot of pressure! So Yelp is basically my space where I can be an a-hole. I think they knew because I didn't finish my pasta and it's not a good sign when I'm not finishing my meal (if it's good the plate is being licked clean, quite simply).

What a horrible experience. Packed, lines for the buffet were 30mins+ because they seated people at specific times so intake seating was all at the same time. I would prefer Mandarin as opposed to this establishment. 
Horrid planned seating times but clever money saving. Had I not been there for another person's special occasion I would have left within seconds of entering the door. 
Food was disappointing, nothing stood out or was vaguely appetizing. After 1 partial plate of sushi and hot foods I opted to save myself any further annoyance and skip the rest. The desserts were enjoyed by those with me but once more it's was nothing outstanding.

I have been coming to Marche Bacchus since before they even served dinner; when it was first and foremost a wine shop run by Gregoire.  When they expanded, I worried they would lose focus on bringing in fantastic Burgundies (which, btw, this place the BEST selection of in town).  Instead, they eased my fears and executed a simple menu that you could enjoy with the wines they sold.  

As the menu grew and ownership changed, the operation did nothing but improve.  Sure, I could nitpick about things I'd like to see or change on the menu, but that would be counter-productive, as they are always making tweaks.  Portions are huge, prices reasonable.  

My most recent visit was for lunch, and we had French Onion Soup (great flavor, though I would have loved more cheese), escargot (mmmm), lobster croissant (huge and filled with lots of lobster meat), poulet frites (fork tender and really juicy) and a ham & brie sandwich (really just ham and cheese, but good and tasty, nonetheless).  For desert, we had an enormous serving of lemon bar.  It was HUGE and more than enough for three people.

I absolutely LOVE the fact that you can buy any wine in the place and have it with your meal for $10 (and they'll also allow you to bring wines from your own collection, as well).  It makes it almost irresistible for me to suppress my inner wine geek.

I did like the difference in flavor - and I think the lychee jelly make such a  good addition to it. However, I do think that the flavor is a tad bit icy-er in comparison to their neighbour. However, milk tea shaved ice isn't available in cha me cha. My friends ordered the regular milk teas with boba - nothing too unique. My friend ordered shaved ice with mango chunks. To her disappointment - the shaved ice didn't have any flavor. You had to really have it with the mango and syrup. In my opinion, if you are looking for milk tea flavor shaved ice - this place would be good to go to. Otherwise, it's alright for the rest..nothing too unique. 

For service, it was not bad, nor was it great. The food did come out pretty quick though, Which was nice. They were pretty attentive to us, but it became slow when we wanted to get our bill.Perhaps they were busy since there was a lineup.",2015-08-01 00:45:37

I also ordered a side of the smoked polish sausage with sauerkraut as well.

BF ordered the stuffed cabbage that came with pierogis and the lunch special with 6 pierogis that were all the same flavor. We devoured our plates. The place is adorable, deli style seating in the front and inside but very small, with giant shelves of pickled veggies and dips. Service was a little odd, it was a younger guy who had to do it all, take orders, bus and run out food. It was getting very busy around 1.

The atmosphere seems like a divey-bar turned into a restaurant-I mean this is a very cute and charming way.  

Food is very value, dinner is approximately $15/person and large portions are given.  My only call out is that the food is quite salty, but the attentiveness of the waitress, who is always there to fill up your glass, definitely helps.

I would recommend the oxtail for sure.

The cost of the lens was roughly $1,400 or $1,500 with tax. Now when we called the salesperson over to help, she said, ""oh I sold you the ____ lens before which you returned"" - now the one in which she said this was extremely rude. My partner being from Asia didn't pick up on the tones so I let it go as I didn't want to cause any issues. 

Now I can completely understand that the salesperson was probably unhappy that she returned the previous lens as she didn't get a commission on it. With that said, we've spent $10,000+ dollars at future shop in the past 4 months on 2 high end DSLR's and about 5 or 6 lenses. If she decides to return one lens because it isn't to the standard she thought it would be, SO WHAT - that is what 14 day return policies are for - if you don't want returns don't have the policies....

Yes, I have decided that Brew Tea Bar is officially THE #1 spot for milk teas and flavored teas. THE NUMBER ONE. Take it in, think about it, and don't argue with me. 

After my initial review, I have returned to Brew Tea Bar a few more times to try a few more things. They now have sea salt coffee. THEY HAVE SEA SALT COFFEE. And you know what? It's pretty damn good and it's also pretty damned strong. Need a lift? Oh, this will give you a lift. This will give you more than a lift. This would get you jumping! Their coffee is strong yet not bitter or acidic and it is BEYOND smooth. It's delicious! Whenever I drink their sea salt coffee, I feel as though I've drank a red bull. IT GIVES ME WINGS. It's just unfortunate that they don't open that early so I can't get it before work... booooo haha! 

I have also requested a strawberry green tea. They don't have it on the menu but they definitely have the ingredients to make it. Most places make their flavored ice teas quite sweet so I had them add notes: more tea flavor and less sweet. I believe there was a miscommunication for my order so when I got it and tasted it, I wasn't really sure what I was drinking. It tasted quite weird. No tea flavor and no fruit flavor. However, they remade it, got it right, and it was perfect -- wasn't too sweet with immense jasmine tea flavor. It was perfection in a cup. 

Brew Tea Bar also doesn't back down from a challenge or any difficult customization that you have in mind. Strawberry milk tea. People don't drink it for the tea, people drink it for the sweetness! Well, I'll be DARNED. But it's okay. Sou was up for a challenge so he gave it a go. I needed it less sweet with a noticeable tea flavor to go along with it and he was definitely able to complete this challenge. Tons of tea, strawberry, and no added sugar. Done. A little tangy due to the strawberries with tea flavor. Yup. Done. I'm good. 

I am typically afraid to order fruit based milk teas in other places because: if I don't like their regular milk tea, I'm probably not going to like any other milk teas that they have. But it's okay, Brew Tea Bar has got you.

First of all, the guys that greet you have the personality of a doorknob, and do not make you feel welcome.  The auto glass guy is picking at your window before you can exit your vehicle.  I also have had to get my own air fresheners the past two times after having to remind them I get a choice of which ones to put in my truck, then the guy shrugs the reminder off and points to the buckets and says ""go for it"".

When your vehicle actually gets through the wash, there is always some other a**clown there jamming it into drive and squealing the tires, then coming to a screeching halt and throwing it into park before the vehicle comes to a stop.  They are show no care with your vehicle and I have never been satisfied leaving there feeling like it was worth the money invested.  I have had to remind them the past 3 times to put tire shine on, at which point they slap a glob of it on and then I have to ask them to wipe them clean so it doesn't spit shine all over the sides of my truck.  That always comes with a scoff or eye roll.  I don't even try and make them wipe everything clean or cover spots they missed, because they lack the drive to do a good job in the first place and don't comprehend the fact you're a paying customer with their tip in your control.  So, their tip usually reflects the job they complete.  It's usually change they scatter all over my console.

Bottom line, save the $20+ bucks, go to the store and buy a car wash kit, do it yourself and get the job done right.  Don't waste your money on this establishment.  If I did my job and treated customers the way they do, I wouldn't have any clients.  It should also tell you something about their service when you get a free car wash for posting a positive review, and there are more 1 star ad 2 star reviews than 4s and 5s.",2015-05-04 03:21:29

The regular prices for the sushi are a bit higher than most other sushi restaurants. But the 'happy days' prices makes it worth a try. We tried the Spicy tuna wonton, hotegai, Lahaina lobster roll,and malasadas. We also tried the sake sangria. 

The pickled Ginger that accompanies the wasabi smelt like day old wet rag and tasted as such. The wonton chips has a good flavor profule. You get the crunchy textures of the won ton and the mild spice from the tuna but the texture of the ahi was mushy. We ordered the Lahaina lobster roll based on a suggestion from our server Nina. I don't prefer cream cheese with my sushi. They belong on bagels and cheesecake but not my sushi. Our fault though for not checking to see what was in it before ordering it. Also there was a weird taste in the lobster roll almost bitter that caught me by surprise and it was only in one piece of the roll. We decided to finish dinner with the malasadas and that was a complete miss. The ice cream tasted as if it was not the best quality. If you've ever had fresh malasadas. Imagine biting into a warm delicious buttery biscuit like sugar doughnut. I don't know what we got but it wasn't malasadas. 

I would give 5 stars! for the amazing service we got from Nina. She was very courteous, prompt, made suggestions since it was my first time, and she made herself available but not intrusive as me and a friend caught up.

On the plus side they are open 24/7. Next time i'll be back for drinks. My advice, skip the sushi.",2012-04-09 05:03:19

I don't know, maybe because I grew up in a Mexican neighborhood in Chicago, or that I lived on the West Coast for years, but I have a certain expectation for Mexican food that I have really yet to find here in Charlotte (except at a couple of dive joints down South Blvd). Anyway, I know the whole story about the South African owner, and JWU trained Chefs, blah blah blah. But here's the story....the food just isn't that spectacular. It isn't. The guacamole was good, but had TOO much line and not enough salt to bring out the flavors. It could have used more red onion as well. The chips were good, but lacked salt and didn't seem that fresh to me. The Orange and Spice Crusted Pork Tenderloin was average, and the pork was well done, not a pink center which I asked for. The ""crust"" part was tough to chew, and I just couldn't finish the dish because of it. 

I got their ""spicy"" Margarita and while good, I didn't get the whole ""spicy"" flavor that our lovely Community Manager Nikki raved about. I'm thinking, WHERE'S THE HEAT? It did say SPICY didn't it??? Ugggg

The highlight of the evening was them giving us the Queso and tortilla as a complimentary extra. Now THAT was really good....honestly the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2.

The restaurant is really loud, and very busy. Which is a good sign. But I'm convinced that the good folks of Charlotte just haven't had a really GREAT, AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant yet. When you do, you'll see just how different and BETTER it is than all these Tex/Cali Mex places that exist in Charlotte.

Look, this is a decent place for sure. Will I come back? Probably, and just get a darn Burrito, Chimi, Quesaidilla or Fajita. Maybe they do those the best?",2014-10-18 03:18:35

I found some deficiencies:

Tint not properly adhering to the front driver window. Close examination reveals voids and air pocket. Basically over time, this can cause the tint to lift up as the window goes up and down. 

Rear windshield tint, two corners were adhering down the windshield properly. 

I said, okay, I can fix these myself, i.e. place a little adhesive at the edge to seal it.

My biggest concern was the gap between the weatherstripping and tint. There was a gap about 6mm in length and 1mm in diameter on the rear quarter panel window.

Basically light is coming through.

I took the car back for them to re-tint the quarter panel. Instead, they took a sharpie marker and attempted to color in the gap. Are you kidding me?

Do you think I can not tell the different between a re-tint and a half-ass touch up.
I paid for a tint job to cover the windows completely, not partial tint and color in the rest with a sharpie marker.

I expected more from them. I guess you get what you paid for.

I guess I should have read YELP prior to taking my vehicle over there.
I'm debating whether to contact my credit card company to contest the charge, or to have it prorated. 

Moreover, I will be filing a complaint with the BBB. Unethical business practice. They had an opportunity to fix the problem, but refuse to.

Coloring a gap in the tint with a Sharpie marker is not a fix!!!

I had been to the nightclub portion of Hakkasan multiple times, but hadn't had the opportunity to eat at the restaurant. Since my family was staying at MGM Grand, it was convenient. 
The dishes are family-style portions, so we decided on ordering the pan-seared Shanghai dumplings, hot & sour soup, roasted chicken with satay sauce, sweet & sour pork, Hakka noodle, stir-fry French bean, and for dessert, I chose the assorted macaroons. I know that there were 2-3 other dishes that were ordered, but I can't remember what they were since I did not eat them.
I definitely enjoyed my experience at Hakkasan. I was not surprised by the price of the food since it is a fine-dining restaurant, and it is on the strip, so it is to be expected. That being said, I typically would not spend this much on Chinese food,  but it was my 30th birthday. I believe our bill was a little under $200 including drinks, but I did have a 40% discount. 
I would rate the food 3.5/5. It was good, but not amazing. However, the service was amazing! I constantly had a full glass of water, and as soon as I was even close to finishing my Diet Coke, they were asking if I would like another. Our waiter was able to answer questions about the menu,and was very friendly. I really liked the attention they gave us.

Enter the mall next to Wendy's and Big Lots, head east a short distance. Easy parking and access off Market St and the parkway. This place is a few hundred feet east of Wendy's.

You enter, walk over to the rack of bags, find the category your desired sandwich is found in, grab that bag, mark your bread, size, toppings, and any extras you like. One sandwich per bag. Tolerate the upsell at the register. Sit and wait for your name to be called. There's a TV and the music is too loud. People behind the counter calling names are hard to understand because the music is too loud.

The food is 'average' for subs. Perhaps a tiny slice above subway but much slower. It would be a good idea to research online what sandwich you want and what toppings you want before you go, so you know what category bag to grab. Otherwise, the ordering process is a little odd and can be a big put off if you go in unprepared.

We had a drug rep come into my office today, as we do 2-3 times a week, for a catered lunch and he brought Cenci's, which growing up in the Wexford area, I have wanted to try since it is relatively (a few years maybe) new to the area. He brought 2 pizzas-a pepperoni and a cheese-in addition to 2 full hoagies-an Italian and a steak. I opened up both pizza boxes and it looked absolutely revolting as in I truly have not seen pizza look so unappetizing in quite some time. So unfortunately I personally cannot rate the pizza on anything other than appearance but the crust was black the whole way around and the amount of grease pooling on the shriveled up pepperoni was disgusting. I ended up taking a 1/4 of the Italian hoagie and a 1/4 of the steak. The steak meat was dry as can be and burnt. I had to douse the 1/4 in ranch to make it edible. The bread was pretty hard and not as if it were toasted but as if it were stale (maybe in addition to being toasted). The Italian was the same deal-the only way it was edible was with Italian dressing on it (and I'm not a fan at all of Italian dressing but it was work and options were limited). Again, the bread tasted stale and was actually too hard to eat on this 1/4 hoagie. I attempted to dissect the meat from the 1/4 but seeing as there was only one sliver of pepperoni I decided that would be too much work and I just threw it away. I'm glad I was able to try the food for free because I had been planning on stopping into Cenci's pretty soon and I would have been utterly disappointed and feeling ripped off if I would have actually had to pay for any of the items the drug rep brought in today. I don't give many one star reviews but honestly, based on what I sampled and saw today, cannot give the food we received at the office more than one star.",2014-11-03 20:01:34

Now those two are next in line. I love the ham and pineapple hand tossed and the specialty chicken with bacon and tomato. This alone was a genius invention. The forever coupon that allows you to pick several different items for $5.99 each is perfect. And the best way to round out an already filling meal from here is with the chocolate lava cakes for $4.

John Felipe was magical, from the coffee to the fabulous pastries that they made in house. Their chocolate decadence has been replaced with this new establishment. The Aria does try to deliver this feeling that one could have with a bakery. But they still need some more magic dust!

The menu here is very extensive and well thought out. The desserts that they offer are more colorful than the old JP. I applaud them for keeping the business the same style and type when John Felipe went south.

The service still needs some work. At every occasion that I have visited this new concept by the Aria. The staff does not immediately recognize the guest when they walk up. You stand there very awkwardly wondering whom is going to wait on you. 

Eventually someday does come over but it takes them way to long. This is how you loose customers. Funny when waiting today two employees were fiddling with restocking and ignored my presence, and another customer behind me. It is random chaos to find an employee to take your order and give them money. It should be the other way around.

The strawberries with cheesecake that I tried was very good. The strawberries on top were fresh and not pre sweetened. The cheesecake was fluffy and gooey. It was properly cooked and all. Just a more loose cheesecake with a stronger graham cracker taste. The strawberries were surrounded by a lime chocolate piece with was very cute on top of the dessert. Especially since it was edible.

The raspberry muffin had lemon red sprinkles on top and was excellent. It was a well thought out balance for a muffin. This is the new tricks that they need more of. The red lemon sprinkles were what caught my eye. 

The muffin was very moist and had whole pieces of raspberries inside. The Pellegrino was the right sparkle that I needed to wash it all day. 

The dining area is very comfortable here and really clean. In fact they are still cleaning as I sit here now. Clean and Vegas are so important. Just think of the people that sat at this stool in a day. Too much math for me. 

The new menu is good, not great but I know the Aria constantly changing. The service could use a little boost here. I will return now that I know it is still way above par.",2018-07-02 00:52:18

DiBella's wows you from the beginning, especially if you are there during a busy time.  You are likely to be greeted by a line just out the front door, which is always a good sign.  Don't let it scare you off, though, as it moves quickly.  Once you're in the first door, you will see where they bake their bread which is one of the two secrets to their perfect sandwiches.  Through the second door, you're greeted by 1920s decor and artifacts.

When you order, there is a very friendly ""Soup Nazi"" thing going on.  The person taking your order rapidly goes through several lists of ingredients that are somewhat logically grouped together.  If you are a newcomer, they slow down and do so with a smile.  But their ""all business"" attitude is what keeps the line moving.

The important part... the food!  I've only ever ordered the Hot Godfather (I should say the Godfather sub, prepared hot) and it is the best submarine sandwich I've ever had, and by no small margin.

I have also given Jimmy John's 5 stars because they have perfected their craft - lightning fast, high-quality cold subs.  But DiBella's is doing something different (something more difficult to get right) and they've also perfected it.

The bread is an A+.  Beautiful shiny crust surrounds flavorful, perfectly tender but dense soft-stuff.  I usually get the ""everything"" bread, but sometimes get the seeded Italian.  It's all perfect.

The meats and cheeses are an A+, as well.  Flavorful but not overly fatty capicola is hard to find.  They have it here.  And they give you a LOT of it.  

The sandwiches are then cooked the perfectly correct amount, and dressed to your specifications.  No matter how high of expectations you come in with, the first bite of a Hot Godfather will exceed your expectations.

For sides, DiBella's has excellent chocolate chip cookies (with and without walnuts) and the best chips on earth, Miss Vickie's.

I definitely get out and about the foodie scene around Phoenix and mingle with some foodniks here or there.  This was a complete shock to learn that Giordono's has been open since Dec 2016.

I'm over the shock.  I'll be honest, disappointed that they chose to go so far west.  BUMMER!  I hope that taking that chance is paying off well for them.  Just getting there on a Saturday afternoon from Central  Phoenix took me 32 minutes.  Most of it was highway miles.  The restaurant is in a nice new building just off of the 101/Bell exit in the Peoria Stadium complex.  Just south of the Target shopping plaza.

So, to the question you may be asking me... Was it worth my drive?  Well... HECK yeah.  I enjoyed the glass of Chianti on their menu.  I googled it and it is a very inexpensive wine that I may order for myself.  It paired well with the pizza and marinara sause!  We sampled the calamari and more and the garlic Parmesan fries.  I was quite satisfied with those appetizers while we waited for our pepperoni deep dish pizza.  The pizza was delicious.  I only wished the crust was more buttery.  Was it as good as I remember from my last trip to Chicago... not quite.  But was it delicious?  Yes. definitely a winner.  Good enough to pull me outta arcadia for a trip that far?  Probably not...

My poor dog has been suffering from severe allergies for years and nothing seemed to work.

This (kind of cute) guy with a pony tail was more than happy  to help me and starting giving me options within minutes. He took a good look at my dogs allergy report and explained why she should or shouldn't eat certain things.

FYI- If you carry a purse bring a purse hook. The chairs are rounded at the top so you cannot hang your purse. Regretfully I had to put my nice purse on the ground because I didn't want to eat with it on my lap. This was annoying.

While the address is on Sunset, it would be much easier to find if you enter off of the 215 freeway Service Road (just east of Ikea). This place is truly a well-hidden gem. It is located in the very back of an office complex off of Sunset. The restaurant itself is rather small with indoor seating for about 24 people.

I enjoyed the tostada, should have just ordered 3 of them and called it a day. It wasn't the best but it was adequate for the price or maybe just so much more enjoyable then the other items we selected.

The sushi Mexican roll, although very creative, tasted like a grease roll and I was not a fan despite all the raving reviews. It isn't sushi at all.

If you are not looking to do any hiking that is alright as well. There is a 13 mile loop you can drive around slowly and see everything. You can also park and take pics in most places.

Called ahead to ask if we needed reservation and hostess highly recommended yes. Made a reservation and when we showed up, we were offered the bar cuz there was no table set aside for us (defeats my reservation?)..After we sat at the bar, we saw the happy hour menu (we were also not informed when we called at 5pm that there was happy hour).  Personally I think it's quite important for a new restaurant to inform their customers events, promotions, and specials.

Decor and ambience was hip.  They definitely invested time and money, it's well thought out!! Loved all the little details. 

We ordered Clams Casino..$7.50 a clam with the smallest Uni on top. (Photos on Yelp had much larger Uni) both my husband and I barely had any clam, I had 2 large bits of mushroom and bacon instead.

Lamb Tartare needed some kinda kick.. like more red onions or capers or something acidic.. the curry powder in the bread just isn't enough flavor to wow us.

Bone Marrow dumpling was a beautiful and visually appetizing plate.  Though the dumpling dough is too thick, the flavor is not bad. But still mediocre 

Beef skewer was my fave tonight because the beef was a perfect medium rare, just how I like it.  Taste was more flavorful than the rest. Again, does not exceed expectation

My husband wanted to refresh with a mojito.  It wasn't the best and it wasn't chilled enough.

They made our party fun. 

One lady who works there, I want to say her name is Denise, but I could be wrong. She is great! Every time we're there, she's there and comes to say hi, When we met her, we had found out our friend was moving overseas, so we were upset.

I love the food here! The firecracker shrimp and jerk shrimp are my favorite. I like my food with a little kick and these deliver. Firecracker shrimp comes with a really good dipping sauce, while the jerk shrimp comes with Cuban bread. Also love their drinks! I get the Frozen Bahamarita. I recently tried the specialty rum drink they had, and got a souvenir glass.

The check-in process was easy, although the clerk remained silent through the entire process.  Normally, I prefer a communicative clerk that confirms the type and location of room I am getting.  In this case, I had to ask her if the room was a smoking room with 2 doubles as I had requested when I booked it online.  It wasn't and she wasn't aware of my request, so she had to start over.  

The room itself was large and airy and nicely decorated in a contemporary style with a warm color scheme of golds, browns and rust. Slightly larger bathtub than most hotels in town with an out-curving shower curtain rod which gives you a little more room when standing in the tub.  Large desk with 2 chairs and floor-to-ceiling windows with blackout curtains.  A large comfy chair next to the bed is perfect for relaxing and watching the large flat-screen TV.  Only 1 waste basket in the entire room, which I thought was a little odd.  No fridge, but I believe you can request one for an extra charge.  Beds were high and fluffy and very comfy with lots of pillows (love that)!

i shared the rib eye tacos with my friend which tasted great, the meat was rare as requested, but what annoyed me is we were given a bowl of whole beans in a soup instead of mashed frijoles like another guest who ordered tacos. where is the consistency here? the molded rice tower was interesting for plating. the rice had good flavor and didn't seem as blown out as other mexican restaurant rices i have had.  i also tried the lobster quasadilla. i was tragicly disapointed. it was void of flavor, and the sauce on top was not very appealing when i tasted it on it's own. the inside was mushy...but not in a mushy melted cheese way. it was just mushy.

service was mediocre, guests who ordered drinks were left waiting 20 minutes without them. the place was dead last night so there is no excuse of being overwhelmed. i ordered a Dos XX's draft and it tasted flat, so my second drink i opted for a can of PBR. umm 3.50 for a can of PRB is hilarious. i can get a 12 pack at safeway for 5 something i think.

last on my gripe list...originally i ordered duck tacos..she took the order, and then came back to tell me they didn't have them. shouldn't the servers know this? the kitchen staff needs to let servers know what is out before they start taking orders. if when i ordered the duck tacos she said ""i'm sorry we are actually out of duck tonight"" i would have been ok.. and ordered something else or asked to be skipped till everyone else had ordered. instead i get to have her come back with menus and tell me ""sorry we are out of duck tacos"". (:-\) no bueno!



Padre's you want to play yourself off as semi upscale mexican restaurant charging 15$ for 3 small tacos. service and atmosphere isn't deserving of your priceing. at least put my PBR in a glass instead of serving it to me in a can.


in conclusion, i will give Padres another shot. but i am in no hurry to return.",2009-04-01 16:40:21

If you thought that joke was bad, you haven't tried these tarts yet. Not really. They're pretty delicious, but I didn't find them anywhere near as good as the better ones in town (Brick Street, Golden Wheat, Brazil, Progress, My Market Bakery), and so I'll stick with a 4 star rating.

These tarts - known as Pasteis De Nata - are one of my favourite sweet treat items, and if you like custard you will love them too. I found these ones to be a little stale or stringy and not great or fresh, but still delicious enough, and cheap enough at $1.25, to award 4 stars to this little family-owned bakery.

dxl9qtFL6wa6vQPYPzqRww,NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA,4,1,1,0,"Imadake, in my ever-fervent quest for good Japanese food in Montréal, doesn't quite hit the spot, but it's nevertheless a decent place in my opinion. I brought my parents here for an American Thanksgiving dinner (no turkey included, unfortunately), and its cozy, dim-lit vibe definitely hit all of the right notes on the ambience front.

After getting our drinks, we ordered eight plates to share among the three of us - the tonkatsu ramen, octopus salad, gindara (broiled cod), yakitori, tsukune patties, pork okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and agedashi tofu. Since the owners of Imadake also run Yokato Yokabai, I was excited to try the ramen; however, it came in an even smaller portion than the one at Yokato for seemingly the same price, and the taste wasn't as flavorful as Yokato's either. In addition, the octopus salad seemed rather small for what we were paying (around $5), and it seems to carry way too much wasabi in one bite (it actually numbs your mouth, and that's coming from someone with a high spice tolerance). Also, the gindara was quite small and less firm than I would have liked it to be, but it had a nice, smoky flavor and the charred skin was arguably the best part, as it was slightly sweet and provided a nice contrast to everything else we had.

Having said all of that, not all of the food was so-so by any means. The yakitori was very juicy and had that really nice grilled chicken taste that's essential for good skewers, and the chicken and pork flavors of the tsukune both came through in a smoky, herby delight. I was most excited to try the okonomiyaki since I've never had it before, and while it was good, I didn't think that there was much pork in there, if any. I did like the interesting texture with the vegetables and how it was different from the crispy outside, though, and I thought the bonito flakes were especially tasty and made it that much better. The takoyaki were perfect little balls of seafood-y goodness, with actual octopus chunks in the middle (some of my favorite things in the world) and a crisp outside that still makes me salivate when thinking about biting into its soft center. The mayonnaise is also a nice touch and reminds me of French fries dipped in mayo, but so much better. Finally, the agedashi tofu was one of the better ones that I've had, with its hot center going very well with the the cool, crisp radish and saltiness of the soy sauce.

Overall, I liked Imadake for what it's worth, although it's definitely a place for you to take your parents if you want a full meal as opposed to just drinks and some snacks. It can get very expensive very quickly as the total bill came to a little over $100, not including tip, so it's not the most ideal place for poor university students. It has a cool atmosphere and fun signature drinks like the sake bomb, but it can get loud pretty quickly as a result. I give extra bonus points to them for playing cool 80's music throughout the night, however, as I found it impossible to not sing along to my favorite tunes the whole night.",2016-12-01 11:12:26

I pretty much guessed beforehand going into this that the place would be a little divey since after all it's a pub, however I wasn't prepared for how my meal here went. Walking up to the entrance you see their patio area for pets which I think is a cute idea but then seeing the grass having huge divots and holes with standing water in them going stagnant made me feel like I would never want my dog to visit here. Then came walking inside. We waited to be seated since there is a sign kindly requesting you wait to be helped, well waiting we did, then waiting some more & some more which felt strange since there was only maybe 10 other guests there tops. The hostess was kind, I was surprised to see how hiked up her skirt was but again I thought ""well this is a pub in Las Vegas"" so I wasn't upset. She was kind enough to take our drink orders and return with them a short time later, when she came back she took our meal orders: bangers & mash and fish & chips. We then waited a long time to see the hostess/waitress again it was about 40 minutes for our food, which wouldn't have been a big deal if the food we got back was hot and appetizing. The bangers & beans were Luke warm and the mash was cold with cold gravy where it's more like meat flavored jello than gravy. The fish & chips were okay in the sense that yes it's fried and a huge piece of fish but I wasn't expecting it to be soaked in oil when I received it and the side of peas appeared fine until I watched a small fly crawl out of them and fly away. Trying to make the best of it with my guest we decided to have the food be taken away and we dared enough to try dessert which was probably the only thing we did enjoy. The things I failed to mention through out this review is that while sitting there the entire time we really took in how filthy the place is with holes in the wall, dirty light switches and scuffs everywhere and creaky filthy floors & A LOT of spider webs everywhere A LOT. The tables are spaced out about 2 ft apart which wasn't a big deal, but my prior mention of the hostesses uniform made it uncomfortable when she bent over to fix up the table next to us which was also odd considering the place setting I was seated at was already dirty from someone else eating on it. I think the worst part of all was leaving their one way parking lot and seeing the back door being held wide open with a rope, immediately all of my food handling knowledge & certifications kicked into high gear knowing that open doors are a EXTREME no no because it allows pests of all kinds directly in. All & all its not a place I would go back to and it made me feel awful that I actually invited someone to join me without checking it beforehand, I won't be returning & nothing could make me desire too.

Service: The hostess welcomed us with a friendly greeting and then taken to our table. The waitress came for our order and greeted us with a friendly attitude (which always helps). After the food order was placed, she was kind of slow and it wasn't that packed tonight. I made a simple request for some extra napkins and silverware (funny how I had to ask for it). It took a few requests to finely have the napkins. So, the service was okay at best.

Food: They started us off with there chips and salsa, but had a bit extra with the bean dip. The salsa could use a lot of work and add some favor to it. The bean dip was actually good and had some kick to it. Now for the chips and it's pretty hard to mess these up, but they tried. Some were spot on and some were left looking wet with grease (not very tasty at all). Onto the kids (2 kids) food, which was chicken strips with French fries . The chicken strips were good (I tried them), but they couldn't even get the fries fully cooked (some were well under cooked). Next up was my wife's food, which were the  Pecos Sour Cream Enchiladas. Now my wife loves sour cream, but these guys over loaded them to where she got overwhelmed by the sour cream and started eating my kids chicken strips. Now onto my order and that was the Arriba Taco Salad. Had them take it back cause I didn't see that it came with ranch dressing and I hate ranch dressing. Anyways, they were nice enough to fix that mistake. It was a pretty decent salad with the grilled chicken and guacamole.

To everyone: They DO NOT make the crepes at this location. They are pre-made and warmed up. 

I came here on my lunch break and ordered the savory chicken florentine crepe. The interior was cute and had a Paris theme going on. But let me just say the whole set up of this place is confusing. As I was placing my order the girl said the drinks were self serve, but all that was available where she pointed was water or pressed juices. I opted for water out of lack of options. I pay and go sit down with my number. I heard 2 other tables finishing their food asking to close their check (no doubt thinking they had a server) and she told them she was unable to print the check they needed to pay up front. So I'm really not sure if you are supposed to pay BEFORE or AFTER. Its a casual place so I would assume you pay before you eat sort of like Pei Wei, etc.They should straighten that out. 

The actual crepe was not even made on site. Do you know how easy it is to make a crepe? It takes less than a minute to cook. They even had the crepe burner and yet they proceeded to take a pre-made out of the refrigerator and just warm it on the burner and add the fillings... I don't understand that. Overall the taste was okay. I lived in Paris for a year and crepes should be a lot thinner and crispier. Mine was thick and doughy almost like it needed to be cooked longer. The filling was good and tasted fresh.

Although to be fair, I'm not sure if this noodle bar is in any way affiliated with Deejai Thai here in Charlotte. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were not located on the main strip in NoDa (parking can be hell). 

Despite not being on the main strip, the parking was still atrocious. I actually ended up pulling out a parking lot entrance that lead to a dead-end because the parking lot was too tight with huge SUV's blocking people in. Sorry, it isn't 2003, didn't those go out of style when gas sky-rocketed to $5 in the late 2000's?

The staff here were extremely sweet and friendly. They are definitely out to please and welcome guests as if it were their home. Originally ordered the pad thai which came out way too sweet. They use a premade sauce and to be honest having had pad thai around the world including multiple trips to Thailand, it was some of the worst I have ever had. Period. 

The staff very graciously allowed me to change my order to a basil noodle which came out way better. Still a tad bit on the sweet side and a bit 'wet', but I'm sure for most American palates it would be considered 'a-ok'. 

So long story short don't come here expecting traditionally prepared dishes that will standup to your experiences traveling.

TDG-Q3ztKIo-YHt8oWzjgA,1WREwRWD4sHHObFXmCCgyw,tT5kEAq2DFTKqc6mJ9ptCg,5,2,0,2,"Vegan review: Gyro House still offers the same friendly service and quality food as at their previous location on Shea and 32nd St., but they menu has been tweaked a bit. I'm so glad they reopened! It's not quite as convenient for me as the last location, but still close to home! This is a great mom-and-pop neighborhood restaurant - so it's great to see them make a go at it again!

It's predominately a to-go place, with only a few small tables. The menu is pretty straight forward for a Middle Eastern restaurant. They offer a variety of items that either are vegan, or can be made so. Our favorite is the falafel pita sandwich, which has tahini sauce, hummus, lettuce, tomato and pickles on it. It also comes with a side of fries. The falafels are made fresh, and very tasty. The hummus is a nice, smooth and not to garlicky variety made with decent quality olive oil. I've had the Fattoush salad at their previous location and liked it a lot. The grape leaves are also vegan, and the thyme pita and Greek salads can be made vegan. The lentil soup has chicken stock though.

The service is outstanding and prompt. The best thing is that the owner is trying to transition to a plant-based diet, so it's fun to talk with her about food choices while waiting.",2018-01-13 23:15:35

A year or so ago they had some of the best customer service.. They would greet you upon entering and small talk with you, not to mention they would make your subs in a TIMELY manner. 

I went there on Saturday and there was a mom and son in line in front me me. Great i thought! I beat the rush! ... Or not.

The gal slicing the meats who is the first person to take your order, doesn't even register that there are people standing here waiting to order. She must have been doing an online order because she was just chopping those meats up without a care in the world.

Finally after literally 6 or 7 minutes, she looks up and says ""I'll be right with you"".. Well ok at least she acknowledged us! 

It only got worse from there.. The guy putting the condiments on the sandwiches was one of the slowest workers I have ever witnessed. He just couldn't get it together and took a few minutes to put on a few condiments on each sandwich. The lady in front of me turned around and gave me a ""what the hell, this is taking so long"" face. 

There was now a line almost out the door and a few people left because it was taking so long.

By the time I got to the register it was about 20 minutes since I came in. 20!! That is ridiculous!

Nu provides a decent, but far from overwhelming experience - in fact a slightly disappointing experience, and we got out of it with a ""meh"" on the lips. It is good, no, better than most restaurants on Murray, but it is not as good as it should.

The restaurant itself looks fine (it shares its door with Pamela): there is enough space between tables, simple furniture, open kitchen, decent light.

The food was not overwhelming. The blintzes with meat (appetizer) were the best dish of the lunch. We  particularly enjoyed the horseradish remoulade that went with it (the highlight of the lunch imo). 

The jewish penicillin with the matzo ball and pasta was quite bland, and I have had many better chicken broths. The brisket sandwich was quite tasty, although not light. 

Prices are fine. A complaint: they clean tables with a smelly product. Surely they know that taste and smell influence each other, and smelling cleaning product is quite unpleasant when the nearby table is being cleaned.",2014-01-06 03:38:18
KyA1NAoS2ECe92YLnswXRg,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,4,4,2,1,"Went to the Chart House with the wifey a bit back to celebrate our 3rd year Anniversary!  Anyone who can be married to me for that long deserves a nice hunk of beef (her 2nd...if I'm considered her 1st...heh heh heh)!

Located in the Golden Nugget near the hotel registration.  Looks pretty unassuming on the outside because the restaurant is rather open-spaced and housed with a LARGE salt water fish tank, no real sign, only way to tell for sure is the menu stand posted near the steps!  Walk up the steps to find the host/hostess, you will notice that the front of the restaurant is all bar and lounge type seating.  The real restaurant is around the fish tank to the back.  Chart House, there you are!

For our Anniversary we were given a more intimate table for two in the corner directly facing the fish tank.  What a view!  Our reservation also came with personalized menus for the two of us, celebrating our Anniversary on top!  Nice touch.  

Our server was excellent, super friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable on the Chart House menu!  She even knew we were celebrating our Anniversary!  After ordering some drinks and perusing the menu, our server led us to some great recommendations for dinner.

For a light appetizer we ordered the Hummus Trio - classic combination of traditional, roasted red pepper, and edamame (yes, edamame!) hummus all served with grilled pita and plantain chips.  Delightful!  Thankfully the hummus seemed to be fresh made (hopefully in-house) and was ripe with Mediterranean flavor.  Good quality olive oil, fresh beans.  The surprise was the edamame hummus, it was delicious.  Fresh, refreshing, light, it went great with the plantain chips.  I could eat a huge bowl of the stuff by myself.  I highly recommend.

For dinner the wifey and I went with what else?  Meat!  Chart House Prime Rib 10 oz. cut to be exact.  I asked our server if I should go with a bigger cut because you know, I'm a bigger dude, but she suggested that with the smaller cut the meat would be slightly more tender.  She was correct!  The 10 oz. cut of prime rib was no slouch, it was really a good size portion.  But the flavor was WOW!  Succulent, tender, salty, peppery, overall yummy piece of meat.  The extra au jus on the side was a nice addition as well.  I always (yes always) ask to my better judgment if there is a house steak sauce.  Yes, in a good steakhouse, this is sacrilege!  Our server, being gracious said they don't have a house steak sauce, but A1 if it's necessary.  But she did say to please trust them when they say the prime rib doesn't need any sauce.  Thankfully she was right.  Prime rib was juicy, oozing with fatty flavor!   Cooked perfectly for my liking.  A touch of horseradish, a smatter of au jus, and I was set.  Yummville, population - ME!  Our prime rib also came with a serving of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes.  Buttery goodness!  Creamy!  Did I mention the extensive use of butter?

For an additional side we got the Asian Green Beans.  They were tasty, but nothing I couldn't have created at home.  Fresh green beans, stir fried with soy sauce, sugar, possibly some rice wine or mirin, topped with sesame seeds. 

Can't go to a fancy place like the Chart House and not try a dessert!  OK, if you're a diabetic I guess you can.  Wifey and I topped off the evening with their signature Hot Chocolate Lava Cake - chocolate cake with a molten center consisting of Godiva liquer.  Then it's topped with chocolate sauce, Heath bar, and vanilla ice cream.  Whoa!  Talk about punch to your gut!  Luckily I saved some room by getting the smaller prime rib cut.  This dessert was rich, rich, rich!  Chocolate everywhere.  Cake was warm, and the molten center was divine.  Heath bar added some great texture, and the the vanilla ice cream helped to cut through everything.  Piggy us, we finished it up!

Lovely evening celebrating our Anniversary, after dinner we lounged in our booth and took in the fish tank sights.  Just relaxed and relished the rest of our night.  We must have been there an extra 30 minutes, and our server was more than polite and told us not to rush at all.  Rather enjoyed that.

Chart House, overall no complaints.  Wait...bring in a house steak sauce!  Nah, just kidding.  Keep up the food and service, and I'll be back.  Save me some prime rib.",2015-01-08 20:47:54

When we have come for dinner everything we've ordered has been perfect, from fried rice to lemon chicken, soups, veggies, and Cantonese chow mein, we've loved it all.

I knew from other reviews it was happy hour and there were food specials. I was given the regular menu -- no big deal, maybe they changed happy hour. I ordered the serrano wings (6 for $7.95) and a side of steam rice ($1.50). The waiter then showed me the specials on a chalkboard -- none of which I was interested in but then I asked what the difference was between the wings on his specials board and the wings that I ordered. He said nothing -- but his price quote was more expensive than the menu he gave me. He really seemed confused and said the price must have dropped. Interesting. Anyway, he then said, what time is it? I said like 3:20, he said oh it's happy hour, there is a happy hour menu. He left, provided it to me, and the wings were $.50 each ($3 for 6), so, then I also decided to order the fried spring rolls ($3.95), and steamed rice. My bill with tip was $11 so, cheap but the food wasn't very good, the wings tasted a bit like chicken liver -- not sure what was happening there. The spring rolls were the highlight but I did not like their sweet chili sauce and asked if they had hot mustard -- they do not. The rice was not quality. It was not sticky, but very separated like American (uncle ben's) rice.

The clincher was -- while I was finishing up. The owner or manager maybe, drove up (Toyota beige truck), parked in the only handicap spot in front (no handicap sign or designation on plate), and walked in the restaurant/pulled up at bar and was still there 20 minutes later when I left. It is totally is rude and annoying when perfectly able body people take the handicap spots (I'm in tuned because my mom is disabled and I drive her around a lot and its annoying that spots are taken by those with no disability and just lazy-asses).",2015-01-09 19:18:10

First of all, the same waiter has been really friendly and helpful each time I've come to eat here. If you have any questions, he'll be happy to answer them. They do have specials on specific skewers for $0.99. Luckily, my favorite one, the chicken gizzards, are part of the deal :D.

Be warned, the big boba cups will not fit in your cup holder. However, I have seen the smaller cups so you probably have to ask for it. I like the big cups though :D. They're cute.

I also tried the chicken sizzling platter on my very last visit. It definitely is not sizzling when you get it. Tastes like teriyaki after awhile. I know I will be sticking to my skewers (which I still have to try all the different types). My friend got the beegee mix but that's just all the meat.

If you have a party of 4 or more, make sure you call in ahead of time and ask for the yelp special + it would definitely help so they can make your orders ahead of time or something.

I went here today for lunch after going to the other location about 7 years ago and really enjoying it. I had a Groupon that was about to expire, so the BF and I went there for lunch. The place was fairly empty, only two other tables were full at about 12:30. I ordered the paradise pork (I think?) and he had the fried pork. Our server was very nice and spoke highly of my dish. The dish was supposed to have bell peppers and habanero peppers in it, but it was not spicy. The pork had a weird flavor to it....kind of like it was a bit old or possibly frozen, but I don't know if that is for sure the case. The bf's pork was kind of dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. When you ate the meat with the rice and beans it was alright because the rice and beans were actually pretty good. We also got the maduras which were good, a little mushier than I've had elsewhere, but good flavor. The real problem with this place is their prices. Without the groupon our lunch would have cost around 30$. That is a bit ridiculous, in my opinion.

I'm always dubious to try a sushi place that has an empty parking lot.  It was Tuesday around 5pm so what the heck -- I'll be adventurous.  I wasn't even sure they were open but, alas, the server welcomed me warmly into the no-ambiance, remnants of a fast food Mexican food place.  Hmmm... no points for ambiance (negative points, in fact), as I seem to have this magical threshold of 20 bucks spent on a meal that shouts ""I NEED AMBIANCE"" if I'm gonna lay down that much moolah.

Oh, and they don't serve alcohol, either, so no plum wine for me.  Wahh...

That said, I didn't turn and run as I really, really wanted sushi.  So I perused the menu and settled on the Sushi Deluxe platter to let the chef pick the 9 selections of sushi and a roll for a slightly lesser price than ordering ala carte.  As a plus, it came with miso and a salad which I wasn't expecting.  I also ordered green tea which was very pleasant.  it must have been pretty good and satisfying.  There wasn't a morsel left on my plate in the end.  And, yes, it did come to just about 20 bucks.

Each sub has a goofy name and a subsequent backstory. I've seen the stories printed up on their wall. Sorry, too long, didn't read.

Earlier in the day, when it's dead, it has that low-key neighborhood vibe. In fact, it's so low-key that the last time I was in, it essentially became a family restaurant with a few of the tables filling up with groups of little kids and their parents after what I presume was a basketball game. Granted, that forced us to move, as our group of adults didn't want to spend the afternoon attempting to talk over the sounds of a dozen + kids, but I guess with a few video games on the one side of the bar, the TV's, and affordable food, it's not an awful option for the locals to bring their kids during the day.

The bartenders have always been really nice, and the beer selection is pretty good. With a nice pint and all of the TV's, it's a decent place to catch a game, so there are definitely some positive aspects to The Saloon. Just don't expect much from the food. 

Now, yes...I'm fully aware that it's a bar, so the food isn't supposed to be great, but their food is actually bad enough that when I'm hungry The Saloon just isn't a place I consider an option unless we're meeting people there. I've given the food on the menu three chances to impress me, ordering different items each time, and sadly, the only food item that I enjoyed was the complimentary popcorn they brought to our table and/or gave us at the bar...and I'm not a big fan of popcorn.

Even something as simple as the buffalo chicken tenders I ordered last time as a fail-safe hope for a meal - after two previous disappointing experiences - scored below-average. The buffalo sauce was almost gritty, as the seasoning in the sauce was too noticeable. Talk about an awful texture. The fries are okay, but the sweet potato fries were too greasy. Now I'm sure there are people who will stand behind the food at The Saloon, but after my 3 unimpressive meals, I know I'll be hesitant the next time I'm perusing the menu during a visit. Perhaps I'll wise up and just eat at Aladdin's or Little Tokyo next door to The Saloon before heading into the pub next time.",2012-03-12 18:12:02

Gd7WJvjXLEyI-Uy9GcIEng,46HhzhpBfTdTSB5ceTx_Og,iSjFKxNpMg750rOY-6wJbw,3,7,0,0,"The Taste of Charlotte sounds like a great idea on paper...a bunch of local restaurants (and a few corporate chains) line Tryon St. and offer some of their best dishes to the masses. Unfortunately, it is executed pretty poorly as the logistics of it make for an extremely crowded and cramped time while the method of purchasing food simply boggles my mind. There is definitely room for improvement, but it is still a decent time.

We had no problem parking (the miss' was able to park where she works) and we made our way over to the festivities. We went at around 5:30 and headed straight to the booth to grab our stupid coins. Luckily I had found a Living Social deal where I got 7 coins for $5 (normally 7 coins cost $10), and spending that little made me feel a bit better about the overall experience. The coins themselves weren't bad...it makes things so much faster and smoother when you just give a vendor x amount of coins for a dish as opposed to fishing through for $3.50, handing over a Hamilton and waiting for change. However, the downfall of the coins is the pricing that vendors charge. Some hit that sweet spot where you feel you are getting your moneys worth, but others are ridiculously overpriced and you feel cheated walking away with one bite of food. 

A prime example of this is how our dishes went yesterday. I stopped by Brian's Dog House and got a Carolina Dog for 3 coins. This thing was great...a charred (and I mean burned, which is great) hotdog loaded with chili, coleslaw, mustard and onions. It was a huge portion of food and it was downright tastetacular, and I know exactly where I'm going next time I need some lunchy munchies in Huntersville. This thing was the right portion at the right price. The miss' also had a good experience with Caribbean Hut. She got the jerked chicken plate which had two huge chunks of chicken and a ton of rice and beans. That thing was not only tasty but filling, and definitely worth the 3 coins. 

Then she got two spring rolls from Mai Tai for 3 coins. Sure they were tasty, but it was such a tiny portion and definitely not worth 3 coins. I was tempted by the chicken diavlo at Bravo!, but it was like one small scoop that could be finished in one bite for 3 coins. Now these coins aren't cheap, and if this is going to be your meal, you want to get the most bang for your buck. I really think that some of these restaurants really need to look over their pricing system for next time...either make sure you're offering 3 coins worth of food, or lower your price to 2 coins!

Luckily there were quite a few free samples of food and drink to offset the time it took to travel from one booth to the next one you wanted to hit up (it was so cramped sometimes I felt like nothing more than herded cattle). Between the free samples and careful selection of restaurants to eat at, we got a full meal out of the 7 coins. 

As I said, there is definitely some room for improvement. I would love to see more local restaurants participate and less corporate chains be involved. It just sickened me to see people lining up to waste their coins at freaking Hooters when they could have been checking out E2 or Room 112. The amount of people attending is sickening, and having the food booths line both sides of the street leaves cramped quarters for traveling up and down...especially when a couple of booths extended much further into the street then needed. Also, the restaurants that do participate should really ensure their pricing is consistent with the quantity and quality of food they are offering. 

Still, despite these issues it was a good time. We enjoyed walking around and seeing all the different restaurants being represented. While it was far from a perfect experience, it's one that I will be all over next year for sure. I'm just hoping there is another Living Social-type deal for half price coins!",2012-06-10 11:37:09

The fair is standard for Korean BBQ.  Ribs, beef, chicken, pork, fish and squid.  The place has various side dishes.  The pickled radishes were excellent as was the pickled bean sprouts.  I found the beef short ribs were on the fatty side with little meat.  The sliced beef, fish and pork were hits.  However, our table of five guys was underserved with just one burner while the table for two had their own.   

The selection of beer was standard for Canadian brands.  I was disappointed the Asia beers were under represented.  

The service was hit and miss.  The initial selection took a little too long which makes selecting the right meat to Cook first a priority.  So my choice was the beef as the food takes less than 3 mins.  Others will take longer and that does not bode well for the hungry people in your group.

Bobby Y. mentioned that the BLT was great so I was dying to try it. Also, since I work downtown and am in the public sector, the LBGT Center is very appealing to me.
Let me preface by saying I am not a big sandwich person. Additionally, lunch for me has to be hearty meal, which sandwiches are usually not. But nonetheless, a friend a I decided to check it out for lunch one day we weren't too famished. The Center is very nice, with ample parking and big, big windows. I think they could use a bit more vegetation outside, what with the white walls, white stones, white fences, etc. But it gives the place a nice, light, airy feeling. 

The Café is right at the entrance, and they have a couple of tables to enjoy your lunch at. We placed out order (LGBTQ for me) and since no tables were available, we took a seat at the lounge chairs in the back by the library. I can understand how they are trying to offer a community space to hang out at, what with the free Wi-Fi and comfy chairs, but really the tables should be for eating. People were taking their dear time, and although the chairs we sat at were comfy and there was a little table to place our food on, it would've been better to sit at a table. Just saying.

On to the food! The sandwich was THE BOMB! It was incredible! Best BLT I've ever had in my life. Period. Also, it looks like a small portion but I ended up very satisfied at the end.

Grabbed a couple of coworker/friends and off we went!

We arrived little after 12; we were a party of 3 and were seated right away. After I sat down, I looked around and thought this is a really cute place, I like how its set up and how the lights hang and the art on the walls, and how tables are divided by bamboo, I liked the place just by site now.

Now I was looking at the lunch menu, soo many choices to pick from, I had been craving Pad Thai forever, so for this trip that's what I ordered, the Pad Thai lunch special, and some Thai Tea. With the lunch special it came with soup and salad, and the soup and salad are all you can eat, wow that's cool, because the lunch special price was like $7.99, that's a bangin good deal!

The salad was good, but what made it great was the spicy peanut sauce they have for the dressing, OHHHH MMMYYY GAWD!! That stuff is amazing, I think next time I'll have less salad and more sauce , I know, that's bad, but it's that good, and the soup, that's great tasting soup, it's a vegetable soup, but extremely clear broth, so tasty! Glad I gave it a try, because I'm not really a soup person.

Ok when I ordered my lunch, the waitress asked what spicy level would I want it, I was thinking of playing it safe since this was my 1st time there and I was unsure, and she told they have different levels, no spice, mild, medium, hot, Thai Hot, Double Hot and Triple Hot, and I thought to myself, if they have a double hot & Triple hot, then Im going to start at Thai Hot and that's what I did baby!  It was packing heat, but I think next time I will give the Double or Triple hot a try! The dish was perfect!! The entire lunch was very delish!

I look forward to making this a regular lunch time spot for me and to trying their entire lunch menu to find me a favorite! I think next I'll try there Red Curry!",2013-02-05 23:59:48

So I have never really been a huge fan of prime rib however I was afforded the opportunity to come here with my company for an awards dinner. I have always seen those Lawry's seasonings in the store and perhaps even used some while cooking before. When I arrived it pulled into valet and was kindly greeted by one of the valet attendants! They do offer complimentary valet so why not? Self parking is also an option for those of you who may be wondering, it's located near the back of the restaurant. The ambiance of the place is pretty cool! 

Our company had already selected some dishes that we may choose from. We started off with trays of appetizers one of them which was a smoked salmon on a cracker bread type thing and the other was some sort of taquito type of thing. Next up they brought out plates of ""The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad"" which was fantastic! Some people at my table didn't really like the egg taste it had however I loved it. For my main course I selected the Atlantic Salmon.  I know I know, who the hell comes to a place that's known for it's Prime Rib and get's some damn fish?! Ha! Me! But I had a plan and that was to order this fish AND eat off my co-workers plate to try their prime rib! Sharing is caring remember? Let's talk about how they bring out this cool oven like carving station kind of thing. That was pretty fascinating! The severs were all very pleasant and I thought that the uniforms were umm idk like are they were maids/pilgrims/omish type of theme. Talk about attentive! My glass stayed full of water and for those who ordered any other kind of beverage they never let it stay empty! Once the food came out those of us who ordered fish received ours first and the others who had prime rib had to wait since the type of temperature of how the prime rib was cooked would be different for each person. My Atlantic Salmon was delicious and the fresh asparagus it came with was a great pair! As far as the Prime Rib, I got to try medium well and also medium. Both were good however I would opt for medium IF I was to ever return for another dining experience. The creamed spinach was amazing!

It is somewhere you go, well I go, when I am really craving a salty dog or fries. Usually this happens after a night class and before I go home to sleep of the working full time going to school part time blues. The food is plentiful but I will say that the prices are a little steep for what it is. 

I went here last for national hotdog day. I was expecting some fanfare or something but the employee told me that every day is national hotdog day for him. Ok, I mean, I get it...but no discounts? No nothing? So I got two hotdogs with a slew of toppings and the price came out to be almost $9. Um... for two hotdogs. I mean they were great, really hit the spot but that price....eh... 

We also got a basket of fries for four people. Massive! But again ketchup and cheese were extra and the price tag of the massive fries were $10. Again...they were great, but that price..eh...

I also spent the rest of the night downing water because my sodium content was way off the charts. 

I like the O, it is some place that I think everyone needs to try once. I am not saying it is my go to, but it is fine for a once in a long while whim. The atmosphere is different and quieter than most of the other places you can head to in Oakland. But the price for what you get, this is not a place that I will come back to often. 

It is good, salty, and fast but the order will hit your wallet for sure.

Honestly, I tried coming here a few weeks ago and had a hard time finding it. I came upon an office building in which the automatic sliding door did not open...how was I supposed to get into this establishment that clearly states that it is held in 260 King St. and the LARGE numbers above also states that this door is 260! I then went to read the list of tenants and didn't find anything about a pizza place. Ok, dead end. Finally was told that there's a separate entrance on Ontario St. Ok...

It was a small little place and we basically took up the entire restaurant with our 15 people party. The majority of the menu were pizzas, which was perfect because that's what I wanted. I chose the salata which had cheese, tomato sauce, roasted tomatoes, olives, arugula and fresh ricotta. I opted out of the olives since I don't enjoy them. 

The food took a little longer than expected but we were a large party and put them in a crunch making all of our pizzas. That wasn't a big deal to me. The pizzas finally came and wow they were so good. Usually people complain when they don't have enough toppings, well I'm going to complain about having too much. Not that having an abundance of toppings isn't good, it's just it was an overload of ONE topping. Arugula. It completely overpowered the pizza with the bitter taste of arugula, I like arugula but not like this. I felt like I was having a salad with no dressing. I looked over and saw someone else had ordered the same pizza with olives and clearly did not have a full sized salad on his pizza.

I still enjoyed my pizza and the crust was perfect thin without it being too flimsy when picking it up to eat. Waitress was a-ok, we had to ask for more water on separate occassions but the fact that they came in a pitcher with lemon and lime was a plus. 

When visiting again, try not to come with your own entourage of people, a select few, max. 4 people are perfect for this little space. Oh another downer on this place, girls' bathroom has a code key entry. I believe it is 1 and 4 pressed at the same time.",2009-10-26 17:43:06

A Karate class was in session right across the way, which got me pumped up about my visit here. I felt like I was really in Seoul, too bad the food didn't complete this feeling.  My friend worked the Miega hut at the Asian Festival, I got BBQ chicken and it was pretty dam good, I was really excited to check this place out. 

We enter and take our seats, a cool call-bell was attached to our table, at first I didn't know what it was, then we asked. You know what they say, ask and you shall receive. Our waiter was quick and friendly. 

I had the Bi Bim Bop and it was a lot of food, but not all that great, it's hard to mess this up. The taste just wasn't there. They say you're body goes through a cycle, or complete change every ten years or so. Right before I turned 30 was my change. I used to love not and spicy cuisine. I just can't do it anymore. I remember before I was 20 I couldn't eat so much as Franks Red Hot without my mouth burning. Before I knew it I was eating a 7-8 on the Thai menus. Mexican. The hotter the better, now that palate is no longer available for me, my tummy doesn't like it. Maybe when I'm 40 I'll be back in the game. When that happens I'll check this place out again, if it still exists, keep messin up Bi Bim Bop, I can assure you won't be. 

In the middle of the floor, in the worst spot in the whole restaurant was a table bearing a reserved sign on it.

This place is really interesting because it seems like there are different portions of the restaurant that try to give off different atmospheres. There's a bar in the front that has modern decor. We ate in an area that seemed to represent a diner from the 1950s and had an open kitchen. There's an area in the bad that seemed to have a lot of bigger tables for larger parties and had a lot of portraits of baseball players. It seems like you can have a different experience depending on what you go there for.

CHEESE RAVIOLI ($15) - This dish just didn't have the cheese flavors I was expecting in a cheese ravioli dish. There wasn't much of it and the ravioli itself didn't have much flavor. My girlfriend ordered the rainbow trout and she mentioned the same thing about the fish not having much flavor. The pine nuts gave it the crunchiness and the spinach gave the dish much needed saltiness. I was just not the biggest fan and the garlic bread was okay. 2.5/5

SALTED CARAMEL PUDDING ($7) - We had heard a lot of Yelp reviews mention this so we hoped it would make up for the entrees. It was what its name says: salty and caramel-flavored. The whipped cream added a nice sweetness to it. It was probably the best thing we ate here. 4/5

They remembered his name as soon as we walked in.  He's quite the popular puppy here.  I used to live across the street and he just looooves the place!
After a quick tutorial in the wash area, my 7-pound rat terrier was ready to be scrubbed.  They give you a few different brushes as well as shampoo AND conditioner!  I never thought to condition my pet's coat before. 
He also needed his lil nails clipped.  I was whisked right in, even though the groomer was doin' a pomeranian.  It was quick and pain-free.
Then, the treats.  Dexter loves the training treats!  We practice his tricks from school (PetSmart puppy class) every night and he devours the different treats.
His favorite?  Peanut butter!  They had some star-shaped peanut butter treats and even a mini peanut butter pie, which he got a slice of.
toys?  Tons!  Dexter needs squeakers.  Got him some long-ass, strange-looking pink dog that squeaks near its tail.  Bought it on Sunday and the dang thing already got decapitated.  There is white fluff all over my living room.  
It's all good, though.  You can't have a 7-pound dog be a total wuss, you know?",2009-11-04 04:02:40

Sometimes I worry that they will close down soon from the lack of business, but they've been proving me wrong for quite some time now. I love this place! They have all these pre-made Korean side dishes, sushi, a bakery, a food court, a little station where they make those red bean-filled waffle fishes, and so much more! I love coming here to eat at the food court, shop for snacks, check out their bakery and just shop around. 

This time I mainly went to grab snacks, but I happened to be hungry so I made a stop at the food court. I usually eat at the restaurant next to Seoul Korean food, I think it's called Han Sung...something, but they were unfortunately closed. I ordered the pork bone soup because I felt like that was the safest choice. It was mediocre; I have definitely had better. Soup was more salty than anything else, barely any spices in it. The pork bone meat was acceptably tender. The kimchi and bean sprouts were ok. In summary, I don't recommend this dish but I wouldn't say don't eat it unless someone puts a gun to your head. I will definitely return to H Mart so next time, I think I'll try something else on the menu...if their neighbour is closed...sorry! 

Headed over to the bakery after my meal, it's around 6:30pm now and they're having a sale on their baked goodies!

It is tempting to compare every brunch to the major Las Vegas brunches, which may be unfair since the clientele is so different, but this is the first one that I think compares favorably, even with the #1 Vegas brunch (the Bellagio).  It is also a bit more expensive at over $40 per person.

There is a reasonably wide variety of food, including the obligatory omelet station, which can be mobbed unfortunately.  In addition, there is a crepe station with four varieties including a dessert offering, a cold foods table with about 20 items, a few hot dishes of which the potatoes and shrimp/salmon were the best, hand-sliced ham and prime rib, and the usual breads, bacon, sausage, etc.  Just about everything is competently prepared from quality ingredients, except the prime rib (about as bad as it gets - tough and flavorless) and the desserts (uninspired).

Still, for a buffet, the number of hits vs. misses was high, the service was as good as it gets, and the physical setting is beautiful.  This brunch is definitely for special occasions but I would return, forget about the price, and enjoy being.",2014-06-16 14:31:48

Our reservation for six was welcomed immediately upon arrival, but the first thing I noticed was how extremely hot it was inside!  The interior will never leave you thinking you are in an Italian restaurant, but that's ok, except for the fact that the eclectic seating will leave you bummed if you end up with the metal chair!  Every fourth or fifth seat is a hard metal chair as opposed to the nicer cushion seating everyone else is enjoying!

The food is fantastic here, with homemade sourdough loafs and handmade pastas, the attention to that detail is superb!  The Rigatoni Carbonara is such a nice dish with a richness that of course accompanied a heaviness!  Perhaps a shareable dish due to that?  The simplest of dishes, spaghetti and meatballs, was elevated to a nice dish due to some quality meatballs and the handmade pasta!  You can't go wrong with appetizers of the Cauliflower and sourdough loaf with its butter or anchovy spreads!  The cauliflower is apparently the house favorite as it seemed every table ordered it while I was there.

As I mentioned before, the extreme heat inside definitely took away from the experience as you just couldn't get passed it!  Multiple people in the small dining room were actually fanning themselves, and several were using their napkins to blot themselves which I find unacceptable!  The food at Esther's Kitchen though certainly speaks for itself!

An update to the hot dining room issue.  The management reached out to me to apologize for the AC issue.  The explanation was that it might be undersized for the restaurant.  I find this to be a honorable gesture to reach out as most do not!  Again, the food speaks for itself!",2018-07-11 16:22:35

(3.5 STARS)

I frequent Cafe Bernate regularly and it never disappoints. In the summer, their back patio provides a quiet space away from the traffic of Queen West. 

I usually get their combo which rotates a random sandwich with their soup of the day or a salad. Their sandwich offerings are so extensive that I don't think I've ever had the same thing twice! Most recently, I had their curried chicken in a mayo base with apples and pears and wrapped in a whole wheat pita. This has become my favourite sandwich they have now!

The soups are good but they ain't Ravi soups that's for sure! I know, unfair comparison, but when Ravi's is just down the street, it's hard not to. Once they got really creative with a yogurt-based blueberry soup, but it ended up being more like a porridge.

Togo's had a cult following like ""In And Out Burger"" and should have went nationwide like subway, but for some reason never did when they merged with another company.  I hear they are on their own now and starting to grow again which is exciting too see.

I stopped in today and ordered the number nine pastrami like old times.  The young man at the counter was very nice and made a very nice sandwich and I did not have to repeat myself over and over like in other places to get my special order just right. 

The sandwich brought back some great memories of a hot pastrami so delicious.   I love the way they now toast the bun, drain the water out of the Pastrami, and do any other special requests you have with a smile. The other nice thing is they still put a lot of Pastrami on it and  have deli mustard verses the standard generic mustard which is a must for me on a Pastrami sandwich.

Not many places even have pastrami sandwiches any longer unless you are fortunate enough to find a deli, so I am glad to have rediscovered Togo's.

Honestly, I hadn't looked at the reviews for a while when we finally decided to try out this place. I had been avoiding it, mainly b/c seeing $15 for entrees then $8 for sides was nothing that I wanted jump into right away. 

Regardless, on our way to Actors Theater we figured that we'd do a nice dinner. 

If you're looking for the standard run-of-the-mill class fare, stay away. In fact you're better off going to pizza hut across the street. If you want to push the edge of your comfort zone, you've found the right spot. 

Case in point, I went with the evening's special, which was not pasta, but rather long green beans doing their best impression of pasta - creative? Risky? Wacky? Yes, yes, yes! Delicious- absolutely. Especially the prosciutto based sauce.  The wife had the Orrechiette con salsiccia - very flavorful and fun. (in fact, picking at it this am it was even tastier). 

I also recommend the plate of fresh vegetables for an app. It seems to rotate, but last night's was solid - kale, butternut squash and fingerling potatoes all rocked. 

The downside was my meal was a little saltier than I'd prefer and the red sauce for the side of meatballs was a tinge ""bar-b-que""-esque. Not bad, just not expected. The meatballs themselves were solid. 

Yes, the wine list is Italian focused, so buck up and take a risk away from your suburban merlot (see Paul giammatti in sideways in fact) and live a little! In fact, I see similarities with the list from Cibo and no one is complaining about their's.

This place has probably the largest square footage of BL's furniture department Ive seen. So if you're looking for furniture check here first. Ive been shopping  all over the place so I recognize labels that major retailers carry, and wow they have it here at deep discounts. And did I mention everything is easy to find here..no packages look worn or torn up or out of place.  The aisles felt crowded though..that's about it. 

They even have an electronics section with mini laptops and tablets that are super affordable $99!! ..I bought one for Mr. B for the heck of it and it works great! 

Staff was friendly and helpful. The store manager was on the floor helping us out with questions I had on electronics.

This place is completely the real deal.  The reviews are legit, and well-earned.

I went in over the weekend to get my kitchen knives sharpened.  When I dropped them off, the guy at the counter said they would be returned in better condition than when they were new.  As if, I thought.  The set is 15 years old, I mean, let's be real, right?

Well, he didn't lie.  Not only are the blades sharper than I ever remember them to be, you can actually see the gorgeous edge they redefined.  Exceptionally impressive!  And as someone who loves to cook and relies on her tools, I appreciate the quality work.  I've never seen a better sharpening job.  Truly.

Second to this was the value.  The last time I had my knives sharpened, I paid twice the amount at Sur La Table.  They could up the price a bit, and I'd still go there.

And, as others have said, besides sharpening, they have a great selection of knives and chefs wear.

I had the 8 oz filet and it was perfect medium rare. Hubby had the NY Strip and that was perfect too. Sides were OK, mashed potato and roasted veg.

Overall, Brand was in line with other steak houses we have tried, good service, great food and high prices.

-The ""Leo"" : lox, eggs, onions and capers, opted for wheat toast instead of a bagel, and hashbrowns.  Peg's cook sure know how to cook the lox because it was just right.  Typically at other places, the lox are either overdone or undercooked.  Not at Peg's.

Most of the food is very good, better conceived and made than a lot of other area restaurants offer. Portions are fairly generous (not so much with brunch items), and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation. The staffing is good, service is timely, and the decor is charming. 

The craft beers made on site are wonderful. Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting. The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate.

For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp ceviche (technically a ""small plate"") and the stone oven pretzels (you get two, with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips). I've tried one soup, the corn and chicken chowder, which was very good, nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken. We've had sandwiches and entrees, from burgers to steak, and it's all been really delicious. The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style -- better than Houlihan's at the i-Hotel in our opinion.

The only bad experience we've had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert. It was badly prepared (the brie wasn't even room temperature) and either the recipe was off or the honey-chili sauce was made incorrectly, because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable. The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank, too. We took the brie home (a big piece) and cut off the rind to eat the middle later, but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke. We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was.  I wrote the general manager and he was good about it, offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef.

Super personality and very helpful.  My wife and I decided to stop in for small plates and drinks since we felt like going lighter before the evening got going.

My wife got one of the fizzes(Milano) and I ordered a glass of Pinot Gris which were fine.  The small plates we ordered where the Cheese Board and the Prosciutto Board.  The Cheese board was what we considered to be about average but the Prosciutto Board was an odd combination because it had a maple butter, a syrup on the meat and cornbread with it and the combination just didn't work at all.  Too much sweet and not enough to balance it out.    

Jose had said that they just changed that dish and it used to have a grilled bread as a side which would have been a better pairing.

From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. 

With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. 

In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. 

A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. 

The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   

Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. 

Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. 

While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.",2010-12-12 20:50:52

I think they stopped trying. I have only been going here recently because my friend loves cheap eats and happy hour pricing, She likes everything, I've never heard her complain about any place she's ever been.
I like the free Martini with movie ticket deal and the Lady's Blue Martini card, drinking for free is never a bad thing. The food is average.

However, do not let the niceness of it fool you; there are hidden things that seem to come out upon entering this place!

Palms place is located across from Palms (they share the same parking lot) the parking garage is off to the side of PP which kind of sucks when you don't want to valet you car and have to lug all your stuff with you.

Everything in the lobby is very modern and made me feel like I was in a swanky upstate hotel. For about 5.5 seconds this place rocked! That was until I walked up to the counter and had Chris check me in. See, I got an amazing deal from Hotwire for a couple of night that I could not pass up. Chris was not friendly or welcoming. He took my ID and the card that I reserved our suite on to confirm that I was in their system. He then went on to tell me that they charge a refundable $72.00 a day ""suite damage fee"" and on top of that they charge a non-refundable resort fee of $22.40 a day just to use their internet/pool and gym... ummmmm.... Yeah, the shock was all over my face but what was a girl to do! I just said okay charge away! Chris then handed me 2 free drink coupons to use at the Rojo lobby  bar or any casino bar on their property, and two wrist bands for the Palms pool party (he went on to say we could only attend  for an hour since the party was ending soon).

He then handed me our card key and told me that we were on the 50th floor overlooking the strip (sweet). Minh and I headed to the elevator banks but our friendly desk help neglected to tell us which elevator to take (there were six different ones to take) and yes we got on the wrong one and ended up on the wrong floor..

We finally figured it out that we had the private elevators. Elevators are clean and on the large side and they move fast! 

Our suite was beautiful with wooden floors and marble tile. Our balcony was nice but we could not enjoy it due it being locked and we did not have a key! Our view was indeed of the entire strip! The bathroom was oversized and had a bathtub/rain shower combo. 

Kitchen had a subzero fridge and above there was a mini bar.
Bed was super comfy and oversized too, our A/C was okay, turning it down meant that in the middle of the night we were freezing so we kept it on 70 the whole time! Three large plasma TV's in our suite: One in the living room, in the bedroom and in the bathroom. Had the typical cable channels. Our remote did not work very well, but Minh found an extra one, which worked!

The pool area was on the smaller side but was amazing! Plenty of places to sit and catch some rays! The music could have been better, but nonetheless it was do-able! The staff was so much nicer then the desk staff! Your were greeted when you picked up your towel and checked on by the cocktail staff. The pool was nice and cool which made taking a dip in nice! Hours kind of sucked they closed at 7:00pm bar closed at 5:30pm.

You can also check out late at this hotel at no addital charge (1:00pm check out). 
Nevertheless, you will have to go to the desk and check out, which is what I had to do and again deal with another unfriendly staff member! When I asked for a receipt, she just gave me a dirty look and handed it to me. Sorry I like to keep records of what I am being charged for or lack thereof!

The cons: My biggest complaint are the tortilla chips, I think they are San Pablo brand, the kind you pick up from Shamrock Foods(the hubs works there)....not bad chips but they are the same brand served at my school cafeteria. It just seems out of place in an establishment like this. 

The pros: Both times I have been here I have had the pork chili verde. The chili verde is served over two cheese enchiladas with a side of beans and saffron rice. They drizzle a chipotle cream sauce over the beans which is awesome. I found myself squeezing a taste of the beans and cream sauce with every bite I took. The chili verde itself has a little bit of spice too it, but the enchiladas compliment it nicely. The passion fruit sangria is very good. Good enough that I am pretty confident I could easily finish off a pitcher myself. A good blend of citrus, without being overly sweet.

I would recommend the shrimp rice for dim sum.. it's a really big portion for about $8. The tofu dessert is quite good for a large group at $4/bucket. Other dim sum are pretty standard. Radish cake is very nicely pan fried. Alot of the fried rice dishes are good too. The one thing I don't like is the steamed egg yolk bun - it's really runny and orangey-yellow with bits of duck egg yolk.

For dinner, I really like the complementary daikon/yellow bean soup! For dessert, they give tofu dessert (the best), black sesame dessert (slightly runny, but not too bad) or green/red bean. The green onion fried chicken and gai lan was pretty good - bit oily, but crisp and sweet.

The portion is quite allot so if you don't eat that much, a pasta entree can be share for two.

They also are served with a side of carrots.  It's a nice change from chips and I feel far superior and healthy after a handful of carrots.

I have also tried the cream of potato soup.  It was a little less creamy than I was expecting and I was hoping for more chunks of bacon and potato but the taste was lovely and it was just perfect on a cold winter day.

I've dined bere on two separate occasions months apart, but on both occasions I experienced the same amazing service and food with good people.

I called a few weeks ahead to set the reservation, and it only took a few minutes. 

Honestly, I couldn't tell you the exact names of what I've ordered, even if the names were right in front of me. The first time, my friends picked out the Lalibela Exclusive platter for us 3, and demolished it with additional amazing utensil-bread. The picture of it and presentation aren't terribly appealing, but dang it was delicious! So naturally this past time that's what I convinced two of the other gals to order with me. Unfortunately we didn't demolish it altogether since our appetites weren't that of 3 ""rabid hungry athletes"". Nonetheless, an amazing dinner. The ""spicy"" meats aren't terribly spicy (coming from a Midwesterner with a ""delicate palate""), there's a good amount of heat that comes from them though.

I called in my order at around 2:15p of Penne Romagno ($9.95) for dine-in since I hadn't had anything to eat since 11p the night before.  I arrived at DD's around 2:25 only to find that the cook had waited until my arrival to start on the dish- I spotted him cutting up the peppers and prosciutto and adding them to the pan.  The pasta was delivered to my table about ten minutes later.  I decided to try their sweet potato fries ($4.50), extra crispy, without the pancake syrup it normally is served with.  

I loved the penne dish!  Mind you, it didn't look as appetizing as it could have; I thought that the glistening prosciutto looked half-cooked.  One bite took care of that suspicion- it was delicious!  The feta cheese (some crumbled, some still sporting shape of the container it was shaped in) and roasted red peppers dressed the dish up a bit.  The SPF looked great, but wasn't as crispy as it looked, so in they went for a second frying.  Needless to say, they didn't look as delectable when they were brought back, but at least they were of the texture I was looking for.

I also tried their two-pizza slice and soda lunch special ($5, add. topping $0.50 each), with ricotta and roasted red peppers.  I did ask if they used corn in their pizza and was told no.  Not even on the bottom to make the pizzas slide easier out of the oven.  I don't know how I forgot to ask if they served thin-crust since it is my preferred choice, but I did, and sure enough, the slices that were brought to my table were more doughy than I cared for.  I thought perhaps the wider edge fo the pizza crust would at least deliver the crispiness I was looking for, but the crunch factor disappeared, no exaggeration, within two minutes or less from time of arrival.  The ricotta looked fantastic, and while the red peppers looked OK, they weren't roasted.  The marinara sauce used was good.  

DD's now serves Berto's gelato desserts (triangular wedges of differing flavors, including chocolate hazelnut, cappucino crunch, white princess, and spumoni)!  Cheesecake flavors come in plain, strawberry- or raspberry topped, and oreo.  A server told me they're trying to convince management/pastry chef into baking a peanut butter cheesecake.  Sounds like a great plan to me!

Don't recall seeing a water fountain indoors during my first visit, but there certainly is one now.  The stuffed Easter bunnies adorning the feature (they've also invaded the women's restroom!) do not lend the restaurant a classy look, although I think it's a more casual atmosphere the owners are trying to achieve here.  Finding another way to advertise Sunday breakfasts and other specials, currently achieved by posting copy paper over the green window shutters and any wall space available, would do wonders for the ambience.

He said it didn't bother him since he is taller, but I think he may have just been trying to make me feel better. 

We decided to start with the cheese plate which was tasty, but never comes with enough crostinis so I had to ask for some more, which is not a big deal except for the fact that within a minute of bringing them out, our entrees arrived. This is a big pet peeve of mine at a restaurant. I order an appetizer to enjoy before my meal arrives. I don't like to be interrupted halfway through with a big plate of food. Something always ends up getting pushed to the side and that feels like such a waste to me.

Both the hubs and I ordered the skillet chicken and found it to be pretty tasty, though I would have liked to see a little more seasoning in the skin. The mashed potatoes were my favorite part.

But seriously... if I'm paying for double meat, please load me up.  It's seriously all I get.  I don't get rice... I don't get beans... I don't even want a tortilla... I want veggies & MEAT.  I've given up on ordering guacamole also because it's been this sad little dollop of avocado paste.  What happened to the glorious days of fair portions??

I used to love this Chipotle... but the workers seem so out of touch with their customers.  Please get it together so I can give you my money.",2015-01-22 05:34:04

They also do a mobile stand, so maybe the address on here is the owner's home address, because it looks like a residential address.
This place is great.  My boss is from Tucson and kept telling me I have to try Sonoran dogs.  I work in the southwest valley and many people at my accounts tell me about their family members that sell delicious Sonoran dogs from their mobile carts at night.  Well I work during the day, so those wouldn't work for me until one of my accounts told me one of the about the best Sonoran dog cart that also has a store on 83rd and Indian School.  
I paid them a visit and discovered the most delicious hot dog ever.  A Sonoran dog is a hot dog wrapped in bacon, fried and placed in a bollilo roll and then covered in goodness.  There's ketchup, mustard, beans, tomatoes, onions, and probably more delicious goodness I can't remember.  It sounds overwhelming, but they are sooooo tasty.  $3 for one or they were having a special $5 for two.  I just got one and a bottle of coke and I was full.  
They restaurant is small and not fancy.  You order at the counter and there are a few tables inside and a few tables outside to eat at.  The woman who took my order was friendly and bilingual.  They take cash and cards.  If you are looking for authentic Sonoran dogs, this would be the place.",2012-01-16 15:53:26

Of course what pizza joint doesn't have mozzarella, but here they also have Gorgonzola, asiago, and others. The staff was really nice, explaining the process to us. It was a good experience.

Make no mistake, this is primarily a Korean market for food, not just random junk.  From the ""green (environmentally-friendly) rice"" to the skin care masks in the front of the store to the vegetable labels written in Korean, Paldo is an excellent place to make your own Korean food.

I was ready to walk into the market and bust out in Korean conversation, ready for a bubbly Korean person to engage me in wonderful talks about how great the Korean culture and food are.  Unfortunately, that did not happen. I strolled up and down the aisles, bought some prepared food, and did not even venture to bother the women cooking.  Maybe the cold, rainy morning reflected into their moods.  Either way, we didn't talk to each other.

The prepared foods are generally $4-8, but they are meant to be side dishes for families, not just for individual snacks.  You could buy already marinated kalbi ribs and bulgogi barbecue beef.  I noticed how fresh the rice cakes are - none of this hardened noodle stuff.  The produce section was filled with extremely fresh vegetables.  There is also a little place to order food in the market, and most of those dishes run from around $6-9.

I bought some kimbap (sort of like a Korean hand roll) and it was good (in the fact that it was made for me) but not the best.  I am used to kimbap with bulgogi and spinach in it - this kimbap was the kind with imitation crab meat.  It was alright.

I would recommend this market if you want a clean market for East Asian food.  It is an awesome Korean market, and I never felt bad for strolling the aisles.  In fact, I will probably go there later today on my way back to Tucson.  Honestly, there are some places that have a larger Korean selection, but you have no idea how long something has been sitting on the shelf!  Go here for fresh Korean ingredients!

I chose to go to Chinato for restaurant week because I hadn't eaten a full dinner there but I'd been hearing so much buzz, I just had to try it!  I was not disappointed - even at Restaurant week where some of the restaurants feel like they can lower their game and still keep people happy (not true...but it seems like a common excuse).  

I ordered the gnocci in a mushroom sauce, the pork piccata and the only desert option - the cheesecake.  I was very happy with all of my choices.  The gnocci was a sweet potato fluffy little ball that paired well with the miso-like mushroom sauce.  The pork was a bit salty (hard not to be with a handful of capers), but very flavorful, well cooked and it seemed like an ample size.  Lastly, the desert was citrusy, smooth and deliciously placed on top of a little sugar cookie.  

Overall I was very happy with my choices.  Some other people at the table chose the shrimp which though everyone claimed to be delicious, was a much smaller portion so they all finished in lighting speed next to us.  

I was extremely happy with my food, and I'll admit - from my previous Restaurant Week experiences, I've not always been (cough, cough...Lola).  Our services was great and I'm only docking them because I had to ask for water twice (I did say the pork was salty, didn't I?).

Honestly had we came 15 mins later we would've had to wait in line. The line this morning wasn't too bad, maybe because it's Saturday so no brunch menu and the weather was so chilly. Yes, much to my dismay brunch is only offered on Sundays (goodbye egg Benny's and french toast). However, they do offer their excellent mains, i.e. chicken waffles, and breakfast menu every single day.

Food- 3/5. I think I'm getting pickier with brunch foods. Normally I would've rated the food here at least 4/5, but after having brunch at Insomnia just a block east and getting into a healthier craze lately, I could only give 3 stars. I'm disappointed with the scarcity of vegetarian and vegan friendly options here. WBK is a cozier, less franchised version of American comfort food, like Denny's. So, lots of meat, waffles, fried potatoes, and grease. Interestingly there's not a lot of egg breakfast options and definitely no seafood. For a pescatarian this was devastating.

I ordered their only vegan main - the vegetable curry, which contained raisins, onion, tomatoes, celery, big almonds, etc and came with loose rice and a papadum. Flavor-wise, it was delicious! Not spicy at all and not super strongly seasoned as ethnic curries can be, but very nourishing and vegetable-heavy, which is amazing inside this establishment of greasy bacon and fries. 

My friends ordered the classic breakfast platter of 4 choices and the chicken and waffles, which comes with one sauce of choice (+$2 for extra sauces), which was gigantic and according to them the chicken was perfectly fried. The fried potato slices in the breakfast platter was such a perfect balance between crispy and chewy - highly recommend! Her fried eggs were really greasy though and the salad greens were really boring, literally just leaves and dressing.

Sad, limited dessert options. Come here for the savory and oily, not for sweets.

Value- 3.5/5. Moderately pricy for breakfast with entrees around $15-20, but big portions.

Service- 4/5. Very nice servers, but food took 20 minutes to come... So slow!

The atmosphere is country casual. Used to have a large amount of upscale biker traffic but now appears to more family or locals.

My wife went for a Salad that was served in a Taco Shell and topped with grilled chicken. I have a pork platter with BBQ Beans and Fries as sides.

Both were delicious.

This is a satelite location of the parent location in Mooresville.  They do a great job and I would recommend to anyone traveling through who is willng to take a few minutes and find the  location since they are a bit off of the beaten path.",2014-08-16 03:19:54

We got there a bit after 8 on a Saturday night and had to wait about 45 minutes to get in. No problem, I anticipated this based on other reviews so we went to a nearby bar (when you're in Park Road it's easy to have multiple stops) until we got a text that they were ready for us. The hostess recommended we sit at the bar for our first visit so that we could watch them create the cocktails and be part of the action. I'm so glad we did because everyone who works there is incredibly friendly and welcoming. You can tell they really want to create an atmosphere where you want to become a regular. Everyone introduces themselves and asks for your name and asks about your experience. Multiple different people will check on you, including the owner who works behind the bar himself. I really cannot commend them enough on establishing such great rapport with their patrons.

Now, onto the drinks. DAMN. You can get a good cocktail at a few different places in Queen City but this was really remarkable. I started with a bourbon drink with some honey and citrus which was delicious. My second drink was the kicker, though. Rum with grilled pineapple blended in and freshly shaved nutmeg on top. My jaw legitimately dropped after the first sip and the owner cracked up because he watched me lose my mind over it. It was simply delectable. 

As for atmosphere - it's refreshing not to have any screens or distractions. It's decorated simply with class. It does get loud but only because everyone is chatting; the music is kept pretty low. I definitely saw a few men in blue jeans that I'm not positive fit the dress code, so it's hard to say how that plays out when someone doesn't fully ""comply."" It is definitely a place to kick back and enjoy yourself - not to get plastered and rowdy.

The great thing about this menu is that you can get 1/2 sizes on the pasta - which allows you sample a few (or leave less full - I sample a few...) The Gnocchi is unreal. There's nothing better than some perfectly made pasta sitting in basil, butter, parmesan, garlic and tomato. On the Entree side - the Deconstructed Ribollita is truly wonderful.

When you walk in your eyes are immediately drawn to all the goodies in the bakery case. But we were here for lunch so we brought our attention back to that. We were seated in the dining room that was pretty empty, there were only 3 other parties. After scanning the menu we ordered the following to share: lumpia (crunchy pork eggrolls), pancit (rice noodles w/veggies & chicken that came w/puto-a sweet rice bread) & ginatang sitao kalabasa (string beans, squash & shrimp sauteed in coconut milk w/rice). The lumpia was amazing, so yummy! The pancit was delicious as well, great flavor. The veggie dish was my least favorite, however my mom loved it. Oh I also did not care for the puto. 

After we finished lunch we looked at all the treats again & decided to order some to go. I can't recall what my mom got but I got the following: cannoli, flan, cheese roll & siopao (steamed bbq bun). The cannoli was for my hubby & he enjoyed it. The flan was yummy but had a much thicker consistency than I am used to. I did not care for the cheese roll at all, I think if the cream cheese had some sugar added to it it would be much better. I had the siopao for lunch today & it was pretty good.

The BF and I went to try this place tonight as we had a deal from phoenix Voice. We were sat by the very nice bartender (but in the dining room). This restaurant is so cute! The decor is so classy looking and they really took the time to make the details nice, including the bathroom sinks, which were really nice looking. We got a pitcher of the white sangria, as it was half off and it was really good! Our waiter was very attentive... at least at first. He made a great suggestion for my dinner, the blue corn enchiladas... holy crap, it was sooo good! My only complaint was when I said I wanted to get just the one enchilada he was a little pushy on trying to get me to get the full dinner.... I wanted to make sure I had room for dessert, so I got the smaller plate, and despite his pushing, I was glad I did because it was the perfect amount for me... no need to spend an extra 4$ on food I couldn't eat. I know he wasn't trying to be pushy, it just came off that way a little. The BF got the burrito, which was just alright. Nothing like my enchilada. Whoa... the green sauce and the cheeses and chicken all blended together in amazing deliciousness. Please order this dish. super Yum. I also got a side of the guacummus.... genius! This stuff was so tasty and something I have never heard of anywhere else. So then we wanted to get the dessert I was saving room for (although there wasn't much saved) and asked for the waiter's suggestion. He suggested the tortilla pudding... which is what we were thinking about, but then remembered they ran out! Noooo!!! That was such a let down! We didn't end up getting dessert as that was what we really wanted. It was probably a good thing though.

 So finally we go to pay and they manager was unable to find my name on their Voice deals list at first... then the manager found it, but accidentally took it off of the table next to our's bill and charged my card for the remainder of their bill.... oops! It took awhile for anyone to come around, as it had gotten fairly busy and there was only one waiter. The manager was really good about fixing the problem, so that was nice.

We ended up having to wait another half an hour for our table, but grabbed some seats at the bar and had a drink while we waited. I had a white sangria, which wasn't too sweet and came garnished beautifully with different fruits. 

We ordered seven plates total, which ended up being too much for two people, but we just couldn't decide!

The tuna crudo was phenomenal, with so many contrasts of flavors. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The jamon iberico was also very good, although I don't know if I would pay the steep price for it again. I also enjoyed the sopressata and roasted peppers, but they didn't stand out as much as the other dishes we had. 

Next, we had the mushrooms, ribs, and octopus. These were all absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend them all. The mushrooms in particular were so rich, and the egg yolk mixed in with them added a depth of flavor and creaminess. The ribs were fall off the bone tender but crispy on the outside, with a really yummy sauce. I also loved the octopus - it was cooked perfectly and wasn't chewy at all.

I had been here over 10 years ago but never had a reason to return. My guy suggested that we go one weekend because he had been before. I remembered the last meal I had there very vaguely but I was pleasantly surprised. I first made a stop at the omelet station and chose the ingredients that the chef expertly turned into a mouthwatering dish. He flipped the omelet with finesse - a skill I'm still trying to develop. I also grabbed a piece of Belgian waffle which I topped with mini chocolate chips, strawberries, and maple syrup. I also had to get some bacon, a pile of smoked salmon (with a lemon wedge), and a some grilled vegetable salad. I also shared a creme brulee and rice pudding for dessert. The crunchy brulee top was lovely and I was very happy with it.
The coffee was the biggest disappointment...it tasted like it was very inexpensive.

It took FOREVER to get our food. So long that one member of our party had to leave as soon as it came. 
This was (seemingly at least) in no fault of our server however. She did check in on us frequently and let us know that it was coming, there was just a large party ahead of us.
We got our good and it was delicious.
I had the Salmon Spinach Enchiladas. It was wonderful very tasty. The chipotle cream sauce drizzled on top was soooo good!
I tasted my friend's Chicken Relleno, also very tasty, however hers was a bit on the dry side. She has had it before and said it was not usually as dry.
The only other issue I had with the food is that it wasn't hot It wasn't cold by any means, I just got the sense that it was left out for a while.

It was so quiet when we arrived that I was worried they were closed. Luckily they were opened with just a few customers at the bar. 

We ordered a round of drinks and appetizer plates that included: chicken quesadilla, ceviche and taquitos. The food was okay, nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about. 

However, the reason for my lower review is due to the service and lack of urgency or attentiveness. If this location was incredibly busy or understaffed, we would understand why it was slower or harder for our waitress to keep up on our orders or requests. The unfortunate thing is it wasn't busy. It took a very long time to order, receive our food and drinks. At one point we gave our card in advance to pay but she didn't check on us in a while to ask for extra orders, give the check or even run the card.

I swung by for lunch on Saturday to grab two salads to go. My biggest complaint (which is a good thing for the business) is the line. There seems to always be a long line. This day was no different. The line was right at the door and was about a 15-20 minute wait. Kinda a bummer when you are just trying to get food to go.

The salad topping chooses are abundant. They also don't skimp on toppings...for example, a half an avocado is a serving! In the past, I have tried many of their salads, including some of the hot grain ones. However, this time I just opted to create my own. One of the salads, we got the Mexican Goddess dressing. It is a spicy avocado based dressing that was great. The other salad had the 5 Flavor Asian. Contrary to the name, this dressing was lacking a bit of flavor....ok, alot. 

The portion sizes are ginormous. If you are craving salads, you will get it here! My total with a drink came to about $22.

Our friend arrived at the restaurant first, so I was promptly seated when we arrived at Canyon Creek.

My first impression of Canyon Creek is a classy dine in restaurant with nice decor and comfortable seats.  The service we received at the restaurant was excellent throughout the evening, so that reinforced our first impression. 

After browsing the menu, we decided to order the $37 three course price fixe menu.  For my three courses, I ordered garden salad, steak for the main course and creme brule for dessert.  The wait for our food was not too long, and our salads came fairly soon after we placed our orders.

My garden salad was average.  I found the vinegar taste a little bit strong in the balsamic vinegarette dressing.  The salad came with the usual ingredients: lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onions etc. I ate the salad, although I would have preferred a lighter salad dressing.

My main course came soon after we finished our salads.  My order was a medium-well done steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables and I got exactly what I ordered.  A medium-well done steak with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  The steak was delicious and I thought the quality of meat for the steak was excellent.  Nothing special to add about the mash potatoes or the vegetables.  Everything was tasty and I cleaned out my plate.

There was a slightly longer wait between the main and the dessert but I didn't mind since I was feeling full and it gave me and my friend more time for conversations.

When the desserts came I was impressed by the high quality creme brule.  The hard icing on the creme brule was crisp and not too sweet and the filling inside was delicious.  Although I was still full from the steak I ate earlier, I ate the whole creme brule because it was very tasty.

Overall, I enjoyed excellent food and excellent service at Canyon Creek.  It's worth checking out if you're looking for a fine dining experience.

The Face Shop is a korean makeup store that is owned by LG and is highly popular not only within Korea but in all of Asia.  Asians have long been known to be far ahead of the game when it comes to fashion and makeup so you can expect to find some unique products at this store that isn't as well known on this side of the globe yet.  Also, korean packaging is always so DARN CUTE! The pricing is also super affordable, especially considering the great quality - yayyy!! :))))
  
There is already a location within Pacific Mall but it's a franchise (owned by someone else), whereas the one inside Fairview is actually owned by LG and the prices do seem a bit lower. It's also more accessible for public transit users (get off at Don Mills Subway Station and walk to Fairview Mall, 2nd Floor).  FYI they're currently holding a pretty awesome GRAND OPENING SALE.  Get $5 off a $15 purchase, $10 off a $25 purchase, and $15 off a $35 purchase.  I am not in any way affiliated with this company but have been using their products for about 5 years now.  I've received their products as souvenir gifts in the past from friends who had traveled to Korea, visited their store when I went to NYC, am a regular at the Pmall location, and also got the chance to check out the original locations when I spent some time in Korea 2 years ago. 

Really great products, obviously not comparable to the high end makeup/skincare brands (like La Mer or Dior), but it's definitely a game-changer in the mid to low price range products. Definitely worth a try considering the affordable price tags.  Just a few of the products that I use/have used and love (in no particular order):

* Volcanic Clay Nose Strip
* Herb Water Powder Mist
* Mild Papaya Peeling Gel
* Green Tea Lip & Eye Makeup Remover
* Herb Day Lip & Eye Remover
* Herb Day Cleansing Cream - Fruit Mix (smells amazing and gets the job done)
* Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam
* Fermented Raspberry Foam Cleanser
* Chia Seed Sebum Control Moisture Cream (works like MAGIC on my combination skin)
* Nail Polishes

My complaints this year are that this is ""A Taste of Charlotte""   I would think that it should focus on hometown restaurants ans services so what kills it for me is when they let the chains participate. 

But some of the chain names sound similar to local restaurant names...for instance, Mama Fu's is a chain but when I was at the festival, I confused them with Wan Fu.  Shame on me.  Oh well, I'll give them credit for the Chicken Curry Roll.  It's was very good.

Had some bacon wrapped Chicken and beans and rice from Brazas Brazillian restaurant and that was pretty good.

From another chain, I had a smoothie from smoothie king which cooled me down for a little while 

I was quite disappointed with the cupcake from Polka Dot baking company.  I'm glad I didn't go with them for my birthday party.  I could have done better at Harris Teeter.

The server was very friendly and generous in her offerings of samples.  She was patient in explaining how the system works which I appreciated.  

Ultimately, I got two entrees to go- rice bowls with Lamb meatballs,  paneer and chicken.  I tried each of the sauces as well as accompaniments and got a samosa to go.  Overall, it was decent.  It seemed like flavors might have been toned down a bit for American tastes.  Would've appreciate some stronger spices since that is what Indian food is known for.  Lamb meatballs were delicious and numerous. Chicken was a little bit overcooked.  I wish they were more generous with their rice. My wife and I finished the meal not quite full despite having the tasty and well made samosa.

The lunch menu was simple, and somewhat veg-friendly. The specialty sammiches looked awesome (Croque Monsieur, Thanksgiving Stack, other inventive plates), but there was no veg option. You do have the option of assembling your own - choose a bread, cheese, veggie, etc. Salads work the same way - a list of house special concoctions, or build your own. I opted for the soup and salad side of the day, both of which were good - french lentil salad with onions, maters, goat cheese garnish. Tomato bisque, while salty, was very flavorful. A little expensive at $5 for a mug of soup accompanied by captain's wafers, but the cheapness of the salad side offset that to end up at about $8 for my meal. Sammiches are in that same range, and come with chips or a choice from their tasty housemade salads and slaws.

The cost of this hotel was super cheap, especially for a weeknight ($60 a night), which was really awesome. We stayed on the 9th floor in a room with double queen beds. It was a really nice room- very spacious, pretty clean, nice shower, and large sink. I was happy to see there was a refrigerator in the room. My reasoning for 3 stars is that this hotel didn't have the amenities that most hotels do- no microwave in the room and no coffee in the room. They also did not have a phone number for the front desk on the phone in the room, which was very odd. If you need to call the front desk, you have to call from your cell phone. I didn't mind the fact that the hand soap, shampoo and body wash were in large containers on the wall- I thought that was actually pretty cool and less wasteful. I do wish they had lotion available, like mostly all other hotels do, as I forgot mine at home on this trip. The beds were really comfortable and the air conditioner worked great- we kept the room super cool, as it was around 100 degrees in Vegas at the time of our stay. The last negative of the room was the fact that there was a plastic bag over the smoke detector in our room when we arrived. It was obvious that someone had been smoking in the room and that no one from the hotel staff noticed the bag. Overall, it was an average experience.

To be fair, the reviews here are semi-accurate about the service -- IF you come when they're slammed. I think a lot of reviewers here are expecting way too much from a busy neighborhood bar. Go in on an off night, or at least not at prime taco time and it's a 180 difference. Moe is great! If you can be chill about an occasional wrong order and slower service, you won't be disappointed.

Here's what we ordered:
1. Banana bread- 
It has a brown sugar crust. It's delicate, and flavorful, and it has a brown sugar crust. Brown. Sugar. Crust. Order it.
2. Winkie (Twinkie)-
If you want to go vegan but can't bear to give up Hostess crap, now you don't have to! It's just like a Twinkie, only it doesn't contain beef fat and won't give you cancer.
3. Nami Cake (Ding Dong)
This is a rich, dark chocolate cupcake topped with chocolate ganache and filled with cream. Essentially, it's a Ding Dong, if the gas station suddenly became a patisserie. 
4. Chocolate chip cookie -
If you lean towards chewier cookies that are definitely on the sweet side, this is the cookie for you. Plus, they're huge and full of big chocolate chips, and everyone leans towards that.  
5. Mini cupcake -
The one we sampled was a vanilla almond, which I should like... but the sweetness totally outweighed the flavor. However, I think that ratio goes over well with most people, so hey.
6. Cake pops -
The chocolate cake pop covered in dark chocolate hit the spot. This was the most intense chocolate-y thing we ordered, which by the transitive property might make it the best thing? If you're a fan of chocolate, you're a fan of these. Millions of these.

Next time: I still need to try something from the coffee bar, which will undoubtedly be accompanied by banana bread... and probably a cake pop (I mean, I drove all the way out there...)

Apparently, they also do a Tsoynami called ""The Mash"", which is filled with random mashed up baked goods (I was only informed of this afterward.)

Cons: process. The wrong draft list was on our table. They have a number system for their beers, so a ""13"" was actually an ""18"" because an old list was floating out there. And because the person who got it drank about half before he said something, we were charged for the mistake. Food. It's just okay. Pretzels were so-so, nachos were just not good.

Images of a motorcycle rumbling and a blade scraping against a rain-slicked black street were conjured as we drove up to Katana late last week. Fortunately, the food, which includes Japanese, Chinese, and Thai fare, matched up to the visuals, for me at least. 

We opted for privacy and eschewed the hibachi spectacle for a quiet meal in the cool, calm back dining room. Beginning our meal was an appetizer of steamed dumplings that were soft as butter, meaty as a Porterhouse steak, and as moist as mid-morning summer grass. 

Unsure as to what I wanted, I went with dual starters for dinner: Godzilla rolls and Tuna Tartare. 

A quintet of deep-fried medallions enrobed in seaweed and filled with rice, whitefish, crabmeat, roe, and eel were plated before me and drizzled with some sort of orange sauce that recalled mayonnaise. To think that I had gotten bored with sushi. The batter provided for a crisp hide that steamed each roll's innards to delicate, delectable effect. The velvet, fluorescent dressing captured the eye and enhanced their vaguely sugary richness. It was county fair food by way of the Far East, and I could have destroyed another plate or two of it as easily as a giant, irradiated reptile would Tokyo. Roar, baby, roar, and unleash that atomic breath!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln8-Y-fIbqM

The Tuna Tartare was closer to elegantly cut and presented sashimi, but complain I will not for the fish was fresh, chilly, raw, oceanic ecstasy. No ginger or wasabi was necessary. 

Kay's fatty, paper-brittle Crispy Duck made me salivate, caused my stomach juices to roil, and turned my brown eyes green. I was grateful that she allowed be to finish so that I could testify to its simplistic, rotisserie-ish quality. Meat peeled from the bones, the skin became a snack in itself, and the thick, chocolatey oyster sauce became inapplicable as the duck was just too rich, toothsome, and well-prepared to be coated in condiments.

The initial person who asked what we wanted wasn't that friendly and didn't offer us a drink menu. After getting up and trying to figure out what beers were in the coolers, another bartender offered us menus. We were also served popcorn with a ranch seasoning while we waited at the bar. It was really good. Not greasy with a nice flavor. 

Once the rest of our group arrived, we moved to a table in the bar area (the upstairs was booked). The menu isn't extensive but everything we had was delicious. The consensus was that the buns for the sandwiches had to have been made at a local bakery- they were very fresh. Two people in our party had turkey burgers and they loved them. The side of the day was broccoli with a sweet chili sauce, which was a nice way to spice up broccoli. One couple shared fish tacos and raved about the seasoning on the fish.

Granted I was 10 minutes late due to my unfortunate East/West confusion, however, I didn't think my nail artist should have taken a walk-in who arrived after I had already sat down and apologized for my lateness. After waiting an additional 15 minutes for the walk-in, my nail artist proceeded to tell me that the manicure would in no way last 4 days until the wedding. I don't get my nails done professionally very often, however, I find it hard to believe that anyone would pay for a service that does not last at least 5 days or more.  Unfortunately, this was my only free day in a very busy week to have the manicure done, so the artist used an extra top coat, spray, and UV heater to set the nails.

The next morning, I noticed the polish had dulled and had a fabric grid mark from my bedsheets had set into the polish. Considering I went to sleep 5-6 hours after the appointment, and with the extra care to set the nails, I was very disappointed in my manicure and eventually had to apologize to the bride.

We got a 5:30 reservation on Friday night and when we showed up we were greeted with italian warmth by the manager. It seems like the entire staff has been imported from italy given the authentic italian accent they all spoke which was music to our ears since we just returned from a vacation in Italy. They have a nice variety on the menu with cold dishes, tapas style bites, pizza, pasta and mains. We opted for the following dishes although I must admit I found a lot of potentially appealing plates on their menu - well, something to come back to I guess for next time !

Foccacia with mushroom and truffle - This was a small bite that packed a lot of punch. Three portions seemed exorbitantly expensive for the price we paid ($15)

Double stuffed ravioli with basil and cherry tomatoes - This was a pleasant surprise. one side of the ravioli was filled with basil mousse and the other end was the gooey cherry tomato. The two sides were fused together creating a nice color contrast with a delicious dollop of parmesan fondue sitting in between. Apparently, our server was keen for feedback since we were one of the first customers to try out this dish. We loved this dish, it wasn't overly rich as we were expecting.

Olive oil poached Halibut with chicken broth and mushrooms -  This was a solid dish although not something I would crave to go back for. The fish was well cooked but the swiss chard pesto did not impart enough flavor for me to make this dish great. The mushrooms were pickled in some kind of vinegar which added a good kick to the bite. 

Deconstructed panna cotta with strawberry - This was the most pleasant surprise and a great way to finish off the meal. The manager even came down to our table and asked us about our entire meal. 

Service here is top notch and the chef really cares about quality by sourcing all his products from local farmers. My only complaint would be the price/portion ratio, it quickly adds up to your bill if you are hungry. I don't mind paying for a good dinner but some of the dishes just seemed way too exorbitantly priced. For instance - prices for the pizza were north of $20.

Thankful I was with someone who is a regular, and who knew how to navigate us through the delicious menu. (Although, I didn't need much guidance as I had been eying their beef short rib stew since I first peeked at their online menu).

We started first with appetizers, and had a great sample of what they offered: the rock shrimp and the pretzel & fondue were amazing.  I couldn't stop eating the pretzel & fondue -- I was afraid I wouldn't have enough room in my tummy for my meal... but of course I would.  And I almost did. The beef stew was so delicious, and even though I was kind of weirded out by the friend egg on top (I know foodies die for that stuff), I gobbled up almost every morsel until my tummy just couldn't hold any more.

And throughout it all, I was sucking on one of their specialty cocktails recommended to me by a coworker -- The Polish Fix.  It was quite good, but very strong, and I was feeling it even with all the food I was eating.

All in all, a great treat for my senses. It is in a great location -- right on the corner of 2nd St. & Jefferson, and if you chose to eat outside in the cooler months, or inside facing the wall of windows, you'll be guaranteed a great people watching opportunity.

  The focal point of Charlie Frias Park is the natural bluffs and adjacent mini ecosystem. The bluffs are more than eye candy. They are the habitat for feral cats. In Charlie Frias Park cats enjoy the great outdoors where dogs enjoy the enclosed spaces of the dog park. The bluffs also separate the lower and upper park. The majority of the lower park is the open grassy spaces looped by a 2/3 mile walking path. The grass ranges from golf course green to soggy. The grass is ideal for a diverse range of activities including soccer and flying a kite. However a posted sign prohibits golf. From the lower park, there is a neat view blending in the Orleans with the Strip. The main view is the natural bluffs. The park drive parallel to Decatur Boulevard connects the lower and upper park. The upper park features a state-of-the-art playground, dog park, and overlook affording a unique perspective of the bluffs. 

  Normally when I spend time in a park, I would be walking on sunshine. Not at Charlie Frias Park. A nice way to put it is that an element of individuals in the immediate area were walking on moonshine. This past Saturday when I walked from the Panda Express a block east off Tropicana to the park and later drove in the Home Depot parking lot, I passed far too many shady characters. Inside the park, it was relatively desolate. As far as security, there was zilch. My instincts told me that if I crossed paths with the bad guy that I would be very vulnerable. Normally when I spend time in a park, my mind goes on vacation. Not here. I was very alert.

  For the most part, Charlie Frias Park has made the crossroads of Tropicana at Decatur a better place. I give the park a high score on being relatively graffiti free. The one graffiti tag I laid my eyes on was at the overlook bench. Prior to October 2012, when the County developed Charlie Frias Park, graffiti obliberated the bluffs. Today this graffiti is gone. The park also provides open space along Tropicana Avenue separating transient land-uses (hotels and short-stay apartments) from local communities.

  I am a park lover. I am glad to have spent time in this relatively new park. However, it is not my favorite and I don't plan on going out of my way to return here in the near future.",2013-11-20 06:09:43

As a hotel, they get a lowly 2 Stars
As a restaurant, they get a 4 Stars
As a bar, they also get a nice 5 Stars
And as a Casino, they get 3 Stars

First we checked into the hotel late. After a long road trip, I wanted to go to the restroom before heading back out to get some dinner. The toilet was NOT bolted down properly and moved if you sat or bumped into it. The bathroom looked clean but very low budget. The tile was poorly installed but oh well, we're here to drink, eat and gamble in no particular order. As I went to wash my hands the faucet was also NOT bolted down correctly. The bedroom and the sink area were nicer and I must say the beds were very comfortable. They might have gotten a 3 if it had not been for the elevator that took 5 - 6 minutes to go down one floor. Every time you got in the elevator, you knew you may be rescued soon. One guy i bumped into inside the elevator said he comes about every two weeks and half the time it is out of service. 

We did leave the room and go to the Sterling Spoon Cafe. I was expecting their old favorites which were: a rack of ribs, a NY steak or a Sirloin for $9.99 but it has gone up to about $14. They did have a very good breakfast and midnight specials, which I love at Vegas. The food was very good in the Sterling Spoon so we went there for a couple more meals. The buffet did NOT look appetizing so we stayed with the SS.

I wanted to catch the ALCS and NLCS [go Royals since my Dodgers are done] and played a while at the small bar on the NW side of the property. They had a couple of great bar tenders that were fast, courteous and knew how to pour a drink. Met some great people from all parts of the world. Happy Birthday Mike from Sweden and great talk Joe from Costa Rica. This was the best part of the day and even won a little on the machines [before you lose it back somewhere else].

The casino was kind of slow. It was a Tuesday but I made my way over to the craps table and it was quiet. Some guy was losing his shirt and I recognized some of me in him so I stayed away. Played a little at the slots but I not a slots guy. I want to be at a craps table or a BlackJack table. It was a Tuesday again but no action, no real enticement to jump onto a table.

Overall, I like the Silver Sevens since it was Terribles. We go a lot more often to Buffalo Bills, Whiskey Pete's and Primm so the points help us get rooms and/or specials. Now that Terribles is gone,l they seem to be doing a little better. Its still a great value.",2014-10-16 08:08:03

Even still, when you did raise your prices to $4.99, it is still worth it.

Everyone got Manhattan's and they were delicious. This is a signature drink here and I highly recommend it. We had their cheese curd, fried pickles, and the chicken sliders for starters. The cheese curds were solid...some of the biggest curds I've ever had. The sliders were also delicious. I could have just ordered another for my main meal and been very happy. I was disappointed with the fried pickles though. It was clear they made these from scratch but the ""pickles"" tasted much more like cucumbers.

There was a plethora of entrees ordered - BBQ Brisket Mac and Cheese, Fish Fry, Short Rib Stroganoff, and their special that night...Prime Rib. There wasn't a single person who didn't immensely enjoy their meal. I would highly recommend all of these entrees.

The only other disappointment was I had been really looking forward to their Grasshopper dessert drink. However, they ran out of vanilla ice cream...on a Saturday at 7pm? Manager should have run out to a grocery store to pick up more...come on!

The child care has been pretty good although they could use some more toys/activities for the kids.

He has worked with me to get a plan in motion that I'm excited about.  If I could rate him separate from the gym he would have five stars.   My frustration lies with a couple of issues.  First, their billing is a little sketchy as with all gyms.  They marketed as $9.95 a month however you are paying upfront $40 fee to ""secure"" that price (way to sneak it in guys).  I'm mad at myself for not asking for this feature to be removed before signing my contract. I was just not thinking clearly in the moment. Secondly, I assumed they would charge my card immediately upon signing the contract. Instead, they immediately charged my card $10, then waited two weeks later to run the full month charges PLUS that silly price guarantee fee.  That caught me offguard and of course created an avalanche effect. Including $25 late fees.  Needless to say, this is why I hate giving anyone my personal credit card information. It is partly my fault for not getting clarity, however as a new client I would hope they would work with me and understand how this could be confusing.

I walked out happy, which means it was a success. 

The highlights? Plenty.

I made new friends. And hey, who doesn't like new partners in crime?

The decor was a great compliment to the night of sexy pretentiousness that preceded it. The couches were fairly comfortable. I loved the exposed brick, the low lighting, the fixtures, the movies, and the music. Speaking of music, songs from the Fugees album The Score were on frequently throughout the night making me want to listen to the whole album so badly that when I got back to my car I spent 10 minutes digging through my glove box to find my copy. I'm still listening to it today.

The service was pretty damn skippy from what I saw. I never had to get up to get my own drink thanks to my amazing friends, but I always seemed to get them quickly. 

The drinks I had were very well made. On the suggestion of the bartender I tried a White Rabbit and also had a lemon drop shot. I usually am put off by chocolate based drinks as I'm not a huge chocolate fan and they always taste fake, but the White Rabbit delivered. I could drink it in a gallon pitcher. With a big bendy straw. And an umbrella. The lemon drop was the best I've had. 

What do I wish was better?

I'd love to see Frambroise *and* Guinness on tap so I could have a red velvet made (my favorite beverage). The up side was I got a can of Guinness and a bottle of Frambroise and was able to make 2 of my own which also meant I could use the proportions i like (30% Frambroise, 70% Guinness).

When you come in, it is pretty dark everywhere, the lounge is on your left (this is where the Happy Hour is) we asked for a table for 4 people and were sat right away. Tonight, there was a band playing, Jazz music I believe (very nice!).
Kara, our waitress was very professional and nice. She made sure we had everything we needed, water, bread (their bread is delicious! I'm French, I know a bit about good bread..) wine, food. We even asked her if we could change tables (our table was right next to the band, a little too loud for us, you know, we love to talk!) 
The prices on Happy Hour are really reasonable, we were very happy to hear that they started doing happy hour all night long everyday of the week (but Friday & Saturday) during the whole summer! That's a good news!
I tried the Ahi Tuna Appetizer and it was one of the best Ahi Tuna I have ever eaten. They added curry and sesame oil in the tuna (such a nice touch!) there was also mango, grapefruit, avocado and orange in the plate. A very tasty appetizer!

I'm not that familiar with the south hills because I'm a city kid. I don't venture outside unless I have reason to. A friend invited me out that way for dinner here knowing how much I enjoy Chinese food and she said she just knew I would like it. Boy was she right.

Silk Road is located in the heart of Caste Village in Whitehall (which that itself I need to explore more). It's modestly decorated and basically looks like your run of the mill sit down Chinese restaurant.

Every time I go to Silk Road I order the following:

Appetizer: Spicy Wontons. I was turned onto the spicy wonton at Silk Road and have been loving them ever since. It's the traditional wonton from your wonton soup with a spicy peanut sauce. I believe you get 8 of them for $6.

Snack: Egg roll. They probably have one of the best egg rolls ever.

Entire: Pineapple beef. I NEVER order a beef dish when I eat Chinese except for at Silk Road. The pineapple beef is probably THE best Chinese meal I've ever eaten. I feel horrible because I feel any description I give it will not to it justice. The portion is enormous so no matter how greedy I'm feeling there is always plenty to take home (side note: I always ask for extra rice)

Beer:
Obviously this is why you came here -- cue personal mental battle between Peach Ale and Hefewiezen (usually Peach wins).  For those who drink ""real"" beer, the 8th Street Ale or KiltLifter may be more to your liking.

Things started off on a positive note with some excellent guacamole (the one with the goat cheese) and chips... but -- and this is a pet peeve of mine -- when asked if we'd like some salsa too, we were charged $3 for a very small bowl of pretty bland salsa.
For my entree I had the ahi tuna, which was of very high quality. However, I felt it was so blandly prepared and sided -- and served with tortillas that looked to have come out of a bag from the grocery store -- that I just couldn't get excited about it.

Despite the hustle and bustle that connected the restaurant to Eaton Centre, and the open concept kitchen our stay still felt very intimate. Even with the construction going on out front, the restaurant itself was fairly easy to access. I ordered the Bannock Bannock which was their house-smoked salmon with onion, cumin and cream cheese. I love salt as much as salt bae, but man was the smoked salmon heavy on salt. It was beyond the taste of smoked, it was just bloat in a pita.

The moment we walked in my husband and I were greeted, shown a place to sit and from that point forward we had the best customer service and awesome food.  The sesame chicken was so good, not over or under cooked with just the right amount of sauce.  My husband had teriyaki chicken, something I am generally not a fan of but I tried it and really enjoyed it.  It tasted amazing as well and the chicken was cooked great.  I love egg rolls but I'm really picky about them.  It seems I'm usually getting ones that are over cooked or so limp they're falling apart, these were perfect.

The location is something that I personally find charming but I understand why some folks are turned off. This is a tiny joint. It's a supermarket with the grill as part of it.

I had admired all the food pics and admired the inventive menu...could picture my five-star review.... couldn't wait for it!  Finally made it to the Cosmopolitan on Sunday night right after they opened, feeling clever that I knew to look for a pawn shop.  What I didn't know was, GO through it.  Don't expect a pawn shop employee to be helpful and tell you to go through the closed door when you say you're there for dinner. (Gal simply said ""okay"" when we said we were hoping to dine). Soooo...TIP: walk in the pawn shop, turn to your left and open the door.   (you're welcome!)

Fortunately we were greeted a little more warmly at the hostess stand, and brought to a small two-top just inside the dining room near the bar, which meant one of us had our back to the dining room. Not overly comfortable, especially considering the place was pretty empty. Now I'm not the most observant human being on the planet, but I couldn't help but notice one of my forks had a big glob of something clinging to it.  Pointed it out to our Server and he removed it with a ""sorry"", but didn't replace it.

We were fine with tap water.  Husband is a Bourbon guy, so he ordered: The Woodsman:  Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Allspice Dram, Maple Syrup, Lemon, Muddled Pears, while I went
with a Cabernet.  Both were quite good, which was a good thing as we were $33 committed at this point.

Two items I wanted to try after having seen all the pics were the tomato soup dumplings and the french onion ones.  Well they aren't doing the french onion ones anymore.  Wah!   But fortunately the tomato soup ones are still on the menu. That was a no-brainer must-try for me.  Surprisingly, Husband wanted us to try the Bone Marrow.  (surprising because he doesn't eat meat on bones, so I assumed he would never want to try the inside of bones).  And the Thai Shrimp sounded really good, so we decided to start with those three.

Loved that our Server asked if we were in any hurry or if he could put the dishes in to come out one at a time.  No hurry for us.  The moment I'd been waiting for arrived...the dumplings came out first.  Beautiful presentation on the soup spoons, but... a bit hard to eat.  After awkwardly throwing a whole one in my mouth, I got smart and cut the other two with a knife.  Never did taste the smoked bacon, but they were good.  $18 good?  Maybe? 

Somewhere around this point, the young guy pouring water managed to dump some in Husband's lap.  Oops.  Another ""sorry"".  

So, the Marrow arrives, and my silverware had been cleared after the dumplings.  I had to ask for more.  All of the components worked beautifully together...the jam, salt, and teeny bit of greens.  There was just enough for the six small pieces of grilled bread.  Good, but again...$19 good?

We were still eating the marrow when the shrimp arrived. Five beautiful shrimp, lightly battered, nice Thai flavor with a small salad underneath.  Slightly spicy.  Very good, but it didn't go with the marrow (remember, no hurry and one at a time?) and for $22...well...maybe worth it?

Ready for dessert, and knowing my obsession with fried dough, Husband ordered the Doughnuts for us.  We also each got a cup of decaf.  The doughnuts arrived before our coffee  (not the order we would have preferred).  They are round large doughnut holes with cinnamon sugar and three dipping sauces...chocolate, caramel and berry.  The caramel was both of our favorites.  We enjoyed it, but would have enjoyed it a lot more at half the $14 price.  Coffee was good and surprise-surprise not crazy expensive at $3.50 each.  Although we were not offered a 
refill.

Two more things that we weren't crazy about...no restrooms in the place.  Yes, I know that's not unusual for Vegas, but for a restaurant of this caliber?  And the other thing that got annoying was the repetitive spiel that the Servers all use.  Tables are close enough together so we couldn't help but hear them recommending how many dishes to order, etc. etc.  Good to be trained on the selling aspect, but more attention to detail like silverware, and caring if you've gotten a lap full of water might be important also.

Yes I realize this is Vegas and the Strip and the Cosmopolitan, and we expected high prices, have happily paid them in the past for celebrity chef experiences, but this time the experience, especially considering the service, didn't warrant them.   Which is why the 5-star review I was sure I was going to write, is a 3-star.  A-ok.",2017-10-29 23:57:53

We arrived at 6pm on Friday night and made sure to have a couple drinks before the 5-7pm half off happy hour (Monday-Friday!) was over. I ordered both the Red Sangria and White Sangria, but sadly just got two Red Sangrias. I was tempted to complain but didn't feel like bothering. I enjoyed the drinks and thought it was a good deal for $4 each.

We started with the Mushroom Saute. Wow! Delicioso! I could've eaten a huge bowl of this stuff. I absolutely love mushrooms and plantains, and the amazing, hearty sauce on this saute was to die for. Next, we split the Tropical Paella entree. The kitchen split our meal onto two different plates, which I thought was really nice. The portion size was enormous considering we both had a nice amount after splitting it in half. The paella was good, but personally, it had too much Caribbean spice for my taste. I definitely prefer a less spicy paella, like the dish you would get at nearby Mallorca in the South Side.

After an amazing appetizer and good dinner, we ordered the Chocolate Bread Pudding and were blown away! It was the perfect dessert after a hearty, Caribbean-style meal. The bread pudding was a great, bread-like (not mushy) texture and had the perfect balance of chocolate and bread.

I had a great time at Kaya and was not disappointed, even after waiting a couple years to finally try the restaurant. I look forward to going back very soon!",2012-12-15 03:02:29
Yleb9d9nKXkCXk11_5ed_g,Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,5,5,3,4,"Hobak Korean BBQ's rise in popularity in such a short timespan is well deserved.  I brought my family here during Hobak's opening weekend last month and we were not disappointed.   From the amicable and helpful staff, the retro-polished look of the restaurant, and the delicious assortment of BBQ, I would highly recommend this place.   

Upon arrival, the wait for a table was minuscule and we were offered one of two slushie type drinks while we waited.  This place is not an all-you-can-eat spot but you get a hefty portion of meat for the price you do pay.   Different combinations on the menu and various pricing will land your table meats which may include beef, pork, chicken, etc.   We did the mixed beef and pork option for two people and it was a carnivore's dream.

The accompanying side dishes were fairly good.  The kimchee was delicious as was the steamed egg.  We did have to ask for rice (which ended up being free of charge) as it was not initially served to us.  

The servers cook all your food right at your table in an encircled grill.  This was reminiscent to the NYC Korean BBQ spots I've tried though I do miss being able to cook the meat ourselves.  Like in NYC, I did see Yukhoe (seasoned raw beef with raw egg) offered and I'll have to order it next time to compare!  As far as I know, it's the only Korean place I know that serves this.

Dessert was included in the food option we chose which was ice cream sandwiched between rice popcorn-type rice cakes. It was great.

One more ""above and beyond"" service provided can be found in their bathrooms.  Mouthwash, packaged toothbrush and toothpaste, and mints can be found for those fighting the war on bad breath and cavities.  

Overall, Hobak is a great and welcome addition to the sea of Korean bbq spots opening all over the Vegas valley.  Unlike many others, though, Hobak is making a convincing argument of who really is the best Korean bbq spot in town.

I ordered Gyoza and Shrimp Pad Thai (spicy), plus a glass of ice water. They offer 4 heat levels. She saw that I was yelping so she gave me a free Thai Iced Tea. Good start. 

They had two TVs but only one was on. It was playing esoteric type MTV. Kinda weird. Artfully set tables, with black and white napkins holding silverware, not plastic. Nice ambiance for a strip mall restaurant. 

My app arrived in 6 mins. The 5 Gyoza were steamed and pan fried, just how I like them. The sauce was very rich with tamarind. The presentation was excellent and even had an orchid blossom. Very good app. 

My Shrimp Pad Thai arrived about five minutes later.   It had 8 large Shrimp that were plump and juicy, tender egg noodles plus some wide egg noodles for presentation. Bean sprouts were found within, along with garnishes of crushed peanuts, scallions, egg and cilantro. The heat level was appropriate. It was a bit expensive but there was plenty of food for two peeps, so it was a good bargain. 

The guy next to me tipped his bowl up to get the last drop, so that must've been tasty!  As I dined, 8 more groups came in, so it was steady. 

Very good service tonight and I couldn't really find anything that went wrong!

I recommend Arroy Thai for a very satisfying meal.",2017-02-16 14:03:40

Shame he didn't realize I get email notifiers.

In response to his stupidity, I think we can all see why West Island STM is much inferior to city STM. The man admitted that he cannot even pack his lunches so he stops the bus during his route. For those of you that don't know, the 217 has 1 terminus right next to a family-like subway and a convenience store and the other one right next to a huge mall yet he feels the need to stop the bus half-way through the round while all the clients wait for him like dogs in a car.

Now for my immature rant at a moron (Mitch. L.): Congratulations on a less than 30$ an hour career ""dude"". I'm in Software Engineering in Concordia. As soon as I finish my degree my hourly wage will be more than what you can get after 15 years of driving that taco around. Enjoy your sunchips while I enjoy 5-star restaurants!

EDIT: Reuploading the transgressions since my pictures were reported for ""Abuse"". Nice one STM drivers.




I'd like to excuse myself in advance for any vulgarity expressed in this review for my experience with the STM hasn't been the most pleasant.

Okay so first of all I'd like to say that this review is not addressed towards DOWNTOWN STM but WEST-ISLAND's STM WHICH IS THE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO­OOOOOOOOOOORSE PIECE OF SHIT SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD!

FIRST OF ALL, I'd like to talk about the 217 and the 425. During winter, for some reason, there is 1 chance out of 4 that they simply DO NOT pass. No, not that they are late by 5 minutes... they simply DO NOT COME. Once I waited for 2 425s in a row and a 217. NOBODY came and I just decided to go back home and skip class. I came late to work 3 times in 3 months because the 419 was not there and I ran to the 217 bus to get to work late. It's AWFUL.

Second of all, the drivers man... ha ha... Fuck. The 419 driver in the morning of Wednesday (12-11-13) who was not only late 10 minutes but also took the wrong turn following the 219 route and ended up doing a 15 minute detour to get to Fairview got me late for work. When I confronted him, he replied with ""Hey, it happens, what do you want me to do?"". Oh, I don't know. Maybeeeeeeee NOT READ THE JOURNAL WHILE YOU DRIVE. FUCKING RETARD. 

Believe I'm pulling this out of my ass, here, have a picture.
fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamai...

I complained to the STM by email. I simply got a big fat ""lol ok"" from them. This is what happens when you have the monopole of something.

I had bus drivers on numerous occasions that stopped in the middle of the fucking street to get something to eat at a dep! Thank you 217 bus driver for showing me that the STM sucks twice in a month. You're already late 9 minutes and you choose to stop randomly on a 1 lane road close enough to an intersection to incapacitate the circulation to buy yourself a can of Red Bull, a bag of Sunchips and a sandwich making me lose another 10 minutes then sit down at your seat for another 2 minutes to eat your fucking sandwich.

WTF! 

Here is a picture of the 217 driver that decided to STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF A 4-WAY INTERSECTION TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THE OTHER 217 DRIVER ABOUT BAD DRIVERS. HOLY SHIT PEOPLE. Are they like elementary school drop outs or something? They moved after getting honked for 2 minutes. A guy even got out of his SUV walking rapidly towards the bus.

The two main factors of why I came to Wvrst are its ""Game"" variety of meats and award-winning Duck Fat Fries. 

I enjoy trying new things, so I tried Kangaroo with sweet sautéed onions. From what I heard, Kangaroo meat is dry and it actually was dry when I tasted it. Although, it was still a decent-tasting hot dog. 

Would I go for another round of Kangaroo? Probably not. I kinda chose Kangaroo because it seemed really unique to eat and the fact that I could now say I ate Kangaroo.

The Duck Fat Fries tasted pretty good, but I expected the taste to be more outstanding due to its award-winning status.

Stopped by on a warm February afternoon and I have to say that This is some of the best ice cream in BE Ohio.  The setup is simple, a small free standing building that used to be the DQ many years ago before it moved across the street.  A bit funky, but just fine for a place to get ice cream.

The menu board has a long list of flavors, since it is February, a number of them are not available.  I did get to try the Caramel Cashew and the Belgium Dark Chocolate; both were excellent.  The ice cream is rich and thick with almost no added air so the ice cream started hard, but softened nicely as it warmed.  The Carmel Cashew starts with a nice smooth vanilla base and then adds lots of caramel and a fistful of cashews; not too sweet, with the nuts giving some crunch, this is really good.   The Belgium dark chocolate is about as chocolaty as can be made, just the right amount of sweet and a nice contrasting touch of bitterness.   Dark, smooth and rich this may be the best dark chocolate ice cream I have had.

Stopped here while on a trip to Charlotte after hearing it was a great wine bar. It's a very chill atmosphere where you can chose from a nice wine selection and relax. The bar itself is a long curvy piece of wood which adds a nice flavor to the bar. 

The bartender was very knowledgable on all their wines and gave pretty thorough explanations as to which wines from which countries he recommended. My wine was delicious and I definitely would have had a a few more if I didn't have to head out. They also had a pretty awesome looking desert menu that i unfortunately was too full to sample, but it's the perfect compliment to a nice glass of wine. The location is perfect as its right the middle of uptown Charlotte with easy access to everything else.

Seeing as this location was bigger and had more seating options I decided to pop in today. Upon entering the place looked very clean they had some high top tables, low tops and seating against the store window. Prices are fairly expensive. I decided to go for the chicken plate which came with fries, pita, slaw and shredded chicken. I had hoped that it was just a chicken breast as u dont see many greek places with shredded chicken off the pit. Reminded me alot of a shwarma joint. I am not a fan of slaw so i asked for extra fries which they were happy to accomodate. The plate plus a drink came out to $15. When i received my meal it came on a tray and you were able to grab mini hot sauce containers which i thought was a nice touch. The fries were fresh, pita was delicious but the chicken could use some work. I ate everything but the chickwn which was disappointing. It didnt really taste greek and I had wished I had gotten the souvlaki instead for $1.50 more. I would probably go back but definitely not for the shredded chicken. I would be interested in trying the dinner with rice and potatoes however its $18 which seems a little deep. I could get a better valued meal at jimmy the greek for $11. 

Glad I went but i wont be rushing back.",2018-01-28 01:52:59

A lot of my friends still go to places like the Keg and Moxies for steaks but they are not even on the same tier.

I always order a 16 oz filet mingon with peppercorn sauce on the side and it literally melts in my mouth. Their seafood platter is not as good as somewhere like La Castile but if comparing the only item I order and the service I much prefer Duncan House. 

The Ceaser Salad was also very tasty and made table side which is always nice.

Based on other reviews it seems what you order will directly dictate your experience so do yourself a favour and try the filet mignon of whatever size suits your appetite

Yes, you can probably season your steak better at home but here you get choice cuts and the peppercorn on the side truly makes the filet a delight.

To our delight we passed this place on the way home.  We used to LOVE eating at OTB back in CO.  But alas, this was no where near what we were used to.  We were seated right away, but the place wasn't busy.  Our waiter seemed to have great potential but that was just an illusion.  I got my food and it was wrong.  Waiter took it back immediately and brought it back out in about 10 min.  So, I sat there eating chips while the rest (5) of my party ate their dinner.  Yay!  Finally my meal is here.  But wait.  What is this?  It's wrong, yet again.  It's just enchiladas...how can you get these wrong...twice?  I didn't feel like messing with it so I ate it...with no enjoyment.  The food was horrible and bland.  This is not what I remembered from CO.  

Well, as we suck down our beverages the waiter HEISTS my brother's empty root beer glass for a refill.  Yes, he took it to refill it and NEVER brought it back until 20 min when something was said.  Then my husband and I wait for water refills which never came until we asked for it.  And my poor niece, wanting a strawberry lemonade...never got it...but we were charged for it.  Of course, the hubby made sure the $1.59 lemonade was removed.

We were all speechless.  Normally, we would've spoken to a manager but it was decided that we will NEVER come back to this place.  So, it wasn't worth the effort.

Overpriced/bland food, lousy waiter, and drink robbers!  No, sir.  You can keep this establishment for yourself.",2011-06-07 00:37:15

I got the Pulsar Light, Floatation Bath and then a Massage in that order, and though, I was super skeptical about the Pulsar, that had to be one of the best relaxation time ever! 

So the glasses were on, the music started playing, and after what seemed like 30 seconds the session was over. In fact I had gone into the deepest mode of relaxation in my life. Apparently it was more like 30 minutes and the attendent couldn't get me to stir, so my bf had to get me up which he said took an additional few minutes to do so! I felt so refreshed after that, it felt like I had rested for hours!

 Of the 3 I admittedly did not have an easy time in the floatation bath, but I think the experience for me was a bit strange. it took me quite some time to get used to it, and when I finally relaxed enough to let my mind go, I floated to a corner, and got a bit sketched out because my body floated to one side, and not sure if I was asleep or not, but It made me jumpy. After that I was too wound up again to relax.

The massage was heaven, I tried to stay conscious through out the massage but I think I was snoring (how embarassing) about 5 minutes into it. I have severe pain in my body due to arthritis and spondylitis, so I found that my body felt so great to have been worked on.

The staff was great, they were kind and accommodating.  The prices were really reasonable considering spa packages out there.

I'm sure my husband (along with all the others) really don't mind the show, and honestly, I'm not totally offended, its just not necessary. Showing my husband and I your cooch won't get you better tips, wrong venue for this. Even if I had the body for it, I would never be willing to wear their ""uniform"". 

I've been here before and noticed the skirts were low, dut I don't remember seeing so much butt flesh. Maybe I just wasn't paying as much attention?

Both the hubs and I ordered the fish and chips. We didn't notice until after our meal that Monday's (when we went) are all you can eat fish and chips. I guess that's why the server asked if we'd like another order of fish, but it wasn't made clear that it was a special. Partly our bad for not checking the specials, but also poor service for not informing your customers of the special. 

I wasn't overly impressed. The steak fries were decent, though not cooked enough for me. I like a little bit of crunch in my fries, not a mouth full of mush. I guess they thought they'd make up for it in my fish? My first piece of fish was SOOOOO overcooked that there was no resemblance of actual fish in about half of the piece. All the meat was so crispy, I seriously thought it was all breading - until I took a closer look. I could have complained and asked for another piece of fish... had we had anything that resembled service. 

I guess I would probably go back sometime to see if anything has changed (I enjoyed the chicken curry the last time I was there - ages ago)... but it's not high on my list of places to spend my hard earned money.",2013-07-22 19:43:17

I find this location to be better spaced than the Futureshop a block away. It almost feels like a location that can be found in the suburbs rather than a downtown store which generally lacks the square footage.

Prices can be cheaper online at other retailers but staff will generally price match. Staff here are easy to spot in their famous blue polo's.

Sure, we have a couple more theaters around town that show movies beyond the mainstream, but they lack the ambiance and intimate feel you come to expect from a film that is subtitled or doesn't feature a minimum number of explosions per minute.

With just 2 screens, you'll never fight a crowd (at least not like the multiplex) and I almost always have a pick of seats in the actual theater.  No reclining stadium style seats here, no raising arm rests to snuggle next to your date.  Nope, just a plan old school theater, and the character to match.

Sadly though, corporate America's tentacles have reached out here too.  Owned by Regal, concessions and tickets are priced exactly the same as the houses of Harry Potter and Transformers.  $10 for a ticket still does not feel right, but at leads I feel better knowing that I'm not underwriting some huge ad budget plumped up with product placements and licensing deals for every aspect of the film.  

Parking can seem like a premium at times, but remember there is another surface lot behind the building.  A little dark at night, but the surrounding neighborhood could not be safer.  It is also easier to get back out to the main street from the back lot, as you are not dodging the otherwise sardine tin of a parking mess out front.  

Do check out the info table near the exit doors.  Lots of free info for upcoming flicks and invitations to join the Charlotte Film Society, who sometimes screens their pics at the Manor.

Ambience : the interior of the restaurant hasn't changed much, they just opened the place up by removing one of the elevated dinning areas. 

Food: they have made a few updates to the menu, added some new apps, pasta dishes, and speciality poutines . We ordered the spicy roe mayonnaise poutine. For main, we ordered the braised nori scallop pasta, the beef carbaonara pasta. The food came fairly quickly. The spicy roe mayonnaise came steaming hot and had a perfect balance of saltiness. However, the poutine could do with more sauce, we found it a little dry near the end. The braised nori scallop pasta had an incredible presentation. However, the braised nori sauce did give the pasta a very fishy taste. The beef carbaonara is your typical tomato-beef pasta. 

Service: service was awful. We were greeted after standing for about 5 mins even though there were 3 servers, some just walking around. It appeared as though they didn't know what they were doing. When we were finally seated, we requested for a different table, but the server refused and forced us to sit in a very tight corner. They didn't really do anything other than serve us the food. 

Price: reasonable price for what we got. 

Overall, I think they have made some improvements to the food. But the servers were very rude.",2018-08-27 12:57:39

This is on the pricey side of Indian Food, but it's the food court and we were really craving some butter chicken. They give out free samples so you can figure out what you want before you buy. The butter chicken was actually very good - spicy, and the chicken was tender. Definitely wasn't feeling the tikka masala - it tasted super weird, almost like sweet and sour sauce or something. We opted for the roti roll, which is basically an Indian burrito - they'll put rice, your choice of curry, lettuce, cucumbers, a bunch of chutneys, and yogurt into a giant roti. They even had one of those Chipotle-esque tortilla heating presses to heat up the roti before they roll it. The first few bites were pretty good but the sauce kind of drips and accumulates into this soggy mess at the bottom and the roti roll got really old, really fast.

They have a pretty good selection of curries for a food court. Their roti was really floppy and kind of weak, and got soggy from the curry really fast. Their naan was very flat too - more like chipati than naan. The staff is super unenthusiastic, but what can you expect?

Overall roti roll came out to around 11.50 after tax, which was fine. You can also get a curry bowl, which is a large serving of curry and rice, for less than $10. Nothing stellar, but would probably come again if I was in the mall.",2013-07-21 18:16:51

They are open every weekend for $1.50 admission on Fridays and Saturdays and $2 on Sundays. The swap meet is huge. It took us a good two hours to walk the entire area and see as many of the booths as possible. There are tons of food options, including Mexican, BBQ and even a Chinese and Thai spot. 

They have a center stage that has live entertainment throughout the day and evening and there is plenty of seating to enjoy the music and a michelada while you're at it. 

As far as vendors, there are all the typical items you'll find at pretty much any other swap meet you encounter. We were a little disappointed in the lack of variety and the pricing tended to start on the higher side for most options, but oviously negotiating is the name of the game here.

The original korean fried chicken, on the other hand was really good.

#1) Get reservations. 
#2) Go for lunch or breakfast
#3) ask questions before ordering the first thing that calls to you.

I went after having read the menu and Yelp reviews but * in spite of reading the yelp reviews. I'll admit my expectations were low and it was better than I expected but to say I'd go back... eh. probably not. there are too many restaurants in town to say I'd go back. But my bf loves B.Flay and he was happy so thats all that matters.

APPETIZER: Queso fundido.. How can you go wrong with creamy ovenhot cheese w/ chips? We both agreed this was the best thing and star of the night. If I had it to do over again I'd have ordered 2 apps for my dinner.and called it a night. 

ENTREE: I ordered the 16 spice chicken mole. Really good but it had the skin on it which I never eat skin on chicken - and peeled it off, which also peels of the great 16 spice chicken ..but the mole was good. 
My bf ordered the pork tenderloin which so did the lady sitting next to us - literally I could have hit my neighbor @ the nxt table in the ribs without leaning over. YEP it was that close. 

SIDES: my bfs plate came with some kind of tamale - dry. I ordered the pumpkin spice tamale as a side: dry w/ too much star of anise. thats all I could taste. IT all sounds good in theory, but its not. I dont recall what else my bf ordered as a side... guess u could say it was forgettable. 

No drinks or dessert and tab was $110. Nope.. could have had 2 awesome dinners elsewhere for that price, not including tip to the waitress who was great.  Felt kinda bad for the staff b/c they looked like ants in a farm - everyone doing something so dillitgently but there's so many- they must rely on tips that or thats why the prices are so high. 

As I left couldnt help but wish I'd gone to one of the other restaurants in the Forum Shops. Hell, even Cheesecake factory tasted better. 
But I give 3 stars - one for service, one for creativity for different tasting dishes. and 2 for ambiance. but I take away for having to practially sit in my neighbors chair with him (now I know who they watch on tv and who they are fans of in the NFL and why their daughter doesnt want to finish college) 

TIP#4)Oh yeah and if you dont make ur reservation (must cancel by 3PM) and if u dont make it or dont cancel its $50 a person !!

TIP#5)if you are not a member of the caesars palace points thing - you have to give ur credit card info to even make that reservation so they can charge accordingly.  So its just as pricy to go as it is not to go.",2010-12-17 23:21:46

We came here for a birthday dinner with a group of 10 people. This restaurant apparently recently underwent some changes and menu revamp. We were seated at a long table in the back of the restaurant. It was in an area where they had private functions, had their own sitting area and bar. Our server was new and didn't know the wine list and couldn't answer any questions on the wine list. At one point the server left us to ponder the wine list but he took the wine list with him and we had nothing to at. He came back with information that he obtained from the bartender and gave minimal information on the wine questions. We ordered wine and various appetizers and entrees. We were given amuse bouche of potato au gratin. The braised beef poutine was baked and way over processed and tasted like salty gravy over fries. Crab cakes were tasty with nice accompaniments but the crab cakes seemed pre made. The nice cut of Berkshire porkchop was completely wasted. The cut was thick but undercooked. Two people ordered the porkchop and everyone left at least half on their plate it was unedible. The porkchop was crispy and slightly charred outside but rare as sashimi inside. Looks like someone blowtorched it to crisp it up after cooking. The Saturday special surf and turf was hangar steak with shrimp, basic and mediocre. One person had fries missing from their order of surf and turf. The only star of this meal was the scallops and pork belly. This was a very good interpretation of this duo with puréed curry cauliflower and pickled cauliflower and sunflower seeds on the side.

But a minute after, practically every office employee within a 1 mile radius was here! Not only physically, but also calling in their orders for them to pick up (smart decision).

As I was waiting in line and looking over the menu. I noticed Olivier was holding his phone with his gloves on. And from what I saw he touched some food immediately after. 

The first thing I put in my mouth was greens from the side salad that came with the sandwich. Unfortunately the greens were wilted, which was already a turn off.  

I ordered the tuna panini which was a pretty standard panini. The only thing is it wasn't left on the panini press long enough because the lines from the grill were really faint. I think since they were in a rush to get the food in and out of the kitchin quick, it wasn't left on the press long enough. And I really do like that toasty taste. 

I was more pleased with my other selections such as the shrimp bisque and the banana nut muffin.

Shrimp Bisque- very tasty, I've ordered lobster bisque at a classy restaurant and this was just as good. The 2 pieces of toasted baguette was a really nice touch.

1- Its local. Support your local business and PAHLEASE stop drinking corporate crap.
2- They take their coffee seriously. Have you seen the way they cold drip coffee? or how they delicately stir lattes? Yeah, get to it.
3- The vibe. LOVE the artsy interior and the fact they promote local artists by displaying their work through out the shop.
4- They have two central locations for your coffee addiction convenience. One in Tempe on University and Ash. The other on 5th avenue in Scottsdale. 
5- They both offer delicious pastries and the Scottsdale location has breakfast and lunch options and just recently expanded their counter space to offer scrumptious beers.

-the burgers. Seriously delicious, imaginative and well constructed burgers. Every time.
-the beer. Options! And real knowledge from the bartender! Like 10-15 on draft and a handful by the bottle.
-the liquor. Again, options! And fun specialty cocktails. And bartenders who know how to construct shots with more imagination than pouring cold jäger in a shot glass.
-the desserts. The brownie and ice cream is so good that I'm willing to throw my calorie counter out the window and devour the thing by myself, while growling at those trying to share with me. NO SHARING!
-the TVs. Lots of them! Playing all different sports! And different teams! Not just the same game on every tv. They switch on music videos after the games are over, later in the evening. I become completely mesmerized by this and will lose at pool because of it.
-the billiards:
---On Monday nights, it's $9 unlimited all night play. Other nights is $7/hour. You can see the value there. 
---the tables are beautifully maintained.
---the cues are straight and true. All in excellent condition.
---the pool tables are appropriately spaced from the walls and tables. You never have to worry about twisting yourself in some weird shape because you're too damn close to the wall to make your shot. 
-the bartenders. They care abut you and your beers. They will come out to you while you're playing pool to see if you need a fresh drink.

Had a good experience our first time. Went through the drive-thru. It was different. Three lanes. No speaker system or window. Instead someone comes out, takes your order, gets the food, takes payment, then you're on your way. Tried the 12 tender family meal. 12 tenders, a family side (we got fries), 4 rolls, and a large gravy, all for $19.99! That's got to be one of the best dinner deals around. Everything was good. Nothing mind blowing, but just a decent chicken meal. Chicken was fresh with thin crispy coating. Fries were crinkle fries. My husband wasn't keen on the creamy gravy (he's from the NE and just doesn't get gravy. lol.), but I liked it. We all loved those pillowy soft sweet yeast rolls.

However, it may be too much change or not very well executed: menu now boasts a selection of ""italian tapas"" which are basically an extension of their appetizer menu, most of which are $5 or $6 and discounted to $4 during a happy hour special of sorts, offered Mon-Fri 3-6PM.
Tried the polenta and shrimp dish- four shrimp atop a bed of polenta with a tomato and olive sauce, good value with four shrimp, but sauce was overly salty and unbalanced with many olives. Server apologetically revealed that the dish isn't going over well.

Though they're most known for their pasta dishes (and, okay, breadsticks), I usually just come here for their unlimited soup and salad lunch special: $7 for as much of either as I like, along with breadsticks. Good value, and good flavors- I usually stick with the zuppa toscana, but the chicken and gnocchi is good for something different. 

In addition to the tapas portion, OG now has a small menu of featured dishes that are ""healthy preparation""/lower-calorie than their typical pasta dishes. A few steps in the right direction, guys- now to work on the execution.

Additional note: never get a cappuccino here. It's not worth the $4. Drive through a Starbucks afterward if you must. You'll thank me later.",2014-08-17 03:05:15

How could you possibly give your future spouse a more awesome, meaningful, and unique ring than one you literally made from nothing with your bare hands? Short answer, you can't.

Literally no one in history EVER has the same ring as either of us. Just let how cool that is sink in for a minute.

When you enter you're greeted by a tantalizing display of baked goods, along with a chalkboard menu of coffee drinks. But you can also sit down for a light meal if you wish. 

When I told the hostess I wanted to have lunch, she reserved me a seat in the front window and directed me toward the counter at the back of the restaurant. Here, another chalkboard listed several sandwiches. But the one that I chose was the truite fume. There were also salads and side dishes. I ordered a salade verte to accompany my sandwich, then went to enjoy my seat at the window and wait for my lunch. 

The salad and sandwich both were generously sized. The sandwich was a truly delicious combination of smoked trout mixed with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, and red onions, and then layered between the two halves of a grilled white bread round with herbed cream cheese and fresh spinach leaves. The mixture of saltiness and smokiness balanced by the cream cheese was fantastic. 

The salad was equally fabulous. I'd expected a plain green salad but what I got was so much better, though still deliciously simple: a combination of watercress, parsley, and mâché covered with a lot of toasted slivered almonds and dressed with a light vinaigrette. 

Both dishes were wonderfully delectable--easily the best salad and sandwich I've had in a long time. Maybe ever. 

On the way out I couldn't resist getting a palmier to go. As I later discovered, this too was excellent. I'm used to palmier that are simply buttery and sweet, but this one went to the next level. The sugar had actually caramelized, coating the entire cookie in a slightly burnt caramel goodness.

Cafe Sanuki is the latest udon restaurant to hit Las Vegas and they're on the ""strip mall"" side of the plaza on the southeast corner of Spring Mountain and Decatur. They have a cafeteria line and manage to get both noodles and rice bowls ready quickly, and they have tempura and onigiri ready for consumption between the entree station and the register.

During my first visit, I had the Mentai cream udon ($8.80), a low/no-broth hot udon based on pollock roe. The udon was certainly creamy, but the noodles themselves were softer than I'd expected. The portion seemed a little on the small side, but perhaps that's a trick of using a bowl that's so enormous as to feel a bit unwieldy.

The second time around, I picked the Ontama Bukake udon ($6.45), which is served with broth on the side. The noodles seemed to stay just a bit more al dente without constant contact with the delicious broth (presented on the side). The egg was pretty nice, with liquid whites around that ""gelatinous"" semi-cooked yolk. The bowl was a bit less unwieldy, although it still has an odd lopsided shape.

I also had a Miso Garlic Pork Belly bowl ($3.95 mini size). It was a good side dish, but I kinda wish that the pork belly wasn't sliced so thinly. It wasn't as complex as chashu pork at various ramen places.

I also had tempura both times. I'm not 100% sure if they use the typical panko breading, but they did get a crispy texture, so I'm ok with that. The shrimp ($1.75) was pretty good, but the other one had soft rubbery texture reminiscent of improperly cooked calamari. Upon second visit, I realized that it was incorrectly labeled as chicken the first time. It probably really is calamari. I didn't try it again, instead opting for the pumpkin ($1.25), which is soft inside and reasonably crispy on the outside.

I also took advantage of the Yelp check-in offer both times for a drink (normally $2.25). I did try some of their teas and their Calpico (new on the 2nd visit), but I kept going back to their house lemonade, which is a surprisingly creamy and light take on the beverage. Fountain drinks, fruit syrups, and hot hojicha tea are also available.

I'd consider returning to Cafe Sanuki for a quick bite in the future. They're fast, and the food seems almost as delicious as more typical udon restaurants.",2018-01-14 00:22:25

I've gone here for decades, but less often in the recent years well, because...eating sweet breads ain't the best for my waistline.  Once in a while though, for breakfast/snack, it's ok!

Anyway, based on a recommendation of a friend/Yelp reviews, I found out that Akko makes Japanese cheesecakes as well.  A coupla weeks ago, I tried Love Me Sweet's (Markham) version.  And I have had a piece of Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake months ago.

Honestly, there wasn't much difference between Tetsu's Vs. LMS ($11, no limit).  Both were light, fluffy, slightly cheesy.  Tetsu has at least 2 flavours, while LMS has a coupla too, but the day/time I visited, there was only Original left.  I don't know how much Tetsu's is 'cause I refuse to stand in that crazyass line, then be limited as to the number of cakes I can buy.  All marketing hype, methinks, similar to when they pull out that velvet rope, and have some intimidating security guard outside a club!

Akko's version?  Only $7, no line whatsoever, although if they sell out, you may hafta wait for the second batch (what happened to me), only 1 flavour, same light 'n fluffy texture, BUT less sugary/cheesy.  I actually didn't taste any/much cheesy.

So the version you prefer really depends on your palate.  Honestly, I think this is more than a solid replacement if you can't, or like me, refuse to jump through hoops to experience Uncle Tetsu's!

However they can improve by having relaxing scent oils in the room. I've had massages before where this was part of the massage and not an extra charge which I imagine it was for Elements. Relaxing music would also be soothing. Also it would have been nice to have the massage table have a warmer setting and if it did I was not asked if I wanted it turned on.  Considering their prices I feel these perks could be added into the massage experience. 

I will be returning and I hope I can change it to a 5 star.",2018-03-19 04:40:26

They were actually, delicious!  Even more surprising was that the side of black beans was well spiced and delicious as well.
Just enough pineapple was added to the dish- fresh greens- great.
I would just knock off points for the sort of flavorless guacamole and the pale and tasteless diced tomato. I would also suggest that they use actual sized corn tortillas. The dish came with three VERY small corn tortillas. Enough for three small bites or two big ones- kind of silly to spend time making a fish taco on such a small tortilla. 
Just make them regular sized and fix the guacamole and this dish would be out of this world.
Also, the fish for the taco came out kind of cold- not warm or hot.

Still, the deconstructed fish taco was otherwise so well done that I will be back to try some more.

On the service tip, it did take a few minutes for my waitress to show up to explain things for me and take my drink order.  After placing my order, she directed me to the Library Room where the buffet was set up.  As you enter the room, the bar directly in front of you is home to the waffle station, the omelet station, and the self-serve juices.  To your right will be the buffet.

With the exception of the eggs, everything I had off of the buffet was fantastic.  I had a couple pieces of flatbread, some eggs, grits, biscuits & gravy, potatoes, and the piece de resistance, merengue waffles.  What was on the buffet that I didn't try: warm brie, two other types of flatbread, sausage, bacon, penne & sausage, rum-soaked pineapple, veggie quiche, hummus, orange-oreo cheesecake, muffins, and bread pudding.

As I mentioned, the eggs were the only disappointing item on the buffet.  Everything else I had was top-notch.  OJ and what appeared to apple juice are included in the cost of the buffet.

Later in the morning, the line for the buffet wrapped around the room to the omelet station.  Yet another reason why you want to get there early.

All entrees come with salad and bread sticks. Daily specials , early bird dinners discounts  available plus food delivery.
We ordered, chicken marsala, eggplant parmesan, and chicken Rizzo.
Breadsticks with sauce very good and also the salads.
My chicken marsala was fork tender. I was able to sub vegetable for the pasta.
Two of us ordered the eggplant.
 It was very good but just a tad on the greasy side.
The chicken Rizzo was good but our dining mate said  too much pasta and too little chicken in the dish for his liking.
Generally good portion size, plated nicely, food came out hot. Overall food was  very tasty.
Service was good.

Eating something green in Las Vegas should count for bonus points. The burger was pretty small for $20. The bun was tasty but was so soft that it basically collapsed in my hand. It was greasy, too. The beef and toppings were pretty tasty but really nothing noteworthy. We split an order of fries with garlic aioli. I was expecting a large plate with a light sauce, but we got was a very small plate of fries with a small cup of ketchup and a small cup of the aioli dip. Decent enough, but nothing great.

That sums up everything about La Gourmandine Bakery!  The delicacies in the case looked scrumptious, it's hard to choose one... so I choose two!  I bought the Délice de Pistache and Paris-Brest.  The Délice de Pistache is Choux dough covered with pistachio mousseline and topped with dark chocolate.  I had planned on only taking a bite.  That did not happen.  In fact, as soon as I took the first bite I was floating away towards the pearly gates of heaven!  It was just divine!  The Choux dough was light and almond tasting, the pistachio mousseline was fluffy and distinctly tasted of pistachio (I hate when fillings don't taste like what they should) and the chocolate just topped off my dessert decent!  

The Paris-Brest is Choux dough filled with hazelnut cream.  It actually looks almost like a doughnut.  It was the same heavenly taste!  They're actually very similar but different shapes.  The hazlenut again was distinct and the Choux dough was light with a slight crisp to it.  I would say my fave had to be the Délice de Pistache though.  But both were fantasmic!

And if you're buying fresh foods, it tends to be ridiculously inexpensive--even compared to the huge conglomerate supermarkets. Super cheap, super tasty apples? Sign me up. The meat is also usually a steal, too. On more than one occasion I've found their whole chickens to be cheaper than Fry's, even in spite of Fry's offering a two-for-one deal. And the Sprouts chickens were frou-frou free range/manicured/massaged birds. Craaaazy.

That being said, I'll totally agree with the comments about the service. Sprouts has a bad knack for putting people who don't give a shit on the butcher case. This doesn't work particularly well since climbing over the counter is frowned upon. Worse, even if you can get a disinterested slacker, chances are good they have no idea what they're doing.

one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items. When I had called to make the dinner reservation, I had asked and the hostess said, yes, we do have gluten-free items that are not just salads. Just let the server know when you come in.

excited to find another gluten-free place in town, my friends and I show up for the reservation. Upon arrival, the server was really nice and friendly. When we had asked about the gluten-free options, the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately, the only gluten-free items are salads. Which was a disppointment to us, as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that weren't salads on the menu.

So we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time, and it wasn't the server's fault that there wasn't any gluten-free items (we felt bad to just get up and leave). 

In reading the reviews, everyone thought very highly of the mac and cheese and poutine, we had ordered that to try. It wasn't bad, but not sure what the hype was about. Definitely pretty rich and filling and made for sharing!",2012-10-19 16:05:07

The servers seemed to pronounce it ""Kee-nah-toe"", and not with a ""Ch"", but whatever, don't let the first 5 letters fool you. This trendy restaurant sits in East 4th street, lined up alongside Lola and The Greenhouse Tavern, completing the Cleveland culinary dream team.

We called in for reservations at 5, left the car at the valet (all for 8 bucks with validation -- the public lots were charging $35 that night), and afterwards, crossed the street towards the Q arena for a Cavs game at 730 to watch our basketball dream team. It was a perfect night out just taking in the best of what Cleveland can offer; world-class fine dining and major league sports!

The group ordered cocktails, escargot (which seems to use the exact same recipe across all Zack Bruell restaurants), lobster crudo, skate wing, chicken legs saltimbocca, scallops with linguine. All were fresh, served hot, tasted pure and delicious. We spotted the owner Zack himself helping with the dish preparations. Considering it was game night, East 4th and all the restaurants were extremely packed and busy. In Chinato, service was quick, the staff were on their game, and hardly missed a beat.

The Cavs won against the Pacers that night, and so did my digestive system.

I can't vouch for the healthiness of frozen yogurt, or the Fruity Pebbles I'm throwing on top of it, but it has to be better than some of the other stuff I've been known to throw into my mouth after a meal.

Razzy Fresh is also incredibly clean. It's usually manned by one employee who does all the prep work and the cashiering.

The roll was decent, I mean it's hard to mess up something so basic, but it seemed like it was missing something... and the wasabi tasted watered down if that's even possible.

This coffee shop features local, Ohio brands and brews of coffee.  On top of that you can see and smell the beans to make your decision.

They have a wonderful assortment of pastries and sweets.  Around lunchtime their menu adds more choices from soups to sandwiches (I'm actually looking forward to trying their pulled pork the next time!).

Overall, GREAT coffee shop with local brews and some nice choices for food.  You can even buy T-shirts with Ohio styled logos on them that you just have to look at for yourself!  The downside?

One of the things that brought me in is the inclusion of a turkey dog on their menu (for those of us who don't eat beef, this is a rarity in a hot dog-themed place).  The menu freaked me out at first?  Pineapple on a hot dog?  Spicy mayo?  Coconut?

Speaking of John... he is one of the nicest restaurateurs I've ever met.  Odds are if he's there when you're there you'll find that out too.

With simple menu offerings from ice cream and sundaes, special creations, milkshakes and malts, you're sure to get your sugar fix on... and if you're in the mood for something savory, they offer a limited selection of salads, sandwiches, and burgers too.  I can't speak to the food offerings though.

I bought the tickets online and the screen was much smaller in person than it seemed on my computer so we had to swap the tickets once we arrived and the clerk at the ticket counter didn't understand and it took 20 Minutes to change.

For lunch my friend and I enjoyed the following dishes; Antipasti Grande, Diavola and the Costatine.

The Antipasti Grande is an antipastos dish with a variety of cheeses and meats. The waiter was well versed with the items on the plate and the time between ordering and receiving the dish was prompt. The dish was delicious but pricey at $26. 

The Diavola is a spicy meat pizza. Unfortunately the pizza was lukewarm and lacked in flavor. The price of the pizza was $17 and I expected a much more favorable pizza for this price.

Lastly we had the Costantine which is a pasta dish with beef. The dish was enjoyable but was a bit heavy on the salt and to light on the quantity. For $10-$15, I would give this a four or five star but not for $26. On a positive note, the service was exceptional as our server did split the portion into two smaller dishes for my friend and I to enjoy.

If I could give Mercatto a 3-1/2 star I would and if the prices were more reasonable I would definitely give them a 4 star, but unfortunately they have to settle with a 3 star.

Chopped Ahi Tuna Appetizer - piled in the middle with a ring, surrounded by some crispy chips, its a nice appetizer to try. Tuna was fresh and tender. No chewy bits. Chips were nice and crispy. Great to eat the tuna on top of the chip. 

Salmon Tacos - Two soft tortilla tacos with sour cream, guacamole, and a sauce (tomatillo? green tomato?) on the side. Salmon was a bit dry, more on the cooked side. My preference on cooking salmon at home, would a crisp sear on the outside, and the inside is still borderline raw. Keeps it nice and tender and moist. Overall, the taco was delicious. Will try a different fish next time ! 

Orange Roughy Fish Plate - BEST of the 3. ok a little side story. prior to this, my friend and I had seen Orange Roughy at a restaurant we ate at before. Didn't know what it was but had google'd it up and what not. Since then, we've been seeing it everywhere. Finally got to try it. Had ordered the fish plate with a side of sweet potato fries, comes with a cole slaw, and we were given two different sauces (indecisive and the one who took our order said she'll give us both to try). The sauces were a mango salsa and a garlic butter. The fish was nicely grilled. The texture of the fish was tender but not flaky like salmon. its more... stringy? iunoe how to describe that. medium texture, not soft like bass but not firm like salmon or tuna when fully cooked. The garlic butter is, like garlic butter. Very butter, with a hint, not too strong garlic flavor. The mango salsa, OMG you can give me a bowl of that, i can eat straight up or with chips or something. So bright and refreshing. Paired on top of the fish. SUPER WIN ! Squirt some lemon juice on top, and take a bite. its like a symphony of flavors. 

Will come back to try other fishes as well. Been recommended the fried cod tacos. Next time ! :D",2014-01-24 09:56:03

Maybe it's the location (most likely) or maybe it's the fact that one time I was there, Canadian folk legend Bruce Cockburn walked right by our table...and proceeded to wait outside for someone for a solid half hour. The whole time I was there while enjoying my rather tasty omelette and above average coffee, I kept trying to think of the perfect line (cribbed from one of his songs) to use in approaching him. By the time I got to one that I liked (it involved the song ""Night Train""), he had finally left and my food was rather cold. C'est la vie!

Anyways, great location like I said, lots of space, pretty good service and a nice menu. I'm sure there are more exciting and exotic places to grab breaky in Montreal but only at Eggspectation on Maisonneuve can I repeat the Cockburn story for the 100th time.

Unlike Hart House which is a more popular option for working out, the AC is home to the Varsity athletes and gives off a more proffessional feel to the organized sports going on here. It is also the venue of choice for UofT intramural sports from waterpolo to dodgeball. 

I've experienced the AC both as a student working out/participating in intramurals as well as working behind the scenes as part of the intramural sports council, and if one is to navigate the inner offices here you are bound to get lost, UofT for some reason has a whole bunch of buildings which offer little help to the new students/staff that are confusing to map out in your head and the AC should be among the top of that list. (We had a scavenger hunt just to get accustomed to it). But one thing is for certain and that's the utilization of every possible space to ensure a well run establishment of offices and playing fields and gyms. 

The front guest services staff members are helpful. No doubt they get the same problems brought to their attention frequently so they are proficient in providing assistance to the needy. The pool observation area is one of my favourite spots to do some reading or kill time at since I do enjoy the sounds of water splashing around when people are swimming, if you're lucky you could catch some synchronised swimming or some fancy dive work as well. 
There is a Starbucks and it's one of the better ones you would find on campus along with a sports store which has quite a comprehensive selection despite it's size. 
The changing room system is also a little bonus as you get a free towel as you walk in.

The food.. in my opinion was ""meh"". Nothing special. The fish on my friends sashimi set did not look to fresh. Signs of oxidations were present by the time the plate got to the table.

 The rolls tasted very plain and average at best. 

I ordered a teriyaki bento with short ribs. The short ribs were well seasoned. Maybe overly seasoned? I found myself extra thirsty after my meal. There must have either been a ton of sodium or MSG or both. 

The cheese wontons were interesting. I believe it was a cream cheese filling. That was the ONE delightful surprise I had at this place. I had moderate to high hopes for this place as the previous pictures looked delicious and had decent reviews.

I window shop like a pro and pretty much pass by the majority of boutiques if I'm not jiving with what's ""on trend this season"" (read: the rule not the exception). But Citizenry got me past the threshold with its enticing offerings in the windows *and* there's the fact that they have a sweet little coffee set-up as well. How could I resist?

But it gets better. I loved a lot of what I saw in the front (nothing tragically trendy, excellent prices) but it was what was waiting for me in the back of the store that really got me ready to whip out my credit card and break my ""no shopping in the summer because I have to save my $ for fall"" rule. In the back is where you're going to find the stuff that makes you go ""ahhh."" Must. Have. There's corsets. There's dresses that you won't see anyone else wearing (and there is probably only one of each item). There's jackets and more. I'm babbling. I always babble when I'm indescribably happy. Young, up and coming designers prevail back here and I wanted all of it. 

Oh the exquisite skirts with all kinds of bells and whistles... The one that attracted me to her has strings in it so that you can gather it up on either side and look like a chic post modern saloon girl. Unfortunately, my budget did not allow for an entire new wardrobe, even with these unbelievably low prices (low for one of a kind items and expertly crafted corsets, not ""low"" as in cheap), so I decided on that skirt and a silky jacket with a bunch of zippers that allow you to adjust the length and whether or not you want to wear it as a vest. So fucking cool! I have too many corsets (yeah, it's true) and was *trying* to be practical that day, but oh how I wanted to have a go with some of these little numbers. I'll be back. that's a promise. In fact I'll be back in less than a month.

LRtK_05RC8JSXXIBDBSmyQ,9UdZsmZ8UFuENuca3mDA_Q,-BbnAc9YEO6pjvJGEtFbVQ,4,0,0,0,I'm always up for trying new ramen places. I came here for lunch with my wife when we found a lot of places we wanted to try was closed on a Sunday.  It was fairly busy on a Sunday afternoon but was able to be seated in 5 mins.  Ordered the tonkatsu black. It was pretty good. Not as strong on taste as one at sho ryu ken ramen which I preferred. Fairly enough meat and the ramen came with an egg which doesn't seem to be that common in ramen places nowadays except as an add on. Also had the slow cooked wings and gyoza. Both were great. You can actually taste the freshness of the gyoza. The slow cooked wings were tender and flavorful. The place was small but not cramped. One of the things I like about ramen places is that they are fairly cozy.,2015-10-29 12:14:44

w860KTzoH-3R7DaxomyOGA,xtwoOTTOuZrXj4GQtsueuA,4noRilkKlHiWf_OrqNL3HQ,5,7,1,2,"I have totally begun a love affair with this Avon Lake gem. I drive twenty minutes from Westlake (usually the scenic route) on all my work from home days to grab a iced vanilla latte made with skim, its fabulous and not too bitter.

Rio is situated out front in the Drug Mart parking lot, in front of Kenilworth and a Subway on Walker Road. Best part? They have a drive-thru. But, be careful that you don't enter the drive-thru going the wrong way! I definitely almost made that mistake my first visit.

On most of my trips to Rio, I've gone inside to order. I just like the atmosphere. The staff is welcoming and friendly and I've never felt that overly pretentious vibe you can get at some other independently owned coffee shops. Rio just keeps it real.

Rio carries lots of whole coffee beans for purchase including some Rainforest Caramel Crunch, Hawaiian Coconut Cream, and some delicious Kona Blend, among others. They also offer a selection of Torani syrups and various other Rio swag (coffee cups, travel mugs, etc.).

The sunlit patio (see pictures) is a great place to sip an iced brew on a warm day. Inside you will find a quaint seating area with comfy chairs and tables, with shelves stacked high with random books and board games for your entertainment pleasure. Rio also has free WIFI in case you're trying to get some work done while fueling up on some caffeine.

Let me also mention you enter Rio from the front of the building which happens to face Walker, which confused me at first - but what else is new. At least there's a sign that directs you to the door - so I must not be the only one that has felt this way. Every time I enter Rio I really feel like I'm finding something unique and special. Its definitely a great locally owned place.

Rio carries a TON of food options. And like Cara has said it does seem a bit Sysco-y, but! they make up for it with the care they put into preparing it for you. The boyfriend and I have gotten breakfast to go more than once and our selections have been super tasty (a bacon egg and cheese croissant and a sausage egg and cheese wheat bagel). Rio's pastry selection could be a bit better... it makes me sad that they don't appear to bake on location like some other coffee shops do (hello, Arabica of North Ridgeville). Most of Rios pastries (muffins, danishes, lemon loaf) look like they came from Costco.

A fab thing about Rio is that the website and menus inside the shop include approximated Weight Watchers points. I love the effort they put into serving health conscious fare.

All in all I cannot pass up my iced vanilla latte on any trip. It's not bitter, it doesn't make me overly jittery, and it isn't overly sweet - its the right mix of everything I want my morning brew to be. If you live close, or are up for a nice little ride out to Avon Lake, check them out!",2012-07-29 23:36:38

nloH77zpM5eJWHDX1J7iRQ,ds-C9AXGATTmvsCEWCqmZg,sYf2auhosrx8trbyP9nGyw,3,2,0,0,"We ordered delivery on a late-ish Saturday night through the online ordering system which was fairly easy to work.

They have a wide variety of calzones and toppings to choose from. We ended up going with a ""double play"" which was 2 zones and cheese stix for about $16, although we added some options to our zones that increased their price by at least $1 each, also the tax, delivery fee and tip, this dinner ended up being pretty pricey at over $24.

Delivery time itself was fairly quick, about 45 minutes. Our food was fairly hot and everything looked to be correct as far as what we ordered goes, which was a pepperoni & sausage zone as well as a maui wawi zone.

I was not impressed overall, though. The zones themselves are a fairly large portion, with a crispy crust, but the insides were mostly cheese and the amount of meat wasn't nearly much as I expected. I also didn't like how the sauce comes on the side, more like a dipping sauce as opposed to a pizza topping. Not only did I run out of side sauce, but I feel like the entire inside of the zone was kind of bland due to being just meat and cheese. The meats were not that tasty, either, kind of lacking flavor, and probably not of high quality. The cheese stix we got with our order were just okay too, I did like the crispy bottom but they tasted quite similar to my zone.

You can't deny DP Dough is ideal drunk food, but I didn't particularly care for it on a more sober Saturday night without any coupons or Hooked/local deals. I would have rather gotten a Papa Del's deep dish for comparable money.

I think if this place narrowed their menu and focused more on simple, quality/fresh ingredients, I would probably give it another shot.",2015-03-09 18:26:47

My car was done in just over 10 minutes. Twenty bucks for an in&out (ie, inside & outside). The only other menu offerings are exterior-only for $12 and a hand wax for $40. Add $5 for SUVs & trucks. Add $10 for Armor-All in&out.

Just seconds after I pulled my car into their bay, four energetic employees swarmed upon my vehicle. And all four stayed at it until it was finished. I noticed one or the other of them back-tracking to double check their own work, door jambs, windows, whatever. 

And, yes, the car looked superb. 

The $20 deal included tire dressing, cleaning the wheels, vacuuming the trunk, etc., items that at other car washes are costly add-ons.

Ok, now the venue itself isn't much to speak of. These guys have commandeered one of those no-touch, robotic cinder-block car wash bays at a Sinclair gas station ... and are using it to do hand washes. Then they do the interior and other details after they drive the car out of the bay. There's nowhere to sit, no music playing, no conveniences of any sort. So I just walked over to the gas station's convenience store about thirty feet away ... and by the time I picked out a drink & snack, my car was all but done.

To quote a former California governor ... I'll be back!

UPDATE: I've now been back for the hand-wax special. That includes the outside only (add $10 for the inside). 

Awesome. Pull-in to drive-a-way was about 25 minutes. 

They are using a liquid squirt-paste wax that hazes (and so requires serious hand-buffing), NOT that 'quickie' liquid spray wax that goes on clear (and wipes off easy). 

At the end of the job, they spotted some overspray from recent paint work ... and worked to try to rub it out with some compound, without me asking. 

While I waited, I saw a very-new gray Corvette drive through for an exterior-only wash. So apparently people with high-end vehicles are quickly coming to trust this venue as well.

Accordingly, this venue is even more highly recommended upon this, my second, visit.",2018-02-15 05:25:56

It's not to the snobby extreme that Scottsdale Fashion Square is (there aren't 50 different places to valet your car), but it has a nice set of stores and some good restaurant options. 

I enjoy coming here more than Scottsdale because it's easier to park, generally less busy, and it's more spread out so it doesn't always feel so crowded. It's a very different clientele (read: old people), so it moves a bit slower, and there are fewer stores that bump techno music. 

Other than that, it's a mall. It's clean and well lit (noted by a couple of other reviewers), and features a nice mix of good shopping and dining. It's a really convenient location overall because you're also close to a Target and a Costco, so if you end up here you could really eat and shop all day...Funny enough, those are two of my favorite things to do, much to the chagrin of my wallet and my waistline.

If you're anywhere close, it should be your mall of choice. Even if it's a bit of a trek, it's worth the trip and will definitely keep you entertained yet not overwhelmed for a number of hours.",2012-02-11 00:06:17

Breakfast items
Salads and Pizzas
Assorted Cheese and Cured meats
Cooked seafood 
Dim sum 
Sushi
Roasted beef
Baby back ribs
Roasted Chicken and Duck
Desserts 

I didn't have any of those, hubby liked the roasted beef, pork dumplings and shumai, duck and chicken were okay. 

There was no line at all, otherwise I wouldn't have agreed to eat buffet, only $30ish per person, good valued brunch. If you only like crab legs, it will do for you, for other things? Not so much.

The atmosphere is hard to beat.  

The bartender( he might have been the owner/manager) was super attentive and understands what customer service is all about.  One guy asked him to make some shot ( he gave him a slip of paper with ingriedents) that he had had at some other bar.  It was supposed to be triple layered and when it didn't come out quite how the guy wanted it, he Goggled it and tried to replicate it for him.  It still wasn't quite what the guy wanted....I would have told him to just get a shot of tequila and man up!  We were amazed how patient he was and how genuinely intent on making that stupid drink the way the guy wanted it.   

He definitely took care of us and we will be back.  Looks like there are lots of possibilities, on lots of different days, for a good time here.

Another restaurant that will bring food and beverages to my little dwelling, sparing me the annoyance of cooking. Well, I had the opportunity to try them out last night. 

... Meh. 

I gave them one star for the lovely Veronica who answered the phone, spoke perfect ENGLISH, and took my order with friendly efficiency. That was truly a delightful surprise! 

The second star is for the very FAST DELIVERY time ... Under 30 minutes, despite the fact that the driver had trouble finding me. 

The lack of any other stars reflects on the wildly overpriced lasagna ($14), which arrived barely luke warm and with no accompaniments other than 2 short, doughy, greasy bread-sticks. No salad, no soup ... nuthin'. REALLY? $14 for a single serving of bland pasta filled with meat and a little cheese and hardly any sauce?! 

What really annoyed me, was that I had to actually heat the lasagna in a 350 degrees oven for 1/2 hour to get it to a point where it was slightly hot around the edges, but still only warm in the center. Grrrr .... Turning on the oven pretty much negates any benefit of getting food delivered, so I was NOT PLEASED. I felt like I did half their work for them. It was as if they had thawed out a pan of frozen lasagna, stuck it under a heat lamp and waited for the orders to pour in. FYI guys ... Pouring 1/2 cup of hot marinara on a 5-inch slab of room temp lasagna will NOT heat it through.

I'd recommend if you want dinner (or lunch) as well go somewhere else before hand and then head to Juliette for dessert.  I find there salads and savory crepes to be ok but nothing great.  The desserts though are another story.

I usually get the brownies although the crepes are good (especially the peanut butter, chocolate and banana one).  The balsamico is worth trying.  It's a dark chocolate brownies with a raspberry-balsamic reduction.  I wasn't too sure about the balsamic part when I ordered it but I was proven very wrong when I tried it.  It was very good!  Also you can't go wrong with the intense brownie or the fleur de sel one.  I' wouldn't recommend the cheesecake brownie though as I found it too rich for my liking.

The service can be pretty good some nights and bad on others.  A few times they've forgotten to bring things that someone I was with ordered like lattes, milk, etc.  It can also be slow when it's an off night.  On other nights though it's spot on.   I'd definitely recommend going though.  It is well worth the trip.",2013-06-02 23:48:35

-Similar lighting. Not too bright, but a bit more dim. 
-Prices are on par.  
-They have some great prepared food specials (Some of the specials this week: croissants @ 3/$1.00, cooked corn - 6 cobs for $1.00, chicken feet for $1.69, etc.).  

The one thing that Nations has that Oceans doesn't is a larger seating area, and the fact that they serve Vietnamese food.

And it didn't even taste like alcohol, but my face glowed like it was the first sip of alcohol I've ever consumed. 

2. The food was delicious and what we ate - very well-priced. We ate an assortment of appies, sides and a clam pizza. You cannot make this type of food with these ingredients for less at home. I am so value conscious and I thought the prices were awesome. It's the type of food that is so delicious and different and you cannot stop eating even though you can feel your buttons popping.

3. Service. Stephanie was awesome and so patient and so knowledgeable with her recommendations. The place is gorgeous and a destination to head to for dinner. From what I could see, the restaurant is well-staffed.

That second floor was like being in the Devil's armpit!  Then again, it -was- storming outside so you can't fault The Venue completely.

I had brought along one of my bestest buddies, Linh L., with me as my +1 with the tickets I won at the Yelp Birthday Bash at Nash.  Thanks a million, Yelp, for allowing me to attend such a spectacular event!  We ran into many familiar faces and it was a Yelpers Reunion.  We all voted that Yelp had the best booth, right?  ;D  That Rachel S. and the new ambassador [Vanessa, right?] were pushing through that heat like champs.  Glad they were giving away fans!  There was some great music by Sapphire Sky as well.  They knew how to get the people dancing.  I was the crazy one spinning in a circle, front and center, to record a video for my Instagram during Pharrell's  ""Happy"" cover.

The best bites of the night for me were from Mirabel Country Club and El Palacio.  Mirabel had that amazingly delicious ""southwestern beer drowned shrimp.""  It was a flavor explosion on a crispy tortilla chip! Running into Rachel S. and having her give me the heads up that it was a tasty morsel was a tip worth heeding.  Amazing!  El Palacio served up some succulent carnitas.  No joke, I think I need to visit their restaurant this week.  I'm daydreaming of a delicious taco...  They had a really charismatic and friendly spokesman for their booth.  The lovely lady even remembered me and which level of spice I liked when I crept back into line an hour later with Amy H. for seconds.  I almost felt guilty and ashamed but then I saw my mild sauce being cooked into the pork and all embarrassment was forgotten.  Get in me, street taco.  Let's be one.  *saliva gurgle*  Congratulations to El Palacio and chef Anthony Serrano for winning and good luck in Las Vegas!  Bring home the big  money!  Also to note, The Venue has some tasty spicy ginger beer and a delicious yogurt and habanero, mango, and watermelon jelly shot.  Such a perfect balance of heat and coolness.

My Swedish Massage was $115.00 for 50-minutes but with a 20% service charge added, it came to $138, which is not bad.  My massage therapist was great, he had me sample the different oils that they use and asked about target areas.  Although, he didn't work on those target areas longer than I had hoped, it was a nice massage.  One thing that irked me little was when he used his arms on my back, I could feel his arm hairs, which kind of felt like sand paper but no biggie, it's a guy thing.

The spa itself has significantly gone downhill.  The lounge area used to be a little more plush, with nice seating and furnishings.  Now it has three microfiber couches, a coffee table and a side table holding a huge 32"" tube tv and a VCR...yes, a VCR.  Their beverage station offers lemon water, hot tea and in the mini refrigerator, there's a bunch of mini cans of juices, but no bottled water.  Apparently, they keep the water behind the counter.  Hmm...doesn't juice cost more than water??

The sink area offers your basic amenities, nothing fru-fru that's for sure.  It almost feels like the sink area at your local gym.  You know, kind of stale and industrial feeling.  The restroom area is out in the open so you can hear (and smell) everything.  The showers are in a separate room/area, which is very dimly lit, but the shower stalls are private.

The hot tub is pretty huge and can fit about 22 people, so the sign says.  But it looked quite dingy and could certainly use a good scrubbing.  The cold plunge is the size of a normal hot tub and was quite cold!  In the same area were the Sauna and Steam Room...which smelled mildewy, nothing minty or eucalyptus smelling like it should be.

The spa staff was alright, they were on the young side, just out of high-school type.  So, they were nice but, not quite refined for the atmosphere.  One of the guys who I thought was restocking the refreshment area, was actually standing there and texting until I glanced over at him.

*Roasted Half Chicken with Eggplant Fries - I really enjoyed this dish and there was enough of it that I had to get a to-go box. I think the sauce was a pesto one?
*Market Fish with Grilled Polenta, Celery and Endive Salad - The fish was very bland with no flavor at all. 
*Beet and Goat Cheese Ravioli with Pecorino Cheese and Fresh Herbs - Smaller portion than the other dishes but the buttery/cheesy sauce was pretty good. 
*Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse Cake - Plain until you get to the center with hazelnut crisps. I wish there would have been more of those crisps! 
*Tiramisu - Nothing special. 
*Pistachio Cheesecake - We all agreed that this was the best dessert of the night. 

Not sure if I would come back, but glad I checked it out! The regular menu is a little pricey but might be a nice place for a date because of the romantic atmosphere.",2014-11-17 02:32:35

I am always wary of newer restaurants in Pittsburgh, and I always have low expectations since Pittsburgh isn't considered a gourmet food city. I have to say for Pittsburgh, I was delighted with Avenue B! 

We were a group of eight and had the front table by the window. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and patient. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant is upbeat, but not overly noisy and crowded. I would never sit outside on the sidewalk, though, as you have to contend not only with the people walking by, but also the fumes from the buses at the stop right outside the door. Street parking on a Friday night was easy! 

There is a small regular menu at the table which changes seasonally, but the ever-changing daily menu is up on chalkboards on either side of the room. Depending upon where you sit in the room, you may or may not be able to read the daily list. With help from my glasses, I could see most, but awkward angles made it difficult to read some of the available choices. I think that it would be a good idea if they had at least one copy of the daily menu in print at each table. 

The food was delicious, from the small plates to the main course. We shared several appetizers, lobster spring rolls, calamari, sashimi, all of which were flavorful and fresh. The soft shell crab and scallop entree was succulent, and the Kobe meatloaf was tasty. Nothing was over the top, but it was all very satisfying. Absolutely no complaints across the board, and remember, there were eight of us! 

The restaurant is BYOB. I am still trying to wrap my head around that concept, the good and the bad. Most of our group are wine drinkers so that we could bring better bottles of wines at reasonable prices rather than order from an overpriced wine list is a real plus. On the Filip's, I am more of a cocktail gal, typically a martini girl, and I can't envision bringing a big bottle of vodka, mixers, etc. Maybe that's what those mini bottles are for? 

All in all, a lovely experience. I definitely would go again, if the opportunity presented itself.",2011-07-04 14:41:29

HOWEVER, the service was horrible to non-existent.  I am use to getting low service since I look young but mind you, I am 21 years old and my boyfriend is 22 so I really don't understand why we were ignored! Water was never refilled and since I ordered the spicy fried rice, I had to flag down the waiter three times to get my water refilled! The table only had one place setting when we sat down so we flagged down a waiter for a setting but instead just got a fork!!!! All the waiters seemed to go around the other tables to make sure they were doing fine but skipped ours. This was by far the worst service I have ever had.

The staff is pretty much useless. I only come here because it's a mile away from my house. The prices are also pretty up there. 

I needed some new scrubs for work and I figured I'd stop by since it's just around the corner. I found some scrubs that I liked, but didn't realize they were double the price of the other pair that I found. I thought they were the same since they were of the same brand. Anyway, I asked the employee (white male with glasses) for help finding the cheaper pant in the color I was looking for. He told me to look for it myself. I attempted to look, but the disorganized piles were just too much to sift through. I then came back to him to ask if there was a cheaper brand that he knew of that had the same color I was looking for. His lazy response was that he didn't know. He didn't even attempt to look or make suggestions. That's when I got frustrated and raised my voice. He then pointed me to the direction of the scrubs on sale in the very back of the store. I ended up finding what I needed after having to raise my voice. When I went to go pay, they didn't discount any of the scrubs that were marked $10. 

If I didn't say anything, I would've ended up paying $84 instead of $56. The customer service totally ruined my experience.

I needed an excuse to check out this newly-opened all vegetarian/vegan restaurant so when I was hungry the following Saturday night, we made the drive down there.  

We were greeted with a sample of the crispy beef from the chef.  It was great, lighty crisp, tossed in a sweet & savory sauce, sprinkled with crushed peanuts.  I ordered the 2 item cold dish combo for an appetizer and selected the BBQ Meat and the Bitter Melon Salad.  I asked what the bitter melon was before ordering and was told that it was a squash that was mildly bitter.  The BBQ Meat can be passed off as the BBQ Pork I remember eating as a little kid, red on the outside and grey on the inside.  The Bitter Melon was terrible.  Not that it was prepared yucky, it is just not a vegetable we could eat.

Entrees were General Tzo Chicken, Szechuan Shrimp and House Chow Fun.  The General Tzo Chicken is 5 stars!  Fried crispy on the outside but chewy in texture on the inside.  Tossed in a sweet and spicy sticky sauce, perfect for clinging to the rice.  The Szechuan Shrimp sauce had a good flavor and it really did look like shrimp, the taste and ""shrimpy flavor"" was a little too much for me.  I'm glad I tried it, and I'm sure that it is a favorite of shrimp lovers but I can't say that I will order it again.  The Chow Fun was great too.  The vegetables were stir fried in a super hot wok that gave them that smokey burnt flavor on the edges and perfectly cooks them to a crisp tender.

So while checking Yelp around the Mesa/Gilbert area, I found Fruitilandia and noticed I had bookmarked it earlier so my husband and I decided to try it especially after I saw some of the pics on Yelp. 

We got there at around 8:45pm. The parking was pretty full and so was the store! Most tables were full, there was a line already and it was buzzing, all on a Sunday night! 

While standing in line, we were looking at the menu on the board. It's a little hard to see when you're way in the back of the line. When we got to the cashier, and with so many options available, I decided to ask what the pic I was looking at on Yelp was and ordered just that. It was Macedonia. It's basically vanilla ice shavings with pieces of mango and strawberry served with mango juice and condensed milk and topped with ice cream. The drink in the pic looked like it had vanilla ice cream on top but when I asked the cashier, she said, strawberry ice cream also tasted great and so did the strawberry cheesecake ice cream as well so both my husband and I decided to try it with those ice cream options. 

When I checked in on Yelp, I realized they had an offer where you would get the 2nd drink 50% off. So the total was a little over $10! Great price for two huge drinks/desserts we were about to have. 

The orders came out pretty quick. The taste, my oh my, it was out of this world. Just as the doctor ordered! This drink/fruit/ice cream dream satisfied every bit of craving I had for that night, I was over the moon. No wonder this place was packed!

Fruitalinda does not only offer drinks and fruit salads etc, they also have savory dishes such as a shrimp cocktail too!

Personal Experience: This was the second Peppi's I ever visited, back in the old days.

I absolutely loved it! It took about 10 mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling me about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun and interesting and interested in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind of service which is hard to come by these days.

What's more, the sandwich was spectacular. It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best service I've had anywhere, actually.

I would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love it. Best service. Miles better than Primanti's.

And more info:

This place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!

Well, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it ""plus an egg"". The ""plus an egg"" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.

Plus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... ""plus an egg"". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there.",2011-12-06 03:19:25

I suggest going here with a reservation, it doesn't matter if your going on a weekday or weekend.. just make that reservation because theres a chance that this place will be busy during lunch time. JUST DO IT. 

Dinner time is always less chaotic but the place is sometimes filled with people on a random and you would have to wait for awhile if your unlucky.

Overall its a good place to take your spouse, friends, co-worker, and family here as they also accommodate large groups. Staff is okay, very attentive as usual.",2016-07-09 00:43:14

Definitely try the bacon jam biscuits with the quail egg - easily the best thing I've ever eaten in Phoenix, a true gem.

The flat breads were decent.  Also had the BBQ ribs and homemade tots - all of which were tasty in small quantities, which is exactly what tapas are meant to be.

The atmosphere is a bit hotel-ish and overly modern hipster.  Even the wait staff is overly-casual in attire, although they were all quite friendly and attentive.

I'm a bit of a creature of habit and always seem to order their calzones. Why? Because it works for me and meets my needs. That's why. I feel like I have a 10-pound brick in belly post-consumption, but that's my choice. This only happens when I'm craving Italian/heavy foods.

This cafe is situated inside the same building as Konjiki Ramen, that specializes in matcha (similar to Tsujuri) There's limited seating inside but you can easily grab a drink (or even ice cream) while you wait in line for ramen. My friend got the Matcha Black Sugar Latte. For $5, I found it overpriced for what it was, but the taste was alright...nothing special. I got the Saryo Signature Parfait. I asked them if they were able to do a twist of Matcha and Hojicha and they said twist wasn't available but also they ran out of Matcha. When I asked if they can substitute there's bean for the oiri- japanese soft candy rice ball (interested to see what it taste like), they said no. Fine. It was $7.50 plus tax which was a tad expensive but I guess it's standard pricing compared to like, Tsujuri. The hojicha soft serve was good (tasted like ""roasted chocolate green tea"" according to one of their employees), the Matcha brownie was meh (I can't describe what it taste like...whether it was good or bad LOL), the mochi was good, the water jelly taste like nothing (reminded me of the teardrop cakes), the green tea jelly had an interesting/bitter taste, and the granola did not blend well with the rest of the parfait!! If they changed that to rice puffs or smth I would've preferred it a lot more.

Came by to use up the rest of my CSM gift card since the market is set to close this Saturday at 5p.  Everything in the store, besides what were offered in the deli and fresh-prepared, were 25% off.  Already, the store looked like it was running on fumes-- 1/3 to 1/2 of the shelves stocked, and not much food in the deli cases, and almost-barren pastry case.  Produce aisle was almost empty.  There were still a few bottles of AZ wine left.  If I hadn't made it a point to only drink organic and/or sustainable wines a few months ago, I'd have walked out with a few bottles...

For sustenance, I ordered a bit of the pasta, quinoa, and sweet potato salads, and I enjoyed it very much!  Loved the lemon-herb vinaigrette used in the quinoa salad.  The pasta was perfect in texture and bite, and not too greasy.  The sweet potatoes were terrific!  Not mushy or too sweet.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o9ncq8xQo_hd427lMsQQZw?select=Z7R54ZSL8VU0YtBHDD5LFQ#Z7R54ZSL8VU0YtBHDD5LFQ  Since I was trying to use up my gift card, I decided to order two sandwiches to try a few bites out of and then box the rest up for leftovers.  LOVED the Smoke Shop (?) bacon used-- very meaty, and not too much fat gristle to trim!  Delicious!  I also enjoyed the aioli very, very much.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o9ncq8xQo_hd427lMsQQZw?select=mFz_yas6nZ2eyApYuZBCzA#mFz_yas6nZ2eyApYuZBCzA  The toasted multi-grain bread had great crunch factor.  :))  The ""Friggin' chicken"" sandwich was very good, as well.  Very spicy due to the jalapenos, but the sweetness of the mango chutney, together with the cheese, helped cut the spice down.  Really, really liked the bun!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o9ncq8xQo_hd427lMsQQZw?select=ixW9ez-QJfjgcqqM0bDeIQ#ixW9ez-QJfjgcqqM0bDeIQ  However, the a la carte pricing was a bit too steep.  However, knowing everything is local and sometimes organic kind of helps...

While the grocery/wine bar is closing, the Wednesday night and Saturday morning markets will still go on.  Tonight's crowd outdoors was a bit saddening, though.  Perhaps the sudden thunder and lightning storm that just dissipated a few minutes before I parked had something to do with the lack of activity, but it almost seemed like those present were there for a funeral...

Since I've tried and loved goats' milk ice cream and cheese, I decided to take a chance and purchased two Black Mesa Ranch (Snowflake, AZ; 928-536-7759) products, Goats Milk Caramel Fudge Sauce and Goats Milk Caramel Sauce, at $9.50 a piece (minus 25% closing-shop discount).  I may use these items as dips and ice cream toppings, and however else they may inspire me!  ;)  I'm having some of the caramel sauce with banana as part of my breakfast (whole wheat pan de sal, a slice of Breadsmith sesame seed-encrusted rustic Italian bread, organic banana, Maranatha organic crunchy and roasted almond butter, and organic coffee!), and I had to take this time to write about how wonderfully delicious it is.  I first notice the exquisite caramel flavor and the buttery-silk texture, and the scent of goats' milk is in the background.  I'd say that, unless you truly abhor the taste/scent of goats' milk, novices and lovers of goats' milk products will enjoy this caramel offering!  I've yet to try the caramel fudge sauce, but as soon as I do, I will definitely add to this review.",2012-05-10 21:30:02

They don't skimp you with topping either, this personal sized pizza will fill you up. The thin crust style is perfect in regards to taste and crunchiness. 

The second time I came here I decided to try out a salad. Again, I could completely customize it with their buffet style ordering line, and no surprise it was delicious as well, and the size made it very filling.

VIBE
Like your average chain steakhouse, the Keg knows what it's doing.  The revolving doorway brings you into a dim lit modern bar. Mahogany wood and plush velvet booths makes it look fancier than it is and makes you feel like you're getting good value (which you are). Thursday night after work hours  is when The Keg (at least it's aforementioned York St. location) is at its peak. But beware: it's banker central. And you may spot an old haired investor with a waitress or two (I've seen it happen).  It's appropriate that it's a meat market at a steak house. Zing!  That said, the service is exceptional. The staff are friendly, playful and quick. Plus, free coke refills! What's not to like? 
NOTE: The York St. location has a great back patio/courtyard in the heart of the financial district. It's a nice summer dinner date. 

WE ATE: 
I had the Keg Prime Rib Burger when a friend was coming in late from a flight. The Keg has a late night menu (read: you can get served after 11:30 p.m.) but it's their bar menu. So we decided to split a burger. Good decision! The Prime Rib burger is served only well done (the way I like it) and still retains all of its juices. They don't accessorize too much (and they give you extra pickles. This means bonus points) so you can still taste the full flavor of the burger. It has just the right amount of spice. So I took 6 friends out for dinner for a Keg Burger Tasting and they loved it! You also get a side of fries, sweet potato fries or a baked potato.  We had all of them and they were all on point. I opted for the baked potato and they give you the appropriate amount of sour cream. Bacon bits and chives also top this potato.  For the meal with a coke, tax and tip I think I paid about $17 to $20. WELL worth the value considering the price of other burgers in this city. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
No need to relive high school memories of getting drunk in a bathtub. This Keg is all you need to get drunk off their juicy meats as long as you steer clear of the meat market that surrounds you.",2011-11-09 05:01:22

It's located down an alleyway right next to Shopper's Drug Mart, you could walk by the signage without even knowing it was there unless you were looking specifically for it. I made reservations for two for a Saturday evening to celebrate Valentines Day.

We were quickly seated and had our coats hung up the staff. We looked through the menu and decided to go with razor clams ($20.00 plus tax) which was a special of the day, pulpo which is essentially a grilled octopus on a bed of roasted potatoes which was also a special of the day ($17.00 plus tax), jamon croquetas ($10.00 plus tax) and the Patria paella which is essentially a seafood paella ($55.00 plus tax for two). I had a pint of Estrella Damm which is a Spanish beer ($9.00 plus tax), since it's a Spanish restaurant, they only offered Spanish beers.

The pulpo ($17.00 plus tax) which was a special of the day was essentially grilled octopus on a bed of roasted potatoes was okay, perfectly cooked, beautiful presentation but a little under seasoned.

The jamon croquetas ($10.00 plus tax) which was croquettes with serrano ham inside lightly drizzled with an aioli sauce. This appetizer was fantastic, perfectly breaded, nice inside and fantastic aioli sauce.

The razor clams ($20.00 plus tax) which was also a special of the day was done really well, perfectly cooked and covered in a cilantro based sauce. It was beautifully presented and the sauce worked really well because it masked the usual fishy smell of razor clams.

The Patria paella ($55.00 plus tax for two) which is essentially a seafood paella was amazing, probably the best you will get in Toronto. It consisted of shrimp, mussels, calamari, fish, snap peas, clams and saffron. The rice was cooked perfectly and flavourful, all the seafood items were also cooked perfectly, an amazing dish overall.

The service was fantastic, your water was always quickly refilled, your dinner napkin was always quickly folded when you left the table, and the server were really helpful guiding you through the menu and letting you know how much food would suffice and not being overbearing.

Overall, Patria is a fantastic Spanish tapas eatery situated in a hip area of Toronto, definitely priced at a higher price point and the portions aren't large and you will probably need to order quite a bit to get full but keep in mind it's tapas. The service and food is fantastic and perfect for first dates, couples night out or dinner with friends before a night out on King St West.",2017-02-17 03:42:37

It's mostly carrots and rice noodles, with some tofu cubes and other vegetables.

Was really disappointed that their chili sauce was not mind-blowingly fantastic as other locations. Lacking in both heat and star anise. 

The Spice Salt Fish here was not at all the same. Instead of a thin light batter, it was heavily battered and dark brown, more like fish-and-chips than Spice Salt fish. Would have benefited from a toss in sauce, Had me wishing we were at Congee Queen. 

The Dry Sauteed Green Beans were good, although oily, and even though we ordered them with the dehydrated baby shrimps, they were noticeably absent.

Dumplings (Dim Sum All Day) were really really good. Comparable to Ding Tai Fung, at least what I ordered.  

for Downtown Toronto, this would be my first choice for Chinese food, in comparison with GTA Chinese eats, This wouldn't make the top ten for certain.

Asian Legand generally has good service (compared to other similar- price-point Chinese restaurants) , and this location was no different.

We've only ever tried two things at this place, the oatmeal cream pie and the tsoynamis.  

The oatmeal cookie parts of the cream pie were great, but the filling was way, way, too sweet.  Actually overpowers the flavor of the oatmeal cookies.

Gotta just compare the tsoynami to other ice cream joints even though it's not technically ice cream.  It tastes fine.  A little icy (understandable with no dairy), but the hint of coconut along with the crunch of the mix-ins makes for a decent dessert on a hot day.  I would never call this a bad thing, but it just can't compare to real ice cream in taste and texture.

There are several business signs on the front of the building, but it's not clear where to enter. There's a random door that says ""open"". It looks like the door for a jewelry store, but you can in fact go to Ruru's through this entrance. I was seated immediately. They don't comp chips and dip, which is bad for the consumer, smart for business because we're just going to buy the chips and salsa anyway. I ordered a grilled chicken taco and a shrimp taco. Like everything on the menu, they had some sort of name that reflected Ruru's theme. I thought the menu could've stood to be more straight forward. The upside to Ruru's is that the food was really good. My drink was weak for $9. I would skip having drinks here. Service is good. Overall, decent experience and I'll be back.

If you want to ogle women, the servers at better casinos are just as good looking and wear skimpier outfits. When I visited, the servers wore heavy makeup and looked pretty hard core. I never did go for the short shorts and pantyhose look. These are industrial strength pantyhose, more like a leotard. It's hard to appreciate nice legs when they're sheathed in sausage casing.

I just had a hamburger. It was good. The beer selection wasn't much. There were some kids scampering about. I never thought of Hooters as a family venue.

I have a hunch why Hooters hangs on in Vegas: Mormons!  Vegas has a sizable Mormon population. As you may know, these guys are as straight as they come. They never have lust in their hearts (outside the home). But when the wife's out of town, they probably like to get a little naughty.  Walk on the wild side.

While some guys go for a wild night in a strip club, Mormons probably get their kicks at Hooters.

I'm obsessed with the Phoenix Knife House. I need to go there every once in a while just to hang out (and I always have to buy something). I've bought many a present here and I'm always itching to buy another knife for the house. 

Phoenix Knife House carries Japanese chef's knifes - which are only sharpened on one side. They're ridiculously sharp and so cool. We have a killer set of Wusthof's that we got for a wedding present that we don't really use anymore. And we just have a few knives from PKH. While we don't need anymore really, I have to get another soon. I'm going for the Sugimoto 8"" chef's knife.

While they have some amazing, high end works of art (Damascus steel & such), they also carry a good selection of great knives that are super affordable.

Eytan, the owner, carries knives in typical Western shape and traditional Japanese form. He also has a bunch of killer kitchen tools. Absolutely love the kitchen shears he told us to get long ago and was excited to pick up a nice fish spatula recently.

This happens to be the place where many of the valley's local chefs do their knife shopping. Eytan has also expanded to carry some additional chef supplies so head over there if you need a chef's coat or clogs as well.

In addition to being an authority on knives, he's a master sharpener. He sharpens all kinds of knives, is super reasonable and has a quick turnaround.

In addition to the awesome product he has, Eytan is a major foodie. He is a former chef (SCI grad I think?) who worked at amazing places like Kai, Circa 1900, opened Fiamma here and did time in New York at spots like Aureole, La Côte Basque, and Craft.

He is also a great guy and a wealth of information on the local food scene. I'm always following up on  his recommendations.

It happened for our 7pm reservation and I'm sorry but a bustling atmosphere is 50% of any meal in my opinion! However, by 7:30 more people trickled in and the place was busy by the time we left at 8:30.
We started with the garlic balls and a roasted beet salad, both were fine I especially loved the freshness of the in-season beets. I ordered a spiced pumpkin pasta with shaved truffles while my husband ordered a pizza. My pasta was absolutely to die for and without a doubt one of the best bites of food I think I have ever taken! My husband liked his pizza and especially liked the pizza sicissors! I felt like it was ok, just a normal pizza nothing special . . . maybe it just paled in comparison to my pasta.

This was one of the first places that Katrina M. took me to when I first came back from living abroad. The nice thing is that their serving size is not dictated by the AYCE and over indulgent trend of Vegas. I am a fan of getting my moneys worth and I would say that you do get that at Yagyu. The serving size meant for two is the perfect if not a little big. You would not think so because the meat is not stacked high, but with all the sides you will fill up quickly. 

Between the two of us we split the Combination A. The marbling in the meat made it very tender without being too fatty. The fried items were the last things to be touched. There was nothing too special about their tonkatsu, chicken karage, or gyoza. The side dishes were not bad, I tend to devour kimchi like no other. Give me a bowl of rice and kimchi and I can call it a meal. I was coming off the nothing beats the stuff I got in Korea feeling which is why we didn't ask for refills.

Today I went in and had the car washed. When I opened the cupholder, there was still trash in it. I asked the manager about the trash, and he said it would be an upcharge to remove the wrappers out of the cupholder. You've GOT to be kidding me. The interior looked like it was rushed through, and I feel that the quality was not on par with what I paid for.

As I write this, I am in a state of carnivore bliss, having stuffed myself silly with delicious korean BBQ (artfully cooked by none other than moi, if I do say so myself). I've been to a lot of Korean BBQ joints, and although Korean BBQ House lacks a little of the authenticity that your typical mom-n-pop shop might have (what? no poster with cute K-girl holding a bottle of Hite taped over the cash register?), the food and service here is right on. 

We ordered the Dinner for Two ($44.99), which included generous portions of bulgogi and kalbi, along with chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops, and salmon. Of course, there was soup and the usual banchan (kimchee, bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, pickled radish and marinated tofu), rice, and fresh vegetables. It's a LOT of food. They really should call that ""Dinner For Two if You Are Really Really Motherf'ing Hungry Or Are Training To Be Competitive Eaters,"" because even despite our ravenous appetites we couldn't finish it all. Let's just say that by the time we were about 75% done, I was getting the Meat Sweats, and leave it at that. The only thing snooze-worthy was the salmon (not bad, per se, but nothing special.)

The service was stellar during my artery clog-fest. My drink was refilled promptly, and they even brought out additional banchan when our little bowls were empty. The only thing that was lacking were the number of napkins, but if you don't eat like an feral child (like I do), you should be fine. The ventilation system in this place is top notch; it's nice to eat Korean BBQ and not smell like a grill house yourself for the rest of the evening! 

One tip: arrive early, this place gets crowded. We got there at around 6:30 on a Friday night; when we left at around 7:40, we noticed that tables were beginning to be in short supply.

I know, you came to our table right after you placed it, but you're telling me that you can't change the order now because somehow in the past 2 minutes the fish was being cut fresh from the Pacific Ocean and the taco shell was being made fresh (obviously this is an exaggeration because the fish tacos took over 20 minutes to get to our tables, which many would presume is ample time to tell the kitchen to cancel the item). 

What confuses me the most is that our orders were repeated to us by the server, yet 1 order of pho tai nam and an order of steak and eggs were missing? Maybe the kitchen is having a delay, no problem, but ten minutes later we followed up with it and the steak and eggs came out within minutes, perfect (except for the fact the rice should of been in a cereal box considering how crunchy it was) and then another 10 minutes later (a total of 40 mins waiting for our food) for a pho tai nam (came out minutes later as well). 

The check was another hassle of its own, and in short, the party of 4 split the check 2 ways (which we wrote in pen) and it was still messed up. It took two reprints to fix things. Water refills? Wishful thinking.

So Kevin T, you obviously had terrible service, why the 2 stars? Fortunately and unfortunately D1 has the best pho (noodles cooked inconsistently though) and food for the majority ranges from acceptable to great. Sometimes theres lots of love in the food and sometimes... none.

Things to order:

Pho (any except lobster)
Mekong River Noodle Soup
Beef Carpaccio 
Wings
Beef (from their fairly crafty craft beer list)

Things to pass:
Belly buns
Lobster pho (really? #onlyinvegas)
Expectations of great service
Fish tacos (I have dog treats bigger than these)

Will I come back? Maybe someday when the raging hole in my heart after getting burned so hard by the service heals.",2014-11-18 07:33:18

I was upgraded from a studio suite to the one bedroom suite and...my gosh...it was just magnificent.

1200 square feet of goodness. 35-301 had a view of Downtown Las Vegas, with partial views of the Strip and mountains.

Enjoyed such goodies as the full size refrigerator, triple headed shower, whirlpool tub, and separate bedroom and living areas. There is a balcony but unfortunately they are kept locked unless you own a unit.

A couple maintenance issues here and there were taken care of quickly.

Access to the main hotel and casino is through a SkyTube on the 2nd level.

Cab rides to the Strip are like $10...but the Flamingo Rd double decker city bus goes by frequently and will get you there in 10 minutes. A Day Pass is $5.

Planning another trip for the Spring and the Palms Place is definitely on my list...",2016-01-22 03:20:30

Today was just a disaster and I'm very off put about coming back here for a while.

Here are a few suggestions that I hope they follow as I've been eating at this place for over a year now:

1. Learn to begin calling orders by number and not by what people ordered. It will help with the inevitable confusion that ensues when people order the same thing!

2. It may make sense for you to have more than one register to take orders!

3. When I give you my card to pay, please, please, PLEASE stop walking away with it.  Fraud is abundant and you force me to have to watch your every move to make sure you don't swipe my card again.

4. When I order ""FOR HERE"" DO NOT put it in to go because it's easier for you...  Believe it or not, when you order ""FOR HERE"" you get better quality tacos and a larger portion.

5. Be consistent in your assembly of tacos!  Usually we get lots of cheese and chicken in our chicken tacos.  Now we get mostly lettuce, a PINCH of cheese and a few slivers of chicken! WHY? WHY? WHY?

6. WASH YOUR HANDS if you handle money and then my food.

7. Put priority on handing the food to your customers, rather than taking in the orders (see #2 about getting another register). Nothing chaps my a$$ more than waiting another 10 mins because you let me stare at my tacos and let them get cold as you take peoples orders. PRIORITIZE!

Summary:
What happened to the A-Team here. I came here today (1/8/2014) and it was like the C-Team was working the place.  Usually the cooks are fast and efficient, it looked like they were half asleep this time.  The cashier was very inefficient and slow and did not put the food out when it was ready.  I was just watching my food get cold and the food pile up behind him.  Then the food came with hardly any chicken or cheese.  Seriously? These are chicken tacos!  Either the entire team needs more training or some energy drinks.  What happened to my A-Team?!?

I've been horribly disappointed with my most recent experience so I think I will have to put this Roberto's location on timeout for a while.  There are better places now than this place - like Baja Taco right down the street.",2014-01-08 21:45:33
MSJS9BAIgxepy_P-Dlyo7g,vj2RoqU4nRFG0YLbTG4etw,CfxVkwEJk1NAqgqMSesLzA,2,6,0,1,"The design of interior and exterior looks exactly like the 2 other locations down town, as well as the atmosphere.

It is located right at the intersection of Yonge and Sheppard, so it's not hard to find. There's also a underground parking right by it, same parking lot as Whole Foods. It takes awhile when you're trying to exit though because you have to insert your ticket at the exit then pay there too.

The interior is extremely small, it has only 5 long tables, sitting max. 8 people per table. On the other hand, their patio is much bigger than inside, which I find great when it's nice during the summer times, but definitely hard to get a seat in the cooler weathers. 

We went on a Wednesday night at around 10pm with a reservation, but the place was almost dead, less than 10 customers in the restaurant, which I find very surprising for a newly opened popular franchise. 

We got served quickly with a sheet of paper which is their special's menu, regular menu and a drinks menu. As we were deciding what to order, no one came around asking us for drinks or even bringing us some water, this was at least 15 mins after sitting down. We ordered a couple of small dishes to share as well as a pitch of Sapporo. There were 5 of us and we were told that a pitch will be enough for each one of us to get a glass. As she brought over the pitcher and poured it for us, they fill the first 3 mugs full but by the time she got to the last 2, it was clearly not enough to fill both mugs full. So she poured 60% for the remaining 2 mugs, which then a WTF popped into my head.. If it wasn't enough to fill 5, then don't tell us that in the beginning, and don't fill up the first 3 mugs so full that it's not even. We couldn't pour it out of the fuller mugs to even it out, so it was very awkward.

The dishes were up to par, didn't taste as good as the locations down town though. The portion sizes of the food were also small for the price we were paying. We ordered a kimchi udon for the cost of $10 and it was only enough for a bit shared between 5 people and it wasn't worth the money for just very little diced kimchi and very little udon.  We also ordered a cod that was way too salty which we took 2 bits and that was it.

The server never checked on us after giving us the food and only came by when she gave us the bill.  She was very nice and friendly but minimum service was given. 

I was disappointed overall, 2 dishes of what we ordered were disappointing. The price and quality or quantity of food was imbalanced. Service was minimum.
I wouldn't go back again, at least not to this location especially.",2015-07-10 19:47:21

It's always great to see a dream turn into a reality - such is the case for Rock Lobster Food Co., who started out as one of the popular TUM (Toronto Underground Market) vendors - upward wait of 1.5 hours for their infamous lobster roll.

Matt Pettit is the man behind the counter, but you will find him mingling with guests in his true down-to-earth fashion.  

While his signature lobster poutine and lobster rolls are still up for grabs, you will also see non-sea items such as his take on a Steak Tartare, topped with morsels of lobster meat alongside house-made chips.  

Seafood towers (a la Société) are also available (in 2 sizes).  The smaller one, aka The Crow's Nest comes with 6 oysters, 6 shrimps and 2 snow crab legs.  The larger one = lobster baby!

Another amazing thing?  Wine on tap!  That's right, and *gasps* what?!  $1 per ounce? Finally, a restaurant that isn't a party pooper by overcharging on the liquid calories.  No wonder they're so popular already!

Came here on a Thursday night with a group of friends and the place was packed.  The rectangular restaurant features mostly wood as it's main element of décor.  My favourite would have to be the back wall leading to the kitchen, with a door looking like a port hole and the actual wall made of wooden lobster crates!  A semi-private dining area labeled the ""Anchor Room"" was also a focal point.

We feasted on:

Lobster Mac 'n Cheese - A bit on the light side.  I imagined a gooey, cheesy mess but what I got was probably more of what you'd see on a Jenny Craig menu (read, light).

The Crow's Nest Seafood Tower - Move over pissing shrimp, there's a new sheriff in town and it's called the pissing snow crab?  These shelled goodies were so juicy it doubled as a Nerf gun and I shot my dining companion in the eye with salty sea water.  Be careful - I've got a crab leg and I'm not afraid to use it!  The oysters were a decent size and I have to say the cocktail sauce is a winner!  It is not watered down; it is just thick enough to cling on to the seafood.  The shrimp were also a good size.  

Flank Steak - Served medium rare with house-made hickory sticksm, topped with a fried duck egg and Crown Royal whiskey sauce.  This was delicious.  Word of advice, dip your steak instead of pouring the sauce over, as this is a cold sauce and you wouldn't want your food to get cold.

Crispy Maple Pork Belly - served with mom's creamed spinach.  They aren't lying when they said crispy!

Whale Tail - which bears striking resemblance to a beaver tail, but that wouldn't go well with the sea theme.  Fried pastry with crème anglaise, cinnamon sugar and Canadian maple sugar.  The only dessert option.

I like the vibe at Rock Lobster.  I'm also glad that they are serving more than just seafood as that is not everyone's cup of tea and as a bonus, it's quite good!  The portion sizes aren't enormous, and we shared everything between 3 people.  A welcome addition to the Ossington strip! 

My only one complaint was that table space is limited and the kitchen was way too efficient because the dishes came out one after the other like dim sum, only we didn't have a turn table ;)",2012-12-17 17:30:37

This is a great date spot, energetic without being overly loud - we were easily able hear each other, and the lighting is good. We came to celebrate a special occasion, and sat at the bar in front of Chef Ian Robinson. Ian is mesmerizing to watch, deft and exacting in his preparation of sushi. He guided us through the menu - we ordered almost everything on it - and advised us as to which pieces of sushi required soy sauce, and which did not. Every bite was clean, rich, perfect. The sushi rice is incredible - light, sweet, perfect temperature and texture.The fish is fresh as can be, and painstakingly prepared.The menu changes daily, but I strongly recommend the oysters, the shishito peppers, the kabocha, hotate (scallop), and the wagyu. Beyond simple recommendations, I firmly demand that you order the madai (seabream), I had seconds of that one - wonderful texture, a little sweet, a little salty, ocean-y clean, delicious. Thanks to an order mixup, I also got a chance to try off menu Hokkaido uni, such a special treat! I was initially bummed that they don't offer cocktails, but sake and green tea were both lovely with the meal.

Nothing is more annoying than a curry that is diluted with water. Loved the veggies that added a fresh crunch factor and the beef was tasty as well.

They pointed out the bar, the merchandise table and the information table. They even mentioned that there would be a meet and greet after the show. More on that in a moment.

I walked around the lobby and sat for a while more before seating began. There were architectural plans for the set on display. Also, character and costume drawings. There was even a section for people to put on and get photographs of. This was all interesting and a great way to feel connected to the production. What piqued my interest the most was the collection of photographs which had nothing to do with the show. But there was a photo of David Hockney, an artist I am a fan of. There was even a photo of Andy Warhol. Cool stuff.

I made my way to my seat about 10 or 15 minutes before show time. It was enough time to get familiar with the set and the theatre as a whole. This is a nive small venue. More intimate and accessible than larger places like the Smith Center. I had a great seat in the fourth row dead center. I was practically at stage level. For sure one of the best seats in the house. Though I get the impression, based on size alone, there is not a bad seat to be found.

After nearly an hour of on stage action, there was a breif intermission followed by another 45 minutes of play time. It was a great production. Funny. Touching. Intense. A little bit frighening. I loved it. And the standing ovation at the end tells me that everbody else did too. 

With bows and the curtain call complete, the cast raced their way to the lobby ready to greet adoring fans like me. The cast were all gracious but we all wanted Armin. People were asking for autographs. A group of Trekkers, myself included, wanted a picture. He asked that we wait for the line to die down. We did wait and got our picture. A great way to end a fun evening.",2015-12-13 07:22:15

When we arrived at 5 o'clock there were very few diners, I'm pretty sure it was just us and two other couples. But as our meal went on the dining room quickly filled. We noshed on the bread basket while we waited for our appetizers, the blue corn muffin wasn't too appealing the bottom looked moldy. The fruit bread was the favorite, and I expected to like it least.

Then, we got started on our first course: Roasted Corn Soup Smoked Tomato Salsa and Blue Corn Pancake Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce. The soup was decent it had an unusual hint of flavor, I thought squash maybe, but my husband thought it tasted more like seafood. Obviously, we weren't on the same page. The blue corn pancake and duck were very tasty. Again, the blue corn does nothing for its appearance.

For the main course we had Blue Corn Crusted Halibut with Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 tomatoes, capers, jalapeno, Fresh Oregano, Basil and New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon -Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale Crushed Pecan Butter. The fish was nicely prepared, the presentation was different - thanks to the blue corn it looked liked it had asphalt glistening off the filet. The pork was flavorful as long as you had the crust in every bite. The tamale was unlike your traditional tamale, still tasty, however.

Lastly we finished with Coconut Layer Cake and Banana Cream Pie. Both were good, but nothing particularly memorable.

Service was very good throughout the meal. All in all, it was a fine meal, it's just that nothing was particularly notable. I can't say I'd return, but I'm happy we took the opportunity to finally give it a try.",2010-09-04 04:26:23

I love breakfast food, hate mornings, so I always end up enjoying it at night. Today was different since I actually woke up early enough on my day off to enjoy some eggs and coffee!!! My beau and I ordered: 

- spinach Benny 
- corned beef hash
- coffee 
- banana nut muffin

The spinach Benny is two poached eggs on top of Canadian bacon, spinach, and old English muffins covered in hollandaise sauce with a side of country potatoes. This was super tasty and the hollandaise was perfect and not too salty. The country potatoes were also deliciously golden crispy and perfectly seasoned. Mmm...
Corned beef hash was served with a side of potatoes as well, but my beau ordered a side of rice to mix the hash with. It makes a great combo. The hash was good, I just wish there was more meat!!! 
The banana nut muffins are always popular here, so it's no exception for me!! They're always nicely warm and sweet and perfect when you spread some butter on it. Gives it a nice balance of sweet and salty!! Pairs well with their coffee, and it's actually really good coffee. 

This will always be my favorite breakfast spot and it's reasonably priced too. Portions are generous (although I always finish my plate) and the staff is always friendly and attentive!

The concept is great and I like where this place is headed... just some minor tuning in taste would make it a perfect 5 star place to eat healthy food.

It was a Sunday afternoon and I was going to try Gerardo's one more time but ended up they were closed. The led display said they had another location at Decatur and Sahara so headed up there with hopes they had later hours. Well I never did find the other Gerardo's location but accidentally stumbled on Gq and the sign says open till 7pm, hooray! 

The vibe in Gq is hip-hop with a touch of school barber that made me think I was in the right place. While I didn't have an appointment I was sat right away and my barber started the consultation. He made suggestions about how to cut my hair, shape my beard etc.. with quiet and steadfast execution I got one of the most precise fades and beard trims Ive had in Vegas. Completely awesome! I felt like a new man walking out of there and ya know what, both the haircut and beard trim were $25. 

BRING CASH! They have a cash only policy! Also if F bombs offend you this might not be a place you'd want to check out. The banter between the barbers was pretty funny though some might find it offensive.

To avoid the 3 hour wait that we had back in February, my friends and I decided to invite a couple to join us for dinner. It was our annual Christmas in July and we were really set on eating here when we did our Secret Santa gift exchange. As we would be going on a Saturday evening, we needed to have a party of 6 to make a reservation. Thus we invited a couple to join us.

Unfortunately, our friends had double booked dinners and decided to back out of ours.... This led to panic and mayhem. I let the restaurant know that our party had actually decreased in size, despite having confirmed our reservation the night before, and that we were willing to wait for a table but would like to know how long the wait time would be. THEY WERE SO AMAZING, they KEPT our reservation!! We were very thrilled to not have to wait at all!

The service from the waitstaff was equally amazing. We were seated in the back half of the restaurant, so closer to the food, which was perfect for us. We didn't get as good a view of the dance and drum performance, but frankly, we were good without it. It wasn't our first visit, and we've seen the performance several times before. We were brought all the juiciest dishes and when we requested certain items, they remembered to bring them by our table. Our dirty plates were constantly being replaced and our water was topped up every time we emptied a carafe.

I think it's a bit funny that we all went in looking forward to certain dishes and came away enjoying other dishes a bit more than the ones we went in for. I found the salmon to be a bit overcooked this time. My favourites were the Top Sirloin and the Parmesan Filet Mignon. I liked the Chimichurri Steak as well. I really liked the cornbread, and found the deep friend banana and roasted pineapple to be good as well.

We definitely planned for our meal better this time, although I felt full the rest of the night. Will definitely be back, although I think we would all like to try out the other location at some point as well.",2015-08-02 18:32:57

My fiancé and I were in Las Vegas for a week on a work trip. We decided to attend the Wednesday night 7 PM show. I knew a few of their swings were going on, but we did not care. We ended up getting VIP tickets because they were very reasonably priced. We got there about 10 minutes early and were escorted to the VIP lounge. After sitting down and breathing in the performance environment, I decided I wanted to go get drinks. If you have a table you can order drinks from the table, but only by the bottle. I don't think we were feeling that frisky on a Wednesday night. I left and got a glass of wine, a beer, and a bag of popcorn for about $38 plus tip. I returned and the show was starting. The show is very energetic. The three leading ladies are Juliet from ""Romeo and Juliet,"" Shatine from ""Moulin Rouge,"" and Daisy from ""The Great Gatsby."" All of the performers are very talented. There are some characters who both dance and sing, others you can tell they hired as a dancer or only a singer. They work well as an ensemble. The show came together quite nicely. The only negative aspect is that if you don't know the story-lines, it can get very confusing as they perform each story simultaneously at times. The characters are also very hard to figure out until about halfway through the show. If I didn't have knowledge about each of the three pieces, I would've been very confused. If you were there just to be entertained, this is definitely the show for you. For less than $200 my fiancé and I got VIP tickets that's including the fees. Plus about $40 worth of concessions. It is a fun date night. The show, itself runs about 90 minutes with no intermission. I like that part because I hate intermissions. There are bathrooms right outside so make sure to use it before the show starts so you don't miss a beat! They use music from each of the three Baz movies so if you're familiar with the material you'll definitely enjoy it. Again it's sort of confusing because sometimes they will play music from one show and have the characters from the other show on stage. Overall, as long as you follow each one of the leading ladies you should be able to figure it out. At the end of the show, be sure to visit the wall where the actors Headshots are. It's nice to know who you saw perform. Show them support because they work their butts off! Shout-out to all of them. Also, great choreography! Enjoy!",2017-10-29 23:10:22

I had the Shahi Chicken which is chicken breast kabob + a beef patty (shami), with rice and salad. It's a decent amount of food for $12.99. I live near many Iranian eateries so I find this price on point in comparison. Taste wise, it's good. The chicken was very tender and flavorful. The beef patty was also flavorful. 

There are a few minor strikes against, but none of these would rule the place out for me. In combination it's only minus 1 star. I would have given this place 4 stars otherwise. a) The rice I found a bit oily. I came late so maybe I got the rice at the bottom of the pot with a higher concentration of oil than expected. b) Secondly, I thought the chicken pieces were a bit small. Naan & Kabob in Sauga as i remember has massive pieces of chicken breast. c) The last little thing that erked me was that the bread didn't feel fresh, which I suspect again is because I came very late.

Some I liked and some I didn't but that's just taste preference I could tell that everything was fresh and was packed with flavor. The one thing I was was that it was more customisable.

The decor inside was very cute and they offer a ton of ice cream flavor options (don't forget to walk past the cash register to check out the flavors further back in the store). The cute older woman behind the counter was very helpful and friendly, and the portion size was humongous. I got one scoop of the mint chocolate chip in a cake cone (I know, predictable...but it's my favorite) and my boyfriend got a cup with two scoops of cookie dough and chocolate syrup on the top. We both liked our choices but mentioned that there could have been more chocolate chips/cookie dough chunks in our respective flavors. Cost for these two items was a bit steep at $9, but I understand due to the location. 

With parking a-plenty and tons of ice cream, sundae, and smoothie options, this is a great place to hit up on a warm southern evening.",2011-03-25 12:52:04

Check out the monkey bar if you want a quick drink before dinner or just hanging around the hotel. The prices of cocktails were fairly priced. Happy about that. The margarita I had was really good. The bartender didn't know what kind of tequilas he had, and even the ones he named weren't good ones.

Usually do dinner there with friends every two months or so and have been doing so for 10+ years.  There are five of us and we always order 1 1/2 pounds of pork fajitas, nothing like being in a rut, but they're the best so why switch. I thought it was finally time to write a review.

Last night was no different, same time, same place and same order. We were seated quickly in a large both. Chips and salsa to start with sodas and iced tea for all. Chips are OK and the salsa has just enough kick. Placed our order with what turned out to be the BEST server we've ever had at Fajitas, Tiana. We've never had poor service at Fajitas, but Tiana was above and beyond. Always a smile, drink glasses never got below half before she brought another refill and our order came out spot-on. Tiana kept checking back and brought everything before we had to ask, that's good service! Pork fajitas didn't disappoint and come with fresh tortias and more as needed.

If you want great Fajitas this is the place to go. I can't comment on any other food items because I've never tried anything else. I kind of have my favorite places to go depending on what I'd like to eat.",2014-09-13 17:02:18

While it doesn't match the quality of other bao places, it's still a respectable option without the need of going far for those of us in the Markham/Richmond Hill area and I appreciate that. 

Before I breakdown the individual items, the overall flavour theme is SWEET and SALTY. If you don't like that combination, then you probably won't like these or the entire concept of these restaurants. For me, I love these two flavours. Some might think it's too much. Especially if you get the bulgogi, then it's the sweetness of the bulgogi, adding on top of the sweetness of the kimchi, the sauce, the carrots, AND the bao. Like everything is sweet! 

Japanese fried chicken bao - not karaage, it's more like panko breaded chicken. Served with a sweet soy based sauce.

Battered fish - probably the better one of the two. Light and crunchy fish that contrasts the baos well with mayo. It was less intense in flavour in a good way than the others due to the lack of a sweet sauce.

Bulgoggi Bahn Mi - really enjoyed this. It was packed with ingredients. A good amount of sweet bulgogi, with kimchi, carrots, raddish, jalapeños, corn, cucumbers and more. The bread was toasted crisp and the entire thing packed some serious sweet and salty flavour. 

Bulgogi kimchi fries - okay but way too salty. Don't know what made the fries so salty. Also, I expected better fries, it was a tad cold and were frozen fries. I like my fries freshly cut with the skin on - see Bahn Mi Boys kimchi fries. Otherwise, there was a healthy amount of toppings.

All in all, it's a bao time is a pretty decent fast food place to get these 'fusion' baos and Bahn Mi although some improvements would be welcome.",2016-04-17 21:12:01

It's a total goddamn shithole, which is totally the reason you have to go there. The casino looks like it was built out of a mobile trailer and the customers have been bred up along with the buildings. My memory tells me that it was the first place I saw the mysterious appeal of 'penny slots'.

The reason you go here is because of the Sourdough Cafe, which serves cheap food (3.99 steak and eggs is only blasphemy because they changed it to a real-ish looking steak sauced in that faux charcoal flavoring that Burger King uses and before they did, it was 2.99.) 

It's open 24 hours. There is keno, and strange people, like the guy who overheard our conversation and informed us that testicles was a lot more polite than balls. Or the OTHER guy who stopped to talk about how much he too loved Jack Kirby, and was working on bringing live women's mud-wrestling to the Strip.

The buffet is utter shit, which makes the Circus Circus buffet sound appealing. There also used to be a gourmet room, believe it or not, which did pretty decent staples like Fillet Mignon and stuffed salmon. I liked it, but it was above the budget and heads of the usual suspects and so it got replaced with an Outback Steakhouse, which closed very shortly after it opened.

I also note that there is a vintage coin-op ""The Simpsons"" in the tiny closet-sized arcade which costs a quarter to play. Enjoy.",2008-01-25 02:41:21

We had noticed The Pitt Stop on our last foray into Bellevue and I was looking forward to trying some BBQ that was close to my home.  We walked into the restaurant and found a place to order in front or us, about 5 tables and a soda cooler.  The menu was behind the glass where you ordered and there was also a whiteboard that had the sides and BBQ sauces that were available listed.

After debating between the pulled pork sandwich and the brisket platter for lunch I ultimately decided on the platter. I ended up choosing sides of Mac and cheese and haluski and the honey bourbon BBQ sauce for my brisket.  My father ended up choosing the fish sandwich and haluski.    We then took a seat and about 15 minutes we heard ""order up"" and I went to the front to grab our food.  I started off by digging into the brisket which is usually my favorite BBQ meat.  Unfortunately about 1/3 of it was pure fat which on top of the smallish portion left me not too happy.  The BBQ sauce was equally disappointing as while I could taste a little sweetness to it, I didn't get much else.  After finishing that up I moved onto my Mac and cheese.  It was cold and consisted of a farfalle pasta in a cheese sauce.  It was an ok Mac and cheese which i think would have benefitted greatly from a cheesier sauce and being warm.  Last but not least was the haluski.  This easily ended up being the best part of the meal as it was piping hot, tasty and soaked in butter. 

The bottom line for me is that I might head here again in the future but it wouldn't be my first choice.  My brisket and sauce were definitely underwhelming as was the Mac and cheese but I really enjoyed the haluski.",2015-09-02 23:56:26

It is likely that if you aren't looking for it then you'll probably miss it. The shopping center is also quite dingy and when I walked in Tay Do I began to get a bit scared by the lack of customers patronizing the joint. It also left a lot to be desired from first sight. 

But, fortunately this is one of those ""don't judge a book by its cover"" type of restaurants. Although it certainly isn't the best Pho I've had, I can vouch for the fact that it is still quite good. A good hot bowl of Pho is like medicine for your soul and this place filled that gap for me.

I personally am a fan of the Pho Ga, but many things on the menu are good. Most of them need some additional cilantro, lime or sarachi, but all of those things are available, so you'll be more than happy with the meal. 

The only thing I was not overly impressed with were the Spring Rolls. Although I am a huge fan of mound and mounds of cilantro in my food, these over did it by a bit. 

However, spring rolls aside, the food is great and the staff are very friendly. Take a gamble and go visit.

I'd recommend trying the shrimp tacos! They've been the staple of each of my visits here, which has to count for something. The entree comes with 3 tacos that are overflowing with flavor: succulent, lightly-breaded shrimp tucked into a bed of purple cabbage & diced mango, which are tied together with a delicious jalepeno cream sauce & salsa.

My only critique is with the appetizers... The complimentary chips & salsa are perfect, but I've tried both the corn & the queso now and they both fell flat in my opinion. The corn tasted soggy or cooked in a pot of water for too long, while the queso was extremely hard to eat. The cheese it was made of wasn't nearly melty enough to easily scoop up with a chip or bit of tortilla. Kinda disappointing to me, but the other entrees make it easy to overlook.",2017-04-03 21:03:30

That said, this place definitely toppled me. I went in with a couple friends and my girlfriend after a rough Friday night. 15 dollar bottomless mimosas (which the server refilled, even after we overstayed our welcome...) and something they call ""mash browns"" which seem to be hash browns on a bed of mashed potatoes. Both crunchy and creamy (a combination I rarely enjoy) this unique side dish is what I remembered most about MTO. 

The decorations are cool, it's definitely a ""hip"" type of bar/brunch place. You're bound to overhear some goatee'd gladhander talk about his worthless sales job, or the blonde bombshell reminiscing about the night she can't remember. Comes with the territory.

The lamb riblets are coated with cumin and other spices, quick fried and then wok-fried with whole dried chilies, Szechwan numbing red peppercorns and caramelized onions.  This is a finger-lickin' tasty dish which you have to eat with your fingers unless you have amazing chopstick skills. 

The Water Boiled dishes are a famous Szechwan classic which I don't know why I haven't ordered until today.  The plain name is quite misleading.  It's a clear soup boiled with an insane amount of chilies, more numbing peppercorns, Napa cabbage, a little celery, fermented beans and garnished with sprigs of coriander.  You have choice of meat and we chose fish today.  The filets are coated with cornstarch and quickfried to preserve it's moisture and tenderness before adding to the stew.  This is by far the spiciest and most flavorful dish I've had here so far.  I think I'm hooked.

Let me stress that this restaurant excels at authentic Szechwan food, not American-style Chinese dishes or even Cantonese dishes.  Although the xiao long bao (Shanghainese soup buns) were surprisingly good.  I wonder if they share some dishes with the Shanghainese restaurant on the other side of Ranch Market, which was extremely quiet in contrast to Szechwan Palace which was packed with a weekday office lunch crowd.",2008-07-03 21:21:13

MMMM, Meat!!

Cons:
Line ups can be long

Came here after a day at Taiwanfest on the recommendation of a friend and was totally not disappointed!  It's hard to find BBQ places like this in general these days.  So to find one this good is always a blessing!

As soon as you come in, you will basically walk right up into the line up.  It's that busy here.  You won't be assigned a seat here.  You come in, order, and then find any seat that's available.  There's a large patio outside and some seats with a bar inside.

They have a pretty simple menu here but everything they do here, they do very well.  We came as a group of 4 with 3 children so we ordered a bunch of things to try them as much as possible. We ordered the brisket, side ribs, beef ribs turkey and a bunch of sides.  Just look at the pics I took.  Me trying to describe everything just wouldn't do it justice.  It's all done very well.  Even the mac and cheese and home fries are so good!!  The beef rib here is a mammoth piece of meat. There's no way around that, give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed.

The service here is very friendly.  The servers go around chatting everyone up.  It's a very homey atmosphere here.  I was surprised to see how kid friendly this place was as well. We didn't have any trouble eating here with 3 children.  The music on the patio can be a bit loud though, so eating inside is the way to go if you have little ones with you.

I love this place.  These places are few and far between so when you find a great one, it's a great feeling.  I'm definitely coming back whenever I'm in the area and feeling like BBQ.",2016-09-09 11:40:52

We ordered queso fundido to start. It was the perfect spiciness/creaminess/cheesiness blend. Actually, it was probably my favorite part of the meal. Also included with the meal was a set of three salsas--including a green salsa which I adored. 

I ordered cheese enchiladas with both red and green enchilada sauces on the side. They were both really good! I preferred the green because I love tomatillos like a fat kid loves cake, which is almost as much as I love rap songs that are ten years old.

They give you 3 tacos in a corn tortilla filled with crispy fish and cabbage slaw, avocado, and cilantro. The tortillas are apparently Reyna's tortillas which is the taco stand down the street which means they're freshly made corn tortillas. The tacos are a bit on the pricey end for the size of the tacos. $17 for three fish tacos.

The burger is probably worth more the price of $12. It's topped with all my favorite condiments: pickles, sunnyside up egg, avocado, tomato, and bacon. Also comes with Kaya chips which seems to be a mixture of potato chips and plantain chips.

My only complaint is the way they handle seating and reservations. It's pretty hard to come here without a reservation. Even if the restaurant is empty you might not be able to get in without a reservation.

They did accommodate us this one time when we had an extra person than what we originally said when we made a reservation.

number 1 on blogto's best chicken wings in Toronto...maybe...

I had really high hopes eating here after becoming friends with someone who comes here on an almost weekly basis ""you gotta try it, you have to"" so I was in the area for a film premier and some time to kill so I figured hey why not. 

the lengthy establishment is very dark on the inside, which is ok for some but to me It felt very moody from the moment I walked in, eh I'm here for the wings. had a seat at the bar and had a once over on the menu, I was fascinated with how much food options physically were on the menu, settled with my favorite started calamari, poutine and for the main event was some wings with a Greek wrap. the calamari was the best item I ordered, and ironically enough was the first item to come to the table. I'm not sure what they do to make that sauce for the calamari but DAMN good dipping sauce, told the waitress she should bottle it, that got a cute chuckle. the poutine was very bland, stock gravy, frozen fries(Cavendish I believe) the cheese was good though. before I was able to finish off the poutine and calamari, my Greek wrap came to the table, I was neutral with the wrap the sauce/dressing on the inside was a bit of a turn off to me, before I could finish that plate my hot wings showed up. 

full disclosure: not the best wings in Toronto...I'd even go so far to say that these wings are very lackluster. not a lot of meat to these wings, I was way too excited for this, I was anticipating buffalo chicken wings which was not the case at all. the wing sauce was pretty hot and delicious though, this much I will give duffs credit. 

the service is great, the drinks are strong and cold and other then the calamari, the food was not worth what was being charged at the end of the day. 

parking is street side with a couple of pay for parking lots in a short walking distance. transit is the 506 college streetcar and the 511 Bathurst streetcar with a short walk along college.

But this year was different...

This year we sorta flipped out when we tasted our creme brulees. We ordered a few pumpkin and then got a ton of different flavors so we could try them all. 

We sat in a circle and just passed them around going to town. They were all amazing. The winners though, were the classic vanilla and chocolate. As in, the kids were licking the containers. We didn't even think the kids would like them but they couldn't get enough. 

We loved it so much we are even doing it twice- Christmas here we come! 

I had the order delivered to my work, it came wrapped in a bow with an adorable re-usable container full of raw sugar for flaming. We used the broiler because our torch was out of gas and it turned out wonderful. I did a test on one of the brulees to get the hang of it.

The service was excellent 5 stars not a single let down there, but the food was sloppy and not as impressive as the Mastro's City Halll location so a 2 star we've had better for sure. 
We started with the Wedge which was good but soggy we love the firm crispness, chunks of bleu cheese and bacon that highlight this salad, however this wedge was sopped in a creamy bleu cheese rather than a chunky dressing with lots of hard boiled eggs that overpowered the salad but the bacon was generous so ....
The gnocchi with king crab and black truffles, a favorite dish of ours, was gummy and we found pieces shell in ours. We know this can happen and to be honest at least that assured the crab meat was fresh and not imitation but still we were not happy with this dish. Normally the two of us finish this side but even our party of four passed and we left over half untouched. 
The porterhouse was grilled to a perfect medium rare, but lacked flavor. My daughter ordered the chefs special, Bronzini ( Mediterranean Sea bass ) in capers and butter sauce but the fish was over cooked and dry. Disappointing. 
On the bright side, our son loved his clam chowder. 
We also brought in a bottle of Bella Glos 2014 Pinot Noir Dairyman, one of our favs but AZ law prohibits outside alcohol so no corkage fee obviously. No problem. They serve this bottle as well at $220 - mark up to be expected. 
The complimentary dessert that we were surprised with at the end of our meal, a rich chocolate and raspberry, thick slice of cake and house made whipped cream made for a delicious ending. 
We chose Mastro's as a celebratory location in appreciation to our Navy Veteran as he gives us his best and although HE was so appreciative and surprised I felt our visit to Mastro's City Hall far surpassed Mastro's Ocean Club, hence the difference in reviews.

  I'll take Verrazano over the Subway. Verrazano is a New York pizzaria and sub restaurant named after the World famous suspension bridge connecting Brooklyn to Staten Island. It is a slice of the Big Apple in Bright Light City. It is not their New York pizza but their delicious New York style eggplant parmesan sub that has kept me returning. 

  This Verrazano is located at the southwest corner of Eastern and Windmill in the Smith's-anchored shopping center. As soon as you step inside the small restaurant, you leave Las Vegas for a mom and pop pizza shop. The white walls are covered with pictures of New York City memorbelia. The red booths resemble the New York pizzaria. The scent of baking pizza permeates the small restaurant. The owner, an older man with a grey mustache reminds me of a New York pizzaria owner east of the Hudson River. 

  I have been a regular the past couple of months. The first time I dined here was on a Saturday evening after work.  I made the trip for the eggplant parmesan sub. At the time, they were out of it. So, I went for two slices of New York style pizza with mushrooms. The pizza was good and could give some New York pizzarias a run for the money. The owner was personable referring to me and his customers as ""friend."" He only charged me for the lunch special. A week later, I made another attempt to try their eggplant parmesan sub. They were not out. This is the equivalent of a New York eggplant parmesan sub with thick slices of egg plant, mouth watering melted parmesan cheese, and toasted bread. It was so delicious that I'd return a few more times. When the owner was here he'd greet me by saying, ""hello friend."" He'd only charge 50 cents for the fountain Pepsi. Usually the hero took ten minutes, which was well worth it. I'd entertain myself looking up at the overhead TV which played anything from basketball to Cops or looked down at the free Las Vegas newspapers or my phone. The baking that took place in the kitchen put a nice potpourri throughout the room. The last time I returned here, the same owner that called me friend on past visits, didn't greet me or talk to me. When I walked in somebody else took my order and when I handed my Pepsi cup to the owner for a top off, he didn't say anything to me. And this time, I overheard him telling a customer that they ran out of pizza slices. At any rate, I don't visit Verrazano for commaderie.  I make the trip here for one of the dearest foods in my life: the eggplant parmesan sub. 

  I am a fan of the delicious eggplant parmesan sub. Disparate from Subway and Port of Subs where they seem to be in almost every major shopping mall, there are currently few restaurants in Las Vegas that serve eggplant parmesan subs. How many New York pizzarias are there in Vegas? There are only a percentage of this small number that serve eggplant parmesan subs. On account of the fact that  Verrazano is one of the few restaurants serving eggplant parmesan subs, someday I plan to return for more.",2015-04-06 06:31:17

Iif you're not a fan of spicy, don't order the latter or you will be verbally screaming. The garlic noodles are also fantastic. My friend Greg loves the skewers.

Fried Oreos and green tea ice cream. You can't go wrong with that.

Pisces also runs a M-F lunch special of all you eat sushi. Sunday nights they offer $3 Stoli flavors, half price bottles of wine on Mondays and half price martinis on Tuesdays. The drink menu is incredible and imaginative. The latest creation: an avocado martini. I love avocados as much as the next person... but in my drink? I was skeptical, but I must say it is delicious.

They are extremely personable and conscientious, so it's always a treat to have them greet you when you are perusing the store.

I would agree with another review that urbAna reflects that of Anthroplogie without the clothes, BUT when I was in a few days ago, there were a few tanks for sale that benefited a charity. They also have adorable cooking aprons for both adults and kiddos. 

Sometimes, they do have crafting sessions, reminiscent of ""live"" Pinterest sessions. I'm not sure how often they do that now. Anyway, check out this store! You won't be disappointed. I always find unique gifts for my mother-in-law who has absolutely everything!!",2016-12-28 17:59:29

I called very last minute to see if I could get in after 8 for a tan since I was going on a date with my sweetie the next night.  I have a regular lady I see elsewhere but our schedules don't always mesh so I was hoping to have a second person to be able to see.  Glo is within walking distance of my salon so I was super jazzed that she could get me in.  She said she had an opening either 815 or 830, I said I would shoot for the 830 just to be safe since I wasn't getting off of work until 8. I arrive at 8:20 and am told she is just getting ready to spray one person but will be able to get to me in 15 minutes or so.  No problem.  About 10 minutes later another customer walks in.  In the 15 minute time frame she is done spraying the girl before me.  After she checks out that girl she said to the other customer that came in after me, ""the room will be ready for you in a minute.""  What?  I thought I was next?  Nope.  She takes the other girl in and when I ask why, I am told there is some kind of computer malfunction and she is backed  up.  I get that, it has happened to me.  But the fact that she told me I was next then took someone else who came in after me is totally lame.  If I would have waited some more my total wait time would have been 40+ minutes.  That is unacceptable in my book.  She did offer to give me a tan for free to make up for the mix-up but the bottom line was I needed it before tonight.  I asked if she had an early morning appt and was told no so I said I would pass on the offer.  Now if it was me I would have brought my happy ass to work 15 minutes earlier to make this right but that wasn't offered.  I was pretty irritated on my drive home so I called and left a message asking if it would be possible for her to accommodate me in the morning.  I didn't even get a call back.
I don't like writing bad reviews, but I really don't like bad customer service even more.  The problem could have been avoided if I was told from the very beginning that there were 2 clients ahead of me, not 1 when I got there. I got the feeling that she wasn't sure if the other person was coming or not but took her first because she is a regular.  I could have been placated if she came in 15 minutes earlier this morning.  I have customers all the time ask if there is a spray tanning place that I know of close to my salon.  I don't ever send people somewhere without trying it out, guess I will keep looking...",2011-05-11 14:19:39

Mi Tierra Restaurant is our Fifth Stop for our November Crawl!

There is still hope to find some Authentic Colombian and Latin American Food in Toronto! Mi Tierra gave me hope.... As I tasted their Hot Sauce which was so spicy...hot...and left me with this burning sensation!

Sancocho ($5.99) -  A traditional Latin American soup, made with chunks of beef, green plantain and casava
- Really light and tangy broth

Arepa con Sausage ($4)
- One of the best Arepa and Sauage I ate in Toronto to date!
- moist and have wonderful bite and so flavourable

Bandeja Tipica ($11.99)  - A traditional Colombian dish of grilled beef, beans seasoned with sauteed tomatoes and maduro (fried plantain) chicharron (bacon) and rice topped with a fried egg
- I felt I might be in a food coma if I ate the whole plate by myself
- Fried pork was fatty and tender, cripy outside and soft inside
- Steak was cooked well, marinated with just the right flavoured and not overcooked or dry at all!

Brevas Con Queso ($3.50) - Figs And Cheese 
- Traditional Colombian dessert
- Figs and Cheese never my first choice for dessert but it was surprising good!

Mi Tierra's decor is loud, colourful and right in your face! The waitresses are friendly and smiley. I really felt like I was dining in one of those little family restaurants in Central America!

Being honest about the diagnosis of a car is only half the battle.  Being honest about pricing is just as important.  And these guys totally failed.

Implying that technicians who charge less than them are somehow lower quality is just bullshit, plain and simple.

They wanted to charge us more than $600 to put on new brake rotors and pads.  Retail for those parts?  About $150.  Hours it takes to swap them out?  One, or two, at the most.

Naturally, when I called them and sounded like I actually knew what I was talking about, they knocked $150 off the price they offered my wife.  Still not good enough.  It was $300 cheaper to tow our car all the way to our trusted Mesa mechanic and have him do the work.

Oh, and the inspection we used a Groupon for?  They charged us for services that i later found out were supposed to be part of the Groupon.  Going to call them today to try and get a refund for that $30 (?!)  tire rotation.

Hate to rag on a local business, but the only way this could've gone worse would've been if they straight up lied about problems with the car.",2010-07-21 14:44:19

My pedicure also included a neck/shoulder massage. The way she massaged my hands, feet, legs, neck, and shoulders was well worth the price. I felt amazing. She didn't cut me or do a messy job.

I decided to go with the shrimp and pork wonton soup - which is actually soup as opposed to the other ""soup"" options which specify ""steamed"".  And also ordered the hot spicy wonton noodles under the ""dry noodles"" section of the menu.  

On retrospect I should have ordered one or the other because it was wonton overload and generally food overload, I barely made a dent in either and had plenty to take home.  That being said, I enjoyed the soup and was able to eat about 2 of the wontons.  I was imagining a small bowl of soup but this could dish feed a family of 4 or more!

I wasn't in to the hot wonton noodle dish.  I got the wide flat noodles (as opposed to the thin rice noodles) so not sure if that made a huge difference because it was the flavor that didn't make me swoon.  You can definitely physically feel the heat of the dish but I didn't think there was much flavor.  I was sweating and my mouth was reacting to the spice but it was spicy hot as opposed to spicy flavorful.  Perhaps the name of the dish makes sense then.

I would be curious to go back and try something else.",2014-08-27 16:42:34

I live in the NW so Kensington was the target area. There are a lot of options but in the end, we decided to go with good ole burger and fries.

Burger 320 more recently got rid of their waffles and chicken options. They still, of course have burgers as well as fries, box of shrooms, milkshakes, gelato and some other desserts available. I noticed that they moved some things around at this location so there's more room for seating.

When we arrived, there was another table occupied but not busy at all. We browsed the small menu and went with a burger and fries each. A went with a Burger 320 where she could choose her fixings and sauce and went with an order of parmigiano garlic fries. I went with the Gladys Ridge burger with a side of extra crispy truffle parmigiano fries and we had a seat while we waited.

It didn't take too long as we were the only ones who ordered so everything came out freeesssshhh! I immediately munched on my truffle fries as they were so fragrant. The fries were freshly cut ands were nice and crispy (as ordered) I wish they had more of a truffle flavor, I found the smell to be more powerful than the taste - good nonetheless. My burger came with sautéed mushrooms, cheese curds, truffle aioli and arugula. The buns are house made branded with '320', the first thing I noticed was the bun.....she thiiiiiiiick!!! I picked the burger up and it was hard to take a bite out of everything because of how thick the bun was. Bun alone is good - soft and fluffy. After making my way to the patty, it was alright. The patty is a bit thinner than some other burger places I've visited and there didn't seem to be much flavor. The truffle aioli wasn't strong enough to really notice it but the cheese curds were nicely melted and stringy. The argula and mushrooms were good but it wasn't a memorable burger for me. A ate her burger but wasn't wow'd by it either. Her parmigiano garlic fries looked very similar to my truffle fries, I thought they made a mistake. Sure enough it was the aioli that is the only difference - I imagined there would have been actual minced garlic and parsley throughout the fries but that's just me. 

Overall, food was good but nothing spectacular. Being a burger place and seeing their Instagram page, I had high expectations. I wished the burger patty was more flavorful and juicy and that the burger bun:patty ratio was more even. Also, it would have been nice if the bun was toasted. I can't see myself returning for a burger but I would definitely order some crispy fresh cut fries.",2018-01-15 22:05:52

The place is small, but has a charming neighborhood butcher feel with a touch of hipster trendiness.  The prices for all of their cuts of meat seamed very reasonable and they had a wide selection.  

We decided to try some of the house made sausages and got three each of the chipotle raspberry chicken, and three of the blueberry jalapeno maple (pork based).  Each sausage is about 1/3 of a pound and you can customize your order with any of about 6 available varieties and an additional 10 or so varieties which require 24 hours advanced order.  

They had a big basket of what looked like roasted cow bones and as we were headed to our friend's dog's birthday party later in the day, couldn't pass up picking up a big knee joint for the pooch.  The total four two pounds of sausage and the dog bone was about 15 bucks.

Both of the flavors of sausage were delicious and easy to grill.  I preferred the blueberry jalapeno maple as it had savory yet balanced flavors and was wonderfully juicy.  The chicken sausage was on the lean side which made it somewhat dry, but still with great flavor.  The chicken one was the spicier of the two.

Between home and business, we have 7 vehicles, so I was excited when this car wash opened so close to work. I had them do an economy wash a couple of times and they did an average job.

On the third time, I was on my way to an appointment with a client and my card had just been on vacation, so it was pretty dirty on the inside. Like an idiot... I let them pressure me into the $32.95 upgrade this time. The outside of the car was just average and the inside of the car was absolutely terrible. It looks like all they did was barely vacuum the mats. Console, dash, everything looked untouched. I didn't have time to have it fixed, so just lived with it. Here's the sad part... I was the only car there and they had about 5 guys all working on it... so I expected it would turn out great.

I didn't want to give them a negative review, so I emailed the company to tell them of my experience. Their response was to have the manager of the location call me and offer to re-do the wash.

Although I have yet to try many of the things at Jean-Marc's, including a croissant comparison across the two bakeries, I will say that my one experience with bread at Jean-Marc's does not hold a candle to La Gourmandine's baguette.

Their sandwiches are also delicious.  The other day, I accidentally schlepped down Butler to have one of their amazing sandwiches for lunch while they were on vacation, and I'm not sure I've ever been so disappointed upon arriving at a closed food venue before.

Everything they sell is quite reasonably priced.  I am appreciating that much more now that another bakery (Gaby et Jules) with much higher prices has opened.  On Saturday and Sunday mornings, expect reasonably long lines (up until about 11:30am or so).",2012-09-18 19:57:42

It's a cute place that offers Brazilian food.  The lunch menu is a bit limited but for a person like me that gets overwhelmed by too many choices that was just fine for me.  The servers were all very pleasant and extremely polite - I was impressed.

I ordered the bean soup (forgot the name but it comes in a glass and not a bowl) and the cod croquettes.  My friend ordered the french toast.  My cod were extremely salty....so much so I couldn't finish it.  The soup was ok but a tiny bit bland.  It had black beans in it with some steamed kale and you are given an orange slice to eat afterwards as a palate cleanser.  However my friend raved about her french toast which more looked like croissant toast with some chocolate drizzled on - she licked the plate clean!  

They seem to serve traditional Brazilian food here so I am curious to try some of their other offerings (dinner menu).",2016-02-02 13:25:34

At first we planned to get only a nice purple dress shirt for my husband. But while I was waiting for him I found a nice blouse that had elephants graphic on it.  It's compatible with a graphic dress. I tried them on. They matched! I love it! It's modern Thai style :)  It's very convenient for us because it's in our neighbour.   I don't need to fly back to Thailand to get one ;D

I check out Winners sometime for men's shirts  because Winners has brands on sale. They are good quality and are affordable.  I rarely buy clothes for myself here.   Anyway, I started to check women's cloths here lately because I found nice sweaters only $20-$30 and other pretty stuff for women like cosmetic bags, cosmetic organizers etc. 

Funny story when I was shopping here:  I asked a staff member to check how my husband was doing in the men's fitting room.  She said it was Men's room so..she didn't know.. Haha I knew she was afraid I would peak at all the men trying out their clothes in there!  Did I!?",2015-09-16 03:49:19

Tried it on a weekday a few months ago and it was so-so but I could tell there was potential. Selection on weekends is way better than the weekday. They had my one of my favorites: steamed brown sugar cake (""Ma Lai Go"") which I have not seen done right in a long time, even in Hong Kong. Color was a perfect brown and it was beautifully soft and spongey (it looks like a sponge too) and the flavor was not artificial like I've had so often.

I was almost as excited to see a pan-frying cart meaning a cart with hotplate where they pan-fry stuff like radish cake, chive dumplings and rice noodles to order.  Haven't seen that since Hong Kong and LA. This is huge as my major pet peeve with other places is that food gets cold as it makes the rounds on the cart.  The chive shrimp dumplings were wonderfully chivey and crispy on the outside while soft & moist inside.

Then the baked cart came around with buns I've never seen before. They let us mix and match any 3 so we picked a taro bun, ""snow"" bun with a milky filling and delicate crunchy white top, and a pineapple bun (pineapple refers to the appearance only) with custard filling. The snow bun is new to me and was absolutely delicious.

They're promoting all dimsum items that fall under category A, B or C for $2.25 each (B & C usually cost $3 or more).

SZAq0NN1rxEtgScJU7HPFQ,QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,N6BDiFk2CyJTMPGUlcOfAg,2,12,5,9,"Boy, looks sure can be deceiving...

Walking into Jackie Bee, you might think you're in a new modern style cafe, rather than a boba shop. Located in the Charleston Festival plaza, this new spot is open, appears clean and is decked out with decent looking furniture and several flat screen TV's. 6 of those TV's are home to the menu which features several boba drinks and a decent amount of food options, including bento boxes.

After standing around and checking out the menu for a few minutes, the girl behind the counter asked if we had been there before. We had not, so she said they had some suggestions of popular items...which ended up just being two things, the Chrysanthemum Milk Tea and the Ice-Cream Ball Coffee Jelly Milk Tea. Both seemed pretty straight forward, but she didn't bother to explain anything in anyway or offer any other help. I was also disappointed that she just offered the people in front of us a 10% discount for them just opening, but didn't mention the same deal to us. She was nice enough, but the counter service is basically nonexistent for the most part. 

I ended up ordering an Oolong Milk Tea with boba and a KungPao Chicken bento box. The bento box is priced just under $9 and includes meat, a side of greens and fried rice. Going off the flavors and textures alone, nothing appeared to be freshly made. The fried rice had virtually no flavor on its own and seemed more like something you'd get out of the freezer. Unfortunately, the chicken was just as bad and had this awful flavor that tasted like burnt soy sauce. Overall it was just a really bad plate of food and I ended up not finishing it. Thankfully my drink was much better and even half price since I ordered a combo meal. The milk tea was flavorful, not overly sweet, and the boba was very decent. A little chewy, but not soggy or slimy.

My biggest issue with the drinks here is their regular teas. Our 6 year old son has quite possibly the simplest drink order you could make. He gets a plain ole' black iced tea with boba. No sweetener, no flavors, nothing...just tea and boba. When I asked the girl if they offered a tea like that, she said yes and punched his order in. Yet when we got his drink, it had this extremely strong orange flavor and was really sweet. When I took it back and asked if this was right, she said it was and that this was there house tea, but because I ordered unsweetened that's how it tastes. I was confused as she just told me the tea was plain and unsweetened only 5 minutes before that. She offered a generic apology and basically sent me on my way. I didn't bother wasting anymore money on ordering another drink.

Another strange thing about this place is their neighboring business, the PVP Zone. I'm not sure if the two are co-owned or if they are just partnering up to generate business for each other, but there is a door inside that goes between the two and people were shuffling in and out constantly. The worst part was this particular guy that I had not seen the whole time during my visit until close to the end. He came in from next door and walked back behind the counter to talk to one of the Jackie Bee employees. While that employee was making a drink in a blender, this guy was standing right next to him constantly running his fingers through his hair. I was too far away to see if anything might be coming off the dudes head, but had I seen that when I walked in, I woulda walked right back out. They let at least 2 other people from next door walk behind the counter and just hang out besides him too. With customers drinks being made in that same area, I think the owners or managers should be paying a lot more attention to who's ""hanging out"" here.

Even with the several boba spots in town, I've been waiting to check out Jackie Bee since I seen the sign a few months ago. Sadly, this was a super disappointing visit and even though the boba was decent enough, I'm not sure I'd come back anytime soon. There's way too many better choices for boba alone, and the food didn't add anything worthwhile. 1.5 stars.",2015-03-11 02:26:54

I have a lady VIP card and an industry card which entitles you to a free drink and happy hour all the time aside from their normal happy hour times which is from 4-8 pm. So if you're a girl, you must sign up for this incentive! 

The food isn't too bad especially at happy hour prices, but I don't think I'd pay for it at normal price. I really really enjoy their lobster salad! It's very light and refreshing yet full of flavor. It has sliced avocados, mango, baby cherry tomatoes, mixed spring, romaine, and iceberg lettuce, and two pieces of lobster. To. Die. For! I also like their spinach and artichoke dip, both of their flatbread choices (margherita & beef tenderloin portobello), beef tenderloin dish, and chicken skewers. 

I ordered the baked Brie thinking it would be fantastic. The bread is pretty good, but the cheese for it tasted much too strong. It was brought out with the rest of my appetizers and I was meaning to eat it last which I did, but at that point the cheese seemed like it had hardened so it wasn't that good. The fruit on the plate also was not fresh and made me want to spit it out. 

The service is hit or miss depending on the girl's attitude that is serving you that night. Most of them are pretty happy, but there have been instances where my waitress was very unpleasant. 

The bands that play are fun most of the time, but I don't generally think of this place as somewhere to go to and dance. It naturally isn't meant for the younger crowd.

My initial attraction to this place was from reviews by a few of my friends.  When I checked in I was impressed to find Misti, the Vegas CM, is the Duchess of this place.

I chose a Thai iced tea to drink.  Even in my limited experience it was only OK but not great.  It got better from there.  As an appetizer I ordered shrimp rolls ($5.95) which were 6 large shrimp in a roll and deep fried with a peanut sauce.  For my entree I chose Rad-na with chicken.  It was very good but I feel I cheated myself of some flavor by ordering it mild rather than 3 or 4 on the spice scale.

It is definitely a hole in the wall with basic decor.

I won't do the food any justice in this review. I will do my best. We did a 4/5 course tasting menu. 

First course: a crudo (Black Sea bass maybe?) in a sauce of ponzu, grape seed oil and what I imagine unicorn tears to taste like. Every bite had savory, citrus, salty, and slight fishy flavor. Absolutely amazing dish.

Second course: clams in a mushrooms broth. Simple, fresh, delicious. I sipped up all the broth.

Third course: wygu beef strips that you cook on a small hibachi grill. Served with asparagus and a delicious sauce. Another perfect dish.

Fourth course: the sushi course. 6 great pieces. All great.

Fifth course: a Japanese crem brûlée. One of my favorite deserts so this was a nice surprise.

I finished the night with a Japanese whiskey. I'm a bit of a whiskey freak and this stuff hit the spot. Not sure what it was called but our server said it was recommended by the chef. Again, a perfect choice.

For me Vietnamese is comfort food. It represents a fresh filling meal of a mix of meat, noodles and vegetables. All flavours dynamic, complimenting one another but mixing in your bowl to give your taste buds a tantalizing wake up. 

Entering Pho Moderne I'd say the restaurant is appropriately as the name suggests. It's modern, clean and tastefully decorated on the inside. The menu offered an array of your typical Vietnamese offerings: appetizers, pho, rice dishes, bun noodle dishes, drinks and desserts. All with a good selection and pricing is your typical very inexpensive for Vietnamese restos. 

I ordered the chicken bun noodles with a spring roll. It was served very hearty in a bowl with peanut, salad, nuoc mam and a generous serving of grilled chicken. On a scale of 1-10 it was a solid 8. With this I ordered some spring rolls as well to share with my dinner mate. They were crispy fresh and a slight bit of oil on the wrappers. Not greasy but not dry. All in all a solid meal and definitely worth a return based on experience, price and quality. 

There are a good amount of Asian restaurants in this Neighbourhood of Decarie N but I'd contend Pho Moderne is a good choice if you want authentic Viet food.",2015-03-22 13:51:25

Well, that answer is easy for me --- I find a frozen sweet treat immediately and today, my choice was Tasti D-Lite. 

So why is this frozen yogurt shop any different then the others around town? Well, I didn't think there would be much of a difference to be honest...I just wanted fro yo and I've wanted to check out Tasti D-Lite for awhile. So, I went in and taste-tested each of the flavors: chocolate, peach, coconut cookie, tart and peanut butter. They were all milky and creamy, but I went with one of my favorite combos -- the original tart topped with strawberries. I took one bite and immediately I knew my verdict. Delicious!! Creamy, delicious, refreshing and healthy. OK the healthy part might be a hit or miss but all the others are dead-on! And it was actually different from any of the other frozen yogurt I've had.  

Here are some other Tasti D-Lite highlights I enjoyed:

- Toppings - not only do they have every topping and sauce you can imagine, but they put the toppings in these individual containers so you can take them on the go and avoid your topping getting soggy. Smart move right?

- Ice cream sandwiches - Yep, they have ice cream sandwiches with frozen yogurt. Right up my alley! 

- Atmosphere - The character of Tasti D-Lite follows its name perfectly. It's fun and colorful. From the group of teenagers who were hanging out there, any age would agree. 

So next time you're a. hot b. have low blood sugar or c. just want something sweet to brighten your mood; I suggest you check out Tasti D-Lite. It also happens to be next to two great shopping corridors so you can do some retail therapy while you eat!",2010-07-21 03:54:21

However, I now understand why this MK has such low ratings. I came in and the man at the front neither acknowledged me nor looked my way, and did not have a smiling face or greeting as I walked past him. Also, as I was walking through, not one employee (3 at the cashwrap, 4 within a group, and 2 walking back and forth to help a guest) had smiles, or acknowledged our presence. 

I have to say, I don't appreciate that even those who walked past us had nothing to say, OR that as we were looking around and I had stared at their group of 4 having a meeting, that no one even glanced our way. 

Honestly, horrible customer service AND this could be a possible LP issue. The fact that two stars are the rating are for the cleanliness of the store and product as well as the one lady (employee) who said ""excuse me"" with a smile as she made her way back to the stock room. 

(It is a busy weekend in Las Vegas, however, there weren't many people in the store. AND they had time for a group meeting? Pretty upsetting to no feel welcome on a store where I was intent on buying a few things for myself and for Mother's Day)

Wife had steamed bass - delicate enhancements; my daughter, the burger - smokey wood flame-broiled - a strong enhancement; the appetizer - briefly-roasted feta cheese had also briefly-roasted purple sage leaves, fire-dried heirloom tomatoes, roasted garlic cloves and peppers with a minimum of capsaicin which all conspired to adroitly enhance the somewhat delicate feta.

The staff is always helpful and inviting to a point.  When I have stayed there I have had wonderful help with demagnetized keys, special requests and help moving rooms.  At one point the ice machine on our floor was broken and they sent a bellman up to our room with a bucket of ice upon request.  This was great service until the 3rd time we called and they questioned why we kept asking for ice delivery when we had a unit on our floor.  Ummmm maybe because it was broken but the front desk made us feel like we were lazy people for not getting ice ourselves.

My biggest gripe is the way they treat their guests.  I have been a regular room guest and a $2k a night suite guest and was treated the same way as a person off the street in their bar.  First of all, if you over night park with the hotel you WILL be charged $30 per car.  I get that this is normal albeit gouging price  for a resort but if I have rented out a $$$ suite, I expect a few concessions.  Another problem was that when I called down to the front desk to reserve a chair by the pool I was told that ""they don't keep track of that and I just need to go down to the pool to see what is available.""   I went down to the pool and watched the bouncer allow 4 locals to pay $10 to get into the pool while I waited to be noticed.  Once into the pool area I asked about a deck chair and was told they were 1st come 1st serve (great the $10 Douchebags were allowed a chair at the same rate I was as a paying guest) but they were happy to sell me a day bed for $200 or bottle service for $500.  At the time I was staying in the Mega Suite and couldn't even get a chair by the pool.  After raising a fuss (which I hate to do but our suite was $1300 a night and I can't even get a GD deck chair by the pool) and they suggested a small fold out chair on the grass.  Come. Freaking. On.

Don't even get me started on the fact that the elevator won't move unless you swipe your key.  I know I know its to keep non-guests from wandering the halls but if you forget your key on a quick trip to your car you are screwed.

Well that goth/glowstick/industrial crowd has now moved to Dickens and Commonwealth is trying for a more generally accepted atmosphere.

I come here for shows, I have come here for dancing, I tried to come here to eat, cause they used to have a 'cafeteria', an then a pop-up Tubby Dog, but their website still says they have a cafeteria, but there is no cafeteria or Tubby Dog!
I even came here to close out my bachelorette party and that evening was 1 of 10 brides-to-be. It was pretty comedic and I have never seen so many fake penises or tutus in a bar.

Things I like:
Good upstairs stage. The back wall is made up of defunct speakers so it looks amazing.

The crows. No, not multiple Brandon Lees, but you can find lots of fake feathered friends hanging out in the downstairs portion of the bar.

Dancing! The music here is fun

Community events. I haven't BEEN to any here yet, but I like how they are doing art/local vendor markets, plus I hear there are mimosas.

Hip-Hop karaoke. This is on my to-do list, I have been practicing my Montell Jordan and am waiting for the right evening to bust it out, then drop the mic and promptly exit.

The bad:
The lack of promised food/late night snacking options.

The reason I gave it three stars is because the girl who did my facial was great. I think her name was Leah?? Hopefully I am right. She was lovely.

The steam room was just ok. The steam is preset to go off at regular intervals but for my taste the intervals were just way to far apart. Towards the end of the cycle I felt more like I was in a hot yoga studio, not a steam room. And I love steam rooms so I was a little disappointed. But even the quality of the steam room needs some updating. Several tiles are cracked. One side of the steam room is a constant puddle due to the inconsistency in the floor. I tired not to step over there because water that never drains just seems like an invitation for bacteria. There was also some white substance in spots on the wall that I am not sure what it is. Leftover soap not rinsed off, growth, I don't know? 

The pool and hot tub area are basic. They have some big trees overhead so I try to give some benefit of the doubt with all the leaves in the pool. However, it is much harder to overlook the edges of the pool and hot tub that just seemed grimy. I think the pool service might need to scrub the edges a little more often. 

I won't go in to extensive detail on everything because I don't want to feel like I am beating them up. It is a nice place. It just maybe needs a little more attention to detail, cleanliness and some updating.

The food is legit spicy lol. If you love spicy food, this is definitely one place you don't want to miss.

The fried chicken itself is very delicious - you can choose to order the whole chicken, half chicken or just wings/drumsticks. I prefer the chicken without sauce because it stays crispy good; the Original and the 5 Spice dry rub are definitely my top choices. I enjoy the Soy Garlic one too but they tend to drench the chicken with way too much sauce. 

Foodie Tip: Order the Soy Garlic flavour or other sauces of your choice and ask to have the sauce on the side instead! The chicken stays cripsy, and I like that I can adjust how much sauce I want to dip.

I would also recommend the Oyster Kimchi Fried Rice. I love the flavours, especially the oysters. This dish can be a tad oily because of the spicy oils. Ooo and be sure to order beer to wash all the spicy down and to quench your thirst! They have a nice selection of beer and soju!

What stood out the most compared the other dimsum restaurants is the service was significantly better - you don't get rude food drop-offs, and we actually hear ""pleases"" and ""thank yous"". It's kind of sad that we get so used to bad service at Chinese restaurants that we completely overlook it, so this was definitely welcoming.",2016-03-23 01:17:41

-- salty fish fried rice
-- clams with spicy basil
-- Hong Kong style noodle dishes
-- lobster or oysters or both!
-- crispy fried intestines
-- golden mushroom with spicy fried tofu

When I made the reservation, I mentioned we would be celebrating a friend's birthday - while this didn't result in a free dessert, there was a card on the table when we sat down reading ""Happy birthday"" (handwritten).

Here is what we had:

*Duck fat fries with trio of dipping sauces (complimentary) - seriously we could have stopped here because they were really really freaking delicious. All four of us loved the truffle aioli dipping sauce the best.
*Rosemary bread (complimentary) - soft and very good, but perhaps a little unncessary because of the fries
*Maryland blue crab chowder - course 1 of the prix fixe for 2 of the 4
*Bibb Wedge salad - my prix fixe first course. It was the perfect size and had a good blue cheese flavor without entirely overpowering the whole dish.
*Ribeye - course 2 of the prix fixe for two of the four of my group
*Organic half chicken - my entree. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the truffle mac and cheese the chicken sat on was the perfect side, and the onion au jus gave the entire dish a good flavor.
*Potato puree trio - order this for the lobster mash alone. You will thank me.
*Beignets - 2 of us got the chocolate pot de creme and one got the creme brulee. The beignets were a good, light dessert to end an indulgent meal.

Service was outstanding. Our waitress was phenomenal - super friendly, helpful, and the right amount of attentive. Prices are what you would expect to pay at a good, upscale, fine dining restaurant.

I was lucky that the boyfriend's parents were in town, so among the 4 of us, I was able to try many dishes. We ordered:
Brussel Sprouts - I never knew brussel sprouts could be so good. Simple, healthy and absolutely delicious. They were cooked in a slightly sweet sauce...honey? Even my boyfriend who hates this vegetable enjoyed them.
Wedge Salad - Pretty standard flavors. The lettuce was fresh. The figs were a nice touch.
The Raw Deal - There were 3 mini servings of raw salmon and tuna. I liked the thinly sliced rectangular slices of tuna; melt in your mouth fish! The salmon nigiri was standard. The mix of diced tuna and salmon in between a bed of rice and wasabi mayo was pretty good but I would have preferred if it were all tuna.
Wagyu Meatloaf - Yum!!! The meatloaf was full of flavor. A tiny bit salty, but when I ate them w/ the potatoes, it was perfect. The crispy onions on top were a nice touch.
Hanger Steak - I didn't try this because I don't like steak, but my boyfriend said it was one of the better hanger steaks he has had in Pittsburgh.
Fish and Chips - The fish of the night was walleye. The fish was well cooked.
Pork Tenderloin - Another dish I didn't try, but my boyfriend's mother said the flavors were ""great.""
Their free bread was just okay. The pumpkin flavored butter that it came with was odd.

The best thing about this place are the tater tots.  You get a good sized portion and they are nice and crunchy.  The maui burgers (which I think I got both times) are ok, but nothing special.  The main reason I probably won't go back is that the last time I was there (several months ago) I placed my order, using the menu / prices that were on the wall.  After ordering, the owner (I think) is ringing me up and says, 'ok, let me put in the new prices since we recently changed them'.  Which means recently increased them.  Which I'm fine with really, places increase prices all of the time...however, if you don't change them on the board, and there is no sign indicating there is a change, that is kind of disappointing.  It was certainly less than a buck difference, but I felt it was a little shady (I mean, I'm still annoyed about it several months later).

We had a reservation but were advised to wait at the bar an extra 10-15 minutes prior to being seated in a dining room with many open tables- most likely to squeeze an extra $13 for a Jack Daniels & $14 for a Belvedere cocktail from us.

We were seated at a nice, ample booth looking out at the City Center fountain/cul de sac and with view of the entire dining room. The service was very professional and informed.
 
Their lobster bisque was extremely salty. 

Lobster mac & cheese was yummy, as a leftover- from what my date later told me. 

I thought it was a unique cut of meat to offer, but for $48, their 16oz bone-in Filet left much to be desired. I later learned that several other restaurants in the city were offering bone-in filet cuts.

I've had a few different options and loved them all. The very best to start with is their renowned coleslaw and dill pickles placed on your table immediately; they are incredible. This time I once again had their rack of lamb cooked exactly as requested. My favourite tho is the rib steak which my husband had and it was so very tasty and juicy - he was kind enough to share some :). For an appetizer I had the salmon tartar and he had the chopped liver with fried onions - this was a new one for him and he really liked it.

1. They've nailed the ordering system - during peak times, you get a number on a piece of paper when you've paid and they call your order number when it's ready to go.

2. The decor is classier than most Tim Horton's you'll visit. There are booths that are kept very clean and there's a certain amount of privacy and roominess. I wouldn't hesitate to meet a friend here for coffee or a chat, and you can't really say that about most Tim Horton's - you usually don't want to stick around for very long.

3. It's open 24 hours. Very handy when you're stumbling home drunk after a night at one of the nearb (douche) bars and want a bagel or a donut to soak up all the beer in your tummy.

4. The washrooms. If you're in this neighbourhood and you need to ""go"", head to Tim Horton's. You don't need a key to use the washrooms and no one will glare at you when you beeline for the washrooms without buying anything.

The place also appears clean which is a plus.

On my last visit, I had: 

Pepper Salt Chicken Thigh ($9.95) - Delicious!! I started drooling the minute it was placed on our table because it smelled amazing! So crispy and perfectly seasoned. It's a must try but just make sure you have a rice along with it since it's considered a side order dish. Slightly on the pricey side for this one but worth it.

Crispy Chicken on Rice & Groupa on Rice ($8.95 each) - Black pepper sauce on the chicken and cream sauce for the groupa, both which I thoroughly enjoyed. Not too salty or heavy. However, I did feel like there wasn't enough sauce in proportion to the amount of rice. Asked for more and they were happy to give us a small bowl on the side. Bonus points! They do their baked rice very well and I would highly recommend it. Portions are humongous. We couldn't finish it between 2 people.

The drinks are not bad either. I really like the red bean & black jelly drink with icecream. It's great during the summer.

Service is decent. They do their job and will get you what you need. I never expect great service from these types of places so as long as they're not overly rude or unaccomodating, I'm not bothered.

Elite Emily loves the Veggie Pita Sandwich, but I'm more of a meatitarian, so I go for their Chili Size. We all know I swoon for a spoon of chili, and Winchell's chili is up to snuff -- good, sturdy, great as part of a meal or on its own. And they're very careful to ask if you want cheese and onions with it, which to chili lovers is a great touch, as sometimes they're good, and sometimes they overpower the flavor of the chili.

The Chili Size is an open-faced burger drowning in a sea of hot, gloppy chili goodness. Don't you dare try eating it like a burger... you will make a mess and we all will point and laugh. Loudly. Even more loudly if you're wearing white. Instead, grab that knife and fork and dig right in to some down-home goodness.

Service is very attentive, even during busy lunch hours, and the staff gets to know their regulars fairly quickly. We almost always have time to grab lunch, catch up on the latest gossip, and still have time to spare within Elite Emily's lunch hour.

Like any Starbucks location, it's as good or bad as the employees working it when you visit.  This one is generally a mixed bag.

Sometimes my drink is ready before I finish paying. Sometimes they act like they've never made coffee before at all. It can be super fast sometimes, while others I have to sit and wait.

It's below average service for a Starbucks, but every now and then I come across someone here who really knows what they're doing.

I'm not going to complain though.. I get to order a coffee to drink while I shop, from a Starbucks that's in the store in shopping at. How cool is that?",2015-09-05 01:29:22

The menu was promising, though, so off we went.

It's a small place, but the decor is homey and inviting. We arrived right on time and were promptly shown to a table right at the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen (which was in itself pretty cool). However, our table was literally about an inch away from another table, so when two more people were seated a few minutes later, it was basically like we were sharing a table. And because the dude to my right had a very booming voice, it made conversation with my dining companion difficult and annoying. Not exactly a promising start to the meal.

The less-than-impressive theme continued with my first course, the Caldo Verde Soup (""Cassava, Chorizo, Collard Greens""). This just tasted like a fairly run-of-the-mill creamy soup, albeit one with higher-quality ingredients. But there weren't any bold flavors here; everything just kind of blended together. It was bland, for lack of a better word. I enjoyed eating it, but it didn't knock me out by any stretch of the imagination.

The main didn't fare much better, honestly. I got the Fried Rice (""Salted Beef, Smoked Meats"") and indeed, it was a small bowl of fried rice. It was fine; the meat was tasty and the rice was cooked perfectly. But again, there were no standout flavors in the dish and it ultimately tasted like something that should've been accompanying something else.

The restaurant finally did knock one out of the park with the dessert, the Guava & Cheese Empanadas with Cinnamon. It was incredible. Hot, fresh, and - surprise, surprise - flavorful, the empanada was exactly the delicious dessert I was hoping for after reading its description. It could've used something like cream or ice cream on the side to cut its richness, but otherwise it was a perfect end to a somewhat mediocre meal.",2017-02-01 16:44:03

I ordered the escargots as an appetizer, the seafood fettuccine as my main, and creme brûlée as my dessert. My boyfriend ordered pate de champagne, seafood risotto, and profiteroles. My favourite would have to be the escargots. They gave a decent portion, and it was garlicky goodness. It would've been nice if they gave more than 2 tiny slices of bread though. Same goes for the pate - it was good, but could've used more bread. Both the seafood risotto and the seafood fettuccine came with 2 black tiger shrimps, 6-7 pieces of calamari, and a bunch of tiny scallops. Both were really flavourful and the portions were pretty big. The desserts were nothing special. The creme brûlée had a hint of ginger, which was a little different, but I'm not sure I loved it. 

The service was pretty fast and the food arrived quickly, but we didn't feel super rushed. However, we were seated in the back room, where it was pretty cramped and dark. It would've been nicer if we were seated in the main room, where there was a lot more natural sunlight. The servers also bumped into my boyfriend a couple times as they tried to get by because of how cramped the space was, which made our experience a little unpleasant.

Not that I didn't want to go, but if you're going to watch the baseball game, why not truly immerse yourself in the entire experience? Sit down in the bleachers, order a hot dog, some beers and scream your head off like every true Clevelander should! I mean, aren't we the best fans in the world? I THINK SO!

With that said, the only times I've ever eaten at the Terrace Club at Progressive Field have been for events when there was no game going on.  To be honest, I recommend doing it this way if you can. Here's why:

It's a beautiful venue with huge, sprawling windows facing the baseball field. Now, this may seem perfect for game-watching, but it's not really. You're very disconnected for the game and it's mostly a view of the outfield. They have plenty of TV's to watch, but then why not just watch it at home? 

The space can also get a little tricky with where you're seated too. They seem to have plenty of tables facing the windows, but there is also an upper section that you could get stuck in, with no view of the field at all.

I've never had a bad experience with the food. That says a lot since I mentioned before I've only been there for special events, which included a preselected menu.  Although, I've seen the menu before and I would say the best deal is the buffet, which is about $25-$30/ person (I believe). If you order separately from the menu, you're looking at double digit prices for almost all food items.  Honestly, the food is good, but for that price...I'd rather go to a nicer restaurant. That's just my opinion. 

My latest experience at the Terrace Club was just this afternoon for a local charity's awareness event, called City Mission. They had a preselected lunch menu, several speakers and a video. 

I think the venue was beautiful for the event, but I wouldn't recommend it for a speaking engagement. It was hard to see the podium and at times, the speakers had their backs to some of the audience.  The shape of the venue just doesn't lend itself for this kind of event. 

The food was good. They served turkey sandwiches on croissants and pasta salad in a bed of lettuce.  It all seemed fresh and was tasty, although it was nothing to write home about. 

All in all, I'd say the event was a success, but more because of the cause and the content.  The venue is great for events but not for a speaking engagement and, in my opinion, not for a game either.",2010-07-22 18:48:46

And while it's true that most Canadian food resembles the meat 'n' starch fare enjoyed by our neighbours to the south, Canada does in fact have a rich culinary history. Bannock does well in bringing to life the memory of foods of yore with a decidedly modern twist. 

Occupying the spot once filled by ""My Favourite Timothy's"", Bannock is truly in the centre of it all. It's steps from the Eaton Centre, City Hall and the financial district. The restaurant itself is bifurcated into a café and a proper restaurant. In the morning, commuters can stop in for coffee, pastries, soups and sandwiches. At night, however, is when the magic happens. 

Making a reservation was quite easy, and we were seated almost immediately upon arrival. I started off with a Back Forty cocktail which was gin, cucumber served in a cocktail class (Bah! I specifically wanted something not in a cocktail glass! I digress.). Determined to try the eponymous dish, the four of us shared a BLT bannock. It's actually quite an impressive portion, so sharing it is definitely recommended. For my main I had the venison chili served with unleaven bread which was amazingly good. It had a real earthy flavour and was spiced to perfection. I ate the entire thing.

The only disappointment came with the dessert. When I read ""s'mores pie"" it evoked an image of something gooey melted over a campfire; this was simply a brownie drizzled with chocolate sauce. Not the best, but not terrible. All in all an excellent dinner option for the most downtown among us.

Obligatory Title Pun: Yes we pemmiCAN.

Menu Readability: It is not lost on me that the menu is shaped like the counter of the ""O"" in their wordmark. Thumbs way up.

Need to mention: Duck poutine pizza seems like a must-get.

Service was attentive but wouldn't categorize it as warm and friendly.  We didn't get water refills until the end of the meal and when we finally asked.  Food came out quickly - hot foods hot.

Adults got the AYCE option. Kids opted for a chicken katsu kids meal and ala carte shrimp tempura and salmon sashimi. Sashimi was $11 and seemed spendy for the three pieces. 

Most of the sushi here is pretty mediocre. Not bad, but it's not knock your socks off.  The ""creative"" rolls like The Sunset were unimaginative and just alright.  We got an order of spicy tuna nachos. Guess we should've known based on the menu (see picture), but it was literally a heaping mound of spicy tuna served with something like sriracha mayo and Tostitos Scoops (yes, straight from the bag of Scoops that you would eat with jarred salsa). The spicy in the tuna wasn't even mixed evenly as the bottom of the lump was spicier than the top.

The honey toast is a poor representation of this great Japanese dessert. It was not Japanese bakery bread but a piece of King's Hawaiian sweet roll. The ice cream wasn't vanilla like described. It was more like a yuzu sorbet, but I thought it was better than vanilla ice cream. The sorbet was the best thing we had that night.

One of the tips mentioned the bench seating for each table. Not ideal but it wasn't too bad.

Doubt we'll be back here despite the convenience. There are many other AYCE joints in town to choose from which you'll leave much more satisfied.",2015-08-02 04:14:41

When I first walked in, I was like WTF and SMH. I thought it was going to be a complete waste of time. I scanned the first aisles very quickly. Not intrigued by anything I saw. I kept seeing these pink signs with information about checking the dates and certain percentages off. So I stood at end cap trying to read the labels and couldn't figure out where the date was listed at. 

There was an associate not far from me and she was able to explain to me where to look for the dates. Not all labels have a date but if one is listed it is in big bold font on the upper left hand corner. The store associate was very helpful and friendly and even smiled at me. That was indeed pleasant. 

So now armed with the knowledge I needed, I didn't mind that the store was a little messy. I now understood why. At the time of my visit, anything with a date of 11/10/16 was 90% off! So of course I was on that bargain hunt and seeing what I could find! Of course anything that was going to be 90% off was going to be rare find but I managed to find two toys for my son. He was happy and I was happy! 

Bargain Hunt has a wide variety of items. Everything you would find in your local discount store like Ross, Burlington, Marshalls or anything else similar. The difference is Bargain Hunt's merchandise is all old merchandise from other stores. We recognized Target and Costco to name a few. 

I didn't venture into the clothing section until the end because I was like there is no way I am buying clothing from here but I did peek a little bit on my way to the register and most of the items were from Target. And at much cheaper prices! I will undoubtedly check out the clothing on my next visit. 

If you can get the disarray and mess of the shelves, and come with a little bit of time on your hands - you are sure to find a good deal here.",2017-03-21 12:15:13

With that said, I love coming to this location because of the Train they have running throughout the whole establishment up by the ceiling. My toddler loves it and keeps him entertained whenever it enters the room.

As far as food go, their Banana Muffin is amazing. Served Warm. And melts in your mouth. I typically order the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet- breakfast potatoes smothered in Country Gravy, with a large cut up portion of the streak (no need to use a knife as they cut it up for you!) And topped with your choice of egg (I only eat scramble). It's simple but so damn good! 

The kids meals come with choice of potatoe or fresh fruit, which I love because potatoes are hit and miss with my toddler (and a side of fruit is $6!).

So when I heard they are now open, I decided to check it out.  Arrived when they started serving for dinner.
 
The menu had a small sushi and seafood selection. So for you sushi fans you might be interested. I really dont like it. So I just glossed over that section of the menu. It's more Japanese cuisine with some Thai dishes thrown in though. The printed menu doesnt even have Thai mentioned yet the banner out front and the listing on Yelp says it is.
  
The Thai and Japanese dishes served for dinner like Salmon Basil, Duck Cognac are the ones you would find in the finer dining places sounded so good, but I wasn't really hungry enough to order a full entree. So I settled on a Beef Salad and Shrimp Tempura appetizer dish.  Both dishes were pretty good.  LOVE the combination of color and flavors. The Thai flavor profile was prominent with the fresh lemongrass, basil and cilantro.The steak was nicely marinated and well chilled.  My only minor complaint was the NY Strip steak strips were cut just a tad too thick and was a little tough.

Shrimp tempura batter was a little heavy but nonetheless I still liked the appetizer.  Dessert option is also limited at this time with 3 selections.  I chose the Crepe Cake. Glad I did! Never had Thai Tea cake before. The texture is different like a cheesecake. I  loved the flavor of theThai tea in the cake and the glazed that was drizzled on top. It also came with a scoop of Green Tea ice cream. So good. Save room for dessert for sure.
 
Ambiance, very chill, trendy just like the vibe over at the coffee shop next door.  Interior design simple elegance to a point and modern, hence the name. The dining space is small but the way they have the seating configurations works out pretty good, it didnt feel at all crowded.  Service wise, my server was really friendly and had a sweet disposition. 
 
I am pleased with my first dining experience here. More like a 3.90 food wise. Overall a 4 for now though. I have to say it warrants another visit in the near future. Towards the end I was given the lunch menu that they had just printed out. The menu selections are different and the prices more appealing.",2013-08-08 14:31:48

The clientele appeared to be local regulars (always a good sign).

This is the only place I have ever been that offers 3 varieties of wings: fried, grilled or blackened.  I tried a hot grilled dozen.  The wings were very tasty but not hot by any means.  I'm not sure if my order was prepared wrong or if the grilling neutralizes the hotness a bit.  Either way the wings were very good so I have no real complaints.  It did take a bit for my wings to be served but the website did indicate that they employ only one cook and everything is made fresh.  I don't mind waiting for good eats.

The bar is large with ample seats at the bar and many tables.  If you're a sports fan they have television sets all over.  They don't all have the best picture but you won't miss any action.  There's a pool table, various arcade games and a jukebox (loaded with compact discs).

I wait for my best friends to wake up and in a snail like fashion we slowly make our way to our favorite dim sum spot. This place I have a love/hate relationship with solely due to the fact that their service is sub par however where it lacks in service it gains in taste.

We sit around, figuring out what to eat and although I don't know the Cantonese equivalents of each dish we order I can half make out the items we usually order as follows: shrimp steamed dumplings, siu mai dumplings, chinese doughnut wrapped in rice sheets, fried shrimp dumplings, steamed rice wrapped in banana leaves, bbq pork wrapped rice sheets, shrimp wrapped rice sheets, bbq pork buns and of course for the finale egg tarts.

The service is slow, you have to nag at the servers to get anything you want and the biggest disadvantage about this restaurant is the fact that you need a Cantonese speaking friend to come with you to increase the service you need. True story.

They don't understand ""Grill"".  They deep fry the salmon belly.  Their ""seared"" is just - take a salmon and fry it on the pan for a minute.  This place is empty for a holiday- only 9 tables had people.  I think that's why their sushi is not very fresh.  Their holiday price is $26pp.  It doesn't even include soft drinks.  Most AYCE include soft drinks for that price.  They want $1 and $1.50 for ice tea.  
The shrimp tempura taste strange like the shrimp is dried inside.  It seems like they cut it in half to make it look bigger then deep fry with batter to hide the small shrimp.  
Their agedashi tofu is just deep fry tofu with no sauce.  They really need to know what is agedashi tofu.

Everything was excellent, except I am taking a star off because the prices are just offensively bad.

If it hadn't been my birthday, I probably wouldn't have dragged my family here.

A dinner for three with a restaurant.com certificate for $50 was about $280.  We had two of the prix fixe menu options, but upsized both of them for the ribeye (for dad) and the fillet (for me).  Husband had the kansas city strip, and like it but liked my steak much better.  If we ever have hundreds of dollars to waste and eat here again, he would probably not order the strip again.

We've been to Turf half a dozen times and usually it is the price-point that keeps me from wandering to the back of the complex and trying Pasta Bar.  I finally got my mother to take us out so that I didn't have to pay for it.  

Pasta Bar seems to have the worst location of the three restaurants in the complex.  There is no patio, no windows, and no personality.  It is too bad because Italian places are always begging for style.  A mirror, a few paintings, some duct work, and a nicely-crafted bar sort of make up the entire ambiance of  PB.

The place was dead when we got there.  It was Saturday afternoon and Turf seemed to be pretty busy.  The waitress was helpful and informative when we got in and we looked over the lunch menu.  They had a lunch special where you picked lemonade or tea, got a salad, and a different type of cavatelli.  I had lemonade and the pesto pasta.  

The lemonade was the most sour thing I had ever drank.  In fact, I think it was made of liquefied lemon Warheads.  No amount of sugar was going to make this drinkable.  It was pretty disappointing.  

As far as the breadstick thing goes, they were fine.  I think I would rather them bring out a basket of breadsticks instead of them sitting on the table like a package of chopsticks.  They taste fine.

My pasta really wasn't that great.  The pesto was nice and light, which was a bit surprising.  It tasted good but could have had more garlic.  The pasta, however, was undercooked and rubbery.  I love non-flour pasta and I will almost always order gnocci or cavatelli if they are available and this was simply not that great.  It was fine but could have been better.

The salad was actually worse than the salad that comes with the Fez Burger.  I didn't think such a thing was possible, but Pasta Bar has figured out how to make it.  They apparently take an entire stalk of celery and chop it up and throw it in with 5 pieces of lettuce and an orange tomato.  The celery taste was so overwhelming that I couldn't possible eat more than two bites of it.  That's fine, I don't go to a pasta place for the salad, but I would have been fine with a traditional salad.

In all, the lunch special for $12 is a fine deal.  The pasta is decent.  My mother had the other cavatelli (with the pomodoro sauce).  It was much better than mine.  I can't give this place a bad review but I would probably not go back.  With so many other food options next door or just down the rail/street, it is hard to see myself going back.",2009-03-24 16:15:15

Normally I am only a fan when it is the ice cream kind, straight from the freezer, but there was so much talk about them being amazing, I had to try it for myself... and it did not disappoint!

They are now $2.60 each. I tried houjicha, black sesame, matcha and strawberry. I am already a huge red bean fan, and with the matcha, it was just divine. Houjicha and black sesame are my favourite macaron flavours and they are also very good in the daifuku. I wish the strawberry one reminded me of the yummy ones in Japan, but even though it didn't, it was still refreshing. Of course if there was chestnut flavour today, that would have been a no brainer. Would have picked it up in a heartbeat!

I'm not sure what makes a Gryfe's bagel so magical.
Being baked in a wood oven?
The sesame seeds?
Their funny non-symmetrical shape? 
Fresh from the oven, they are crispy but oddly light, fluffy, and airy for a bagel.

The bakery is always busy but it's worth the wait.
I would eat two bagels in the car with nothing on them as if they were potato chips.
And yes, I have bought a tub of Western cream cheese in the bakery and I have made my own cream cheese bagel-wiches outside.
Even after living in Montreal, there aren't any bagels that can compare to Gryfe's.

I prefer to have them from the bakery, but I've picked them up from Daiter's as well.  There was actually a Japanese take out place at RBC plaza in the downtown core that sold them.

Here's the scoop.  Arrived Saturday night to a 60 minute wait for a table. Wife did some magic wifey stuff and all of a sudden we were seated at the chef's table on the side where salads and apps are created.

We sat down, and were greeted, immediately by a server with amazing energy and passion for his work.  Efficiently he took our drink orders, made recommendations, and went to acquire the goods.  Next, an equally energetic line cook welcomed us to the restaurant and asked if this was a repeat visit.  No we advised.  He truly beamed with excitement and welcomed us, telling us about how excited he was to have us and started offering us what I expected to be small samples.  At this point, I felt like they thought we were actually important.  As though we were famous, knew someone in their corporate office, etc.  BTW - were just normies.

Wife asked for an off the menu item due to food allergies.  Did they respond?  Yes!!!!  I was able to watch the employee hand cut a head of lettuce, grill it for a moment, hand slice chicken.  He then confirms what the allergens are and asks if he can add more to the salad to make it better for my wife!  He then turns to a line cook to coordinate the timing of the delivery of our food.  I am soooo impressed at this point.  Everyone was getting along, no egos were bruised as the staff (tactfully) hollered to their peers, what they needed.  It was amazing to see the true team work and the fun being had!  

Salad - perfect 10.  Turkey Sloppy Joe - 9, just a bit sweet.  Portion of fries served with Sloppy Joe, enough for (4) four adults.  

Overall experience?  11 out of 10!  (Or 5/7 for my Imgur peeps). 

One the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Made my last $250 dinner at Dominicks feel like a dinner at Chillis.  Two entrees, one draft, one soft drink - including tax, title, license, and docs fees - $40.",2016-02-28 17:16:03

So with the help of one of them, we were able to get a very good package at a reasonable price, especially compared to the quote we received from the banquet's department at Caesar's Palace.

The waitstaff were great at taking our orders and during the meal service.  The back private banquet room was fairly large and accommodated our large party (can't recall the exact number, but we had well north of 60 people, all seated in 3 long rows of tables).

The Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale with Corn-Cilantro Sauce was simply delicious.  The tamale was top notch, and the Flay-concocted Corn-Cilantro Sauce will pair up nicely with other seafood and poultry dishes.  


For my entree, I selected Bobby Flay's signature dish ""New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce + Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter"".  It was cooked perfectly and the flavors was very unique and complimented each other.  The sweet potato tamale was the best I have ever had.

I tried a sample of my friend's ""Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon, Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce"".  Filet Mignon was good, but aside from being tender (which is why most people order it) it lacked the flavor I crave from beef, but the accompaning Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce was super!

The Blue Corn Crusted Alaskan Halibut + Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 Tomatoes, Capers, Nicoise Olives, Fresh Basil + Oregano was also a nice fish entree.  And highly recommended.

I know this review is based on a banquet experience instead of the more typical restaurant dining experience, but the food overall was good to great.  Service was superb, and the price we were able to negotiate for the event was unbeatable (big thanks to Mitch and the restaurant GM!!!)

First off, Kim is so sweet and helpful. As my party ordered, she made sure to warn us about the Jerk Chicken Spice-o-Meter, asking each of us what our spice level was. One adventurous friend said ""7""...and his eyes were watering near the end. One other friend said ""3"" and her dinner was sufficiently spicy by my standard! I ordered the oxtail dinner ($15), which comes with rice and peas and coleslaw. The oxtail was melting in my mouth. I'd barely had my first mouthful and I was swooning. It was SO good. Highly recommend. In fact, when I come back, I may do the unfoodie thing and order the same thing again. Each dish is made to order, so everything is freshly cooked, but takes a bit of time (15 min)

For the finale, even though we were all stuffed, because their portions are fantastic, we ordered a funnel cake to share. This funnel cake was HUGE and for $6, it was a steal! Freshly deep fried, topped with vanilla ice cream, maple syrup and blueberries and strawberries....oh goodness, it was so good. But sharing is caring - this was a big dish.

You'll also find many unique menu items such as the Fontina burger, which is made with roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, arugula, pesto and Fontina cheese.  Whatever you decide on, you can be sure it will be expertly prepared and very tasty.  Some of my favorites are the breakfast tacos, BBQ chicken pizza, onion rings, sweet potato fries, any of the salads, and the malts.  

Some other really cool things to note about Joe's Farm Grill are that much of the produce is grown in Agritopia right next to the restaurant.  You'll find many seasonal items are from the farm as well.  Also, the building itself was the home that Joe Johnston grew up in.

The stairs to the café is located in the front and back of the plaza right on Yonge & Finch (same plaza as Crazy Wings). There is paid parking in the back, but because we always come here after 9pm, it's free parking in the front (on the streets). So don't waste that $3!  

Their menu is quite extensive in my opinion, at least extensive enough. The waffles were beautifully presented and really delicious! The princess waffle comes with fruits and a choice of 2 flavours of ice cream - green tea, strawberry, cookies & cream, chocolate, and vanilla. I love green tea ice cream, but I decided to go with strawberry and cookies & cream. Both were really good. The mixture of warm waffles and cold ice cream went really well together. None were overly sweet. My favourite hot drink from Café Princess would be the Sweet Potato Latte. As for cold drink, I love their Iced Green Tea Latte. Creamy and flavourful, sweet but not too sweet.

The best thing about this café is that they have board games for you in case it starts getting boring. Unfortunately, the board games are very limited and some have missing pieces. On top of that, each board game you bring back to your table, you will be charged $2.50.

I thought - why not watch some FOOTBALL at the 'ALL-AMERICAN' SPORTS BAR?  

Walked in a few minutes before kick-off.  Huge place - 30+ big screens.  Ratio of customers to workers = about 1 to 1.  Not ONE TV in the ALL-AMERICAN SPORTS BAR was tuned to a FOOTBALL game.  Loud music playing.  Nobody watching sports.

Asked if they would put on the FOOTBALL game in some corner somewhere (anywhere?) with sound.  Help agreeable ('we'll have to ask manager' if we can put sound on any TV) and they gave us a corner booth (but first we had to wait for it to be cleaned - despite a virtually empty restaurant and tons of bored employees they let dirty tables sit around) with two immediately overhead TVs.  These TVs were placed so high above the booth such that no human could keep their neck in 'watching' position for an entire game and not hurt himself/herself.  (I kid you not).

Were told FOOTBALL sound would be coming but it was complicated and would take a couple of minutes.  Meanwhile I order a beer... Takes help 10 minutes to figure out how to turn on FOOTBALL at their SPORTS BAR.  15 minutes pass with no FOOTBALL sound and no beer served despite my ordering such.

So finally 22 minutes after our arrival we left with no beer ever being served and no sound ever managing to be turned to FOOTBALL.  We watched the game at another place up the street.

I will not EVER come back here under ANY circumstances.  Poorly designed place with many TVs literally unwatchable as they are placed too high above the booths.  Not really a SPORTS BAR.  I was thinking since FOOTBALL is an ALL-AMERICAN SPORT going to the ALL-AMERICAN SPORTS BAR would be perfect.  Instead ALL-AMERICAN SPORTS BAR means a place where nobody watches sports, nobody knows what games are on, nobody knows how to work the TVs and sound system, and nobody can be bothered to do stuff like clean tables and timely bring $7 beers to patrons.  

Went up the street to a pizza place and had a nice meal.  Ironically - we sat in the bar at the pizza place and they put the game on for us...  We had a great time watching FOOTBALL somewhere else!  I suggest you do the same.",2017-09-04 04:21:46

(Friend's Pork Bulgogi never arrived but it was waived from the final check) I thoroughly enjoyed my Beef Soondubu as it was a boiling hearty bowl of goodness filled with a whole egg and tofu. I never received gochujang (spicy red pepper paste) for my bibimbap but I had fun dipping the rice into the soup so I ended up not missing it that much. Sadly I left my to-go box of the bibimbap at the nearby Boba House so I didn't really get to experience the dish in it's fullest form.

Prices here are similar to the other Korean restaurants in the area with $10-$15 prices for most dishes. Their banchan selection is average with five sides offered.

Service is a little slow as they seem to be understaffed during the lunch rush and you may be forced to flag them down with some waving to get some attention. 

Overall I like this place way better then Hodori and on par with Chodang and the other 
Korean restaurants in Glendale. A good addition to the Lee Lee's neighborhood and I'm sure they'll work out their consistency issues.",2014-12-23 01:52:53

Three words: Chicken Parm Sliders.

You can technically sit down at the tables here and order food from the neighboring Triple George Grill but, at heart, this place is really just a dive bar with fantastic bar food.

It takes on a completely different theme and angle from the normal crappy food we get served at bars. As a light-weight who needs food with her alcohol, this place is perfect. I can order my drinks and order food I actually enjoy eating along with them. 

Best part is, the drinks AND the food are reasonably priced. Definitely a happy hour worth checking out.

The service does get a little shoddy as the place starts picking up later in the evening, but the cheap drinks and delicious food make it easy to ignore that. I'd say this little bar is the best place to go drinking afterwork in the whole downtown area.",2012-12-11 05:59:28

When we asked our waitress about it, she acted like we were putting her out.  We ended up ordering off the regular menu, which might have been our mistake. 

The Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Peppers were the first and only good thing we had. They were Crispy, Salty, Cheesy, Crunchy and slightly Spicy. A good sign for the start of our meal. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. We also ordered at least one of each of their tacos. I can't tell you much about them because they all tasted the same.  In a word...bland! It's pretty bad when we couldn't tell the difference between Al Pastor, Al Carbon, Garden and even their namesake Pink Taco. Even the Tortillas were bland and doughy. The Shrimp and fish tacos were identifiable, but not much more. The Rice and Beans and Chips and Salsa jumped right on the same Bland Bandwagon. 

Even our Margaritas missed the mark. My Cadillac had an off, bitter taste and Diane's Kinky B*tch tasted like A shot of the liqueur by itself. Needless to say, there was nothing about our visit to Pink Taco that would make us want to return.",2015-03-09 00:10:21

They get 5 stars right off the bat for the simple fact that they deliver Mexican food to my house. That's a rarity in this town in and of itself, but the fact that the food was good was a bonus. 

People get really picky about their Mexican food here - as they should. Arizona is lousy with Mexican food restaurants. I'm not going to go so far as to say it's the best I've ever had (I've had a lot of Mexican food from a lot of different places), but I will say that it's delicious and consistent. I mean, some of the best places to go get authentic Mexican food in the Valley are dirty little hole in the wall joints that you might be scared to go into. This place is clean and nice and quite a bit more upscale than that. 

I wouldn't say the food here is inauthentic either. It's plenty authentic... that word means different things to different people anyway. Some think it means a similar experience to when they visited Rocky Point, and others will cite examples from when they visited Oaxaca or Cabo or Mazatlan, and yet others will compare your favorite place to a chain they like.

This is a killer good pizza joint. 

Philly cheesteak pizza -- 5 out of 5 as close to a outstanding pizza I have had.

This is def. a lighter style pizza not too heavy seasoning are nice on the pizza also good quality steak. A must try.

Also got chicken wings--  these comes french fries witch I was a little shocked at first and thought I got the wrong order. The Chicken wings are jumbos really good and clean tasting not fryer like witch is nice. Also the french fries where really good to also came with celery and carrots .

We are new to Charlotte, NC (been here since Nov.2012) and frequent Blakney shops, Stonecrest and Ballantyne shops as we were in corporate housing in Ballantyne until recently when our home was finished. We drove past and saw this place on many occassions and never thought to go in and have breakfast. 

After a great couples massage, the hubby and I were hungry and were driving and we thought maybe we should check out the menu at that Flying Biscuit place it does have buscuit in it's name so breakfast should be on the menu.

We arrived and were immediately seated in the country looking, quaint restaurant. I immediately noticed the decor which was fun and attention grasping which is great for conversation and great to keep children interested which I noticed was going on a couple of tables over from us. 

My husband ordered the Chicken Sausage & Turkey Bacon Egg white omlette with a homemade biscuit & grits and I ordered the infamous Shrimp & Grits. Now I'm from Chicago and Wishbone in Chicago HANDS DOWN has the BEST Shrimp and Grits so I was very skeptical. 
My husband ENJOYED his meal and is sooo excited about going back. ME on the other hand had HIGHER expectations for the Shrimp Grits from the reviews. They don't have ANYTHING on the Shrimp grits in Chicago at Wishbone. However the day after when I heated up my left overs the flavors had time to mix and mingle and it tasted much better (still not Wishbone in Chicago or 131 Main in Blakney).

I will be back to try something else as my husband is definitely impressed with the food for the price ;-)",2013-04-18 20:18:18

The service is always great, even during Seasonlicious, which I really appreciate - there are very, very few places that will treat you like a full-price-paying customer during those times of the year, and this is one of them.

We decided, spontaneously and without a reservation, to go for dinner here on Friday night.  Alas, the restaurant was full and we didn't want to wait, so ended up ordering take-out.

One of our regular orders is their fried chicken.  Having tried lots of fried chicken around the city, we consider the fried chicken here to be one of the best.  While we've tried their ""hot"" version, we prefer their original (as it's less ""saucy"").  It's a generous serving, comes with a biscuit, and a side (we love their coleslaw!)

A newer item we'd not tried before is their double-down.  We decided to give this a try, even though we debated whether it was overkill to have both fried chicken AND a double-down (hey, it's a Friday night so we went all out).  Having KFC / Taco Bell across from them must give them some menu inspirations - they have the equivalent of ""fries supreme"", and now the double-down (although I'm not sure if KFC still has this since I don't do KFC.)  This is 2 pieces of boneless fried chicken topped with cheese / sriracha mayo, their home-made square bacon and an egg.  A nice touch is that as take-out, the sunny-side up egg is packed in a separate container.  Fantastically decadent!

The order came to $44 before tip, but this lasted us TWO meals each.

We've tried most of their menu items, with their mac and cheese being another favourite.  They also offer a lot of dessert options that are often nostalgic (i.e., lemon ice box pie) have a very ""home made"" feel.  The only suggestion I'd make is for them to offer more veggie/vegan options.  The only entree suitable for one of our friends is their curry - she says it's delicious.  That said, when we suggest going to WBK for dinner, this choice is sometimes veto'ed because she needs to be in the mood for this one entree that she can order!

We've also tried their brunches a few times.  The food again is excellent, but the wait times / lines deter us unless we go for a late brunch.

It's not though. It is in the middle of a residental neighborhood, can't be seen from a major street, and look's closed from the outside.

They're known for their walnut cakes and Korean pancakes. I like how places like this know they make good food so they stick to what they're good at and just perfect it. The walnut cakes are delicious and soft with a light crunch on the outside and a sweet filling inside. Best eaten warm, if possible! 

The Korean pancake is also super delicious, you can choose between brown sugar filled or red bean filled. I got the brown sugar for the pancake because I chose red bean for the walnut cakes. Unfortunately, it wasn't warm when I bought it but I warmed it up in my toaster oven when I got home and it was soo good! I wish this place was closer to where I work..

I have little experience with ramen (other than the stuff that comes in plastic bags that got me through college).  With that in mind, here's my review.

My wife ordered off the sushi menu.  She found the fish to be fresh but did not care for the Wasabi.  She also didn't love the trim on the salmon as they left the layer between the skin and the flesh on the sushi.  I tried the tuna and the halibut and they were both fresh and nicely cut.

I ordered the crab steamed buns and the Obon Ramen.  The buns were OK but I thought the crab was over-fried and a bit too salty.  This would have  been a much better dish with sauteed soft shelled crabs.  The ramen, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious.  As I noted, I don't have any experience with Ramen but the flavors were rich and complex.  The pork melted in my mouth and was not overseasoned.  The noodles were, well, noodles. I loved them.  

Service was excellent. Vivian was a great waitress with good suggestions and an engaging personality.  When I return, I'll probably try try the pork buns and a different ramen.  

The atmosphere is what I term 'busy modern'.  It's a little noisy but did not interfere with conversation.  Decor is a little nondescript but certainly pleasant.  

Overall, it's a nice place for dinner and the prices are not unreasonably, especially for Scottsdale.",2017-09-03 01:37:41

That didn't matter too much because we don't live far and I wasn't driving, lol. Anyway, I ordered their regular Philly Cheesesteak and a side of fries. Let me tell you, I enjoyed this sandwich more than I did an actual Philly cheesesteak from Philly that I had last year. The fries were delicious and the sauce that came with the sandwich was amazing. I would say that the sauce is what elevated the meal for me and made me love it. Had I known their sauce would be that good, I would have ordered an entire bottle (if they offered it that way). The sandwich itself was nothing short of tasty; everything was prepared beautifully and the bread was not soggy or anything.

I really hoped to like this place but I felt the food was hit or miss.  The service was average with a few instances where we were unable to find someone to help us.

But really, the food was sort of a disappointment given the price tags.  So here's the rundown:
- Snails:  The price on these were ""MP"".  I believe they were $14 that day.  We got a small bowl of anemic snails (6) in a lemongrass broth.  The broth was good.  The snails were not my cup o'tea.
- Black Pepper Lobster:  MP...Good flavor, waaayyyy too salty and oversauced.  The noodles underneath also became too salty. Lobster must have also been dieting.
- Shrimp Skewers: Also MP...they were just regular big shrimp. Unfortunately, these came a skosh overcooked.
- Oxtail fried rice:  Probably my favorite dish that evening, especially since they left in all the tender fat and gristle from the oxtail itself.
- Oxtail fries:  Nicely done fries, topping was also great.
- Garlic Chicken Wings:  You got the garlic but it was sorely unsalted.
- Cornish Hen - Bird itself was moist and well-seasoned; accompanying rice was meh
- Calamari - Forgettable except for the spicy sauce that came with it.
- Rib Eye Pho - Average

I routinely stop by here after work to pick up a few things before I head home to make dinner and the store is always clean, well stocked and everything is reasonably priced.  The employees I have met have all been very friendly and helpful.

Their house brand is quite high quality and I usually prefer them in both taste and pricing.  Also there are some harder to find items in their import section, which is nice if you occasionally indulge in dishes from overseas, particularly from the UK.  Where else in the Valley can you quickly find clotted cream, spotted dick (*giggle*) and Wheatabix cereal?  Of course the prices for the import items are slightly more than the regular domestic items, but that's to be expected.

They also have a reduced price, fresh food section which I really like because it's usually chock full of ready to eat, but on the verge of expiring, items that are both tasty and affordable.  Also, they sometimes distribute samples of the bakery items from the in-store bakery in the back.  I've noticed their baked goods are quite delicious.  Additionally, they have an admirable selection of import cheeses, cured meats, wines, fresh made hummus, salsas, olives, etc..  I think the perfect Summer dinner is a tray of sliced meats, cheeses, a fresh baguette, some buttery spread, olives, heirloom tomatoes, grapes, roasted nuts and maybe some fig jam.  Delicious and easy thanks to Fresh & Easy.

They send out a weekly mailer that always has a coupon of differing value on your overall purchase price, not just on an individual item.  I really like the $5 off of $25 coupons, but more often than not they send out the $3 off of $30 coupon, not a smoking deal, but if you are coming here anyway that week it pays to have the coupon with you and pocket the $3 savings, right??

My only complaint is about their convoluted, hot ass mess of a shopper's reward card program.  From what I can tell, it's more worthless than tits on a boar hog.  For that alone I am subtracting a point.  It has some bizarre equation of points accumulated with certain purchases.  (But not all purchases...?  I'm actually not sure, it's THAT confusing)  Those points are somehow linked back to some coupons you've *maybe* earned somewhere, which I have never seen offered nor have I been able to generate *any* point-of-sale reduction in price either, and I shop here quite frequently...  It doesn't make any sense, I suspect it's simply a marketing ploy to track our spending habits with the constantly moving target of the tantalizing promise of potential savings, someday...  I MUCH prefer shoppers rewards cards that give you an instant discount (on a artificially inflated price, naturally) or even better, NO rewards cards at all, just plain, old low prices.  Now THAT'S a novel concept.  ;)
  
Anyway, aside from the stupid shoppers card, all in all, because of its manageable size and fresh selection, this is a good store for a quick trip in and out.  If I need a huge cart full of groceries, this isn't the best store since their overall selection is smaller than say a Fry's, but still for a few must-have dinner or lunch items this is a great option.  And yes, aside from some kinks when they first opened with regards to rotating stock they really are Fresh & Easy.",2012-10-16 15:27:55

The address is 303 Centre St SE, but you'll find it inside a bigger building on 3 Ave SW right near the Centre St intersection. Follow the sandwich board arrows inside! The restaurant is the first on your right once you're inside.

The place is open from 11am - 8pm, with a specials list all under $10 on weekdays 2-6pm and Saturdays 11am - 6pm. I walked into an empty (tiny) restaurant at 5:30pm and asked for a spicy recommendation from their specials list. She suggested the Kongpao Chicken Combo, which is very popular. It was $8.75 + tax - I peeked and the usual menu item is $13.50.

My food was ready is less than 5 minutes and was pretty tasty! I had a generous serving of rice with chicken, onion, peppers and chilies. I was impressed with the chicken quality and the flavour given the price. Plus the veggies tasted fresh even though I don't see how they could have cooked it so quickly.

Being pretty hip to the coffee scene in PHX, I was a little surprised to hear of this new shop, having not heard of it's coming.  Maybe I didn't look around enough, but it felt like Nami just kind of popped up.

So I had my doubts, as I always will when giving a new place a shot.  The layout was pleasant, and the decor pretty rad; love the couch.  Parking seems sorted out a great deal better than when That's A Wrap inhabited the area -  good plus there.  Sweets looked great.

So I order my typical - drip and a 2x (on the side).  This gives me a general idea of the shop; milk drinks are for second and beyond trips.  Firstly, their demi-tasses are super cute.  Obviously hand-made, and hopefully local.  Loved it.  My drip actually turned out to be a pour-over, which is a plus to me.  A coffee junkie can appreciate a pour-over, where it kind of scares a person just wanting some ""coffee"" (see: I understand why you call it drip vs pour-over).

Straight up espresso is generally a quick way of determining bad-average-good.  Crema was nice though, consistent, and had me thinking I might have a decent thing here.  Taste was good, creamy and quite chocolatey (which seems the profile of the beans being used - the drip was reminiscent of the same).  Said and done (from a 'snob' standpoint), the espresso was good, not mindblowing.  I think the grind was right, but either the dosing could be moved up a tiny bit, or tamped a little harder.  Granted, this was the first and only I had there, so I can't necessarily base the entire shop on that one dopio.  All in all, I'm saying it was good, and while the extraction time was right, it could use a little more density.

The drip (see: pour-over) clearly used the same roast, which isn't a complaint.  The same chocolatey, creamy notes were abound.  I feel the dosing was very light, and should have either been a 12oz, or more grounds used.  I actually felt I was drinking a water heavy coffee.  Not terrible, but certainly not great.  I have a sneaking suspicion if the measurement was a bit closer, it would have been a much better brew.  Pour-overs are an art first, for sure, then a science.  I think they have potential here.  Maybe a better pot would help with this brew method as well.


-- I'll be back.  My experience was neither mind-blowing nor off-putting.  I'm hoping after they get into the swing of things and get the kinks ironed out, this will be one of the cooler stops in PHX.  Certainly a great concept and whatnot.",2011-10-06 21:26:47

We went with the sweet and spicy chicken wings instead and it was pretty subpar. The meat itself was moist but overly seasoned. The skin was overly battered which made it separate from the meat and bone with each bite.

On a more positive note, their spicy cheesy udon was done quite nicely, with reminisce of the cheesy topping of a freshly made pizza.

The service was not attentive at first (when we arrived, it took a while after we were seated for someone to bring us menus and then for someone to notice we were at the table) but after that it was smooth sailing. We were not in a hurry and did not mind the wait, but if we were I may have deducted a star for the inconvenience. 

First lets discuss the decor. Exposed brick, mirrors, an assortment of Edison lights and lit candles make this place trendy and intimate without sacrificing the urban appeal. 

We started with the spinach and artichoke dip, which was served with light, crunchy crostinis. It was ridiculously good possessing both a creaminess and a density in the flavour. The sundried tomatoes were an excellent touch and had me questioning why all spinach and artichoke dips do not come with these salty delicacies?! 

We decided to split a small order of the zucca (butternut squash) ravioli and the Diavolo pizza 
(spicy chicken, mozzarella, Pecorino cheese, caramelized onions, roasted grape tomatoes, balsamic reduction). The ravioli was gorgeous and delicious. Had we not have also gotten the pizza I would have regretted getting the smallest size. Despite being rich in flavour, I swear I could have eaten three times as many of those delicious pockets of scrumptious and flavourful squash. The pizza was awesome, but way spicier than we were anticipating! Luckily we can stand the heat and had wine and beer to help wash it down, but be wary if you don't like it hot.

We were too full for dessert, but that changed when our server whose name I don't recall brought us out a small plate of warm, gooey chocolate chip cookies. Damn those were good cookies! What a great way to top off a delicious meal. 

Definitely recommend Scaddabush! I know it's a small but growing chain, but it did not have the atmosphere of a chain at all. Definitely a great place for a date or to hang out with friends.",2015-10-22 20:22:05

I was hoping for something more 'Pumpkiny' but this wasn't it.. The pumpkin beer they provided said it was brewed with 200 lbs of pumpkin hence why I expected the 'Pumpkiny' taste...  I don't mind the beer though because wheat ale is definitely my go to when it isn't pumpkin season.

Ordered the BBQ burger which had a burger patty with caramelized onions, artisan lettuce, and pulled pork on top! Everything was very consistent with each bite! There was jalapeños and pepper jack cheese which tied everything together and you couldn't really taste the jalapeños because the BBQ pulled pork flavor was a bit overpowering.  Oh boy and let me tell you about their side of tator tots!!!! Its like little hash browns with a hint of ginger and cheese.  I couldn't quite figure out how they made it but it definitely is not the average tator tots you could buy at the store.  It was crunchy on the outside and cheesey and chewy on the inside.  I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone in the mood for a juicy BBQ type of burger.  And their booze to wash it down is definitely a plus!

So I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp and my wife ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken lunch special which was because it was still considered lunch time.

I got a Thai tea with boba and it was really tasty, we decided to get the food to go and if you order the lunch special they don't serve it with soup to go because the containers they serve it in are not very sturdy so I opted for an order of egg flower soup which came with a better container. 

The owner said it was more of liability  issue which I could see after he showed me the cup they serve it in.i wanted some and was willing to pay more to take some with me.

The food was still pretty hot since we live relatively close 2.5 miles away, I liked my Kung Pao Shrimp. My wife didn't like that their was too much tempura on the Sweet & Sour Chicken and the rice didn't really have no flavor to it and the noodles were too thick.

This time, I went to see if the food was consistent and to gauge how different the omakase was, a month later.  

First of all, I want to say EVERYONE that I had with me loved it.  They unanimously agreed it was the best sushi they've ever had and the entire dinner was filled with sounds of Mmmms and Ohmahgawds.  I think some agreed it was the best meal they've had.  

There were a few overlapping items for me, but it was different enough for me to be satisfied.  

Consistency!  It was just as good as the first time!  

This place makes every other sushi restaurant in Arizona seem like supermarket fare.  

Finally, a few people may think it is too expensive for a meal.  
Here's my take.  We had six courses with a dessert for a total of 7 courses.  
The second course was six different small portions of completely different items.  If you're counting the six pieces of nigiri in course number 6, that is a lot of different dishes and items to prepare.  Osetra caviar, huuuuge pieces of fois gras, nigerian tiger prawn, giant clam, toro, Kumamoto oysters, black sea bass... were just a FEW of the ingredients in our long list of bites.  That is sooo worth 125$.  

Best deal and best meal in Arizona.  Period.",2013-06-07 06:48:54

This place is a dirty disaster. 
First of all, the staff was blasting gangsta rap, it was so loud that I had to ask the guy at the counter to repeat himself several times while taking our order. They were out of watermelon and several ingredients for the hummus sandwich. Tables inside were not clean (and the loud music continued) so we had to sit outside in the summer heat. 

The Thai wrap I ordered not only came with wilted, overly marinated lettuce, and dry chicken, but I found a plastic clasp in my sandwich, you know the kind that comes on every loaf of grocery store bread that keeps the bag closed? Yeah, that happened. I took it back to the counter immediately and the staff only said ""oh, sorry about that"". I guess they're ok with making harmful mistakes in people's food. Biting into plastic and almost swallowing it, was not fun. 

All other food in our order was ok, absolutely nothing special. Mostly slapped together and not worth the $30 I spent at all.

Armed with a varied menu of sexual innuendo sushi rolls, there is something for everyone.  I love sushi does not do all you can eat which makes it difficult to try different things on a budget but usually means better quality and attention.

Note - 3 stars means A-ok in my book.  To score higher, a restaurant needs to add the other things in that make restaurants appealing.  This is where this experience fell short but I enjoyed the food enough that I will return and hopefully update the review with additional accolades.

What fell short? 1) From the initial seating, we felt rushed. At least 3 times in the first 5 minutes, the sushi chef assigned to us (there must have been about 6 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar) asked us if we wanted to order. It was our first time in this restaurant and we were obviously going over the menu and I thought it less than friendly.  The bar was not overcrowded and there was no danger that other customers would be waiting without a seat.

Once we ordered the food came very quickly.however, when we wanted to make an additional order, we found all 6 chefs staring at a Nets game and not paying attention to the customers.  It literally took 5 minutes to get the chef's attention.

We ordered the sushi dynamite which tasted good however it said it came in a shell but it really comes in aluminum foil which gives it a very tinny taste and really lacks in presentation.

Finally, this is the most overpriced sushi restaurant not located on the strip.  if you order one of the special rolls, it costs nearly as much as an AYCE lunch.  The rolls we tried were good but there was nothing distinctive such as larger portions, better presentation, or fresher fish than a similar AYCE roll.

Either it is a large show-off over decorated place with a patio and flame torches, with a menu that costs an arm and a leg, with blonde girls in tight black t shirts serving lousy food, or it is low rent chains that pass for Asian food by throwing soy or Teriyaki sauce on rice, like the low end and ubiquitous Samarai Sam's and other similar take out teriyaki places that compete with Chun King and Cup a Noodle. 

So for Snottsdale, this is pretty darn good. It is in a strip mall on N Hayden, near where I used to work, and oddly enough, next door to a Samurai Sam's. 

It has been here for about 3 years, it is clean and nice, and they have most of the basics you would fine in those other major cities with larger Viet populations. Of course Pho Noodle Soup, Vermicelli noodle plates (Bun), and some rice plates that appeal to those in Scottsdale more used to PF Chang. 

Also for the Low Fan are popular Spring Rolls, Egg Rolls, and Fried Shrimp Wontons. But for the Viets missing more than the popular American dishes, they also have Banh Xeo and Com like rice dishes. 

They do have more Chinese like dishes to appeal to those who never had Vietnamese food and couldn't wait at PF Chang's.

And then I ordered the spicy miso ramen bowl... which was good.... but the pepper strings in it really just blew my pallet out and I wasn't able to enjoy the rest of my meal.

I want to just mention that Charlotte/Matthews ramen scene is still relatively young so I expect these trail blazer restaurants to have their food on point.  The few other places that do offer ramen are ranking a little higher than YUME in my book.

In true Asian form, there is a $1 upcharge for dark meat which has less meat.   We got both but it would be nice to be able to get a combo of white and dark.    The trio of sauces consisted of a sweet dark soy, your traditional ginger scallion, and a SPicy Nuro which was more vinegar base.

My esteemed sister and I went to Belgo this week for a mid-week lunch and some deliciousness. I haven't been to Belgo for five years - so I knew I liked it then and was excited for this round two adventure. It didn't disappoint. I remembered a great poutine, so I surely ordered it again for an appetizer (because carbs are my friend) and it was really good. It was very hot (read here very fresh), awesome cheese curds, good sauce, delicious sausage slices and nice big toasty taters for ""fries"". Score one for the poutine.

A cute feature they offer is the 2 for 25$ deal which gives you a choice of three appetizers and choice of three mains for 25 $ - which is a decent price at a high end restaurant. However, we were swayed away to the lunch menu as there were numerous items that peaked our interest. My sister in crime ordered the burger which she shared graciously with me - and it was delicious. They did a good burger. I had the prime rib beef dip which was yummy! It came with a surprisingly large amount of really great meat and beef dip that was really tasty (not too salty either). Only complaint is the sandwich could have been a little hotter. The star of the meal was the mac and cheese as a side (yes - a restaurant that gives an awesome M&C side option like the USA - loves it). It was in a small dish to its own, nicely hot, roasted tomatoes and chicken included. It made me very happy to have as an option and happier it was well done. 

The beer menu as mentioned below is outstanding and they likely have one of the biggest in the city with lots of import beer. It makes for a fun Saturday night of taste testing with a poutine. The prices can be a bit high for the steaks and main dishes, but it's expected for the restaurant that it is (the lunch prices were very reasonable and comparable).

Our service on this visit was exceptional and the waitress was a joy to have as our server (wish I knew her name). Her perfect amount of joking with the right amount of professionalism made her fun to have at our table doing follow-ups and water refills.

Bouchon put together a really dinner nice menu for restaurant week.  The table started with a large bowl of pitted olives and 1 tasty salmon rillette each.  I would go back just to eat the rilletes, they were salty silky perfection.  The next course was a tomato salad which was dressed with a flavorful basil dressing. I really loved this salad because I am crazy about tomatoes.  For the main, we chose the trout which was beautifully presented and came with tons of toasted almonds and green beans.  The portion was very satisfying and it was cooked nicely but I had trout earlier that day from DB Brasserie and DB's was quite a bit better.

The low point was dessert which was an unimaginative chocolate mousse.  The mousse was boring yet rich and was paired with a bland custard creme.

L'ambiance était festive, avec les ""Saké. BOMB!"" hurlés de tous bords, tous côtés, et la nourriture était vraiment délicieuses.

De manière générale, j'adore le concept de petits tapas japonais à partager. Ça permet de goûter à plein d'items au menu et ça fait tellement plus convivial ! On a donc eu la chance de goûter à tout ceci :

-Tataki de boeuf
-Gindara (poisson mariné pendant 3 jours et grillé)
-Fromage de chèvre frit
-Champignons grillés
-Taki Yaki (boulettes de pieuvre frites)
-Yakisoba aux crevettes
-Gomaae (salade d'épinards)
-Salade d'algues
-Karaage (poulet frit)
-Crème glacée vanille avec mochi et purée d'edamame

Personnellement, j'ai eu un gros coup de coeur pour les boulettes de pieuvre (à essayer absolument) et le tataki de boeuf. Les cocktails qu'on a goûtés étaient aussi vraiment originaux, tant par leur saveur que par leur texture.

Seul petit point qui nous a dérangées pendant la soirée, c'est que par deux fois, le serveur nous a apporté le mauvais plat, et il nous faisait sentir chaque fois comme si c'était nous qui avions commis l'erreur lors de la commande.

the service and quality I received the first day were amazing. Recently my Acai bowl is just thin (like water) fruit is lacking and hardly any granola or chocolate. My 1st one was perfect and prepared by the gentleman barista. The girls have been serving my more recently.

 Bowl is just not worth the price. The amount they give you wouldn't even be a small smoothie ugh. So you're stuck with a thin mix of yogurt and acai... 3 pieces of sliced strawberries, 2 blueberries and hardly any chocolate and granola and charge $6. No way. Not worth it anymore.

Irma was helping us. When I pulled her over to inquire why she was going to cry, it was because a patron couldn't possibly eat his postre. (A general word for dessert.) Irma, our amazing server, laughed when I said I'd take his dessert. This is very laid back, chill place serving authentic food in an unassuming place.

I miss hearing my parents and family banter in their Colombian selves. Cubans apparently mix and mingle in a similar fashion. Irma wove her magic throughout the restaurant, smiling and laughing. Quite possibly the happiest woman in Phoenix. (Eventually a delicious red sangria was selected, which went down entirely too fast.)

But back to the menu. The menu is clear to understand to anyone, from any corner of the world. Yes, I had a head start as many of the dishes share palates with Colombia. However, the menu here is clearly translated into English for anyone to decipher. No need to fret. And if you're overwhelmed by choices, there are two things that might help you order. Forks designate ""Havana Signature Items"". Additionally you can opt for a Combination or Sampler plate. It's for the ""I Just Don't Know"" moments.

SEATING
I came here the night someone had their wedding reception! So yes, Havana Cafe readily can accommodate groups. With charm, sincerity and the utmost attention they can provide wonderful service to a party of two. We arrived separately on a Tuesday night around 6-ish pm. Patrons started to trickle in more so around 7pm. 

Upon arriving I learned there wasn't really a bar area to wait for my friend to arrive. No matter, I was promptly seated even though my party had not fully arrived.

FOOD
Eager to eat we ordered fried plantains. When offered an option as to how they were prepared, I jumped and asked for Tostones. The pounded green ones (vs. the sweet kind.) Salty, but not too salty, served with a side of mojo-garlic lime sauce. My mom and aunt prepare them slightly crispier, but these were still delicious.

For a meal the Ropa Vieja was divine. Humongous, but delicious. Shredded beef brisket, bell peppers, onions, tomato wine sauce and black beans over rice. I was surprised by the difference in texture of the onions on the rice vs. the brisket. It was nice to have a sweet, fresh onion on the rice. The brisket had a blended texture of spices with the vegetables. (Enough left overs for two more meals. But I'm a girl eating 3 ounces of protein in a meal.)

The night was young, and ma ' belly was full. The flan looked tempting. I'll have to send a recon mission back just for that!

And yes, the leftovers were excellent :)",2014-03-06 07:08:46

They had pumpkin spice cake neatly tied in a bundle at 4.95, pear and walnut tortes, rocky road layer cakes, and chocolate bombs. They have carrot cake, chocolate brownies, date squares and lemon squares all for $2.14.  They have a big banana mess at 3.95, assorted pies, sandwiches, salsas, granola, trail mixes, homemade jams and I have to breathe!

There is just such a nice mix here and the most upper end presentation, the goods are baked in the back and the staff is super friendly.

I had polled quite a few friends about restaurants they think are worth showing off to people who used to live in Pittsburgh and are back in town. Morcilla came up on everyone's list. 

We made a reservation for a Saturday night and I'm glad we did as the place was packed all evening. 

The atmosphere is very warm. Our server was a wealth of knowledge and helped us navigate appropriate quantities of food for our group. Her recommendations were on point and she paced the plates we ordered at the perfect pace and combinations of plates that we ordered was also perfect! 

We did a number of small plates. The octopus was phenomenal. Incredibly tender and yet meaty! I couldn't get over it. The fried artichokes were great and the oxtail was one of the most flavorful foods I've ever eaten. The cecina was perhaps the most buttery,melt in your mouth cured meat I've ever tried. 

I cannot adequately express what a pleasurable dining experience this was. We finished our meal with the churros and they came out piping hot-crispy and coated in sugar and slightly custardy in the center. Dip them in the not-too-sweet chocolate sauce for perfection. 

I have to say, there are other things that impressed me. Our table was close to the kitchen and offered us a unique view. We could not get over how impeccably clean it looked! It was also relatively quiet! No screaming from the kitchen! In addition, despite the fact that the place was full, it didn't feel too noisy or that you're on top of other diners.

I've been getting more adventurous with my beers as my disposable income level (every so slightly) goes up, but left to my own devices with restaurants, I always want to go to a place where I can get a burger or big-ass grilled cheese sandwich. 

So when one of my friends had originally wanted to go to One of Those Burger Places for their birthday, I was psyched. I was not so psyched when I got a text message from his wife saying it was changed to some sushi place I had never heard of. ""Aw man,"" I thought to myself. ""I know my dude bro wants a beer and burger."" But since I am at least smart enough to not argue with my friends' spouses, I acted like it was all cool, but still wanting inside, well, not sushi, even though I dig it from time to time.

Well, I was a regular nitwit, because she took us to this place, and I am extremely grateful that she did. This is definitely a higher-class sushi bar -- quite literally a bar, that you sit at and watch them make the sushi. The entire place is about as big as a Parma basement, which actually makes for a great ambiance. The beer/wine selection is good, but the real treat is the sushi. Nothing ever compares to fresh-made sushi. Occasionally you can get decent stuff pre-packaged at the supermarket, but this blows that shit out of the water. 

My buddy basically got the ""everything"" platter -- I can't remember the actual name and I don't speak Japanese anyway. I was pretty much everything they offer, sashimi-style (without rice). It looked HEAVENLY. I had a couple plates of the ""regular"" sushi, and it was fantastic. The service was excellent, and, as I mentioned, the ambiance was great.

I've been here several times and I can't say I'm entirely impressed. Although it's neat to watch the cooks make the noodles right in front of you, they seem to use the same dough for everything on their menu, which makes it easy for them to offer such a variety. However, everything I've tried just seems to taste the same because they use that same dough for everything. If you get one dumpling, you've tried them all. I've tried the potstickers, soup dumplings and pan-fried dumplings. They taste the same, just depends if you're in the mood for fried and crispy or steamed and soggy. In terms of noodles, of course the broths and toppings change the flavor but something about the ones I've tried are still so similar. I've tried the Dan tsu, Dan Dan and spicy wonton. Of the three, I like the spicy wonton most. Dan tsu has a strong 5 spice flavor and Dan Dan, I'm not a fan. Their Dan Dan noodles have a strong peanut butter taste and although that's a key ingredient, I don't think it should overpower all the other flavors. 

However, I do like the bubble teas. Their bubble teas aren't overly sweetened and I like that you have the option of getting an additional topping other than tapioca. They have grass jelly and red bean which I haven't seen at many other bubble tea places.

Case and point: Local foodies were prematurely speaking of Soho months in advance of it's opening. Salivating and fantasizing of the very much needed concept of Southern cuisine that is still very sparse among the Cleveland dining landscape. ""At last!"", they seemed to say in unison. A hip, modern take on Southern hospitality! 

And then Soho opened. And we went there. And we dined. And ate. And drank. And we were disappointed by it all. Another far reaching take on Southern cuisine that just didn't cut it. Sigh....

Where did it all go wrong? First off the menu is very unadventurous. Stereotypical Southern food done in a stereotypical, unexciting way. The majority of the menu is either battered, deep-fried or smothered in a heavy sauce or syrup. The portions were absolutely humongous and somewhat insulting. Half the menu is made-up of Po-Boy sandwiches the size of your head. The plates I saw leave the kitchen seemed like enough food to feed a family of 4.

I ordered a bowl of sweet potato bisque with marshmallow cream and spiced peanuts to start.  I could barely taste either the marshmallow or peanuts. Next I ordered the chicken and waffles. 2 legs and a giant breast; overly breaded, heavy and deep fried atop 2 waffles. The fried chicken had so much breading that it wasn't cooked all the way though. Red juices were still seeping from the bones of the chicken legs. Not very appetizing and unacceptable. We also ordered a side of the jalapeno hush puppies which were flavorless, overcooked and as dry as sand. Those went unfinished. For dessert and with every bit of energy soaked up by all of the grease consumed, we opted to get a slice of pecan pie to take home. 

Each entrée on the menu was listed at a flat-fee of $17 a piece. With no rhyme or reason, that just seems lazy. Also, I don't know about the rest of you, but when I eat out, I don't expect to be fed on leftovers for days later. I really wish some restaurants would lessen the portions and instead focus on quality vs. quantity. For people who want quantity, the Golden Corral exists for a reason. For the rest of us, give us a plate food a normal person is able to consume.

The Flamingo is one of the old school Casino/Hotels in Las Vegas. Many of its contemporaries (Dessert Inn, Sands, Stardust, etc.) have been torn down.

As such, this Hotel is nothing special for Vegas goers, and for folks like me, this is where the meeting was held, so why not stay here?

My upgraded Room (in the Spa Tower) was about $80. It was roomy, clean, and comfortable, albeit dated and in need of refurbishment. And at this price, there was no coffee in the room or anything else past the most basic of amenities. In hindsight, I should have maybe splurged and stayed somewhere fancier, but considering the short stay and my focused business purpose, I did just fine.

The Conference Center part of the Hotel was much better. The meeting rooms were comfortable and very conducive for business.

- The shari rice was done quite good
- The California Roll was A-OK!
- The Nigiri sushi though really disappointing! Fish was sliced so thin and have the tuna looks frightfully red and the rest of the selections were kind of dry

However, I for the first time today took what seemed to be the advantage of ordering online. My office all wanted lunch from there and the line can be pretty ridiculous at noon, so I figured I would pre order then just walk in pay and be on my happy way. Not so much. I will say that the ordering process is great, very easy and fast, took just a few minutes then hit send. But when I got there is when the annoyances started. Our food was not ready on time. I made a point to watch the person that walked in right after us and see how quickly they got out of the building, they won, we were still trying to pay for our order. It was seemingly very unorganized. The girl at the register kind of pointed us in a direction where someone would come out from the kitchen to give us our order, we were not allowed to pay or fill drinks while we were waiting, and it was to difficult to ask any questions that we were too frustrated to ask for extra salsa. 

On top of that while we were waiting the lady that was making our food came out in the middle of prep to talk to another customer about franchise opportunities and how much their building rent was. **Note to the jerk off that thought it would be a god idea to pull the manager out of the kitchen to discuss business at noon on a Monday: HELLO!? Are you serious? Time and place buddy, time and place. Call Corp for these silly questions. Arg! 

Anyway, the food is good, but they really need to get a better handle on their service. A bit of a cluster f*** if you know what I mean. I am a huge fan of ordering online and getting things fast, but I do not recommend using these opportunities at Chipotle.",2009-11-23 21:10:56

Service, the staff are very helpful, came by to remove dishes, ask for opinions and refills of drinks promptly.  No issues here.

Decor/atmosphere, the place is nicely decorated but don't come here with a large group.  It seems like the ideal size is 2-3, 4 is okay but harder and any group that is 5 or more will likely have a long wait.

Food, the food was okay.  I personally don't see why the reviews are so good, but it may just be a personal preference and that we had waited for over half an hour for a table and my expectations weren't met due to the wait.

Price, we ordered a sandwich for about $12 and a green salad for $6.  The salad seems like a good size but the sandwich was a bit of a disappointment for me at $12.

Here's the secret for Canes tho - Breakfast Chicken! A lot of Canes (including this one) open at 9 AM, I figure a chicken basket isn't that far off from chicken and waffles for breakfast (its pretty much the same thing without syrup). There's hardly anyone there until like 10:30 or so too, plus early in the day you can be sure you're getting strips fresh out the fryer, which makes them twice as good.

Having now tried one of the entrees however, my expectations of all the others that sounded good have gone down. Perhaps this is more of a place for burgers than entrees. 

I tried the Pretzel Crusted Chicken entree. The portion was large; two big pieces of white boneless meat. The pretzel crust however fell right off the chicken and basically turned into a pile of breadcrumbs on the plate. I appreciate thin breading, but I do want the flavors from it. The overwhelming flavor of the dish was the mustard sauce, which tasted pretty much unaltered from your traditional mustard. The dish came with your basic unflavored steamed broccoli and a big pile of potatoes. I thought at $15.99 the price was a bit too high and TGI Fridays could have done just as well.

Also note that while the fish and chips special is running, the fish and chips on the extra paper menu is frozen. The one in the menu for just $0.51 more is fresh our waitress told us.

I'm particularly impressed with the Urban Eatery food court, I love how all restaurants serve food on actual dishware and cutlery and there are no garbage bins as staff sort through the trays to minimize waste. 
Toronto Eaton Centre immediately set the standard and is ahead of the game, coming from Montreal, the food courts around here only use paper or plastic plates.

 Buffalo Burger - maybe it's me & my untrained palette but I did not like this at all. Probably the wrong thing to order looking back. Should have read the menu more. The flavors didn't go well for me and I ended up throwing half of this away. I'm sure there are people that love this but for me... meh. 1/5

18 Hour Citrus Braised Veal Cheeks - really, really tasty. Great flavor & cooked perfect. Worth $34? That can be debated... I don't have anything to base that price off of. Never ordered Braised Veal Cheeks before... would have like to see more meat at that price though. 4.5/5

Cookies & Milk - ummmm... it's hard to go wrong when you are serving fresh, hot cookies. The chocolate chip were delicious but could have used few more chocolate chips. Outside of that it was great. 4.5/5

Service was good, ambience is really cool... love the decor. This is another strip restaurant that I would love to frequent if it wasn't for the price. Great for tourists... not priced for your average local.",2014-07-03 01:51:53

1) It's a beautiful farm atmosphere in what some consider ""the middle of the desert""
2) It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, and I'm a sucker for Triple-D
3) A fresh and tasty take on fast food
4) Unique wacky bathrooms
5) Must-see pneumatic condiment fountain

In fact, one of the times I visited, it was ""Triple-D Month"", which meant they had a lot of promotions relating to their appearance on the much-heralded Food Network show. You could even score a $10 gift card if you showed up dressed like Guy Fieri. I might've been able to grow out and two-tone the goatee, but since I'm bald, I'd never be able to pull off the spiky-haired thing. I will admit, I was tempted to ""borrow"" my neighbor's blonde kid and costume him up just to save a couple of bucks on the fine burgers here.

All the item menus in red type are the meals featured during The Blingy One's visit, so I've been working through them one at a time. I give a thumbs up to the Fontina Burger and the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, but I'm not terribly crazy about the sweet potato fries with the pineapple-serrano dipping sauce. I did fall in love with their garlic fries however, and have to recommend them dipped in the Joe's BBQ sauce (available at the fun-to-use pneumatic condiment fountain).

The waffles were not that great - a tad on the soggy side. My friend told me about the donut tree and I was very intrigued; I love donuts.

The server was amazing and very kind. However, as we came in there was a woman, I'm assuming a supervisor or manager of some sort, who was rudely yelling at a girl who was at the hostess stand. Not only should you not do that in front of guests, but you should never talk to a staff in that way whether in public or in private. She was so rude and unfit to be a supervisor/ manager. Sometimes, it's not whether you can run operations, it's how you do it. 

The food was mediocre. We did the winterlicious menu. The salmon poke dish to start was really good. Right amount if acidity and flavors. Great start. Then it went downhill. The steak was okay but rather flavorless and the grit on the bottom was definitely not appealing in both look and taste.  The beef cheek was tender but again, the grit to away from that flavor. Over all the dish was extremely heavy and there was nothing on the plate to give you a contrast. Everything was just savory and heavy. Finally the desserts came around. The cheese platter was okay.

It is a local place so you have the rough edges you get with local places. My friends are regulars here so maybe we get a little better service. My friends have told me that they have gone trough a few chefs here in the last few years. There is one there right now called Tony and he is very good. We requested him and it was worth the extra wait. He is very good and funny. Great interaction with us. Made some of the best fried rice I have had in a while. He is very talented.
The rest of the service is good too. Sure it is not that corporate teppanyaki place but it is still good. The show is different here. More fire. The corporate place is afraid of fire. Some of the dishes the corporate place does better some are better here. If you could combine the two you would have the perfect place.
Prices aren't too bad. The place is pretty good too. Like I said a few rough edges you get from a local place but nothing horrible. I would come back here with my friends anytime. Of course I love teppanyaki so it doesn't take much arm twisting. Overall I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars but I rounded up.

The lady not doing anything paged the next number. I didn't take a number, seeing as how I only had a question. She got very sassy with me when I told her that I didn't pull a number.

I asked her the question about pricing, and she very rudely told me it was ALWAYS by the yard, as if I should have known better..... yikes. Sorry, I'm new to this....Never been to your store.

A lot of Yelpers have ragged on das Hofbrauhaus mainly for the service, but I love this place!  I've been here a few times and I've never had a bad experience, even when it was super packed, which is very often!  There's a line to get in on the weekends, so be prepared.

I know this is a national chain and like most Yelpers, I prefer to stick to the local places, but I really enjoy the food (and drink) and ambiance here.  
The schnitzel is lightly seasoned, pounded out thin, and fried to a tender golden brown.  The sides they offer are good, but nothing special.  The pierogies were very good and filling, but I think I prefer the ones at Sokolowski's over HBH's. My brother in law raved about how good the sauerkraut balls were before this place even opened. I've had them on two separate occasions, and I must say I agree...they are fantastic!  They're filled with a mixture of corned beef and sauerkraut and fried up til firm and oh so scrumptious!  Put these golf ball-sized bundles of joy into your mouth and you'll see what I'm talking about!  Nomnomnom! The honey mustard dipping sauce pairs well with these balls.  The giant pretzels with beer cheese are great too!  After seeing all the pics of the ginormous bier battered onion rings, I'll be sure to try them next time!  

The beer (bier) hall here is really fun! There's always live bands playing polka or your favorite German tunes and it makes for a hip, family-friendly atmosphere.  Singing along and dancing on the benches is definitely encouraged.  I love me some Chicken Dance!  I'm not a beer connoisseur  by any means, but the beer (brewed in-house) is really good.  Dunkel is favorite!  Oh, and if you come with a group, you have to try the shot skis!

The wait staff is attentive and friendly. The ladies where these little ensembles that bare a lot of cleavage and the men wear traditional German Lederhosen! Love it!  Like I mentioned, Yelpers have complained about poor service, but I guess I've been lucky and have had pretty good service each time I've gone, although it takes a bit longer to receive your food when it's a madhouse.

Its bigger then most station casinos out there and one of the nicer ones. Of course, it was kind of confusing at first, but it sort of makes sense. We were trying to find the garage but there very well hidden. Of course, being the first time going there, you basically get lost very easily. But the garage, you'll see an entrance way at one point, then you go up another level and its just a big parking lot. Of course you then realize, the garage is under you, and we're just on the top floor. A bit further down the way is another garage, but we decided to just park at the first parking we saw. 

From the looks of it, it was very well detailed on the whole structure. Its like they actually took the time to make this place look appealing. To me, I was really impress on how they made the outside look so elegant. The inside, had this warm feeling to it. But on the other hand, it tend to be crowded by all these slot machines. Which is kind of a downer, but it is a casino/hotel. I just wish they use less slots, but I guess that's how they make their money. A lot of their restaurants are well designed and detailed, that it makes it look interesting on what this restaurant is. I'm sure people just want to know that its just a sushi restaurant, but putting something extra, puts a bit more of a spin to it. I do like their creativity when it came down to these restaurants. 

We came to Green Valley to watch Aaron Lewis in concert at the Ovation. The Ovation itself was a nice little venue. I honestly think they can probably make it better. But the design outside and inside was very nice. I gave the Ovation a decent review, but it could of been better. 

Overall, Green Valley Ranch is a nice place to look around. Its one of the busier Station casinos. So I'm sure there will be a lot of mix reviews. But I would probably say, that if your there to eat or play, then that would be a great place to check out.

Fired Pie has been on my radar since it's close to where I live and I could basically live off pizza if I had to (and even if I didn't have to). The glowing Yelp reviews helped make our choice to go in for an early dinner on Friday.

The experience of making your own pizza and choosing your own toppings is awesome...if the people behind the counter are actually listening to you. Here is, verbatim, how it went when it was my turn:

Guy: ""What can I get started for you?""
Me: ""I'll have the veggie pizza, but with pesto instead of red sauce""
Guy: ""Sure"" *immediately picks up red sauce and puts all over my pizza*
Me: ""...can I have some pesto on there too?""
Guy: ""Yeah. What kind of cheese?""
Me: ""...um. Mozzerella.""
Guy: *Puts mozz on my pizza, slides it down to toppings area*
Me: ""Can I please have some pesto on there too?""
Guy: ""Oh, sure"" *drizzles small spiral of pesto over cheese*

So. That's how that started. 

The girl who handled my toppings seemed to have no idea what went on their menu-standard veggie. We both kept having to look back at the one menu on the side wall (they should definitely invest in an over-the-back-counter menu ala every other fast/casual food joint for ease) and check to make sure she got it correct. She wasn't sure what went on my boyfriend's pesto chicken pie either. 

Speaking of boyfriend, he also handled to ordering for the field greens and roasted veggie salad we wanted. First guy lined up two salad bowls, so it looks like they split them there with no problem. Great! He also asked that they sub the balsamic out for italian dressing, which guy said would be no problem.

Once our pizzas rode the struggle bus out of the toppings area, we were asked for our names to write on the paper that our pizza slid onto in the oven, to keep everyone straight. We told them our order was for there, ordered drinks from the woman at the end of the line and sat down at a booth, after we picked up our own silverware and parm/red pepper shakers. Hopefully we could get over our ordering disaster and eat some delicious pizza!

I heard my name called and looked to the counter to see two pizza boxes and a boxed salad sitting on top (complete with a side of...you guessed it...balsamic dressing.) I couldn't do anything but laugh; it was the perfect ending to this nightmare of an order. First guy behind the counter had even taken out two bowls for our salad TO EAT THERE! Boyfriend was about to have a stress embolism so I scooped up our food and got the hell out of there. ""We would literally have to order the opposite of what we wanted for it to come out right the first time,"" he said in the car. Basically.

Why the second star? I have to be fair, the food was absolutely delicious. The pizza's crust was really on point and the salad was completely filled with roasted veggie toppings (and even better once I added my own dressing from our fridge.) But it was downright insulting to have NO ONE working there listening to us. I don't understand at all. Was it an off night? Was it an off team working? Did they hate us for some reason? I doubt I can convince the boyfriend to go back, so maybe I'll never know. Dang.",2014-03-03 15:50:49

I decided to walk down Mill on my way home from work and the doors were open and there were plenty of seats at the bar (in fact, no one was in the bar at that time). I sat down and ordered the cocktail of the day, which was some sort of vodka, cranberry juice, and vodka thing and though I'm usually a beer guy they seem to be a place that specializes in making good cocktails and I was right, it was smooth and kicked like a horse (just the way I like my cocktails and my kicks). 

For food I ordered off the small plate area of the menu. I started with something I've always wanted to try and never had the chance, shrimp and grits ($10). It came with 4 medium sized shrimp nestled in a small oblong bowl of some very creamy grits, which had a topping of sauteed bell pepper. The bartender told me he did not normally like shrimp and grits but the dish here was quite good and he was right! The dish came with a side consisting of a hot bread roll and some homemade garlic butter and if you like bread, not bad (not a big garlic bread fan and honestly, I would liked to have a more robust bread, in slices, to mop up the grits (I am a simple creature, liking good food but as you can tell from that statement, somewhat lacking in manners. 

The food was so good, and I care so much about my fellow yelpers, that I ordered another cocktail (they call it a super sunrise and it is made with some sort of herbal liquor from Sweden and orange juice, it had a strong herbal taste, not unpleasant, and if anything, was stronger than the last drink, but not in a bad way). For the second small plate I ordered the triple slider from the happy hour menu (comes with three different sliders on the most amazing potato buns, one with fresh roasted turkey, another with grilled portobella mushroom, and one with roast beef and a topping of fried onions). You get sauces as well, fresh fruit cranberry relish for the turkey slide, Au jus, for the portobella mushroom and if you ask, a side of horseradish for the roast beef. Overall, for $7, the best meal in town, just enough for a light meal and I noticed they grilled the inside of the bun, giving them a nice crunch when you eat the slides, delicious! 

Now, for the advice to Regions Bistro and Bar, where I pull from my knowledge of business and plain old sack of personal opinions, so do with them what you will. 
1. You don't seem to even know what Yelp is, the site even says you are closed! If I owned this restaurant I would invite the Elite Yelp group in for a tasting and some drinks, and the intrepid yelper who made the suggestion. When I made comments about La Bocca, just down the street from you, they responded that day! Learn from your competitors kids. La Bocca does a lot of business on a street many thought would only support places that catered to drunk frat boys, so study them, and benchmark some practices from them. 
2. E-mail list. I came in, let you know I lived in the area, and mentioned I would love to get a weekly e-mail of lunch specials like you can get from Essence Bakery (also in your general area, just off Hardy and University and does quite well, study that place as well). The manager noted they were working on those things and gave me a card for getting a free lunch if I bought a certain number of meals. Guess what folks, free meal cards work for sandwich shops, not places that charge $30 plates at dinner, have a daily lunch special and get the news out! Notice another successful restaurant in your area, they offer a daily lunch special and many people order it. Individuals who eat at a place like yours are not, in general, that concerned with saving money and if they were there are places a lot cheaper than yours. Your competitor is not the sub shops, it is places that foodies like to go like La Bocca or House of Tricks, so compete against them! 

Okay, enough advice, I only give it because frankly, I care and I want you to succeed. I want more nice places to eat on Mill where the preferred drink is not bud light and does not come in pitchers but work with me people! 

Finally, at the bar, what a great view, the other side of is open and you have a great view of Mill Avenue and the great and wonderful parade of diversity that walk up and down it all night long. I could sit there and watch people, with a steady supply of quality drinks, all night long. So yelpers, go check it out! :-)",2009-11-10 03:30:41

Last night I arrived to Casbah around 9:15. The kitchen closes at 10:00 so we were fine. The male at the host stand seemed pretty irritated that we were just arriving but it wasn't like I was walking in at 9:55. We opted to sit inside because it was a little chilly. He the two of us down at a table against the wall in the very back. It was tiny and cramped and not too mention very poor lighting. Almost felt like I was punished to that table? So I asked our server to be moved to another table in the restaurant. 

We served some bread and sea salt butter. In my opinion, the bread was nothing special. I had a few bites and didn't finish much just because I wanted to save room for the more important dishes. We were also served some type of Greek yogurt for the bread but that combination didn't sound appetizing to me. 

I ordered a 3 cheese selection option as an appetizer. I regret it a little bit now just because I was served the same bread. I added the prosciutto for an extra $4 and it was very good. I picked the first 3 cheeses on the menu (forget exactly what they were). I would have like the server to tell me which cheese was which, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. 

In addition I also had the Charred Spanish rock octopus which was the highlight of the entire meal. I highly recommend it. 

I had the Casbah (signature, as I was told) double-cut pork chop. This cut was very large and I ended up taking most of it to go. The rice was phenomenal, especially the rice that was under the meat. It had absorbed the flavors from the meat. 

Finally, I decided on the pistachio cannoli. I had a tough time deciding between that and the chocolate pot de creme. The flavor seemed to be a little off and I think i would have like the filling to be a bit sweeter.  I also opted for the Greek dessert wine pairing, which they only able to serve me half a glass because they ran out. It ended up being free, so I didn't mind. 

My server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to explain things very clearly. However, I HATE when servers go take a smoke break and then leave my table smelling like an ashtray. Off putting as I was eating my cannoli dessert. 

Pretty good experience, but could have been amazing.",2016-04-27 19:22:37

Downsides are the service was a little on the slow side so if you are in a rush this might not be the best choice and the food choices are minimal.  And boo that the 10% discount is only for UNLV students.  I go to NSC and UNLV honors our id just like their own.

YAZnBsQKwyJ36FsvBc5a8w,53JHz4dbMg9JfuzakOZK4A,dM6_Qs08iyxMTZt5q4_hPg,5,0,0,0,"I called on Saturday to get a quote on my tires after receiving a quote from the Discount Tires on Market Street and from San Tan Ford.  Wasn't real happy that I needed new tires and I wished I had known about this before Memorial Day so I could have taken advantage of some holiday savings.

Needless to say, I felt pressured from the Market Street guy that he'll give me a $50 discount on 4 Michelin Defender tires for my '14 Ford Focus, but I had to pay for them that day, before I could bring my car in.  My car was already at the Ford dealership getting servicing and I was out of town.  

Though I have gotten for many years my tires at Discount Tires on all my cars, I felt uncomfortable doing this.  

This Val Vista & Ray Discount Tires, it's been a hit or miss with this store.  Sometimes I get great service, other times, not.  However, i called them and Andrew gave me a better out the door price than the Market Street and I was not pressured to pay for my tires until I was actually going to get them on.

I asked if he would still give me that price if I came in later in the week and he said yes.  I had made an appointment for 11 am for Wednesday, but my husband wanted the tires on the car today (Monday).  So, I called in about 8:30 am and spoke with Todd to bring my car in about 11 am.

Mike helped me as Todd was busy on the phone.  Mike was very friendly and said my total would be $548.48, which I had written down Saturday it was $548 when talking with Andrew.  Before coming in, I thought they would try to get me to get a Discount Tires credit card, which I did not want one.  They did not do that.  In fact, the sales transaction was so quick and it was over in just a few minutes.

They put new tires on my Focus in about 45 minutes.  I was out the door.  I had asked Andrew while waiting for my car why he was able to get me a better deal than the Market Street store.  He said that he knew there would be a $70 rebate on the Michelin tires starting Sunday and knew that when I came in, that coupon would be on.

Also, that was a $70 mail in rebate, which I did not have to mail it in, rather, they gave me the discount on the spot and Discount Tires would mail in the rebate on their end.  That saved me the hassle.

Andrew did a great job at listening to what I wanted, which the guy at the Market Street did not.  Andrew saved me money, didn't pressure me into doing something I didn't want, and everything from bringing in my car, paying for things, leaving was super easy.

The store was super cool - very nice A/C, in fact, a little cold, but nice compared to the Arizona heat.  I had to run a bunch of errands after Discount Tires and those Michelin Defenders are very nice.  The car rides much smoother and quieter.

Thank you Val Vista & Ray store - Andrew, Mike and the guys that put on my tires.  :)  We are safe once again.",2015-06-01 21:05:18

There's live music sometimes and the location is great. I like that it has its own parking lot. Parking could get annoying in Scottsdale. 

The cons: 
If you're into wine, red or white. There are only 2 options. The red is a grenache blend. Not sure about the white. The pretzel was bland and somewhat hard. The cheese dip was okay. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants and I'm not sure the quality is comparable.  

I was excited when this place opened because I thought, great something like Lux in CenPho, a coffee house that serves wine. Lux is def bigger. I guess it is nice sometimes to get away from the crowd and be somewhere not so packed. Def a good place to hang out or meet for a quick ""get to know you"" date.

The Pride was missing, the quality was missing and hopefully this was just a night that the chef was having a bad night.  If this keeps up though, this place will be given less stars and taken off our list....",2013-03-05 04:28:08

I used to go to the GameWorks on the Strip when I was kid. I mean, I even remember going to the original grand opening and losing mind because it was so amazing, two stories of video games! That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. 

They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have ""Donkey Kong"" and ""Centipede"", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most ""little"" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play ""Call of Duty"" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!

Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by ""Barcade"" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, ""One Moscow Mule please"". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. 

All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game.",2014-08-05 00:54:45

I was a bit apprehensive after booking and THEN reading Yelp reviews...there seems to be a black & white feeling about this place, no grey area at all.  Love it or hate it... I will summarize what I loved and hated about this place.

Love!
We got in around noon, and I knew check in was at 4.  I called in advance and asked what the early check in process was.  I was told it depended on the day, situation,etc.  basically, you won't know till you get there.  We stood in a short line and Jamison waited on us... he is THE MAN!!!! Seriously... after asking about upgrades and early check in, we were able to check into an upgraded room on the 28th floor with a strip view for $20 more a night along with a coffee maker and fridge as well.  So Happy!
The location is ideal if you don't plan on spending much time in your room.

As time went on...

Hate....
Ok, the elevators... I had no idea what to expect after reading about the problematic nightmares till I experienced this myself.  Also, I might add this was EDC weekend which only added to the nightmare.  Having a top floor room was amazing....the ride up or down to it, not so much!!!  This elevator would stop on floors with no one there, the doors would remain open, or closed... just ridiculous!  Plus, I don't think they were all working.  I'm referring to the Habitat Doors.   I'm not sure if the Spa Elevators had the same problem.

After spending the night, the next day our room was never cleaned.  We noticed that the cleaning people were still on our floor, yet no one cleaned our room.  We called housekeeping and they assured us it would be clean.  Nope... and that meant a shortage for three of us to share towels for two.

Be prepared for Wyndham time share people to corner you everywhere...they are by the elevators and the check in desk - just ignore them and keep walking, they are VERY annoying!!! I don't recall getting bothered by these types at any other hotel I stayed at.

If you want a seat at the 21 & over Go Pool, be sure to stand in line well before 9am...by 9:15 there is a long line and NO seats in the place.  There is a nice money making thing going on in here where there are less chairs and more day beds to rent for $100/day plus you need to spend at least $50 there on drinks.  Needless to say we spent time at the FREE Family pool with plenty of seats and no line to get in.  Also keep in mind it was this way during the week, I can't imagine what the weekend would be like.

I haven't sorted through our final bill yet, but I will say the resort fee here is a joke too.

When the food finally came, mine was a bit lukewarm/cold and the waffle had softened.  I've never had a waffle sandwich before but I'm assuming it should have a bit of a crunch like waffles do?

Despite the food being on the cold side, the taste was not bad.  The pulled pork fries was probably the best part of the meal.  Quite tasty.

I know I want to see Angkor Wat at some point in my life, but that's about as far as my knowledge extends. When I saw there was a local Cambodian restaurant here in Phoenix, I was intrigued and wanted to stop by to broaden my knowledge base. 

We walked into Reathrey Sekong on a Friday evening at 6:30pm and were sat immediately. For a 4-1/2 star restaurant, that impressed me. Especially since we had just left another place after seeing a horde of people standing outside. 

The inside is small but charming to say the least. I ordered the Cambodian iced coffee which was recommended in other reviews. Greatness. I thought it was going to be too sweet, but it wasn't, the mix of coffee and condensed milk was perfect. 

I ordered the large serving of the Cambodian BBQ Platter for dinner. It was basically a big plate o' meat that consisted of sliced beef, grilled beef skewers and grilled chicken wings. It's also served with a bowl of white rice. Excellent. 

The two beef offerings were cooked so that they were still tender and the flavor was awesome. The wings were on another level. Probably in the top 5 of best wings I've ever eaten. 

The only issue I experienced was in the order the items were served. I waited for what I thought was a while before my coffee came out but it was okay. I figured they were just waiting for it to brew. My coffee came out, but my wife's drink (coconut smoothie with boba) didn't come out for a few minutes later.

Then the same thing happened with our food. My food came out and hers didn't for about 3-5 minutes later. It wasn't a huge deal, but it's just awkward when you're sitting there with your food and your eating companion is sitting there watching you, twiddling their thumbs. She wasn't actually twiddling her thumbs. Does anyone do that anymore? Anyway... you get the point.

xVv9BrlhXy3-kuRWDQQPKw,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ,GpX1PmgplBrG_DLiJVDC-g,4,3,1,2,"I've been to Padre's twice now - once for a full dinner and a second time for a margarita and a bite. I really like the bar area, find the service to be friendly and attentive, and think that certain dishes on the are top-notch. On the downside, the dining area (as opposed to the bar) is dull, the parking is tight, and the margaritas aren't all they're cracked up to be. 

Both times we've gone, we've really loved the food. The cilantro mousse was a really interesting and different accompaniment to chips, and the black bean soup was a flavorful and rich starter. As far as main dishes,  the duck tacos are absolutely outstanding. Wow. We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside. I'm not a huge steak person, and I love the way their duck combines the juiciness and charred texture of steak with the lightness of poultry. Both times, we also had super-friendly servers who were very attentive. 

We did not fall head-over-heels for the margaritas, though. We tried the $5 Padre's Margarita and found it to be way too sweet. Not the worst margarita we've had, but nothing outstanding either; I much prefer the house margaritas at Z Tejas if I'm going to go cheap, or the fresh-squeezed/hand-mixed ones at McCormick's if I feel like splurging. 

We also weren't huge fans of the dining area. The first time, we chose to sat there, whereas the second time we were offered a table since the bar area was full. It's just kind of closed off and uninspiring, with ugly gold ceiling fans and no windows. Atmosphere isn't everything, but it would be nice for the dining area to complement or highlight the inventiveness and passion that clearly goes into the food. 

A few final notes: 

1. Parking is tight, and even if you're lucky enough to find a spot in front, good luck getting out of it. I had to do a three-point turn just to pull out of the angled spot! 
2. There appears to be a big patio on the left side of the building. I'm not sure if food is served there, but it looked like a really pretty spot to have a drink and talk.
3. Happy hour is M-F from 4-6 pm in the bar area only. Beer is $2.50, margaritas are $3, mojo martinis and wine of the day are $5, and mojitos are $6. There is a special 6-item bar food menu with prices ranging from $5 to $7.",2008-09-18 00:16:53

It looked like a small version of the Grand Canyon. There are also numerous hiking trails that can last for miles if you have the time. The entrance fee to the park is $7 per vehicle.

The drive is about 30 minutes from Las Vegas and be sure to look out for the turnoff to the canyon or you will drive right past it like I did. Lol. You want to look for the route 159 sign by a gas station in the middle of nowhere.

They have a newly built visitors center that you can visit with interesting facts and also picture vistas if you do not want to take the scenic drive around the canyon. The drive around the canyon is about 15 to 20 miles so it can take awhile to visit if you stop at every point possible to take in all the natural beauty. Once you start the scenic drive you have to drive all the way around as the road only goes one direction until you get to the end.

She does amazing work, however tonight, my scheduled appointment was for Jimmy because Jenny was fully booked (understandably so--she does a damn good job). I had scheduled my appointment days ago and it was rescheduled to be with Anthony on the day of, which is fine but makes me think they don't pay close enough attention to their own availability and limits. Anyways, back to the point. Long story short. I go to get a deluxe pedicure and a gel polish/fill. 
The pedicure: sloppy and actually quite painful. The young lady (who also was pretty unprofessional--complaining about the types of customers she dislikes), managed to literally scrape my heels RAW. Maybe the polish job made up for it? No. Mediocre at best. 
The fill: Anthony (who took over for Jimmy) re-sculpted my nails according to lovely acrylic standards. However, when it came time for the polish, he quit out of sheer frustration and told me he'd let Jenny finish me. Jenny (along with every other worker) was busy with another customer so I sat and waited. And waited. And waited. For 20 minutes. Reminder: my visit was a SCHEDULED appointment. 
I asked Jenny to please take off my half-finished/half-smudged/still sticky polish. Thankfully, she did. 
I'm so irritated because the skill (some of the employees carry) is spot-on. But the customer service was horrible. No customer wants to be passed around like a piñata and that's exactly what I was tonight. Will not be returning. Word of advice to business owners: Don't overbook yourself to where you are having to move customers from person to person (there needs to be structure. Jam-packing the salon will not result in happy customers who get mediocre/rushed work) and do NOT lie to a walk-in client that it will be a ""10 minute wait"" for a mani-pedi when EVERY manicure and EVERY pedicure station is FULL.
Cherry on top: I was still charged $70 for a crappy job and my nails not even painted (at all. No polish whatsoever). I should have refused.",2015-07-21 01:12:24

It's a cute place. We sat at the bar.  The rest of the place reminded me of a family restaurant.

I ordered Fish n'chips (beer battered halibut fillet served with fries, homemade coleslaw and creamy tartar sauce).  It was okay, not great. Considering it was $14, there could have been more fish (it was mostly batter).

Gord ordered Rogue chicken wings (1 lb of herb marinated chicken wings tossed in your choice of mild, medium, hot, suicide, bbq, honey garlic or sweet chili sauce - he got sweet chili sauce) and onion rings.

The bartender had told me that the wings were breaded so I didn't order any (I'm not a fan of battered wings). I wish I had because Gord's wings were better than my fish. It's like they were Shake 'n Baked then deep fried.The onion rings were really good.

the husband ordered the carne asada burrito (~$7.50) and was in heaven. i had the carne asada taco combo (~$7.50 - you can get them with flour or corn tortillas)- and loved it. the rice and beans to me were kinda meh, but those tacos!!! we got the horchata ($2.00) and it was also pretty good. at the end of our meal, we sprung for a mango-strawberry raspado. The large size (~$4.75) comes with lechera (condensed milk) AND a scoop of ice cream! Perfecto!!! I recommend eating some of the overflowing cup of raspado and then mixing the rest all together. mmmm.

Now, let me talk to you about the salsas. They bring out a roasted tomato/green chile/onion salsa that is SO GOOD. we practically licked that little bowl clean. they also give you a bowl of salsa verde, which has amazing flavor and the perfect amount of heat to it. mmm. We didn't spring for it, but chips are ~$1.50 and guac is the same. 

they offer nachos, quesadillas, and a few veggie options. but really. if you don't try the carne asada, you are just cheating yourself out of amazing. 

the service is incredible and super friendly. the older lady, who i assume is the owner and possibly a chef? came out of the kitchen to check on us, told us how they make the salsa, and then made our raspado for us. she's so sweet.

Friday night around 9:30 and Sunday brunch at 1:15.  Both times are a little late into service and that seemed to be good timing because we had a table right away.  Both times we sat in the back area closer to the kitchen and next to the bar.

I can't say enough good things about this place.  The few minor disappointments were far overshadowed by all the high points.  I feel that I will develop a few favorite dishes here, keep coming back, but be disappointed as it becomes more and more popular and I have to wait for a table, but such is life.

Anyway, for dinner I had the Fried Chicken, Evenin Style.  It was very good, fried perfectly with not too much breading.  A boneless breast and thigh came with a scoop of mashed potatoes and collard greens.  The greens were a tiny bit too spicy for me.  I also had the Ruby Cado salad for the first course.  It was delicious.  My only complaint here is that I hate salads on plates.  Can I please have a bowl so I don't spill it?

My date had Oysters Rockefeller for his appetizer and the corn cob salad for his meal.  He enjoyed both of these.  He especially loved his drink, made with Strawberry and Basil. I tried it and I think it would be delicious when warm weather finally arrives.  I had a Louisville which was also a great drink.

For brunch, we had Biscuits and Gravy, Skillet, and Chicken and Waffles.  The waffle with Rosemary was the most delicious waffle I've ever had in my life.  I don't even like waffles that much, and I want to go back to eat these again.  I had a peach mimosa which was fairly good.  My date had a Gentleman's breakfast to drink, which was very good.  The drinks here have clearly been thought out and the proportions are perfect.

Service was very good on both occasions, the only exception being that my friend was never offered a coffee refill at brunch.

As a side note, I loved that on Friday they were playing low-key rap music.  Most places would not have the balls to play rap, but it wasn't distracting and complements the theme of the restaurant.  On Sunday they were listening to Motown.  Two thumbs up.

I will be coming back for sure, maybe for their chicken scratch on Wednesdays.",2013-03-26 00:47:46

The seats at the united terminals don't have arm rests, which isn't ideal when you are trying to sit up and stay awake, but super nice for when you want to lie down.

I bought a 3D greeting card for my grandma here. I also bought quite a few Homeboys jalapeño hot sauces from the youtube show Hot Ones where they do interviews while eating increasingly spicy hot wings.  I could have sworn that the price displayed was less than what I paid for but I was distracted at the checkout talking with my friend. I would recommend getting the chipotle hot sauce instead of the  jalapeño. I think it's more flavorful, plus it's the one they use to use on the show. They carry all sorts of knick knacks which would make good gifts. I think there were some locally produced products available. I would love it if they made locally made products a little more obvious. The jewelry was cute, but not my style. 

We dined at the next door Pomelo (pizza and such) before heading over here. Combined, it's an adorable Phoenix venue. I could see someone holding a wedding or big party here.

Apparently I had to travel to the other side of the country to a very un-European city to find a place that not only specializes in them, but knocks it out of the park.

There's nothing crazy about perogis - they're just a dumpling by another name - so the key to All Pierogi's success is in making them from scratch. Even most of the fillings are pretty traditional - lots of potato, sauerkraut, and soft cheese - so it's really all in the finesse of the dough and the careful cooking. Pan fried is obviously the more indulgent way to go, but they give you the option of boiling them in the traditional manner, too.

mqQVNyLlOMgXRMVAmXPHsQ,hjOVziDSQB1-JK6sLcCvEw,zidkKI_N1OPxsiddTOQH_Q,3,2,0,0,When you see 99 reviews with that kind of star rating you figure this place would be off the chain.  When k first walked in it smelled a little funny. I ordered a two item meat combo with brisket and spicy sausage. Brisket was very moist but full of a lot of fat pieces. Need to do some trimming. The sausage was ok not spicy at all and I didn't like that they cut it up into little pieces so when I went to eat they were kind of dried up. They had two kinds of BBQ sauce. One sweet one spicy. When I started to eat I could not tell the difference.  The sweet tea was good. The little piece of cornbread was not so good. I also got a Mac and cheese. When you go to a BBQ Mac and cheese needs to be stepped up. This tasted like store bought brand.,2015-09-03 22:40:28

I also tried the fried ""chicken"" as well. My only complaint is the portion was pretty small. After one bite, you want to eat like 5 more pieces of ""chicken."" Besides the food, they also have amazing cocktails, such as the techno lemonade (my favorite). The ambiance is great as well, decorated with work from a lot of local artists.

Great Wall looks small outside, but when you walk in it is a pretty big restaurant. When I came here for a wedding it was very decorative and the menu if already set up for you. It was an Asian wedding and some of the food that came out for the guests included soup, seafood, fried rice, and dessert. Coming here for lunch is much different. It is not as busy as a wedding would be of course and mostly you see big groups there such as a family. Every entree is family style so we basically all just ordered and shared the food within our party. Food is always delicious and tasty there. I think I just barely come here because I live on the other side of town. 

Now, for that Saturday we came here for dim sum. It was my first time here for dim sum, but I heard great things about Great Wall. As we drove into the parking lot it was already full. The wait was maybe about 20-30 minutes for us and looking inside it was pretty packed. So, I thought wow, maybe this place is all the hype. Once we got seated we got shumai (I think that's how you spell it). It's a pork dumpling. We also ordered chicken wings, shrimp dumplings, chow mein noodles, and chicken feet! I know a lot of people that may be unappealing, but the chicken feet was very good. I loved it! 

Overall, I can always recommend this place because I basically enjoy the food they have here. I would say when I had the best tasting of  food was during the time I came here for a wedding. The next best is during the time they serve dim sum, but as stated above it does get busy so coming here early would be the best thing if you do not want to wait. Staff was good, but we did keep seeing the same person with the same cart of food like 5 times. It sucks that its a pretty far drive for me to get here or else I'd be over here all the time for dim sum. So, on that note I will definitely be back here again for dim sum and if you NEVER tried or experience it, mine as well get to Great Wall and try it!",2014-08-28 04:44:33

Ice Castle is a nice arena, possibly the nicest in the South Hills.  There are two sheets of ice with ample spectator seating with a clear, unobstructed view of the ice.  The rinks are very well lit, and very well maintained.  The bleachers are wood which is not as cold as aluminum, and not noisy like aluminum.  (This is important because young kids love to run on the bleachers that are aluminum because of the noise they can make.)  There is also viewing from outside the  rink on a balcony with tables and chairs accessible from the lobby.  The lobby is also large, and includes a large projection TV and smaller LCD TV's that usually play the important professional sports games going on.  They have a newly renovated pro shop which is always important to have at a hockey rink.  They have a fantastic snack bar with a short order grill where breakfast is served all day.  And fresh coffee!  The parking out front is ample, and there is more on the side of the building.  These amenities make Ice Castle and ideal rink for weekend tournaments.

So why doesn't this rink warrant a 5 star rating?  Well, another offering in the lobby is a bar.  Tournament parents too often pass time in the bar drinking beer, watching sports and socializing with other tournament parents between games. When they later watch their kid's next game, they have a tendency to start heckling the kids on the opposing team, which often brings on a response from those kids' parents and it just goes down from there.  

Nevertheless this is a very good rink for ice hockey, and a fantastic venue for hockey tournaments.",2015-09-27 12:07:49

There was no one at the front when we came in and the bartender didn't even look up.  Had to wait to be seated.  

There were only a few people in the restaurant and now I know why.  The chips were oily and cold.  The salsa was bland.  

I ordered the chicken tacos and the meat tasted weird and it had not been salted before cooking.  Very bland and grease came off the taco when I picked it up (and it was in a soft corn tortilla, not fried).  The refried beans were gluey and had NO FLAVOR.  The spanish rice was ok.

The grilled cheese my daughter go was ridiculous.  Velvetta between 2 pieces of Texas toast.  And served with cold fries.

No refills on my drink without having to ask, but my husbands' glass was constantly kept full.

I went there today, and when ordering from the front, I got a shawarma and a piece of pepporoni pizza. On the menu, it said the shawarma was 4.99. However, when I went to the side to tell them what I wanted in the shawarma, they had another menu that said a shawarma and a pop was 4.99. It seemed like it was like that for a few other things on the menu too (i.e. the menu you order from displays the price for one thing whereas the menu on the side displays combos for the same price...but you don't get the combo). 

Now for the food. The pizza was quite good. Better than places like Pizza Pizza and not all dough which is refreshing. It tasted oven-baked and was crispy and big. All pizza slices are 2.75 (including tax). The shawarma was good too, except the pita is too big. You see the pita and think you are about to get a HUGE shawarma, only to see that they wrap it in such a way that when you bite, you get half shawarma, half pita. They could probably get away with a pita half the size with the same amount of filling. Also, I *think* you can only get a chicken shawarma.

There's a tv for you to watch while you eat and seating for roughly 10 people. It can get busy though, so you need to be prepared to eat elsewhere/wait for a spot to eat.

Overall, it's an alright place to go for a decent piece of pizza, but I wouldn't recommend it for other items (there are other places nearby which are better for things like shawarma). Quick and easy, so it's good for university students, but for those not completely strapped for time/money, I recommend going elsewhere.",2012-11-21 01:39:04

- Decent takoyaki
- Saba oshizushi: mackerel pressed sushi. Nothing special.
- Wagyu carpaccio: seared beef sashimi (on the specials menu). Decent, but kinda pricey.
- Lobster and Scallop sashimi: really fresh.
- Baked Oysters: Great size and great taste.
- Salmon natto yukke with seaweed for wrapping: pretty good.
- Green tea cheese cake and green tea creme brulee: Both pretty good.

This is a great option for a lazy dinner night that is Great for the whole family!
I personally enjoy the chips, salsa and queso for an appetizer.  Typically I have always had fresh chips that are warm and with the case so it feels like it melts in your mouth. Super delicious! The queso has some peppers in it but it's not overly powerful or spicy. You could certainly tweak it to make it more spicy with the salsa provided. I prefer to have it the way it is since my children often enjoy it too.
Besides the casual atmosphere and to go option, this place is perfect for children because they offer mini quesadillas AT NO COST for the little ones. This includes an orange slice. If your children are like mine and eat like a bird then this may be more than enough for them to eat as the herb meal, however it's also a great appetizer for the kids that I think is a great addition to their meal. The fact that an orange slice is included makes me happy because it is adding another very important food group to the meal or snack; instead of just a greasy quesadilla.

We had the American Breakfast and the Croque Madame. Both were pretty good, but not extremely outstanding. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the brioche was awesome.

The location is a bit of a pain to get to.

MedExpress is basically the lovely alternative to waiting for a doctor's appointment or going to the ER - or in my case, the best place to go for help when you have no primary doctor whatsoever. 

I stopped in here when I was dealing with an extremely bad, violent cough. The biggest thing that stood out to me during my visit was that the staff here were very, very nice. The receptionists were very patient with me - it took me a while to finish sentences since I was coughing so badly - and the nurses and doctors were reasonably thorough during the exam and with their questions. They really did make me feel like I was getting the care they thought I needed. I left with a couple prescriptions meant to bring down swelling in my lungs and help me breathe better (so no pointless antibiotics, something that matters to me when visiting a doctor), and was told to call if the problem with the coughing persisted.

However, I can't bring myself to give the place above 3 stars. I feel like during my initial visit, though the doctors and nurses were very nice, they weren't really listening to my main complaints. I made it very clear that the violent coughing I had was preventing me from sleeping, but nothing was done to address this problem. Wanting to be a good patient, I went ahead and tried what they gave me...and those medications did nothing. About five days after that first visit I called to voice my concern that the coughing wasn't going away. No one called me back for an entire day and a half. Needless to say I wasn't pleased by that.

At least when they called me back they finally got the right medication prescribed and filled at my nearby pharmacy. I slept soundly for the first time in almost two weeks, and thanks to the reprieve the prescription cough syrup gave me I was finally able to shake the cough completely within a few days. It's just a shame it took so long to get the miracle prescription that I needed at my first visit.

Would I stop in here again? Absolutely; this place is a great alternative to a busy ER or waiting for a regular doctor's appointment when you're in a bind, and the staff really does seem to want to help the people coming through their doors. I suspect a lot of my problems just stemmed from the fact that I had a cough, and coughs are a really general complaint that's hard for any doctor to treat. I just wish I'd really been listened to at my first visit and my call had been returned sooner; I probably could have recovered a lot faster.

I purchased a groupon and had two brunch and two drinks for only $19. The prices would have been reasonable even without the groupon. We shared the Eggs Murgatroid and the Pigs in Blankets. 

The Eggs Murgatroid was an interesting take on eggs benedict - it had a two house-made english muffins topped with chicken, crispy skin (tasted like that amazing Chinese pork skin you get from a whole roasted pig), poached eggs, and green onion. There were potato wedges on the side which were TO DIE FOR. The Pigs in Blankets dish featured three breakfast sausages wrapped in pancakes and two eggs on the side. The sausage-pancake-maple syrup combo was amazing. The eggs didn't need to be there because I was stuffed by the end of it! Coffee was delicious and bottomless, which I always appreciate in any brunch place. 

Given that we went on a Friday morning, the place was pretty empty. The food took a while to come, but it was ultimately worth the wait because it was so good.

We entered the restaurant with no issue as we were seated right away. And that's when everything went wrong. The waitress took a long while to get our order,  and when we were ready, my girlfriend asked if we can have all our orders delivered at the same time. This is because her main dish was tom kha kai which tends to come in first because they're served as an appetizer. She also ordered pineapple fried rice with that because that's how she enjoys the soup. Back to the order, when she asked the waitress if all our food be delivered at the same time, the rep retorted a not-so-reassuring, ""Uhm... I hope so."" She chuckled and walked away. Experiencing was displeasing as if they weren't even going to try and make it happen.

We waited a while for our food to come in, and guess what? They all came in separately. First, it was the chicken satay which we ate pretty quickly. Then we got the soup and my noodle entree. My girlfriend tried waiting for the fried rice when she realized that her soup was getting cold. Very displeasing to see her not eat with me. At that point, she started eating the soup and thinking twice about the other order that was still late. So she went up to another server to tell them that she didn't want that order anymore. 

The food was very basic. Nothing about it stood in mind. My noodles lacked a little bit of sauce as it appeared dry. The satay was rubbery and the peanut sauce that went along with it was bland. My girlfriend liked her soup but was not impressed about the mushroom used with it. Still, it hit the spot. 

Overall, would we come back for a second round? No. The restaurant was courteous enough to give us a 10% off discount for the trouble, which was surprising because it didn't really seem like they cared from the beginning. Anyway, we're too paranoid for repeated offender so I think we'll pass this restaurant and go somewhere else.",2018-01-13 04:34:44

She needed some staples. The nurse told us to come back to get the staples removed free of charge. Free? I inquired as I didn't expect an ER to do anything for free. She said yes, in front of my husband who is an attorney. I asked if I need to call to make an appointment and she said no, we just walk in. So I come today and guess what? The ER nurses are now saying it's a charge as another ER visit! They confirmed with the registration that we would be charged if we had the staples removed today. This is a shady operation trying to trick patients so they can charge more money. Had I not asked at the beginning I would have been charged another $400 ER visit!!! 

I demanded for the name of the nurse that told us it would be free but the charge nurse Teresa claimed she couldn't look up my daughter's chart and said we could go to records and ask for the medical file. I also asked to speak to the hospital administrator, Page Laughlin, that conveniently was in a meeting. I called and left her a message but don't expect to hear back from her. It's too late anyways, I'm not going to waste any more of our time or money here. I had to take time off work and pull my daughter out of school to bring her all the way over here when I could have taken her to her pediatrician to have the staples removed. But now it's 5 pm on a Friday so I can't take her to her pediatrician now. I didn't bring my daughter back here because it was supposed to be free to have the staples removed. I had already taken her for a follow on Monday with her pediatrician. I brought her back because I thought the ER would be more experience at removing staples than a regular doctor that doesn't do it very often. I was sure wrong on multiple levels for wanting to come back here. 

This hospital and ER are untrustworthy and overflowing with unknowledgable staff. The original nurse also told us that the only warning signs to look for our daughter's head injury is if she started vomiting. Really? Vomiting is the only symptom to watch for after a head injury?

I've been to this location several times in its former business and never has it been this beautiful, this delicious, or even occupied with this many people at one time.  The head chef Brian Howard, who I've read about in LV Weekly and Seven magazine, really has something special here - it's more than just a meal.

My experience began with a drink:

- ""Get off my Lawn"" ($14) - a Camus v Cognac served with a technique to initiate its full enjoyment. A flipped sniffer glass arrives sitting atop singed cedar wood to encapsulate a smoky aroma. Once turned right-side up, a house cooked bacon slice is place inside at the base, and before pouring your classy booze, a thinly sliced orange peel wraps around the inside and rim to secure that hint of citrus flavor. Sounds like work, but damn, smells so good and goes down so smooth.  ""I'll have another please!""

Ordering food is suggested to be done so from the left to right (cold to hot) of the menu, so the first round was this:

- Lamb tartare ($13) - gorgeous, light, fresh, and served with bhatura bread
- Farm Egg ($11.50) - this one actually surprised me. Asparagus (two-ways) never tasted so good to me. Really cleaned up this one.

Before the hot round, the Urban Seen Chopped Salad ($12) was ordered to freshen the palate and prep for the next course.  Simple yet several ingredients assembled for this bowl of lightly dressed leaves. I could never put together a salad like this. That's because Sparrow + Wolf works directly with a local source specifically to produce all their greens, and I'm glad they do, it was great.

And now to the main attraction:

Beef Skewers ($18) - deliciously cooked beef bites with chickpeas, served with a side of crepes.  Damn that's clever.
Campfire Duck ($21) - Three well-marinated duck strips along with a thick piece of foie gras made this dish my favorite of the night. Made me wanting more.

Since the closing of the former establishment, this neighborhood spot has kept me curious until it's grand opening yesterday.  Today, my visit and experience has satisfied the anticipation and only leaves me curious for more.  How are the other dishes and cocktails?  What will be on the next menu?  Will there be a happy hour??  I look forward to it all",2017-05-19 03:52:31

The concept? They take a pita and stuff it with whatever you want. It's kind of like Chipotle in that sense (or Subway, I guess? I've never been to Subway nor have I had a desire to), except without the streamlined assembly line convenience. What makes no sense to me is that you pay first, upon deciding what meat you want. It's also at this point that you must decide if you want anything that costs extra or has to be cooked, like hummus or grilled onions. Then after you pay, you get to choose the rest of your toppings. Why? Why not do what just about every other fast food establishment does and get all your options out of the way BEFORE you pay so you don't get stuck deciding you want to add guacamole at the last minute and having to get back in the register line to give them a couple quarters? It's such a simple little thing, but it really bothers me.

Also, I've been to this location on multiple occasions and everyone who works here always looks like they are in serious need of a hug. Why IS that? Where do they find these people? Maybe they post Help Wanted flyers at grievance support groups? Seriously, as someone who works in customer service, nothing bothers me more than an employee who does not smile and greet a customer. It's really the easiest part of your job, yet it makes a huge impact. Again, SIMPLE things, but things that leave an impression (at least on me).

So Pita Pit...work on your operational model and hiring practices, and I could be alright with you. Until then, the way you go about your business will continue to confuse me and I'd rather not bother with it.

PS: I realize that I barely mentioned the food, but it's just that unmemorable. Not bad, per se, but their cold, dry pitas are whatever. It's fine if you just want healthy fast food and you happen to be in the Southside, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",2011-10-03 07:14:40

She went back inside and this marketing manager of the bar named Lenny greets her. Our friend tells us to go back to the bar and we have more cocktails. We met Steve the bartender who is the girlfriend of the hostess that we met earlier. The girlfriends who were with me challenged Steve to show us his abs. Well, eventually he did and he did not disappoint with the washboard abs. This is a very laid back bar that had a very friendly vibe to it. I mean we actually interacted with many of the staff here because they were just so nice. We would definitely return back here again.",2012-03-12 23:15:05

  Even though it is taking longer to get the treatment here than at another dental office, it is worth it!
  We were quoted over $8000 for her dental work through several dentists. At Midwestern, we paid a fraction of that cost. My daughter had no dental insurance at the time, so the cost was a very big factor in my decision to have her treated here.
  The doctors are top notch and the students we've dealt with have all been eager, caring, and have gone above and beyond to make both my daughter (Who was 8 when we started her treatment plan) and I comfortable. 
  It can take a while to get an appointment, but it is worth the wait! 
  The campus is clean, as is the clinic. I recommend Midwestern to just about everyone I know. 
  Hey, if they can tell my child they have to pull teeth in such a way that she's actually OK with it... they win major brownie points with me! She actually looks forward to seeing ""her"" student doctor!",2012-09-22 00:45:18

It's a little Mom and Pop shop, literally. She manages the floor and he's in the kitchen.  Wait time for food and service can be slow, but be patient. It is worth the wait. 

The food is always fresh and delicious. The vegetable dishes are bursting with fresh cuts of vegetables. You get  Broccoli tops, not broccoli stems, pea pods, mushrooms, carrots, sprouts, celery, etc The tofu is always crisp, I don't know how they do it. 
One of my favorite dishes is the lemongrass tamarind soup. It's sweet and spicy with bean sprouts, tofu, tomatoes, and celery. It's a meal of a soup. Everyone loves the Tofu Me appetizer, fried tofu with sesame glaze.  I'm also a big fan of the black bean and tofu dish,the curry tofu with flat rice noodles, and the bun dishes (OMG! I always eat the whole thing!). My step-father loves 91 and 95 chicken. The chinese dishes are excellent as well. Some of the best Lo Mein. I have never been disappointed. The portions are generous. You get enough for lunch the next day..if you can stop eating. 

I hate to fault the place because they work so hard. The decor is minimalist.  Basic tables, chairs, and a fake plant by the door. But I've been to fancier places the food was more expensive and not as good. Since the food is made to order and they have minimal staffing there is a bit of a wait, like I said. But just go and enjoy your company. Or bring a book while you wait. 

They take credit cards, but for a minimum of $10. 

I've been going to Tay Do for over five years and everyone I introduce it to loves it. The maintenance guys at my work even have their favorite numbers.",2012-01-14 15:23:29

When I discovered an upscale vegetarian spot is opening in Montreal, I was beyond excited. We have a lot of decent vegetarian spots, but LOV is dubbed as the one with a creative twist. 

Good: Conveniently located in the Old Port right by Square Victoria, this seems like the perfect spot for locals and tourists. The interior decor is beautiful, trendy, and totally Instagram worthy. I was excited just entering the restaurant. Lots of greenery, exposed white brick walls, and just simply gorgeous decor. As for the food, the best thing I've had here was the kale Mac & cheese. Even my boyfriend was surprise that 'it's not real cheese?'. Service was very good, the waiters were attentive and courteous. 

Bad: they don't have an English menu, which was a bit surprising considering it's in such a touristy area. I understand some French, but still had to ask the waiter to explain some of the dishes. I really wanted to love this place, but I honest felt the food was mediocre and menu description sounds better than the actual meal (except that Kale Mac and cheese was 10/10). I've ordered the 'Hero', (note: the staff was accommodating when it came to my sesame allergies, big ups!) The dish came in a beautiful bowl, nice presentation, but tasted horribly bland. Few pieces of unseasoned steamed eggplants were buried in the middle. The napa cabbage was minimally flavoured and kind of soggy. The tempeh was okay. Very small portion, but that was fine because the Mac and cheese was very filling anyways. Basically, the Hero was more of a Zero.

My boyfriend ordered the Rave, which was celery root. Beautiful looking dish, however the only part that was good was the guacamole and pickled onions (I think). The grains were pretty flavourless so I didn't really enjoy it either. I think I did more of a Rant than a Rave.

We also had a brownie for dessert at the end, which was okay. The almonds were a bit over roasted and the brownie was really hard. *sigh*

The food taste like something from a culinary school, beautiful presentations, but the flavours and skills are not all there yet (except that kale Mac and Cheese).

Bottom line: I probably wouldn't go back by choice. If my girlfriends want to try it, I might give it a shot again just to order the kale Mac and cheese.",2017-01-07 04:34:24

The vegetables, herbs and fruits only survive if they are watered, given nutrients and protected in severe weather. In addition, the best of gardens have a green thumbed gardener overseeing the entire operation. The Phoenix Public Market reminds me of a cherished homegrown garden.

Just as if I was walking through a friend's house into their backyard of homegrown products, I walked into the Phoenix Public Market and immediately took in a whiff of fresh herbs, produce and products welcoming me inside. Freshly picked fruits and vegetables sat in the middle cooler and dairy, more produce, meat and other refrigerated treats such as hummus lingered in the left-hand cooler. In the back cooler, locally owned products such as Sweet Republic made their home in the freezer and then throughout the rest of the shop, locally owned delights sat on the shelves. There's everything from Desert Smoke BBQ sauce and Tracey Dempsey Originals, to locally owned cracker companies and plenty of dairy. It's easy to spend awhile exploring each and every product.

Now it's time to pick from the ""garden"" and talk about the restaurant portion of the market. Here they make everything including breakfast, salads, sandwiches and plenty of baked goods. Today I went for the fresh Turkey sandwich. My-oh-my was it delicious. Freshly roasted turkey hugged chewy wheat bread and fruit jam as well as a herb mayo spread kept the turkey and bread together. It's a simple sandwich but something about the combination of ingredients makes it much more than just simple. It tasted like a garden on my plate especially with the tomatoes and lettuce that accompanied it.

After my meal, I continued to sit in the grocery store and do some work while looking out on the Downtown buildings and beautiful vines growing on the market's patio. For a split second I forgot I was in 113 degree weather in Phoenix and pretended like I was sitting in a cool 75 degree San Francisco day; or better yet, a fresh garden overlooking an ocean. Finally, I finished my day with a meeting inside the coffee shop (Royal at the Market) and before I left, I browsed the outdoor Public Market that goes on every Wednesday night. It was a wonderful afternoon and the reason I love to live local so much.

This is clearly someplace where you can spend the entire day daydreaming and imagining you're in a garden. It's a pleasant atmosphere to do work in. The staff is extremely friendly, but they let people do their work and chat when guests are ready for a conversation.

** Some other highlights of the Market include a Chef Series where you can learn to cook and eat the food, wine tasting events, Food Truck Fridays (with many of my favorite local food trucks like Short Leash Dogs!) and of course the thing that started it all - the Public Market (come on Wednesday night and Saturday mornings)",2011-09-03 20:39:37

Can't say they redeemed themselves. Horrible service and the food is just not good. We arrived as a group of 3 for dinner around 830. Were told there was about a 15 minute wait because they were holding tables for a group of 35. After about 30 minutes I went to the hostess stand to ask if they knew hold much longer it would be. The waitress was clearly surprised to see me and said the hostess had left to go deliver a food order and they did not know we were waiting. What?! So we sat down. Waitress took a while to come over. We put in an appetizer order and drinks. She never came back to take our dinner order. She didn't come in to check on us and we had finished the appetizer and been waiting and already needed another round of drinks before we even ordered dinner. Buffalo chicken sandwich. Not good. Sweet potato fries. Great. Fried pickles great. Brisket platter. Awful. Then we waited so long for our check we finally went up and asked a random server to help us pay our bill so we could leave.

Then the scallop had a weird taste. Not a fan. 

8 second bull ride Roll.. not worth the $16. The garnishes up top made it taste like dirty grass. The asparagus so mushy and soggy that I forgot it was even there, it just all mushed in together. Very disappointing.

We ordered 2 appetizers, the brussel sprouts and the chicken meatballs!  Both of the dishes were really good and the portions were just right.  Then we ordered our main courses... there were 4 of us and we ordered the Pork Chop, Short Ribs, and the beef bourguignon shepard's pie.  All of it was really good!  There is a sort of ""richness"" in all of their dishes and a hat should be tipped to the chef because not many places create interesting and unique flavors.

The one thing that was off was our server.  She seemed really disconnected which really annoyed me considering we were there for the complete experience.  It seemed like she was in a rush to get us in and out.

It's one of the only bars around that stretch that sells pub style food and beers. Everything else around that area are korean/japanese or random joints. The next closest pub style bar would be st louis north of Frog. 

The whole Firkin franchise has recently revamped their look and now have this modern touch to their environment. They have new couches, seating, and decor. Their menus are redone and have great selection in food.

This particular location has an upstairs patio and pool table and a mini bar. Their bottom floor is more quieter and intimate.

The waitresses are mediocre as some can be rude and some can be nice. Depends on the day.

The food portions are massive and definitely worth the price you pay. if you feel like coming out full and feeling gross (but in a good way) then definitely come here.

I enjoy this place more so for the group atmosphere. I bring my teams here after a game and enjoy a few pints.

I wish they had more beer specials or team specials. They used to sponsor Toronto Sports and Social Club and provide us a platter if we bring our team and show our TSSC ID's but they don't anymore. Too bad.

We were invited to a kindergarten classmates 6th Birthday hosted at Laser Quest.  This was our first experience and I was pleasantly surprised with the facility.  The lobby is large and has video and merchandise cranes for the guests, as well a two air hockey tables.  The staff greeted us with a friendly hello and a smile right away when we walked in. 

 We showed a few moments late so we had to rush to get on the playing field with the other classmates.  The staff gave everyone an introduction as to what to expect while out on the playing field and also informed the kids that if they needed help while playing just raise your hand and YELL!  After going through the rules it was time for action.  The playing course was really cool with neon paint that was illuminated by black lights.  The playing field also had lots of mazes and things to hide behind as well as multi levels with ramps going up and down. Game play can last about 20 minutes per round and after you are done they give you a score card telling you how many targets you hit and who with a point total so you can see who the winner is right away.  

We came here with small children 5-6 year olds and I might not recommend playing a game with this age group.  They just do not quite comprehend what to do and the equipment weighs almost as much as they do.  My daughter kept complaining the vest was hurting her, so I put it on for her during game two.  Seriously the vest is like 10-12 lbs.  For a little kid that is a lot I think.  In my opinion Laser Quest would be best for 7 and up.  At that age they can at least carry the shooter and vest and understand  where to point the lasers during game play.  

After playing two rounds which was perfect for this age group it was time for food  presents, cake and ice cream.  The nice thing about Laser Quest is that you can bring in whatever you like.  They do not have food service like other party places so your options are endless and your own.  The staff again was really helpful by giving plates, cups and napkins for our pizza we were having. When it was time for cake and ice cream the staff promptly fetched both from their fridge and freezer with more plates and forks.  Great Job!

We had a great first visit to Laser Quest and we will be back again soon.  I found out that they have a membership program you can purchase that will save you $2 off each game for an entire year.  If you plan on coming often this can pay for itself in just a few visits.  Laser Quest can also be rented for private events or if you are having a team building outing for your company.  Contact them for questions but this might be fun.  Someone was there from the corporate  challenge that has been taking place all over Las Vegas.",2015-04-06 05:03:47

I always love to try new places when I'm out of town and stay off of the 'chain' route, and this was a perfect choice! 

It was pretty crowded for a lunch crowd, and I'm sure having March Madness on every TV helped as well. Since I was on 'vacation', I ordered a Pirate Lite, and it was a perfect lunch beer. Not too heavy, and it went awesome with my spinach and portabello salad. Having a ton of food options is always important to me since I follow a plant based diet, and this salad exceeded all of my expectations. It was a bigger portion, completely fresh, and very healthy with the vinaigrette dressing. Everyone loved their food (my friends got wraps, and sandwiches), and I would definitely check this place out again when I'm back in town!",2011-03-28 15:15:49

The first time we tried it for lunch and had the following results:  I ordered a meatball sub and it was good but was short on flavor.  My lovely wife ordered a hot dog with onion rings.  She said the dog was good and I sampled the onion rings and they were great!  The only bad thing was that we sat at the pub tables in the bar area and they are too small for lunch.  The second visit was on Friday night for happy hour and here are the results:  We arrived around 6pm and the place was full of people.  We sat at the bar and the service was very good.  I ordered Southwest Eggrolls and my wife had Buffalo Wings.  They were both great.  The manager stopped and talked to us and mentioned that he had seen us earlier in the week for lunch.

The restaurant is right next to the beautiful garden and pool area. The interior design of the restaurant is really pretty and definitely a romantic ambiance for a date!

They don't do reservations for lunch so our wait time on a Sunday was about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad. Plus, they have free pastries out to nibble on while you wait. 

My boyfriend and I got 1 pastry and 2 entrees and we were stuffed by the end! 
- Beignets du Jour ($8): These were made perfectly! Crispy on the outside, super soft on the inside, topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar. You can dip these with their homemade strawberry jam or chocolate. Just thinking about this makes my mouth water! Seriously so delicious. 
- Chicken and Waffles ($27): The chicken is roasted, unlike the usual fried chicken from Roscoe's x) This is their most famous dish. My boyfriend said it was just regular roasted chicken but I appreciated that they didn't make it dry. We both really liked the brown Chasseur sauce it came with - it really made the chicken more tasty! The waffles were really good as well but I usually get tired of eating any waffle after a while.
- Croque Madame ($19): This was the first time we've tried this dish and we both loved it! The only complaint was that we wished the sandwich was bigger!! It was super delicious. My boyfriend usually hates cheese but he loved this dish because all the flavors and ingredients blended in really well. The ham was really great quality too. Definitely recommend this dish - it ain't no regular sandwich! It also comes with A LOT of fries - wish they could use some of that space to give us more of the sandwich :p

I would rate my experience 4.5/5. I had no complaints with the service or food except that I want more of their beignets!

The quality of sauces and overall ingredients exceeds every other chain, restaurant, fast-food joint I've tried. 

We usually pick-up food to go, but at least once a year we will dine-in.  The decoration and ambiance of the restaurant are unique and visually pleasing. They have traditional music and wear traditional outfits. This really adds to the dining experience.

Every time I eat in, I feel like I am their number one priority. They immediately look after us, take our drink order, followed by food order, all within 10-15 minutes of being seated. You never feel rushed, they are really awesome at taking note of whether your menu is still open and you're browsing or closed and ready. Once everything is ready, they place everything on your table and scoop portions on your plate. They respect your space if that's not your thing however. 

The food isn't heavy like the Chinese food I've had in other restaurants. The sauces are flavourful and light, the deep fried stuff isn't too battery or oily, and the noodles and rice are always cooked perfectly. A bonus, when we order deep fried dished to go, they always serve the sauce on the side so it's still crispy when it gets home.

Walking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.

They have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me.

She explained perfectly what she wanted while being prodded down the chute by a young manager and a couple of fellas on the line that had not yet mastered the English language. After a completely unnecessary lecture by this manager fella who seemed annoyed that anyone would dare ask a question to slow down the ringing of the almighty cash register, they completely disregarded her request and gave her a bowl of miscellaneous pasture weeds and a sweet balsamic dressing.  

She was frazzled and pissed when we sat down but not one to complain. I witnessed the entire thing and they could have easily given her a bowl of romaine, some tomato and blue cheese dressing.

This having been my first time I'd been in a Paradise Cafe for lunch the entire experience seemed a little awkward. I had to look around to find any type of menu and all I saw was sandwiches.

She had called the day of to make reservations and was able to get a table for 6. When I arrived, my husband and I were the first in our party. We were asked to wait in the small bar area for our entire party. This was rather annoying to me since the bar was righ by the entrance and other people kept coming in and bumping into us. The area was highly congested with the bar on one side, tables on teh other and a coat check a the end.  Not a good place to grab a relaxing drink before our meal. The drinks are fairly reasonably priced, $17 for two VERY large glasses of wine. Once our party arrived, we were seated. We decided to skip the appetizers and move right to the entrees knowing the portion sizes are large. The waiter read the 20+ specials, as usual. They must have the same specials for several days in a  row, otherwise no one would be able to remember all of those dishes. I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the paella. My filet was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. As always, the table was served rice, veggies and chips family style as sides. The rice and chips were delicious but the veggies were a bit under done. The green beans were quite crispy, not in a good way.

How often do you see a Subway share the same room with Winchell's Donuts? NEVER.

So you want to eat healthy by getting a 6 inch turkey on wheat. Maybe a footlong if you're hungry. Of course lots of extra vegetables. 

As you move over to the cashier, BAM! DONUTS! It hits you hard like a bad vague topic on the Vegas Yelp Talk Thread.  So much for eating healthy. When a chocolate glazed donut is screaming out at you, you cant help but rescue that poor, sugary, chocolate goodness from it's glass case dungeon.

Ok so this review kind of strayed off the main road and into a dark forested area so let me try to restore order.

If you are not easily distracted by shiny things then you should always take advantage of Subway's specials every month. There is always a designated footlong for 5 bucks. So far, every February is Februany. You can get most of their footlongs for 5 bucks. The premium ones this year they have for 6 bucks.

Other than wanting a footlong roast beef on a maple bar, I dont see why they have Winchell's up in here. Its like trying to run a marathon with stilettos on. It's just not a good idea.

Service here is hit or miss depending on who just happens to be working at the time. Some of them see it as just a your basic minimum wage job. Others just plain dont wanna work. 

On a positive note, the wifi signal is very strong from the Starbucks next door so you can stay here all day and play World of Warcraft or whatever choice of game you are addicted to. Im sure the employees will leave you alone as long as you buy a sandwich or two.

So to me its just ok. Every time I have gone here, it's a different atmosphere. Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.",2013-02-09 04:09:51

When we asked the chefs (Damon and Tom, chefs extrordinaire) they told us their fave wasn't on the menu - for themselves, they whip up goat cheese, corn and BACON!  Then they favored us with that plus the blue crab, corn and chipotle and the pineapple, jicama, habanero and mint.  The crab and pineapple were really, really good, but the goat cheese and bacon....MMMMWWWAAAAAHHHH!

Oh wait!  I forgot about the cucumber margaritas!  Sigh.....maybe you should just order one yourself and experience it....words fail me.  Yum.

I ordered the machaca taquitos - brisket braised with coffee, ancho chilies and Lord only knows what other magic presented atop onions and peppers with emerald green salsa verde and more of that marvelous guac - this time the traditional.

Last time I came in, I had their brisket, and it wasn't very good. So I stuck to something safe....a Patty Melt. Now the burger meat itself wasn't that bad, but they also salted the outside of their bun. Who does that?

I'm guessing here that the owners of City Smoke own lots of Stock in Morton's. I have NEVER been so innundated by salt flavors in my life. It's been an hour since I left here and I still taste SALT.

I rarely ever see someone who doesn't pick up after their pet. (note: the park does not have stations that provide doggy poop bags, you have to bring your own)

only reason this park doesn't get five stars is because there are quite a few homeless people who use the area for sleeping or hanging out. if you walk under the bridge toward the library you walk right into a HUGE crowd of homeless people hanging out outside the library. it can be a little intimidating.

Some friends and I were here for happy hour and things started off great - great drinks, great apps - had the ceviche and one of the bruschetta's (forget which one and not even sure if thats spelled correctly but it was awesome). 

Our friends met up with us and decided that we should stay for dinner. I've eaten there but not a full dinner - their apps are always so good so what could go wrong with dinner right? So we order another app for the table and it never comes out. We make a comment to our waitress and from her reaction, we know she forgot to order it. Cool - it happens, all of us either work or have worked in the restaurant industry and we know what its like when it gets busy. 

So she walks away and one of our friends food comes out. She comes back over and tells us that she straight out forgot to order the app and its also been 86'd so we can't get it anyway. Our friend already had her food so we were like whatever, our food will come out soon too. So about 10 minutes later 2 more plates come out. We told our friend to eat before so by the time their food came out, she was well into her dish. We wait about another 10 minutes or so and my food never comes out. So after another 10 minutes we finally get our waitress over and come to find out my dish had been 86'd too. By the time we figure this all out, my friends were done with their meals and I had nothing. Their food was good - Kelly's food is always good.

Our waitress comped my meal and I was able to order something new, but it took another 20 minutes to get that out. I wasn't even hungry anymore and frustrated so I asked for it to go. Normally I don't bother telling a manager or anything, I'm not one to complain too much and usually just go on my way, but this was pretty bad. I had to ask to see a manager 3 times and he was not quick to come to us.

So I finally talked to the manager and am really positive about it all - I really do get it! Shit happens but I think it was really important for him to know what went down. I wasn't looking to get anything for free - I did already when she comped my meal.

Greeted and seated by a super nice guy who ended up being our server---I never caught his name---but he was A+!  Personable, professional, well-informed on the food...

Started (as always) with the Fried Green Tomato appetizers.  They rock my world, they are so good.  Super hot and fried perfectly---crisp and never greasy---with the green tomato adding a bright note.  Generous serving.  No frou-frou portions at H&S!  Comes with a side of Chipotle-mayo that adds the perfect amount of heat.

I was tempted by the Lemon Tilapia---I could hear a lady a few tables over exclaiming how good her's was----but then I fell in with DH and ordered the Blue Cheese sirloin.  I got mine with the housemade mashed taters and DH got the baked.  Sirloin can be iffy---this was not.  Cooked perfectly to order, trimmed so just the tastiest bit of fat remained, tender but with some chew and full of flavor...  Dressed with just the right amount of blue cheese sauce.  I had remarked in a previous review that the mashed potatoes are good but a bit dry---these were beautiful in texture and served with two generous pats of butter spilling lovely, butter-y goodness over the snowy folds of potato perfection.  DH's baked potato was a baked potato, except someone with flair had cut it with a cool little zig-zag rather than a straight slit---we admired that artistic touch!  Oh, and to accompany---grilled yellow squash and zucchini.  DH is a pro at grilling these two veggies---our faves!---and these were very well done---hot and crisp-tender and well-seasoned.  Maybe we would have liked just a touch of char, but we are used to them being done on a grill.

Our server said it was Romero in the kitchen---thank you, Romero.  Great job!

We were STUFFED at the end, but our very good server convinced us to take home some peach cobbler for afters.  This is where there was a slight falter.  Both DH and I have southern roots (WV and NC) and we know our cobbler.  This was a little too cakey---a cobbler should raise up and embrace the fruit.  But the peaches were very good, with a nice bite and not too sweet.  Yummy ice cream, too!  Cakey or not, we ate it!

Okay, H&S doesn't have the ambiance of Cafe Bink or maybe the self-conscious ""foodie"" attitude, but comparing them on service and quality of execution----and reasonable menu prices----I don't understand why Heart and Soul doesn't have the SRO crowd every night  that Binks gets.

We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ...""  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes. 

This, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, ""Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!""  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700° F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!

The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10"" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.  

I had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.

I shouldn't be forced to use a Kohl's charge to receive my discount.  I found myself there over the weekend as a friend needed me to pick up an item they had on hold.  I browsed a bit.  Tons of sales rack which is great if you are into hunting for deals.  I'm not a fan of disorder and it reminds me of an old Mervyn's store.  I checked out the Nike section for woman hoping they would have some deals but even their Nike pieces were not the same selection you would find in department store or a sport specific store.  It was not even the nicer fabrics or prints.  In my opinion their prices are not that great unless you have a 20 or 30 off and the item is already on sale and on top of that you have  Kohl's charge.,2014-10-20 19:18:42

I was thoroughly impressed with the serving size and the value for money you get here. My friend had the Golden Sago mixed and loved it as well.

When I had pain in my nose cavity of course I was worried. I got 2 opinions from general dental offices regarding the pain and was told that I was going to possibly need my two front teeth pulled with implants. No way did I want implants. The 2nd dentist I saw referred me to this office to see what Dr. Christensen thought. 

The office is located on Sahara in a reddish building next to carmax. There is assigned parking right out front for dental patients which is nice. The dental office is warm and inviting. I was brought in with a small wait and had a CT/3D scan of my mouth and a series of x-rays. The technology is really amazing. I could see my whole jaw and teeth in 3D. Dr. Christensen reviewed the diagnostics and advised he could treat the area without taking out the teeth. Boy was I relieved. 

I went in a few weeks later to have two root canals redone and my mouth cut open to put in bone grafts. I took some sedation pills they gave and the 3 hour procedure literally felt like 15 min. Dr. Christensen and his assistant Stephanie really put me at ease. Anytime I felt pain, I would raise my hand and they would immediately put more anesthetic in my mouth. Dr. Christensen has a comforting way about him and low voice. I have been to other dentists that talk about random stuff when doing your teeth or chattering back and forth with their assistants (prob why I have so many dental problems). That was definitely not this dentist. 

Dr. Christensen called me the next day, which was a Saturday morning, to see how I was feeling. He advised me I would probably feel worse the next day, which I did. 

The follow up to get the stitches out went well and overall I am feeling good about it. We will continue to follow up to make sure my mouth is healing. 

I would definitely go back to this office or recommend this dentist.",2015-10-12 22:38:58

Our children raved about their tacos from the Taste of Hudson outdoor food fest. We brought them back as requested.

Parking is tight at the First & Main development but we lucked out in finding a front spot. 

Inside we were seated immediately in a large open dining room, that was stylish, they had some cool lighting at the bar area, something that fascinated our youngest child.

We were seated but waited a while for chips & salsa, something the hostess could have easily grabbed off the open shelf next to the hostess stand.

The menu is very small, something I like, as most Mexican restaurants have pages and pages of endless options. Here they keep it rather simple.

Our server was friendly, knowledgable of the menu and was great with refills, couldn't ask for better service.

The chips were tasty with a very mild salsa, perfect amount of salt.  Only to be enhanced with a queso dip that was perfect.  It was even served in a big appetizer bowl, a plus as it's annoying when other places give you a tiny little sample dish.

I had a Tacos Mexicano ($13.99/Sept 2013).  Three tiny crispy taco shells with a choice of chicken or beef.  Both meats were shredded. The dish was a big lop of lettuce and completed with rice and beans.

In general, I liked it, especially as someone that doesn't like the traditional mom & pop Mexican joints.  The kind that occupy some former fast food joint or a former Denny's and the kind that try to hide the B & C health grades on the windows.  This place was immaculate.  Very clean, not too fancy but not so simple that you couldn't entertain friends or business colleagues.

A family friend told me they have the best chicken & waffles in town, but I'd just never made it over to try them. On our six-month marker, my boyfriend surprised me with dinner here; because it was a Tuesday night, we were seated quickly, & though there were a few other tables filled, the ambiance was generally quiet & low-key.

We split the Jalapeno hushpuppies served with ""comeback sauce,"" which our served described as ""Probably a mix of mayo & ketchup?"" It was better than it sounds, I promise, & the hushpuppies were perfect - lightly spicy, very crispy, & not too dry, like hushpuppies sometimes are. We were also served a few pieces of fresh, hot bread with house-made seasoned butter & some kind of jam (I forget what kind) that I would've eaten with a spoon if it were an option.

Needless to say, we were carbed-up & happy by the time our meals arrived, but we'd left plenty of room for dinner. And good thing! My boyfriend ordered his fried chicken ""evenin' style,"" served with mashed potatoes, braised collards, & sausage gravy; I,. of course, ordered mine ""mornin' style,"" with a rosemary waffle & Ohio maple syrup. The other option, which I'd love to try, is ""late-night style,"" with pulled pork mac 'n' cheese, & smoked cherry bbq sauce. I KNOW, RIGHT? They're all served with boneless chicken - a breast & a thigh. I don't like dark meat, & getting it with all-white meat wasn't an option, so my boyfriend & I swapped - all-white for me, all-dark for him. A good trade, but I wish I could've just ordered it the way I wanted it.

That said, everything was delicious. The waffle was hot & soft, & the chicken was perfectly done, with the crispy coating so fresh that it was sliding off of the meat. I was too full to eat all of it, but I took one of the breasts home for leftovers the next day. Just as good afterward!

SOHO has a number of interesting-sounding items on their menu that I'd love to go back to try - but honestly, the mornin'-style chicken was so tasty that I don't know if I could bring myself to order anything else!

Minus one star for the very slow service, because only one server seemed to be working that night, & she was also playing hostess - crazy!

There is a waiting room with a tv, and a fancy machine (no not that table top kind.... the tall machine that stands about 4 feet tall and looks like a giant coffee vending machine!) that dispenses Starbucks. You have a choice of two types of blends. There are also usually pastries and bagels with cream cheese on hand as well in case you haven't eaten anything yet when you wait for your car. Nice amenities, check!

My service guy is Travis, and he takes good care of me when I go there. He's honest whenever my car needs something changed and lets me know when the car is just fine. He's not pushy in anyway and always friendly whenever I'm there. If he is busy, usually someone else greets me when I drop the car off and checks to see if everything is okay or what my concerns are. Customer service good, check!

Prices for service? They are basically about average compared to other Jeep dealerships. I know, I know, you're going to tell me how people's wallets get, for lack of better words, raped whenever going to a dealership, but right now my Jeep is under warranty, so I'm going to go there for now. Moore Jeep always floods my emails with coupons or deals. Heck, there's even a Yelp discount for going to this dealership, so that always helps with lightening the bill. Overall, I'm well satisfied with going here. Hopefully, that doesn't change!",2013-01-07 02:35:24

They really pile on the cheese at Fausto's whether you dine in or get it to go.  I've noticed that some places will skimp on your to go orders...not the case here.

The only one negative is the lack of it being open 24 hours...not a biggie but I believe that's truly the only appeal of Roberto's.  Drunks wanting food at 4am settling for average Mexican fare.

When I lived in Canada all I did was sample poutine and 595's is very very authentic tasting. They just need to add more cheese curds and they'll be solid!

On the east side, the Fairmount is the place for quality tipples and fresh, flavorful drunk food. They also have a couple dozen bottled beers and usually a decent draft selection. The place isn't that big, so it gets pretty cozy in the evenings. Even when we've come on weeknights we've had to stand around awhile before seats opened up at the bar. I kind of wish they would take out the whole living room get-up around the fireplace to make room for more actual tables but I guess it adds to the intimate ambiance. The patio in the back is the place to be in the summer - there's a separate bar out there too.

Ok but who cares about that stuff? People come here for the drinks, and they should. Their catalog of a drink menu is organized by type of booze, so you can head straight to the promise land of gin and whiskey, without wasting one second on boring vodka drinks (sorry Russia). They do the classics - Palomas, Sidecards, Aviations - but Fairmount also offers some pretty exciting twists like the Tobacco syrup cocktail and the spiced pear Collins. Almost everything falls in the $8-$10 range, which is a steal compared to other cocktail lounges that somehow get away with charging $12-$15 - or even $18 - for the exact same thing. And props to Fairmount for actually listing the drink prices on their menu, I hate having to feel like a cheap-ass and ask. Nothing ruins a good buzz like getting your bar tab and realizing you spent $15 on one pour of mid-range liquor.

We also had our rehearsal dinner here out on their patio last summer, and it was definitely a success! They really knocked it out of the park with the food and service for our group. Peppadew poppers were a huge hit, and I think they have these on their regular menu.

Last time I came here was with Randall S. for his birthday (7/30/16). It's the perfect restaurant to celebrate special occasions like birthdays, graduations and anniversaries etc. The white table cloth and dim lighting really sets the mood for a romantic night out. 

We had reservations but arrived early and had time to order a drink at the bar. Two Moscow Mules and complimentary house made potato chips to snack on while we waited to be seated. A few sips later our table was ready. 

Once at our table, our server explained the menu and gave a bit more information to my date since it was his first time there. We both decided on the Lawry's cut and we shared the sides. Creamed corn, asparagus, mashed potatoes with gravy and creamed spinach, also each meal comes with yorkshire pudding. 

To start, they bring you the famous spinning bowl salad (appropriately named). I absolutely adore this salad and I'm not particularly a salad kinda gal. Then we ordered another round of drinks while we waited for our food. Shortly after the carver comes by with his glorious cart full of prime rib and all the fixings. You'll be asked how you prefer your prime rib. I always go with medium. My date ordered his medium well. He's not a fan of pink. Even when we went to Gordam Ramsey he ordered medium-well, he'll never learn lol.

Now back to the prime rib. Every bite is absolutely delicious. Juicy and tender, so flavorful. It literally melts in your mouth. I like to sprinkle a bit of the lawrys seasoning and just a touch of horse radish for a kick. Mmmm, perfection. After our meal was done they brought a surprise for the birthday boy. Chocolate cake with a single candle to make a wish. The look on his face was priceless. 

The overall dining experience is as good as it gets. From the bartender to our hostess and not to mention our server. She was very attentive and made sure we were on schedule for the show we had tickets for right after. Can't wait to visit again. Until then I'll be dreaming of prime rib & yorkshire pudding. 

Misc tips: Always make reservations and if you're up for the challenge, you can find all their recipes on their website. I've tried it, they really taste like the real deal. ; )",2017-01-06 17:49:57
dTzmmjcUCyyV2zSeTjL0SA,dLkOEK2tAe8B-LNV6x_HoA,aquwzx3ZsiG8l83lpnWF3Q,5,2,1,1,"Since I was in middle school, I patronized the 24 Fitness at West Sahara and Cimarron.  I loved that gym: large, well maintained, friendly staff and people.  So when the announcement came that it was closing down in July of last year, I took the news with a loud, resounding and somewhat manly ""NOOOOOOO!!!!""  Not quite like Darth Vader's at the end of episode III, but still booming.  BUT!  They were remodeling this location and all who had gone to the West Sahara gym could now go to this one at no additional cost.  Despite being further away from my house, I went anyway to check it out.

First impression, ""Holy crap this place is hoooge!  And has plushy lounge chairs!""  Granted, I am the type of guy who could lift weights in a shack and be happy, but it was a nice touch for people either chilling after a workout or waiting for your more motivated spouse/partner/relative/friend to finish their workout.  Second thing I noticed walking to the locker room: towels!  Wow, they must be spoiling us now!  Large cycling room with painted skies and mountains where it feels more outdoorsy than other cycle rooms with look more like raves.  Basketball court is small, with only two hoops rather than the usual six, but since I am 5'6"" and don't quite have the jumping ability of Spud Webb yet, I don't really use the court.

Locker Rooms:  CARPET!  Excuse the caps lock, but this is the first time I have ever been to a gym where the floor was not either concrete or tile.  Lockers a big and wide, with a ledge in front so you have a lot of room to put your stuff down while you change (unlike other 24's I have gone too with cramped lockers and barely any benches).  Showers with foggy doors so you have pretty good privacy, and a very large aquatic area.  

Climbing the stairs to the workout floor, you have tons of workout space.  Cardio machines are in the area closed to the stairs, with weights on the other side of the floor.  Machines and benches are well spaced out and there are a ton of machines, so even when the gym is busy it never feels cramped or crowded.  Cardio machines are high tech, either having a personal TV so you can watch whatever you want, or sockets for you iPod or other personal electronics.  Lots of weights as well, though I personally prefer free weights over machines.

There is also a ""Personal Training Area"" where trainers work with their clients, but is open to everyone.  It's basically a plyometric and functional fitness area, with rope, medicine balls, kettle balls and stools for jumping.  So if you're looking into a more explosive type of training, this is a good area to do that, and you might even witness yours truly tripping and faceplanting from a mistimed jump, as what happens once every couple weeks.  

Only complaint I have about the floor, and it is a rather large annoyance for me unfortunately, is that the dumbbells are almost never in the right rack for the right weight.  In other words, I once found a set of 125 lb dumbbells on the rack for 40's, and so on and so on.  It sounds like at first that this only happens for a couple of pairs of weights, but it is quite a problem here, and the weights are often disorganized.  This escalates because when someone is done with their weights, and go to put the weights away and find other weights where his are supposed to go, they will often put it somewhere else, creating a chain reaction.  I try my best to organize to the best of my ability,  but sometimes I am forced to put the weights anywhere since I either can't get to the right rack, or the weights there are too heavy for me.  

In conclusion, I was on the fence between giving this place a 4 or 5, making my ""official"" score a 4.5.  I went with five, because this place is practically perfect except for the organization problem with the free weights.  This is a an excellent gym, however, and is the best 24 I have ever been to.

Large and new workout floor
Towels available for use

Large and advanced aquatic area.

The white table clothes and smartly dressed waiters definitely add to the romantic atmosphere. However the mood is dampened a bit by the small and rather close together tables.
The menu is thoughtfully laid out starting with a good, but not overwhelming, selection of appetizers, traditional Indian dishes and modern Indian dishes. The samosas come beautifully plated with a hot sweet and sour chutney. The seared scallops are my personal favorite because they always come cooked tender on the inside with a distinctive seasoning seared on the top and bottom.
I am still a novice when it comes to Indian food so my go to order is the chicken tikka masala and I love the creamy tomato sauce it comes in which they do not prepare with much heat. I have also tried the dahl makhni which was also a solid choice for those still experimenting with all the new flavors of Indian cuisine. 
While Copper dishes have been consistently enjoyable I am not quite sold on the value of the meal. They offer a single slice of naan to begin the meal, but if you would like additional naan, even plain, they charge. That seems a little too opportunistic when they are already charging $20 for most of their meat dishes and $15 for vegetarian. At least they do include the rice in the meal price.
Other people have noted that the wait staff can be a bit off-putting and we have experienced that before but our last two visits the waiters were very attentive and had a courteous and friendly demeanor. Hopefully this is a sign of a long term improvement.

We did not come for dinner this evening, but instead, a rare occasion, simply dessert.  Sometimes that's the best way to do it though.  Generally you won't get dessert at places because you're too stuffed from dinner, so coming for dessert was a nice change of pace and BOY oh BOY did Cafe Bricco DELIVER!

Our waiter was friendly, fun, not annoyed by the fact that we weren't ordering meals too, and just an all around pleasure.  He kept our water glasses full, which was key actually, because these desserts could certainly be rich.

We ordered tiramisu, pistachio gelato, I had an Espresso Martini with chocolate drizzle, and the boys had caramel apple cheesecake.

Is your mouth salivating yet?  Because I'm about to pass out over here just reminiscing with my taste buds - overwhelming nostalgia.

The cheesecake was rich and creamy, yet not overkill with the topping, syrup not too thick, and a nice hint of apple.  My Espresso Martini was strong *good on ya, bartender* but not overpowering, and the perfect crisp cold temperature I need in a sweet alcoholic drink.  The chocolate drizzle swirled into the cocktail making it that much more enticing.  The pistachio gelato was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH delicious.  We almost didn't order it because I felt like we had enough, but the waiter recommended it and I am SO happy he did.  The tiramisu was UN-REAL.  Seriously.  I was in absolute love with every bite I took, but also had to limit myself from becoming so stuffed that my pants burst.  Okay okay, I was wearing leggings.  But you get the point.  Made fresh and you could tell!  Rich sweet mascarpone cheese hitting your lips with the exterior of nicely dipped espresso ladyfingers.  Unbelievably perfect.

The night was a huge hit all around and these desserts were, quite literally, the cherry on the cake.  No that's not true.  We didn't get any cherries!  How about chocolate drizzle on the latte, or the caramel on the cheesecake, instead.  You get the point  ;)",2017-04-03 16:03:38

At first I was disappointed, but since we like to try different hotels in Vegas, we saw this as a cool opportunity. Thank goodness we went in with a good attitude!

The area between the highway and the hotel is....interesting to say the least. Who knew Vegas had an erotic museum?? As previous reviews have stated, it's valet parking only. I don't mind that, but trying to get the car on Monday morning when we were leaving was a bit frustrating. We tried calling down when we were getting ready to leave to have the car pulled around so that it would be waiting for us, but when we called, we were told they couldn't bring it around until we were downstairs. Seriously?? The explanation given to my husband was that we had to physically hand the valet ticket in before they would go get the car. I thought it was a really lame excuse, but luckily it took only about 10 minutes for us to get our car.

Check-in was very quick and friendly. Yes, there is a $15 per day resort fee, but it pays for the parking, use of the pool, and use of the fitness center. The rooms are spacious, but not as impressive as those at the Palazzo. The bathroom is actually the best part about the room - very large shower and a nice jacuzzi tub. There is a TV in the mirror as well. I'll admit that on Sunday morning, I soaked in the tub and watched basketball - it was awesome. Our view completely sucked but that's what we get for using Priceline I bet (don't be jealous but we had views of the highway and the Stratosphere).

We don't mind walking, so the fact we were off the Strip didn't bother us. It's about a five minute walk to the Wynn and about 30 minutes to Bally's and Planet Hollywood which are in the center of the Strip. If you want to go to the Strip and have fun, but come back to a quiet hotel with no casino where you don't have to walk a huge distance to get to the room elevators, the Trump is not a bad place to stay.

My friend and I each tried a flight of 4 out of the 5 ciders. Between the two flights, we covered all 5. Neither of us were fond of the Hoppin' Good Thyme. The Queen City Common and The South End Sweet were decent ciders. The Nor Easter was super tart but would be excellent with a bit more carbonation and a twist of lime. By far their best cider is the Cherry Bobbin Trolls. We enjoyed 3 more pints each! The bar also offers other regional beers by various brewers and wine. Food is limited to food trucks and there wasn't one this particular night. It did seem as if they were open to outside food being brought in as our table mates had a Fuel pizza with them. The decor is nicely done, but it's a small bar. I don't know if they usually have outdoor seating because it was raining a bit. Patio seating would be a plus. We'll definitely be back to see how this place develops. And it's right down the street from Olde Mecklenburg and Sugar Creek breweries. Beer tour!",2015-09-13 23:44:33

I ordered the Green Curry chicken. The service was great, the meal was yummy, can't complain. I wouldn't say it stands out in comparison to the other gazillion restaurants in the area, but it's worth the money you pay for. The green curry chicken was a it spicy. If you have a medium tolerance, this is just right.

I had my mixed drink and water within minutes of ordering it, which was great. (The mixed drink was basically entirely alcohol and I couldn't manage more than a few sips, so without me even asking, the waitress did remove it from my check at the end of the meal, which I did like/appreciate.) 

I ordered a sprite to try to wash taste of the mixed drink from my mouth. About 25 minutes after ordering, I finally stopped the waitress while she was walking away from helping another table, to ask for the sprite again. I finally received it about 6 minutes after that. 

My friend and I ordered an appetizer but we both only had a few bites as it was pretty horrible. (If I remember correctly, I believe it was three types of hummus and pita bread.) Everything on the platter was bitter while at the same time, tasted the way I imagine cardboard would taste. It was strange.

Our meals arrived about 15 minutes after ordering them, which was lovely. At that time, there were three of us and I think we were all pleased with our main meals. I ordered a burger with waffle fries. (I highly recommend the waffle fries.)

The burger was massive and I couldn't finish even half of it so I asked for a to-go package. The waitress took the plate and brought our check about 10 minutes later, without the packaged burger. I had to stop and grab her again on her way back from helping another table to ask her if the burger had been packaged. She brought it out and sort of tossed it into the table.

I don't think I will ever be eating there again. Well, maybe to order some waffle fries to go. (They were that good.)",2013-06-29 14:27:25

Quintealia's is located in a charming victorian home from the 1800's. All the rooms are decorated in a different style, and I would have been happy to have my tea in any one. There are all different kinds of antiques throughout. It was fun to look at the different tables since each one had different vintage salt and pepper shakers, sugar holders, etc.

My mother and I went for the full tea. It came with an assortment of sandwiches, pastries and scones, plus a pot of tea. The food was great and the service was wonderful as well. Everyone was friendly and attentive without making us feel rushed. You can actually go and enjoy a cup (or pot) of tea without the fear of the owners waiting to get back their table. 

They use those beautiful little tea cups and pots that most places just put on display, and I have to say, it made us feel really special. Other little things they do to make you feel special include putting the napkin on your lap, giving you doilies for your tea pot to sit on, frequently warming your pot of tea with fresh water (and we didn't even have to ask!), cream mints on a cute little silver plate with your bill... just go and you'll see what I mean!

So, instead we ordered the Spareribs hotpot. We liked the Spareribs Hotpot a lot but we liked the Eggplant Hotpot a lot more. There was a hint of sweetness and spiciness at the same time. Daughter liked the tofu that came with it. We don't get that in the US in our eggplant order! The tilapia was delicious as well. It was nice and soft with the perfect amount of soy. Service was very friendly and quick. I loved that the waitress was very knowledgeable with the menu and was sensitive about the food allergies. She even made sure that the free soup was nut free!

I wasn't overwhelmed.  I wasn't exactly underwhelmed, either, given what I had read. Is it possible to be just whelmed? Anyways, I digress.  The festival is fairly expensive: 15 tokens for 20 bucks isn't a great exchange rate, especially when most things cost 3 or 4 tokens. There were also a lot of chains present: while some of them have their merits, I'm not going to a food festival to eat Salsaritas. Corporate sponsors are plentiful as well.

The factor that puts my opinion firmly in ""Meh"" territory is that the food I did get was quite unremarkable.  I had tandoori chicken from Namaste (bland), a mini barbecue sandwich from outlaw (also bland, and sadly so, because I suspect they can do better). The filling of the mini strawberry pie I got from Divine Pies was pretty good, but there was way too much crust, and that itself was bland.... have you noticed a theme here? The only truly delicious item I consumed was the taco from Harvest Moon Grille, which was good enough that I really want to check out the restaurant now.

While the amenities are a bit older than other spas, and a bit more basic, if you get a service such as a massage, it includes use of the facilities for the whole day.  We had a couple's massage here, and the massage therapist did a pretty good job with working out the omnipresent knots in my back and shoulders.  It was a good mix of relaxation and therapeutic massage.  At $210 for both of us, it seemed a bit pricey to me, although since it is a spa environment in Scottsdale, higher prices are to be expected.  They also have a harsh cancellation policy that I wish I could get away with at my own business and still stay afloat!  If you cancel within 24 hours of your appointment time, they will charge you the full amount of your service.  To be charged $210 if an emergency or something happened within 24 hours and I couldn't make the appointment made me feel a bit uneasy- good thing it was a normal day for me!

We were excited to try out the facilities, but there are a few things that need to be updated or fixed.  For instance, the steam room was lukewarm and it seemed like the controls were broken.  The steam room itself is very basic, with blue tile, and just steam, no other therapeutic scents.  There is a pool and jacuzzi outside, which we used for a bit.  There were a lot of leaves in the pool, and there was some dirt both in the pool and the jacuzzi accumulating.  They have flotation noodles and pool rafts for you to use to float in the pool with, but the pool rafts were very dirty and caked with sand, even after trying to rinse off all the dirt with water.  The whirlpool itself is a nice hot temperature, but the knob to activate the ""whirlpool"" feature was missing so we sat in hot, calm water rather than whirlpool type water.  Another option that I found missing was a ""cold"" room so that you can alternate between a hot environment and a cold to invigorate the senses.

They have a bar with fresh fruit, iced water, iced tea, coffee, and a nice selection of hot teas to choose from when you are relaxing in the atrium.  

In general, while Spa Lamar is a decent place to get a spa service from, it isn't the most posh.  So far I'd say the best experience I've had in Arizona would be at Joya, but prices here are more reasonable than Joya, so it is true that you get what you pay for.",2011-09-10 23:04:30

My brother has had a timeshare here before the change and since the change. I think most people think this is just for timeshare owners, but apparently you can rent a room like any hotel. 

The rooms are spacious, has a full kitchen, a nice deep jacuzzi tub, and has a awesome TV projector for some wall to ceiling watching with a large couch. My family is large, plus add in those of us who live here and most regular hotels aren't made for visiting or crashing. There is plenty of sitting and sleeping space in these rooms. It's a quiet hotel since it's just a hotel, yet its connected to Miracle Mile and Planet Hollywood with stuff to do and the strip is right there so you get the best of both worlds. Theres a bar and live music downstairs at the lobby and a convenience store if you need something. The pool here is simple, but kinda nice. Somehow though the pool catches a lot of desert wind. They've stayed here several times and I've tried to jump in the pool with the kids, but it's just too windy.

If you're just gonna be walking around, it's a good location right in the middle of the strip really. The parking lot is one of the negatives as it shares the same parking as Miracle Mile and Planet Hollywood casino so it's a bit busy and hard to find a spot. They should maybe make a designated area near the Elara side for parking. Parking off the back way on Harmon and not a entrance through the strip which can be a good thing during busy times on the strip if you need to get out. 

One thing that's a bit annoying is that they have to scan your room key each and every time you go in and sometimes they were straight weird about it. My brother who forgot to tell friends something who were just going up as we were leaving ran up to as they were going in the elevator and got a attitude from the door man about it ""are you with these people? and where are your keys?"" when it was clear he was telling them something.  I guess I can't expect him to know all faces, but we seriously were up and about a dozen times hauling crap up, getting things from ABC store, going out to eat, going to the lobby to pick up people (since there were only 2 keys), asked him a few questions, etc.  I guess if you have stalkers, this may be your refuge! Haha. 

It's probably a good hotel to do for a family. There's very few nice looking hotels that offer a full kitchen on the strip -you'll be lucky with a kitchenette.

I wish them the best of luck but they need to take their recipes more seriously. 

On the bright side, this experience inspired me to purchase a dehydrator to make my own!

David our sales guy was very helpful and told us we could have them planted for free in a week.  When we got to the register a week became two weeks and $999 became $1188.  He asked if there were any trees or bushes were we wanted the trees and we said no.  He said they would not remove plants unless we paid additional fees.  We paid and he had us initial about the removal.  We did not get a chance to review all of the fine print on their receipt.  We did agree to leave the back gate open and to place the flags on the desired locations.  When we went to place the flags we discovered there had been a tree in two of the areas and the roots were in the way.   I wanted to reevaluate our decision to buy the size of trees we did but when I looked at the receipt I realized we were SOL sales are final.  Ended up paying a landscaper to remove the roots and he told me we should have had him plant the trees and it would have saved us hundreds.  I also realized the two week time line ended up being  3 weeks.   The planting day they knocked on the door and left.  We had to call David and remind him they had access to the backyard and the location was marked.  They left my yard a mess, rocks and dirt in the pool so bad it clogged it up.  The cypresses are doing well but the tangerine has lost almost all the fruit and is looking distressed.  I wish David would have been a little more forthcoming about their policies.  Not planning on ever buying anything more from them.  Just hope the trees make it....",2015-08-23 19:51:53

This was the ABSOLUTE BEST hotel we've ever experienced. The whole stay was amazing. I loved everything about our room and the size of it, the view and the bathroom was impeccable. The bathtub was huge, also inside the shower, a very modern feel.
The view is absolutely breathtaking. Since it's one of the only hotels off of the strip, the view of the strip is amazing. That would be the only inconvenience of the whole hotel, many taxi rides. You can walk to the strip, but it's a looong walk. It's better to go across the street to The Rio and take the shuttle from there to Harrah's, that's your best shot. Since there's three hotels that make up the Palms, you'll never really be bored there. The Palms Place is where you should stay (price-wise) for your room, the Palms Casino is just a short walkway from there. The actual casino floor of the Palms isn't extremely impressive, it's smaller than I expected, but of course, it gets the job done for gambling. The restaurants in the Palms are top-notch. N9NE Steakhouse was to-die-for. Best steak I've ever had. They have a cafeteria in the Palms Casino and it comes in handy when you're on your way back to your room for a late night snack. The pizza place in that section of the casino is pretty impressive. We ordered a pizza around 2 in the morning and took it back to our room.
The lovely cleaning room attendants cleaned our room everyday to the extreme, but not so much that I felt uncomfortable with them touching all of our things. And they left presents for us everyday. chocolates, robes, flowers. They really were amazing. 
You can't use your balcony anymore, because you can't use any balcony anymore in Vegas, which is upsetting now, because that would have been beautiful to sit out on at night, but still the view was just as beautiful from the door. 

I really was surprised by all of the bad reviews I read on them before writing this, I really don't even have a complaint and it just seems odd that so many people had such a drastically different experience than us. I can only go off of our experience, which was amazing. it's going to be hard for another hotel to live up to my standards of this one from here on out..that's for sure.",2015-06-25 15:36:21

We were greeted by the the sushi chef as soon as we walked in. He was pretty cool. But thats where service pretty much ended.

Our server was this older Asian woman who just didn't seem happy with her job. She greeted us and gave us menus.  She came back a few minutes later to take our order but were weren't quite ready. She kind of scowled at us and walked off. From there, we waited over 10 minutes. When she would walk by, I would try to make eye contact and even raised my hand, but to no avail. Finally she came by and took the order.

I had the All you can eat, and my gf had the vegetarian tempura and seaweed salad.

The miso soup was tasty. Her seaweed salad was great as well. I had a spicy tuna roll, the red snapper sashimi, octopus, philly roll, and the spider roll. The only stand outs were the red snapper and the octopus. The octopus was very tender. The snapper was very fresh. Everything else was, meh. The softshell crab in the spider roll was obviously frozen, not fresh and very fishy, on the brink of unpleasant.

In the end, there are many other places in the area that have much better sushi, service and ambiance. But you live and you learn.,,",2011-09-08 16:49:11

The platter held a generous portion and was beautifully plated. The squid was cooked perfectly: not too chewy but still had a nice bite. Delightfully paired with the squid, the seasoned, leaner cuts of pork belly tasted heavenly.

The fun menus, nice staff, solid beer selection, and good food won't disappoint (and bacon night is always a plus) but there's very little that you can find at Harris that you can't get - or top - somewhere else. That's the primary reason that I'll rarely wait for a table when it's busy.

The mac & cheese is a standout, as many will tell you. Rich and creamy, with the cavatappi pasta being the difference...definitely a winner! As far as the food goes, I've never really had anything that I didn't like, but many items that I used to love are no long on the menu (pulled pork sliders being the main one, but the big sandwich is still there). Nowadays, I usually go for the fish tacos (good, but not a lot of fish on them) and the hummus, which is excellent. Henny Penny is another go-to, but be warned, as the spice levels have varied from time-to-time from so-so spicy to mouth-on-fire spicy.

If you're looking for a nice vibe in good weather, it's fun to try your luck landing a table on the patio. Service can occasionally be slow outside and it almost always gets crowded, but it definitely beats the inside when it gets packed. The only real downside is that it gets packed most nights, and as mentioned before, it's not really worth the wait. Enjoy!",2014-01-21 18:59:18

If like me, you grew up thinking that your friend Vinnie's mothers daily offering of Italian Food, with aromas wafting all through the apartment building, was something very special and real Italian Food - THIS IS IT! You will have found Nirvana, as have I!

Until now, I had almost given up hope for what I call ""Old World Italian Food"" prepared with love and the most incredible ingredients available. It is here and being served in a friendly small environment by a knowledgeable and wonderful wait staff.  Not to mention that  the Owner is usually present and generally talks to everyone, making certain that all are satisfied. Now I ask you, is that PRIDE or what?

Based on talking with adjacent Diners, everything on the Menu;  both the ""Today's Menu"" (Changes sometimes daily) and the ""Full Menu,"" seems to be pretty fabulous and receiving ""Rave Reviews"" from my fellow Diners!

Looking at previous Reviews, as well as Guy Fieri's recommendation, I had to have the Bolognese Ragu on my first visit. I have yet to have everything on the menu, but here are the choices I have made on my visits to date and each is NOT to be missed:

        Bolognese Ragu - Don't ask! Just order it. Seven meats and homemade  
        Pasta that lives up to all of the previous fabulous Reviews! Like so many 
        before me, I am not certain I can eat here ever without having this incredible 
        dish, which leaves little room for anything else. Share with a friend so you can 
        have more of their remarkable dishes.

        Burrata (Appetizer) - Mozzarella like you have never had. Do NOT overlook it 
        if  it is available. The description doesn't do it justice, but it is described as 
        a ""ball of mozzarella filled with shredded mozzarella and cream."" If you love 
        Mozzarella -this is ""MOZZARELLA MECCA!"" 

        Antipasto (Appetizer) - An absolute work of art! Do NOT be fooled by the 
        Menu designation of Small (they also have Large), it is NOT small, but can be 
        shared by two (I refuse to share!)  Incredible morsels of meat, cheese and 
        vegetables, with the proper amount of dressing.

        Pasta e Fagioli (Appetizer) - I have a friend who says you can judge ALL 
        Italian Restaurant by their Pasta e Fagioli. This is a light (meant to be, it's an 
        Appetizer!) flavorful mixture of beans and pasta that is oh so satisfying, with 
        just a hint of spice.

        Spaghetti and our Famous Meatballs - Not to be confused with your Mothers, 
        as she probably could not make this rendition. The meatballs in my sampling 
        were made from Veal with Ricotta and other special ingredients. If spaghetti 
        and meatballs were like this everywhere, we would all be Italian! Hint - you 
        can have the meatballs alone as an appetizer or a side dish.

        Bread and Olive Oil - Nothing remarkable about the bread here, which is a 
        surprise, but it is the Olive Oil (with Giuseppe's label on it) that is the star. No 
        Balsamic needed, just pure goodness with salt and pepper to your own taste. 
        Take a bottle home (I have!) and pair it with your favorite bread.

Giuseppe's has definitely replaced The Restaurant (Now Pizzeria Bianco) as my favorite Phoenix Italian Restaurant. The love, pride and caring that has gone into each and every dish is more than apparent. There is no need to go elsewhere, unless for a diversion you wish to go to Andreoli Italian Grocer for their bread! Between these two you will be in ""Italian Food Heaven!""",2013-07-18 21:45:20

Bread basket is a treat with both sweet and savory muffins, scones, biscuits, and bread. For entrees we usually stick to hot dishes - spicy chicken sweet potato hash, chilequiles, salmon. Grits and the bacon are favorite sides. I'd say skip the tenderloin sandwich (cold deli style), and the salads unless that's what you are in the mood for.

+++PROS+++
1. For the type of food, the prices are good
2. The service is excellent.  They handled our group of 20 or so Yelpers as smoothly as they could have.
3. Lots on the menu, plenty of options for all, even those annoying vegetarian friends.

---CONS---
1. If you're going to call yourself a ""Really Really Nice Restaurant"", you may want to invest in things like, paint on the walls, a janitor to clean your bathroom, etc.
2. The most important thing, the food, simply wasn't that great.  Just good, not really or really really good.  I had the scallops+pork belly, gnocchi, and lamb chops.  The gnocchi was the best of the bunch. 

To be perfectly honest, there's too many good restaurants in Toronto for Gio Rana's to be a destination location for me.  The high Yelp rating and great expectations don't help either.

There is only ever one register open at a time and a decent sized line. So if you want one item but the person in front of you is ordering 10+ items, you will have to wait the entire time to place your order and be taken care of.

Today, a young gal (who I will leave unnamed) was cashiering. Bless her heart, she was just not having a good day. Her black makeup was smeared under her eyes, she was constantly ringing up wrong orders and one of the food preps had to keep yelling at her the whole time. 

When it was my turn, she didn't even muster a hello or how are you. She just stood there and stared at me. I placed my order although she was extremely confused. She said a few times during taking peoples orders ""this is my cue to be off and go home."" I asked if I could get almond milk in my dink instead of regular milk and she said ok.

My drink came out and I saw it wasn't marked for almond milk so I asked the barista and she screamed at the cashier who then apologized because she forgot to mark almond milk. It wasn't really a big deal because I had time to wait for them to remake it.

Gates & Brovi is located next to that Mallatt's at the end of Monroe St, where it splits off into Nakoma Rd and Odana Rd. There is not private lot; it's all street parking. They have these very complicated diagrams everywhere showing you where you can and cannot park. Most of the suggested parking areas have some kind of restriction. Anyway, back to the pizza. They have 7 or 8 specialty pizzas on the back of the menu, and having tried about half of them, I can say they are all amazing. The crust is on the thin side, and I think they must have a wood-burning pizza oven in the back. 

The Clam Pie has clams, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, cream, basil, mozzarella and parmesan and it all melts together in your mouth. The clams are very juicy *insert clam joke here* but the basil and fennel really make the flavors pop. 

The Green Goat is also a good bet: basil pesto, zucchini, roasted tomatoes, oil-cured black olive, mozzarella and goat cheese. You can't go wrong with pesto and goat cheese. 

Another one of my favorites is the Sausage and Roasted Artichokes pizza: parmesan béchamel, red onion, house-made giardinera and italian parsley. It combines many of my favorite things; giardinera, sausage, and artichokes. Win-win.

I also love the interior...it is really spacious, and the exposed brick walls, the cozy booths, and the wooden ceiling give it a casual but upscale feel.

Campagnolo is a small Italian restaurant that opened up quiet recently and the reviews have been pouring in of great food in a little cozy setting.  The decor right away when you walk in is warm and friendly, but at the same time elegant in its own way.

The lager was alright, nothing special to be honest in my opinion.  But the menu looked incredibly tempting and we decided to order and share so we can all taste as many items as possible.  If you're heading over, this might be a very good idea as the menu is a little on the expensive side.  And the ingredients they use are a little different, so you would want to try as many dishes as possible.  

There are a fair number of dishes we ordered and a few of them stood out for me.  For the appetizers, I liked the Fresh Burrata Cheese and Roasted Grapes with Toasted Bread.  Sounds simply, but it tasted great.  Also, I'm starting to see more and more dishes where grapes are getting involved; can this be a little trend?  Nonetheless, it was a good choice.  For the mains, I liked the Monkfish which was deep fried.  I know I'm horrible, deep fried Brian? But the taste was good.  The Pappardelle with peas and lemon was for me a surprise but definitely welcomed.  It was a great little dish.  And last, I'm a little mixed... see I liked the Sea Bream as I think that was cooked well and all the ingredients worked.  But I too liked the Wild Boar.  The reason I'm mixed is... if you're that type of eater that wants to try something new and different, then I would say go for the Sea Bream.  If you're not of that variety, then the Wild Boar would be a familiar taste that you may expect more.  And who doesn't like something that's familiar right?

Overall, I would have to say I did like Campagnolo.  But for me, it's a little too expensive for my regular preference.  The food is cooked well but in terms of portions size, the dishes are small.  So my recommendation might be to go to Campagnolo for their cocktails as they have a great list.  And maybe order a dish or two to nibble on while enjoying the atmosphere.  It's nice and cozy and a good place to unwind with your date over drinks.",2011-02-21 21:16:44

Staff:  Every staff member I encountered was extremely friendly.  Even walking past them in the halls, they greeted you with a ""hello"" and a smile.  The servers cleaning and serving breakfast and the evening reception were extremely efficient and friendly as well.  We had four people staying in the room so we needed to use the pull out soft.  It was later in the evening (around 11:00) when I called the front desk for a comforter, pillows and extra towels were delivered to the room within ten minutes with a smile.

Rooms:  the rooms were very nice, but they were smaller then the typical suite at an Embassy Suites.  The bedroom had two beds, dresser and TV and the living room had the pullout sofa, two chairs and a desk.  The entire space of the suite was just slightly larger then a typical hotel room would have.   The plus side is that unlike a typical hotel room, there is a fridge, microwave and sink in the living room which adds to the convenience of having a room here.

Complimentary food:  The breakfast is great!  There is a hot buffet line that has bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage and french toast.  You can also have eggs made to order.  Additionally, there is an area that has several choices of cereal, several fruit options and breads and muffins.  There is also an omelet station where you can choose from a variety of meats and veggies.  The manager's reception at night was so so.  There were potato chips, salsa, veggie dip and limited veggies.  Nothing hot or really interesting.  The free drinks were quite nice, though.  They had a wide selection of beer, wine, liquors, mixers and even had sangria.

Restaurant:  This is one of the aspects that lowered my rating.  While the food was very good, the service was slow and the prices were high.  I had about an hour and 15 minutes to eat before my event started.  Our waiter was efficient and friendly, but food took a very long time to come out.  It may have taken even longer if I hadn't asked about where it was.  The waiter said that people usually like to have leisurely meals so they space the meal out.  Even if you enjoy a leisurely meal, waiting 20 minutes before you get a salad is a bit much.

The maki were less impressive and were poorly presented. The filling to rice ratio was good, but most of the black dragon roll was missing the unagi (eel) top! How they could forget to put the unagi on the rest of the roll, I'll never understand. The ends of the roll were uneven and looked rushed. The spicy salmon sushi had an okay-level of spiciness.

The menu is not too large, but they have a good selection of yakitori. I also ordered other items including a rice bowl, karaage, grilled squid and dessert.

We tried one of the specials, duck confit, as well as deviled eggs and bacon biscuits for appetizers. For meals we shared cast iron petite chicken, pork osso buco confit (based on several Yelp reviews), and fork tender short ribs. Dessert consisted of the fig & pecan pie and chocolate dipped bacon s'mores. 

Our overall assessment was TOO SALTY. I actually love salt and could eat it plain, so the duck was ok to me but even I could tell that it was too salty. It was basically inedible for everyone else. The bacon biscuits were good, maybe a bit dense/hard, but are huge and only come with three (we split one and it was fine, but some might find this annoying). 

We had the same saltiness issue with the pork, though 2 people ordered it and one was worse than the other. The summer veggie spaetzle that came with the pork was a bit off putting (green and quite a large serving) and no one ate it - I would switch it out if you can. The short ribs were very similar to a pot roast. It smelled exactly like canned cat food but tasted ok - the mashed potatoes were excellent and the highlight of this dish for me. Everyone was actually most impressed with the chicken! It was tender, moist, and seasoned perfectly.

As for dessert, the fig and pecan pie was very dry and we didn't finish it. The cream cheese citrus ice cream was refreshing and interesting. The s'mores were awesome.

This is a soft opening for this place the official Grand Opening will be in early June so maybe as they get things going better, they will look at using something other then pure cane sugar or even try making some items sugar-free.

The stuff here is good, there were only a few selections available but like I said, be careful because Gluten Free does not necessarily mean healthy, you will still pack on the pounds with all the sugar in the items they currently have.

I say you still should give them a try and leave your own comments.  I am just one person who cares about sugar content, there are many that may think this place is Heaven, I just cannot eat what they serve as it will put me there and I am not ready to go yet.",2015-05-02 18:58:24

I really enjoyed my experience here! The service was friendly and efficient. There was no pressure to order wine or a drink if we didn't want to or an appetizer for that matter, which I appreciate.

I ordered the margharita pizza; a great way to judge a pizza restaurant as it's the simplest of pizzas. The tomato sauce on the pizza was delicious and I loved the taste of the crust because of the wood-burning oven. However, I did find the middle of the pizza a little soggy probably because the dough was so thin and it's not as good once it cools down. I knew we were going to order the nutella dessert pizza to share (I had never tried one before), so I ate 2/3 of my pizza (could've easily finished it) and took the rest to go. 

The nutella pizza was the star here. Perfectly cooked, the nutella melted in my mouth and I wanted to eat the whole thing but restricted myself to 2 slices. I would go back just for that. Having spent less than $25 with taxes and tips, I don't find it crazy expensive though I didn't order any drinks or appetizers.

So when I do eat out I like to do it at places that are very clean and also transparent with their ingredients. Avoiding soy isn't as easy as it sounds since it's in a lot more than the obvious foods. I decided to try Fix 8, a self proclaimed healthy fitness cafe. As such, I expect the employees to be very knowledgeable about the ingredients in the foods that comprise their menu. Eating healthy might mean different things to different people but some may say that, no matter who you are, a healthful diet includes knowing what's in your food. 

I told the employee that I had a soy restriction and just wanted to confirm that certain menu items didn't have hidden soy. The employee replied... ""is that like an allergy to gluten?"" It leaves a really bad taste in my mouth that the employee of a fitness Cafe doesn't know the difference between soy and gluten.

Since he wasn't sure, I asked how we would be able to find out with certainty which menu items were safe for me to eat. His suggestion was to come back at another time when a manager might be there. Luckily, another employee suggested that I contact the manager at the other location. When I asked her she replied... ""so, like, soy sauce?"" Not quite that simple... 

The manager at that location called the owner at my request to confirm the ingredients. She called back and told me that my chosen menu items should be safe for me to eat. 

In the end, my food was good, albeit expensive. But I was disappointed at the lack of knowledge about ingredients and very common allergens.",2016-11-30 01:45:39

I met my family here for lunch this week and wasn't super-impressed by anything in particular, but wasn't disappointed either. 

Let's start with what I did like: 

- They have a decent amount of lunch options. I would suggest taking a look at their half salad with soup or sandwich options. My sister and mother tried the ham and cheese panini with a chop salad. Both looked pretty tasty, but then again, when isn't melted cheese with ham good? My uncle tired the chicken parm sandwich and although he didn't say much, his plate was clean! 

- Chop Salad: pretty decent size and dressed salad for a ""half-size."" We all swapped out the blue cheese crumbles, since for some reason no one in my family likes it--and it was still good. Nothing super special, but good. 

- Gnocchi with Italian sausage: Lately I've been letting myself indulge on whatever I want and this vodka sauce dish was pretty tasty. The gnocchi didn't taste homemade, but it was still good. The sauce was pretty tasty too. Overall it didn't knock my socks off, but it was a decent, chain restaurant dish. 

- Service: There was only maybe one hiccup, but otherwise, our server was really nice. She seemed a little frazzled, but was always smiling and very helpful.

I didn't like: 

- SUPER large lunch menu: Too many options for lunch, which makes me think not a lot of what they serve is all that fresh. They could cut that menu in half and still have too many options. This isn't dinner time. 

- HUGE, but shallow plates: Our table was hella-cramped with just three people and when my pasta dish came out, there was no room for this plate the size of my torso. Still, the guy helping our server made me feel like it was my job to figure out where we were going to put it. Nope. The portion was also a bit too large for lunch, and because the plate was so huge and shallow, my gnocchi got ice cold in mere minutes. Toss those plates, please. Figure out a better, more appealing way to serve your pasta.

- It's really dark, you guys! I'm only 29 and I felt like I needed reading glasses... at lunch time. 

- Chain-y... It just feels and tastes really chain restaurant... because, well.. it is! But I've also been to some chains that fooled me. I think Maggiano's could step their game up a lot. When we asked our server  about the tomato bisque, so told us the kitchen just put their alfredo sauce in tomato soup. Maybe I'm the only one, but that threw me off... big time. Not only does it sound like a short-cut a restaurant shouldn't be taking (considering how easy it is to make homemade tomato soup), but when they're cutting corners that I wouldn't even cut when I'm cooking at home, that's a big no-no for me. 

- No lunch-sized pasta portions, unless you want to do buy one, get one to take home thing... which, I didn't.",2015-02-06 20:16:28
gbwfltJHGWhWNmeTa1WSiQ,SRA86Xyf9fbOAhICWttMLQ,CIF-zvPmVk-hVqExQmvw-g,4,2,1,0,"Recently my friend told us to try Paramount and little did we know, they were opening one closer to home. They just opened their Erin Mills location on November 15th.

We decided to try it out last night. Boy, was it busy! Driving by, you can already see the crowd waiting inside (thankfully there's a decently sized indoor waiting area). I thought they were joking when I was told it would be about 10 minutes...and I still think they were (just to keep us around). We ended up waiting 15 minutes, so it wasn't a bad estimate.

We were told to check out the menu, then order and pay at the counter. We returned back to our table and were given fresh pitas that were warm and puffy, which we enjoyed until it cooled down. It took 15 minutes for our food to arrive at our table, which was not bad considering how busy it was.

We wanted to try a bit of everything, so we ordered a plate of Chicken & Beef Shawarma and a plate of Mixed Grill. It was an incredible amount of food for two people, but it can definitely feed up to four. Each plate came with a lot of plain white rice (the other option was fries), some pickles, a little bit of lettuce and tomatoes, and delicious garlic sauce (don't forget to bring a pack of gum!). Out of all the meats, my favourite was the shish tawouk. The marinated chicken was very juicy and it was cooked perfectly. (The shish tawouk plate is something I will definitely order next time!) The BBQ beef was nice and juicy, slightly but not overly chewy. I'm not a big fan of kafta, but the kafta was not bad. Considering it is a Middle Eastern / Arabic restaurant, I was expecting the shawarma to be one of the top reasons I would dine here again. However, I was pretty disappointed with the shawarma meats because they were both dry. The temperature and the texture of the meats tasted like either the plate itself or the meats had been sitting in the kitchen for a long time. 

The staff were all very friendly and quick at everything they do as they were trying to clear the tables as soon as possible. I thought the restaurant was a bit noisy, somewhat similar to a bar and grill with a lot of chatter plus the clinking of cutlery and plates.

All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is even just slightly interested in Middle Eastern / Arabic cuisine. It's a nice, friendly environment, the portions are big, and the shish tawouk is great!

One more thing... Our friend also told us ""one cannot leave without having their baklawa"". I have never been a fan (maybe because I've never had well-made baklawas), but we still decided to try their entire assortment. The first one I tried was the cashew-filled baklawa and it just melted in my mouth... It was a tiny bit too sweet, but so delicious. Our friend was right. I'm not sure I will ever step out of there and not have a bite of their baklawa before I leave!",2013-11-24 04:56:22

The fries, first of all, are huge and should be shared between 2-4 people. Being sort of an okonomiyaki snob, the toppings and presentation were true to the okonomiyaki name, but for some reason, they salted the fries. This made it too strong. There's no reason to add salt because of the already salty kewpie, okonimiyaki sauce, katsuobushi. Still a great dish, but I feel like leaving out the salt and also adding bacon bits would make it a winner.

Also tried the azuki cream smoothie. If you like red bean, you'll love this. Naturally sweet with a strong red bean taste.

I might come back to try other dishes. The menu is pricey, and I'm not big on pasta, but sometimes you want a little quality, presentation, and a relaxing atmosphere when eating, and you don't find that often in Markham.",2013-02-28 14:21:55

I have to admit, I was a skeptic after the first time I went here. The Sangria was great but I was not a fan of the food. Considering that the drinks had been so good, I decided to give it another shot, and I am glad that I did. My second visit even got Ticoz an extra star from me.

First visit:

I came here during happy hour on a weekday night because I had been really interested in checking it out. The first thing I did was order a Passion Fruit Sangria. It was amazing by the way and tasted very homemade! I then decided to get some food. There was a lot on the menu that caught my eye, but I decided to play it safe with a burrito. The waitress then recommended the tilapia, which sounded like a winner. It's then that I noticed the toppings for the burritos; there was enchilada style and queso style. Thinking that some melted cheese on my burrito would take the taste over the top, I ordered it that way. -- Let me just say really quickly that the waitress was pretty fantastic, though she sounded a bit scripted. That's understandable though considering the place started packing in a crowd. -- Now, back to the food. I was completely baffled when I saw my burrito. It was completely covered in cheese. Normally this would have been great, but in this case it was covered in what looked to be movie theater nacho cheese. Ticoz is a swanky place so I brushed it off and gave it a taste. No joke, it tasted like movie theater nacho cheese. I had no idea what I had done to my food! When I think of ""queso style"" I think of shredded cheese melted over the burrito via a broiler or something. The contents of the burrito were delicious, but the topping soiled their flavor (I even tried to scrape it off). I left Ticoz that night wishing that I had ordered something else to eat.

This leads us to visit number two...

Second visit:

This time I decided to go for breakfast and I am pleased to say that I had a great time. Two dollars mimosas and pork chile verde in the morning hit the spot! To condense this visit to a sentence: The drinks were just as good as before and the food was great!

I can now say that I like Ticoz and I am happy to be able to say so. My one request is for them to lay off the cheese sauce for their burrito. Now go check out their happy hour!",2010-01-19 22:07:27

It's also because we were staying at New York New York so we didn't want to bother with getting a cab anywhere. If you are a lady and want to get in free just look for the person handing out passes below the escalator that leads to Coyote Ugly. Men pay $10.00 dollars with the discount I don't know if that was a local discount or not. 

Friday was dead they didn't even bother to play images on their big screens that surround the dance floor. The part that disturbed me was they were playing music mixes from when we were there last year! I remember because they were playing ""I don't want to lose your love"" by the Outfield. It's pretty memorable because they don't really play that song in dance clubs unless it's 80's night. 

Saturday we came here again because I'd rather be here than at the Bar at Times Square. If I'm going to be somewhere loud I prefer to hear dance music. This time they played the images on the big screen and it was packed . If you come here try to wear comfortable shoes because they will not let you sit down without paying for a table or take off your shoes. My sister in law tried both and she was out of luck with her pointy stilettos and sore feet! The floor is also really really sticky I was afraid my shoe was going to come off! 

If you have a problem with sharing a bathroom with the guys it's best to use the restroom in the casino because the bathroom is coed. The bathroom is stacked with necessities like body spray, mints, hairspray, etc just in case you may have forgotten something.

Now with being open 7 days, I think this will relieve the line-ups. Wait! Don't get turned off by the long waiting time.. It's worth it. I promise you!


Yes, most restaurants with very few exceptions are pricey and none other than a tourist trap. Olive and Gourmando is not at all one of them.
Their main focus is on the locals that come and enjoy an outstanding breakfast, or lunch. Each of their meals, pastries  are simply delicious and well presented. 

This is not about big or huge portions of pancakes and waffles or massive amounts of sausage and bacon. This is about using local and delicious things to make it all about quality. 

Their pastries are oh so crumbly and buttery, along touches of Valrhona chocolate in some of their pastries. Nothing is overly sweet or greasy.  Again, just perfect! 

I ordered the homemade granola with Greek yogurt and fruits. It was a good portion with such generous amounts of fresh berries, apples, grapes and oranges. The fruits were perfectly ripe and juicy. 

Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I put a lot, yes a lot of focus on hot chocolate. Their hot chocolate was out of this world!! A simple glass of hot steamy milk(Perfect temperature) with a generous amount of Valrhona cocoa. You put as much sugar as you desire. Perfect! At last a hot cocoa that is not packed with 90% sugar and 10% chocolate. 

We arrived at 11:30am on a Friday. It was packed! Wait.. Give it a try anyways. The service was very professional, efficient and so fast.

All their sandwiches come with dirty sauce.  My mom ordered the Paul Ruebens and she wasn't sure how the dirty sauce would taste on it, but she loved it.  The moral of the story is- Always get the dirty sauce!

Having eaten at this location another time and experienced bad service I was not particularly excited, but hey, how can a margarita and some nachos go wrong?  

We were promptly seated and a server came to take our order.  He disappeared, we assumed to enter our drink and nacho orders.  We were very shortly visited by another server who offered to take our order.  We explained our orders had been given.  The young lady said he was in training, and she disappeared as well.  We waited a bit, and we were served chips and salsa.  The bartender noticed that a nearby table had not been served and he asked them about their order.   The table explained that we were there first and to take our order.  The bartender took our order AGAIN.   Another 10 minute wait.  I believe another server came over to ask about our order.  Finally we received our drinks and had to ask again for our nachos.  Yet another server came over and explained they were ""short staffed"" which was odd because over all we had at least 7 different people come over to either take our order, ask about it, or apologize.  

Finally we received our nachos and additional chips and salsa.  A person told us they were very sorry for the confusion and comped the nachos, which was very nice.

Couldn't resist the loaded tater tots ($8) to start. They were very good, hot, and crispy. Price is definitely on the high side. Would have liked to have had something other than plain sour cream served with them, especially at that price.

Wife had the steak salad ($16). It was large, but again, price point was too high for what was received. Somewhere around $12 would be a better value. She also had the beer cheese soup and deemed it excellent!

I went with the prime rib ($16, is this a theme?). Beef was generous, and thankfully, sliced correctly. The au jus was good, but could have used just a bit more. Came with fries that were definitely not made in-house.

Dessert was creme brulee, and was very good. They rotate their desserts around, so there is no actual menu of them.

Place is cavernous, but clean. The staff is very nice, and well trained. Our server Bree was awesome!

I had opportunity to try a sugar cookie drizzled with dulce de leche. Sweet, sugary goodness! A nice crunch but such a smooth finish when that creamy caramel sauce melded together in your mouth. Yum. 

A comfortable space with an excellent variety of Spanish foods for you to eat or take home. There's a fridge and products situated along the wall for you to purchase.

Dried scallops with mushroom. This was an improvement over the other spot, Humongous mushrooms with the not so dry version of the scallops this time.
Chicken: Devoid of taste and mushy in texture.

One person from our group has been there before and she said it was great last time, so it seems it's a hit or miss from time to time given the menu changes a lot. 

The 5 year aged Jamon (add-on) was delicious. The first 3 courses in our set menu was great and they were focused on seafood, which is what Edulis is known for and what came for. For the main, we had a chicken and mushroom dish which was a bit of disappointing. We didn't expect to have a chicken dish as main on the set menu from a restaurant known for seafood. For the dessert, we had a bitter orange sorbet which wasn't my type of dessert but the rest of group enjoyed it.

None of us had any of the wonderful looking desserts or treats, but we all went through a few beverages. The Nutella Cappuccino seemed to big hit with the ladies. I liked The Americano. For the hardcore, Leone Cafe, does not have the best coffee or coffee based beverages in the world, but they do brew a decent cup. I also wish that their proportions were bigger, for the price. The main charm of this clean cafe, is the huge open seating area, where you & your friends can sit, relax, enjoy your refreshments & gab to your hearts content, without other people's conversations interrupting your own groups musings. The staff also, never makes you feel like they need your table for other customers..... no matter how long you stay, even if you don't all order refills.

My beer tour started off with registering on the website.  Simple to use and the communication was excellent from the confirmation to a friendly reminder of the tour.

Parking depending on the size of your tour may or may not be a problem.  Be flexible and be happy.

While waiting to check-in everyone seemed excited including myself.  Everyone was all smiles and super friendly.  Checking in was a breeze.  Only 21 and over are allowed.  You get a very nice JJBC pint glass to sample with and away you go.

I don't want to give away to much of the tour.  But trust when I say you will be more educated in the brewing process and get sample many of the excellent beers JJBC has to offer.  They are by know means stingy with the delicious samples.

Said they would fix our outside storage door and fix our carpeting since it was installed horribly and is coming up with nails sticking out. Nothing.
We have to renew our lease since budget is tight, and they tried to raise it on us. Keep in mind the downstairs apt and a few others by me have been vacant for 2 months atleast.
Probably going to renew the lease..but that's cause of the location and the hassle of moving to a new place.

You know how McDonald's has been doing those commercials showing that they make fresh biscuits every morning? That's because BOJO's does! Bojangles has amazing air and fluff to their buttermilk biscuits. The biscuit actually sticks a little to the roof of your mouth as you're eating it. Then you take a swig of coffee and all is right with the world. The bo rounds... don't get me started on bo rounds they are in a separate hash brown category. They are a bit larger then chick-fil-a's and made with onions which gives them a different taste that I think we can all enjoy. 

When my husband and I have that dilemma like everyone else in the world...  ""What's for dinner?"" One of our many fall backs is Bojangles. I LOVE the 2 piece meal deal with a leg and thigh and seasoned fries. YUMMY! Now the only trick is that you have to try and get the chicken right out of the fryer for it to be perfect. Otherwise the chicken looses it's crispiness. We usually pick up from this location because it's just down the street from our house. If they are out of legs or wings they are always willing to substitute. I know this is kind of weird but if you get a long fry that is warm but limp it's almost like eating the perfect french fry.

Went by the place at around 1245, parking lot was full and there was a line out the door.  Left and came back about an hour and half later...no line, lots of parking.

Ordered the farm burger and 2 hot dogs...that and two drinks....$23.  

Hamburger -- nothing special.  Came with two leaves of partially brown lettuce and two rather anemic looking rings of red onion...not two slices...two rings.

Hot dogs -- actually not bad.  Came with onion and ""homemade"" relish.  

Fries that came with the above we ok, but again nothing special.

So what's my assessment?

- Nothing special.
- Way expensive.
- Odd that they're a ""farm"" restaurant but yet they had such sad looking produce.
- Glad I didn't have to wait in line...I wouldn't be a happy camper if I did.
- Places to get a better burger...especially on a price to quality ratio...In and Out, Five Guys, Fudruckers.

Well, it's been open for a bit, and I thought that I should jot a few notes about Thor.

First - the service is great. 
You might think, ""Who cares? What about the coffee?""

Well, this is my neighbourhood, and its my neighbourhood coffee shop. 
I want good service.

The owners know their customers and remember them ... when they walk in the door, their orders and names are remembered.

Second - the coffee is great.
I have been trying different single-origin espressos during each visit.
They use a Slayer Espresso machine. 
Top notch. 
Great crema.
Great pour.
Interesting flavour profiles on their coffee - not what you might expect from a shot of espresso!

i don't drink lattes, but the barista (Patrick) can steam milk like a champ. His milk pouring is seamless, smooth and artistic. The foam is creamy and micro.

All in all - Thor rocks. 
Great job!",2011-02-21 05:43:16

Yes, I understand that the register is ringing them up that way and repeating that 2x doesn't make it ok.  Sometimes it's how you handle a situation that makes all the difference.

Located on the second floor of this building on Bloor, Museum Tavern has a really classic, old timey tavern vibe. There's a small patio out front, and lots of half booth half chair seating on the inside.

Service is really good. The host was very friendly, and our waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu and provided some fantastic recommendations.

With some Johnny Cash in the background, we scoured through the delicious looking menu to make our choices:

For my cocktail I had the ""Pina Kaluha"" - exactly what it sounds like: like a Pina Colada but made with Kaluha, though it was served sort of like an alcoholic snow cone. It was pretty good, though I felt it could have used a bit more booze and a bit less snow. By the time I was finished, there was A LOT of ice chips left that didn't seem to soak up the drink, so when I nibbled on the icy slush it just tasted like ice.

For food I had the pierogies. I was a bit hesitant to get them at first, thinking that it might not be enough for a meal (they were on the starters menu, and most pierogies are a fairly small size) but Oh. My. Gosh. These were the monster of all pierogies. They were about the size of a medium sized Empanada, and it came with 4 of them. The pierogie dough was delicious, and it was stuffed with mushrooms, served on a bed of carmelized onions and crispy boar belly, with a side of sour cream. Fantastic and filling. I was happy I ended up ordering them!

I tried out the Salted Caramel Blondie for dessert. The Blondie was good, but VERY sweet. It comes with 3 small-medium sized Blondie's, and I only ate one. It kind of reminded me of a maple fudge, almost. The Blondie came with yummy toffee brittle, and some incredible popcorn ice cream. I wasn't sure what I was going to think of the ice cream, but in my opinion, it was the best thing on the plate! I want a whole bucket of that stuff at home! Yummm.

The bill was kind of weird - it came standard with the price + tax on the bill, but when I paid cash, the server automatically took the tip out when she gave me my change, which I thought a bit odd? Usually if they auto take gratuity the 15/18/etc % will be on your bill so you know how much you are tipping.

Anyhow, a really pleasant experience and there was so much on the menu that looked awesome I know I will be back. Definitely worth checking out if you want to step outside the typical tavern fare.",2013-07-25 15:22:46

VDKgvdgdd-Tmbhk2sV0-bA,oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,4,0,1,0,"Came here this past Sunday with my husband and Andrew C. We would've went earlier but worked all week so Sunday was my only day off. We all got invited to their Pre-Opening event, which means they were generous enough to gift us with a meal. We have been waiting for Sanuki to open ever since August and boy has it been a long wait. We booked our reservation for 1200PM - 100PM. 

We got there a little bit after 1200PM and there was a line out the door. According to the associate, it was going to be a half an hour wait, which we already anticipated. One of our friends was there earlier for his 1100AM reservation and he said the kitchen was backed up. The kitchen couldn't keep up with the volume but that's also to be expected. They are in their pre-opening so they're all trying to get the hang of working in an extremely busy establishment. 

I love the layout of the restaurant. It reminds me of the udon places that I've visited in Japan and Hawaii. It's slightly different than your usual American restaurant. It runs on a cafeteria system. You grab a tray, tell them what kind of udon you want, they give that to you, then you move along to the area where all the tempura is at. You get to put whatever you want on your plate and in the end, you get rung up based on what you have on your tray. So it isn't table service so please don't complain that you had to stand and get your own food. 

As an invited guest, we were allowed one udon, one mini rice, and two tempura items. With the Yelp check in offer, we also got a free drink. Unfortunately, because we came at the later end of their pre-opening, we missed some opportunities. One of our yelp friends got to order whatever he wanted when he went on their first pre-opening date. But that is fine. I'm not a huge eater -- one bowl is enough. It just sucks when things are not consistent through the same event.

We probably chose the wrong date to go regardless because they did not have the clam udon that day, which was my first choice. Not only that but by the time we were able to order, they had ran out of egg. The eggs they used are imported from Japan so they are much cleaner and safer to eat when the yolk is raw. It's understandable that they ran out but laaaaaaame, my second choice was now out the door. I ended up going with the kitsune udon, which is sweet deep fried tofu with udon. For my mini bowl, I went with the miso garlic pork belly. As for my tempura choices, I went with the sweet potato and shrimp tempura. I also grabbed a mentai (spicy cod roe) onigiri. 

For their drinks, they have a drink station, which is pretty awesome. You get to choose between their signature lemonade, ice teas, or create your own drink in their coke machine. I ended choosing their lemonade and I'm glad I did. Their lemonade was not super diabetic sweet. It was light and a little tangy. I definitely recommend getting that. 

Their udon is okay -- it was a little more overcooked than I would've liked. I prefer a firmer texture to my udon and it is quite disappointing that Sanuki did not reach that level of firmness. Perhaps it was too busy and it messed up their mojo but one of my friends that went on Saturday said he had the same issue with the firmness. Also, their soup base was luke warm by the time I actually ate it. I don't know if their broth just isn't hot enough or they just took way too long with my order. I like my soup steaming, please.

I also got to try my friend's mentai cream udon. It was fantastic. You can tell that they use super fresh ingredients because it's not fishy at all. I've had the mentai udon at Monzo and it wasn't as good and I've had a mentai cream spaghetti at another place but it was fishy. Good job, Sanuki. Let's hope you keep that freshness level up. 

The tempura is decent as well. I just wished they had yam tempura or maybe an egg tempura. But who knows, maybe they had it and ran out. They do not refill the onigiris if they run out because they don't want to waste anything by over-making. They also like to keep things really fresh. As for the pork belly bowl -- I really wished that they cut the pork belly into pieces instead of giving me strips. I was only so-so on it. I did not even finish this but it's partially because I was too full. 

Their prices are fantastic. Out of all the udon establishments that we have in Vegas, Sanuki is probably the cheapest. Plus during their pre-opening event, you get 30% off everything!

Overall, I would definitely be back. But if they can stop overcooking their udon and give me steaming/piping hot broth then they'd be perfect (almost) all around.",2017-11-21 04:04:16

I loved the restaurant itself! the decor/ambience was really nice. The staff were all friendly and helpful. 

The bread was very nice and the olive tapenade was divine. I would return just to eat more of that delicious olive spread! We ordered the duet appetizer which was stuffed mushrooms and meatballs. Both were great!

Our main courses were the rigatoni, veal picatta, and chicken picatta. The rigatoni and the chicken were great. The veal was only ok.  I personally was not impressed with the picatta sauce. We each upgraded to a different salad, but all agreed we wouldn't do so next time.

Dessert was spumoni ice cream cake and it was great!

Firstly, I hoped that maybe they would somehow begin to try to clean up their act a bit. Maybe upper management would swoop in and get the store back on track. Something. Secondly, I think the staff would be the kind to make me think twice about giving feedback. 

I went about five times a week for 10 weeks out of pure convenience. There really aren't a whole lot of options for coffee in the area, and it's the only sbux for a few miles.

I know I have certain expectations when it comes to any and all Starbucks. The brand itself has well-known standards. Quick, friendly, accurate (except for name-spelling, of course), and clean. Nine times out of ten, I'm impressed with the level of cleanliness and attention to detail behind the counter. This is not the case at this location, by any means. 

Quick? Nope. I love the app, with the order function. The app tells you, normally, that it'll be 4-7 minutes at any other location. This one regularly says 7-10 minutes. Okay, maybe it's a busy location. The drive thru usually has a half dozen cars at most times of the day, true, but the lobby...? Not so much. Sometimes, all the tables and lounge chairs are taken. Sometimes. Even with the 10 minute expectation, I regularly wait an additional 5-10 minutes. There are even times when I don't use the app, in hopes that they will pay attention to my order if I order it in-store, and they still take a ridiculously long time making any drinks. 

On a side note, their location will tell you that they are out of a product on the app, but you see people ordering it in the store. I brought it to the attention of the manager twice, and she couldn't figure it out. It went unresolved. For 10 weeks. 

Friendly. Sometimes, a new face would be smiling and seem happy to be there. It doesn't take long for the new hires to adopt the surly, impatient attitude of the staff there. One thing is that the manager always seems to be present. Standing against the counter, behind the pastry case, gossiping with her staff. I've never seen her actually handle a guest outside of a complaint (and there seems to be many there, daily), nor have I seen her make a drink (even when there are cups lined up at the espresso machines with no employee actually making any drinks - and hat happens often), or anything else that would suggest that she knows how to work in a cafe. 

Accurate? Ask them to make a Toasted Coconut Cold Brew. That is, if they actually have Cold Brew. They run out of many products regularly. I love waking in after ordering ahead to find my empty cup sitting on the counter and I have to wait five minutes to be acknowledged. Really, I love it. It's the best. 

Clean. Now this one really chaps my hide. Yeah, I said it. This location is disgusting. The spilled coffee stains all over the counter that have obviously been sitting there awhile because it's starting to congeal is a regular guest star at the pick up counter. The self-serve are is always a disaster area, littered with trash, spilled milk and cream, sugar packet emptied all over the counter, and the trash over-flowing, even when it's slow. Their work area is cluttered and in serious need of deep cleaning action. I wonder how long since it's been since their last health inspection. 

In short (lol), this place is in serious need of help. Their management staff clearly doesn't have it together. The staff morale, alone, can tell you that. They're lucky that they have the brand backing them, because they wouldn't be drawing any return business on their own. I'm so happy that I won't be going there again.",2017-04-24 14:22:13

The sidewalks are often crowed so just relax and enjoy the journey. In the summer you will often find entrepreneurs on the over crossings selling water. (this is not an authorized activity.) Speaking of winter, it gets really cold in Vegas in the winter...but it is a dry cold. 

Suggestions are City Center, Fountains at Bellagio, Daquri Bar at Coyote Ugly in NYNY. M&M, Coke, Hersheys and anything else that looks interesting. 

During your journey you will likely encounter TimeShare reps wanting to know how long you are in town for. Remember they are just trying to make a living like everyone else, i am always polite and often joke with them. If you are up for a high pressure sales pitch you may want to grab the free show they offer for 3hrs of your time. You will no doubt also encounter the porn slappers. Just keep walking. I ask a police friend why they don't shut them down because prostitution is illegal in Clark County. He said they are not selling prostitution and when you pay the $99 the girl will show up to your room and be offended after you proposition her, storming off. (with your $99...so you do end up getting scr**ed after all.) So just take in the sights, grab an adult beverage (you can drink while walking) and just enjoy yourself.

For those who have any kind of musical, singing and/or dance background....you will enjoy this tremendously. Although my boyfriend who cannot be any further away from any kind of performing arts life enjoyed it a lot more than he thought. The show is an hour and a half but it literally felt like an hour. This is at The Encore Theater. Conveniently close by to the guest parking garage.

There is no intermission but each number moves pretty quickly. No doubt these performers are talented. The general public may not understand how difficult it is to dance with a group. Everyone have to be completely in-sync with one another. My dance teacher would say if a photo was taken of us during our kickline.....our legs better all be at the same height and angle. And if you've seen any photos of these dancers in mid-dance....they are polished as heck! Costumes are gorgeous as well as the backdrops.

They perform a lot of songs the general public will be familiar with. You're the One That I Want, Money, Money, Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better, New York New York, Luck Be a Lady and my personal favorites: Cell Block Tango, All That Jazz and the famous One from The Chorus Line. (*~ohhhh those wonderful dance memories came rushing back!!~*)

When I first heard about the show, I was rather skeptical. I mean, how can you really tie together the best songs of a whole bunch of different broadway plays? I love broadway (grew up in NY), but I also know that a lot of the best songs that I remembered were remembered because of the story of the play, and the climactic feel of them. Take them out of the story, and then just go back to back to back...it just sounded like something that was going to be disjointed and boring.

Wow, was I impressed with how they did it. The transitions were generally nicely narrated by the main singers, and they put together quite a variety of songs and jokes. The singing, the dancing, the music...it was all top notch. World class performances. I was blown away at how great these performers were. There wasn't one misstep, they nailed every single part of it. It gave you the feeling in some scenes that you were truly watching a Broadway play (especially with the main singer...forgot her name...but she was a show stealer).

The biggest problem I had the show was that all of the songs are from old Broadway classics. I'm not sure if this was designed because Mr. Wynn is older and these are his favorites, if the demographic they're targeting is older people, or if they just thought these would be the most well known songs. Many of the songs I could tell what they were from, or had heard them at some point, but not many of them were like a ""wow I want to sing along"" or anything.

I would have loved some newer Broadway excerpts, something like from Wicked. I think this is what will ultimately kill this show. There isn't a huge interest from younger people, and the ones that will be interested will want to see newer more modern Broadway. On that alone I just don't think they'll be able to fill the seats for a long period of time. It's unfortunate because it is just so well done, and the performers are quite frankly breathtaking. Whatever happens though, they will find something else though because they're oozing with talent!",2015-01-26 06:24:01

Buffet had about 4 vegetarian entrees and 1-2 meat entrees, potato pakoras, dessert, and came with freshly made plain or garlic naan.  Not all items were hot, but nearly all were rather tasty.

I watched Anthony Bourdain No Reservation - Shanghai episode the other night and sortly after, a friend and I went just like that, unplanned. So the place looks sketchy like hell like a lot of asian restaurant. You can say that this place must have been a really classy dim sum place when it opened but it's just so freaking outdated. But whatever, Decor only count when the food is ok. In that situation, the dim sums are quite amazing. For any neophyte, dim sums are the Asian version of Tapas. This is a mouthly of VAST BEAUTIFUL FLAVOUR! If you're white they might give you by instinct what I call the «White people's menu». Ask the Dim sum menu when being tabled. The price like any asian joint in Montréal is ridiculous. 2 beers plus food for 3 persons (when we're only 2) and I got away from it for less than 60$ (with a generous tip of course). 
I tried a lot of thing there even the beek tripes which is pretty ok, but I think asian has an acquired taste for chewy stuff. Otherwise my favorite things has the word shrimp or pork in it. They got some sooooooooliiiddd Shrimp Rolls. One tip...one of the waitress.the youngest of their staff (which is not young!) really will help you select if you're not confortable and she look like a person that has been there forever, so have a meal there with an open mind and an empty stomach (yes yes like th chairman say). Last thing: Quick service, cheap, good food, Super huge, great for the family or/and friends. Pretty good for kids too. CLEAN BATHROOM, no Diharia! TMI I know...

Après avoir regarder l'épisode a Shanghai d'Anthony Bourdain: No Reservation, j'ai vraiment eut envie d'essayé les dim sums. Pas longtemps après, un collègue qui terminait en même temps que je commençais mon lunch s'en allait diner rapido chez Rubis Rouge avant d'aller a ses cours. Cet endroit à l'air miteux et comme de nombreux restaurants asiatiques dans le quartier chinois, ça l'air pas propre. Quand on rentre dans ce resto on peut facilement imaginer qu'à son ouverture, ça devait être un palace de luxe dans un monde relativement pauvre. À mon humble avis, le décor compte seulement si la bouffe est moyenne ou ordinaire.  Pour les néophytes, le Dim sums est le Tapas asiatique. C'est une petite bouchée de SAVEURS EXTRAORDINAIRE Si à l'arrivée on vous donne un menu, vous verrez que c'est un menu qui n'a aucun Dim Sum, j'pense que c'est le Menu des Blancs. Un genre de réflexe de donner le menu de la bouffe qu'on mange. Enfin, comme tous bon resto dans le quartier chinois, c'est la découverte d'une aubaine! Pas plus de 60$ pour 2 avec 2 bières et un repas pour 3 avec un bon pourboire en plus. 

J'ai essayé plusieurs trucs jusqu'à date et même les tripes de boeufs. Pas mal caoutchouteux  mais je crois que c'est un goût acquis chez les asiatiques, la textures est très présente.  Un des meilleurs plats pour moi contient le mot crevettes. Les rouleaux aux crevettes sont géniales;  très généreux en crevettes. Tous ce qui contient porc et crevettes chez Rubis Rouge m'ont vraiment plus.  

Si vous y allez, une des serveuses relativement jeune par rapport à la moyenne d'âge des employés, est vraiment bonne pour re-diriger votre commande s'il y a une incertitude dans la façon de commander. Si vous recherchez un bon plat, elle vous recommandera avec une franchise anti-corporative agréable. (elle n'aime pas un truc, elle le dit!). Le but c'est vraiment d'y aller avec une ouverture d'esprit et un bon appétit. Petits dernier détails: le service est rapide, et c'est peu cher. Les toilettes sont macculées! Propres! J'n'ai pas eut de problème digestifs après un bon lunch là-bas, donc pour moi, c'est un resto propre.",2011-10-08 05:52:09

1) Caesar salad: It's like any other Caesar salad but you can taste a hint of anchovies in this one.  The romaine they used was fresh & crisp and the sauce wasn't overwhelming.  There was also a good amount of ""tartness"" to the sauce. 

2) Oyster Rockefeller: I've eaten this dish twice.  You get 3 in one order and it is delicious!  Bacon makes everything great and their oyster is a fair size as well.  Their sauce is also just right - not too salty, not too bland. 

3) Crab cakes: I probably am just not a fan of horseradish but I found the taste of the horseradish way too overpowering in this crab cake.  I wasn't a fan of those but from other Yelpers here, it seems like it's a pretty popular dish so it may just be me. 

4) Tuna tartare: The tuna is fresh but the tartare was just okay.  It wasn't horrible but I wouldn't say it's the best tartare I've had.  The sauce was a bit too bland for my liking. 

5) Lobster bisque: I've gone to their store before and tried their canned version they have in store and it was horrible so I was a little scared to try this one.  However, I am glad I did!  The lobster bisque here is not too salty and not too bland.  There is a very strong lobster taste and there are even chunks of lobster in there.  I was one happy gal drinking that soup!

6) Seafood mixed grill: This plate really isn't that small.  It has one whole piece of salmon filet, 3 scallops, and 3 tiger shrimps.  I am not a scallop eater but the other two fish were very fresh and delicious.  I wish the tiger shrimp was a little more buttery.  Apparently the scallops are made to perfection - not overdone but not chewy and raw.  It comes with a quinoa & mixed grilled vegetable side but if you want mashed potatoes, they can do that instead. 

7) Grilled butterfield seabream: This is DELICIOUS.  For those of you who are not afraid of bones in fish, you MUST try this one.  I can go on and on and on about this dish but I definitely will be getting this again.  The sea bream is extremely fresh and you can taste the fish but it's no an overpowering type of taste.  It is indeed buttery and sprinkled with some lemon juice, it was one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had. 

Overall, my experience at Diana's thus far has been great.  I've only gone to the restaurant twice but both times, the service has been good and the food has been good as well.  I'd definitely be going back.",2013-04-01 00:30:23

I came here on a Friday night and while there were many patrons, the space was reasonably sized so my large group didn't have to wait around for open seats. We ordered the AleWorks wings and the cheese curds as snacks. The food was the bomb and I would even consider coming back just for the food. The Aleworks wing sauce was a combination of sweet and spicy and it was such a wonderful complement to the wings. The cheese curds were crispy on the outside and melty on the inside. My favorite part of the cheese curds was the light flavoring in the batter that made them perfect without any dipping sauce. However, dipped in ranch elevated them to another level! I also very much enjoyed my drinks and love that they serve other local beverages (cider/mead/cocktails) and not just the beers they brew.

The glaze had a little kick, nothing crazy, and was very flavorful. Tasty wings!

Our table was given two types of pizza. The Calabrese (meatball, Italian sausage, prosciutto cotto, mozzarella, and chili with salsa verde) and the Verdure (zucchini, eggplant, artichoke, mushrooms & spinach with pecorino, mozzarella). I loved the different meats on the Calabrese and the nice spice from the salsa verde. Delicious. The Vendure had such a great selection of vegetables for an unique Vegetarian pizza. I also really liked the crust on their pizzas; nice chew and I love the flavor from the brick oven.

We decided to have a dim sum lunch here on a Sunday with relatives -10 people at this table! 

Their dim sum was actually pricey. Do they have specials? We visited here at 11am and left at around 1-2pm... so it was a long lunch but we probably caught the ""morning prices"" because they were expensive!! The prices were, in my opinion, more towards the ""premium dim sum"" side but the food was only average. 

I also thought their menu was quite short! Yes they have the typical shrimp dumplings, pork siu mai, and even the abalone soup dumpling (which was a joke! The abalone was so tiny, I wish they'd just skip it!!). When I go for dim sum at other restaurants, I am able to happily check off at least 10 items... but at Diamond Banquet Hall, for some reason I checked off only 2.. and I handed the menu off to relatives. Maybe I didn't understand the fancy names? Maybe I didn't like that the dishes I'd order were mostly under ""L"" or ""XL""? *

And the service wasn't that great. I'm not sure if one of the floor staff** was new because she seems to know all the staff? But she sure acted like it was her first day! And the people who brought us food were so rude, and I noticed one was rude even to the floor staff. 

MEH. I'm giving this 2 stars because the food wasn't terrible... it was just average. But I wouldn't visit again on my own***

*Dim sum dishes under ""S"" (Small) are cheapest. Items under ""XL"" are the most expensive.

But when I arrive by 1:00 or 1:30 on a Saturday to be told that you are *already* out of the only reason I came to see you (the tomato based seafood chowder), well .. I find that frustrating. It would be less so if it happened once. But now it's happened twice. On two consecutive weekends. I could understand if I was going in really late for the lunch crowd. If they ran out of soup at 3 or 4 in the afternoon, that would be perfectly understandable. But the seafood chowder is only available two days. Maybe I will have to switch and try to make it on Wednesdays since they aren't as busy during the week. Or I will have to go ask for it right AFTER BREAKFAST so I can be assured they won't run out.

Wildflower is my go-to place for lunch at least once/wk. I have never been disappointed with the food. Always delicious. I agree with some who say they need to make sure there is more than one register going at busy times. I have seen long lines waiting for one person to ring everybody else more than once. So I try not to go when they are busy. Yesterday I tried a soup I had never seen on the lineup before. Tomato based seafood chowder. It was To Die For.

Lured in by an unused Groupon we purchased and no desire to grocery shop or cook dinner on a Monday night, my husband and I headed to White Oaks. It was pleasantly packed for a Monday night, which is always a good sign. Other reviewers described it best, as a cozy yet upscale dining experience. Very rustic and quaint. We got a seat next to the fireplace, right by the window overlooking the stream. I'm all about restaurants with great views, and White Oaks didn't disappoint. 

The food was phenomenal, albeit a bit expensive. I probably wouldn't dine here again outside of appetizers or lunch and drinks without a Groupon, but they seem to almost always have a Groupon deal running so that's a non-issue. We got the Pale Ale White Cheddar Cheese Fondue to start. Extremely tasty in and of itself, but what really made the app was the fresh baked Parmesan bread. We must have gone through three baskets of the stuff! My main dish was the Beef Wellington, and in contrast to the reviews on here, mine was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious.

But trust me, when they run out, I'm still coming back! My boyfriend and I are big Mexican food fans (thought not picky about authenticity per say) and we are VERY pleased with 1900!

The chips and salsa are my favorite in town! The salsa isn't chunky, which I actually prefer and it's just the right about of heat. My bf doesn't approve of the salsa, but definitely agrees the chips are legit.

I'm also in love with the refried beans here. I could just eat a plateful of these and be happy! 

1900 has a decent selection of vegetarian options, but they could definitely add more to get more stars from from me. Even so, they are great about adapting their other menu options to become veggie-friendly... like substituting beans or grilled veggies instead of chicken or beef.

My favorite part of menu is the CREATE A COMBO on the back. I usually avoid these sections at most Mexican restaurants, but 1900 is a little swankier so I gave it a go....I was not disappointed!!  You can choose between burritos, chimichangas, enchiladas, hard tacos, soft taco, tamals, or tostadas.  One item is $7.50, two items are $8.50 and three items are $9.50. Since all of these come with a heaping pile of rice and beans... this is an excellent deal!  My favorite by far is the CHIMICHANGA! Holy moly these things are amazing! Especially since they let me substitute the meat for those glorious refried beans.

My boyfriend loves the soft tacos here. He's so happy that they come with 2 tortillas to make them extra durable and hearty. He tried the chicken, beef, and pork until he settled on the pork being his favorite and that's all he orders now.

On a final note, I really enjoy the atmosphere at 1900. It's not your typical kitschy Mexican decor, but has enough flare with aztec art and prayer candles that it's got a definite style. The restaurant is neutral enough so that you can dress super casual in yoga pants and a tee or dress up classy with a cocktail dress and heels.",2012-04-13 15:02:56

We both ordered steak, which comes with a salad. We both opted for Caesar.  It was a very large portion, but lacking in flavor.  My filet was cooked properly, and the bourbon peppercorn sauce added a nice kick.  The porterhouse did not get such gleaming reviews.  

The brussels sprouts were undercooked, but I have to say that the bacon pieces were delicious. The mushrooms were good, but I agree with another reviewer who said they were quite salty.

The trend of style over substance at newer bars has been disappointing, and I'm happy to see that Velveteen Rabbit offers such a strong cocktail menu.  It's been a while since I've seen a drink menu that makes me feel like I have to try everything on it; after a couple visits I have three more left to try, and I can't wait.

The Crucifix in a Deathhand is by far my favorite on their menu.  It's a complex drink where almost every sip offered different flavors.  Highly recommend ordering this drink first, so that your tastebuds aren't dulled from drinking too much early on.  It's fantastic, and if you don't agree I'll gladly finish yours for you.  The other highlight for me was the Improved Whiskey Sour.  Since most every bar uses premade sour mix, it's not hard to improve on a whiskey sour; Velveteen Rabbit does better than that and uses cherry, lemon and cinammon flavors to round out the cocktail.  A real treat, easy to sip and probably more appealing to a wider range of palates than the Crucifix.

Velveteen Rabbit is easily accessible, with street parking and a small private lot available.  Same drinks made by different bartenders were consistent.  No bouncer hovering around the front door.

The overall ambiance had a casual charm that made the dining experience fun and pleasant. The menu offers a wide assortment of ""Canadian comfort food"", an intriguing concept to me because my knowledge of Canadian cuisine is limited to poutines and beaver tails. 

I sipped on a mighty canuck cocktail while waiting for food to come. While the drink itself was quite tasty, it was a bad idea to drink on an empty stomach. 

Now onto the food:

BBQ chicken + tortilla soup- hearty and full of smokey flavours! The soup was so thick with thicken taht it was more of a chilli than a soup, and the crispy tortilla strips added a nice crunchy texture

Bannock caesar- quite satisfying with a generous splatter of cheese. The substitution of traditional croutons with bannock was an innovative twist to a very commonplace salad.

Bannock bannock- house-smoked salmon, onion, cumin, and cream cheese. The flavours were well-balanced, with the tangy pickled onions contrasting the smokiness of the salmon. The bannock itself was slightly spongy, like a naan bread. Overall, this was delicious and I would order it again.

Pickerel taco- caviar tartar and a side of cucumber apple salad. We expected a crispy taco shell, but instead the taco was very spongy and soft, like a Chinese steamed bun. From the bite I had, this was also quite delicious and my friend really enjoyed it. One complaint was that I wished there was more filling to go with that spongy, bun-like taco shell. 

Boneless back rib burger- smokey tomato jam and maple mustard bbq. I ended up eating most of this even though it was my boyfriend's order. The back rib patty was moist and flavourful, and the smokey tomato jam really added a sweet and tangy kick to the burger. I enjoyed it immensely.

St-Canut pulled pork tourtière- honey roots, greens, and heinz ketchup. I wasn't wowed by it in any sense, although the flavours were good and the pastry was nicely done. It was a little too meat-heavy for my liking, but I imagine meat-lovers would really enjoy it. I actually preferred eating it by itself rather than with the ketchup. 

Canoe fireweed butter tart- ridiculously yummy! The pastry shell was perfectly flaky and the maple syrup-infused filling was super gooey and rich. It's a winning combination and a fabulous end to an amazing meal. I highly recommend sharing one as it is quite rich.

It is a kind of tucked away place on 7th Ave and McDowell. If you can believe it, it is located on top of a Pei Wei. When you go it does feel like you are in on some sort of secret. 

The parking for this place is ample. Although, the walk to and from the bar can be a little treacherous as there has been puddles on the way back every time. At least one person goes shin deep each time. 

The ambiance is a very cool, hip one. There are plenty of couches and chairs, along with some larger tables. The bar area has several high tops. Seating at the bar is available also. The seats are just at a premium. There is music playing all the time, but it is not so loud that you can't have a conversation with the few people sitting around you. 

I have only had beer, so I am unsure of the mixed drink prices. There beer selection is pretty extensive. Being a skunky beer lover, I usual go with Stella or Pilsner Urquell.

I only liked 2 of the sauces which is the biggest part of fondue. I ordered the signature which came with chicken, beef, & shrimp. I had the oil to cook in which came with 2 types of tempura. I was not crazy about either one. Most of it got burned in the oil and stuck to my cooking utensil. The best part for me was stuffing the mushrooms with green goddess sauce & frying them at the waitresses suggestion. Other than that all the meats were pretty bland.

I had the Wisconsin cheese fondue. There was something about the smell & the consistency that I found off putting. Even now I can smell it & it's not a good thing. It was way too mushy for me & I wish now I would hv sent it back. 

Desert was okay. I can't remember the kind of chocolate but it was lit on fire at the table. That was pretty cool. It had some type of nut in it. It was difficult to pick up the nuts and the different sweets on the dipping utensil at the same time. Just imagine picking up nuts with a tiny 2 prong fork. I just ended up dipping the treats & eating the nuts after with an actual fork.

The decor is very nice but that's not that important to me. For me, it's about the food. I've had some great food from some hole in the wall spots but for the cost of the food here I expected lots more.

But alas, I still find myself there because it's really close to work and the you can't beat the prices. Marc's is just so damn cheap which is good because I'm pretty damn cheap too. There usually isn't anything wrong with the quality of their groceries and I get a kick out of browsing the close-outs, but there is just something about the Marc's shopping experience that makes me crazy. 

First of all, if you go to the store for 10 things there is a good chance they will only carry about 6 of them. They have the most inconsistent inventory ever. They employ a lot of High School kids.... I'll just leave it at that when describing the customer service. But the absolute worst part is check out. Previously mentioned under-age employees can't ring up their own alcohol so you often have to wait for a manager to come scan it for them. They accept cash, check, EBT and Discover... which means slow moving lines and more manager-approval wait time. Not to mention there always seems to be approximately 3 lanes open during peak hours. And what the hell is up with their bags??? I usually try to be a good citizen and bring my own reusable bags but when I happen to forget them their bags are so thin that they usually have to double or triple them up. How is that cost saving? Search me.

In sum, Marcs--the necessary evil for the cheapskate shopper like me. I will continue to moan and groan but I will enjoy saving money on the basics.",2015-09-28 00:01:55

Duff's is a legend back in Buffalo and this place pays homage to the original back in Amherst not very far from where I've bought numerous sets of tires at Dunn Tire.  I've never been to the original though, never and as far as Buffalo goes I've only been to the Anchor original once.  My impression of the Anchor was that is wasn't that great.  Perhaps my expectations were higher because of the name but really nothing stood out as superb regardless of them being the original or not.

Duff's I've seen win against the Anchor on Food Wars so since each has their following I figure I should try Duff's.  We have numerous locations for both Anchor and Duff's in the GTA so although this isn't the original I'm guessing they go by the same standards and recipes.

We went to the place on a Thursday (March 22) and I have to say the place was packed, packed and noisy, very noisy.  I found ourselves having to almost scream to talk.  I was amazed how noisy it was inside.  I get it though it's a sports bar with wings and beer.  That is like a magnet for sports loving men like me.  Honestly I just wanted to eat there and try their chicken.  My friend Monica was taking us out for an early birthday dinner for me and it was a short walk from their place.

My wife ordered lemon pepper and I had asked for the hot.  The menu says something to the effect that mild is medium, medium is hot and hot is very hot.  That's sort of a subjective statement but I suppose if you're going by what others out there consider to be mild, medium and hot I guess that's one way to measure.  I still went with their hot but not death or the even hotter because I want to gauge how it is first.  I'm necessarily looking for the hottest wings although I like a hot bite from time to time.  

The hot wasn't really hot for me but it definitely had a decent sting to it.  I could have gone hotter but it wasn't really necessary.  I liked the flavor and the chicken.  The drums portions of the wings were large but the flats portions seems almost disproportionate to the size of the drums.  I'd expect bigger flats with larger drums on split wings.  I could be mistaken but it was my observation.  I've eaten a lot of fried chicken in my life to know.  I'm guessing roaster wings but again, larger drums to flats but it could have just been our batch.  Being large and by the pound don't expect more than a bowl for a pound which is about 8 large pieces.  The wings were naked, and sauced quite well.  The sauce was not conservative by any means on the hot wings.  The tang and smell was great, not too much of a vinegar tang but a saucy sting.  

Gauging the hot being the way it was I'm happy I didn't order medium because I think their hot for me is in the Goldilocks zone.  I like my wings just about what they served as hot.  Any hotter would have been fine but the flavor was great.  

Along with the wings they give generous servings of both dill and blue cheese along with veg to dip. We also had their fried pickles and mac and cheese bites.  Both were good but the star of this place is their wings.  Big, meaty sauced and tasty.  I had one honey garlic to try and it was also good.  I'd be interested to try other flavors.  The dry ones like what my wife had (lemon pepper) were also very good.  Usually when I eat a lot of wings I like to have a variety of both sauced and dry.

The appetizers were good, the wings were better than just good.  The roasters alone is something you won't see as commonly used and while Duff's may be famous I can safely say they're much more satisfying and in my overall opinion they're just better than what the Anchor has to offer.

The only downside to this place is that it can be rather loud.  I'm assuming it would be even worse during a Leafs game or some other hometown game.",2018-03-27 00:57:41

WHERE: #140 Downtown!

WHEN: They are open everyday at 4pm.

WHAT: Due to the fact that I am uncultured when it comes to Downtown Las Vegas, my friend decided to take me on a date to hit up all the cool spots in Downtown Las Vegas! During our date, this was our last spot. I guess it's true when they say ""SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST"" because this was definitely an out of this city experience.

When you find the bar and walk in, it looks a little intimidating, but DON'T BE FOOLED! As soon as we walked in, I fell in love with everything in there! The bar is inspired by Prague's Strahov Monastery Library, and is absolutely gorgeous! The wall is made of bookshelves with actual books (somewhat like the Library Bar in Los Angeles), the sofas and seats make me feel as if I have left Las Vegas for the night, and the drinks were all so unique, and ones you wouldn't find at your local Las Vegas nightclub.

I tried The Lady Sylvia because I'm a nerd, but it is now one of my favorite drinks! It has a citrus taste to it, and will make you feel like dancing!! =)

NOTE: This place is a smoke-free environment though, so smoke outside before you come inside!

To conclude: If one night you and your friends are bored, make a scavenger hunt out of it and try to find THE LADY SYLVIA. The only clue I leave with you is the number 140. ;) You can do it! =D",2013-12-11 03:49:44

I ordered a Popeye bowl because I wanted something with some greens.  The color was a little off putting, but the flavor was fantastic. For those who don't know, Acai bowls are much like ice cream or frozen yogurt in consistency. I switched the apple juice this bowl is usually prepared with for coconut milk (made in-house) which gave a really creamy consistency although I didn't notice a coconut flavor. My only complaint is that there wasn't more granola! That stuff is delicious! Next time I want to customize my bowl with different toppings, and I think I'll need to try a juice soon.

How many mechanics say that?  They just take your money PERIOD and fix it, even if it's not worth it. Hamid and Victor had my car diagnosed within an hour.  They gave me a list of immediate fixes and then some things that can be fixed down the line, no pressure to fix those.  I left it Friday afternoon.  They offered me a ride home, which I did not need and told me they would call me Saturday which they did.  I went to pick my car up and no sooner than I got on Spring Mountain my light came back on.  I turned right around and Hamid was so apologetic.  He said I could either leave the car and they can have it taken care of Monday (it was almost 6pm) or I could bring it on my lunch break Monday and they would take me back to work.  I got there Monday and Hamid and Victor told me that they know what the problem is and had gotten the part I needed Monday am and to just have a seat and they would have it done in no time.  Victor immediately took my car in and did what he had to do.  He drove it around the block and said that I should be good.  Its been 2 days now and I havent had any problems (knock on wood).

I made reservations a week in advance.
When we got there at 7p right on time, they told us a 20 minute wait, huh?
After 20 minutes our buzzer thing went off and they said, 'your table of 8 is ready', huh? I said six, right?

After another 10 minute wait we finally got seated. Of course, no one apologized or made any effort for a concession.  

I'm not going to go over board like so many others have on their review.
The  concept they have is nothing new. It's the same thing as the 'dim sum' concept except for meat eaters.

I liked that they remembered my son's birthday, had a cake and sang happy birthday in Portuguese.

I also, like the complimentary valet parking.

We were looking for MJ who lives on the top floor but no sighting this time.
Oh yeah, the check for six was $305.00, we had a few crown and sodas.
The usual price per person with tax is $44.00; that includes the salad bar. Pay attention to your check as they add an 18% gratuity.

I would def recommend you go with the top sirloin, it's a choice cut and has the best flavor.

Bear in mind there are a million other Thai spots on the street. So choosing this one was strictly based of Yelp reviews. Man am I glad we listened.

Walked in and first thing you see is a gorgeous stream of water running down a mirrored wall. At night it's beautiful and adds flair as you walk in. We were immediately greeted and sat. Restaurant wasn't too busy but again it was early dinner. I don't mind when it's slower because my food is faster and always tastes better. 

We ordered our drinks and appetizers off the bat. We got and order of crab rangoons and a platter which consisted of chicken satay, spring rolls, crab Rangoons and pork dumplings. Each having their own sauce to dip in such as sweet and sour and peanut sauce. Best satay I have had in a LONG time. Spring rolls weren't my favorite but everything else was good for an app.

Our server came to take our order. He didn't write it down but spoke it back to us perfectly. Food came out staggered with entrees. I think they thought we were doing family style which we were not. So my meal came about 5 minutes later.

The staff seems to work as a team because I had about 4 different people waiting on us from order taking, to bussing, to drink refills. Team work makes it work better. I didn't sit there waiting for anything because someone was always around.

I obviously ordered Pad Thai. As we all know on here that's like all I get. Their spice meter is all over the place. I can handle spice and the 2 was a lot. For me it tasted great. For some at the table it was TOOOO hot and that was just a 2 out of 10.
Pad Thai was great. Didn't have too many peanuts which I like an abundance of. I actually added pineapple to it and it made it even better. Try it next time you get pad Thai. All meals were large and can be split for two or good for take home left overs.

We all saw fried bananas on the menu so you KNEW that was happening. Came out at a good time. Not overly battered and very warm. The bananas were very tasty. I thought it was a caramel sauce on it but it was honey and I hate honey so I had to eat around it :( we had ours served with mango and coconut ice cream.

I was so very wrong...she was so kind and so patient...counted it out and then told him he needed a few cents more so he gave her a dime and then she said, now I owe you a penny...with a big smile on her face. I am sad to say that her behavior just shocked me....I am so used to everyone being rushed and treated rudely...it has become so commonplace...as though we have to pay to be treated like decent human beings...and here this man paid for his coffee and food with change and was treated with extreme patience and kindness.

We stumbled by chance that night upon a Charlotte Film Society meeting centering on the same film, so were treated to some extra perks like an aftershow talk-back with a notable guest speaker and some swag giveaways (woohoo!). $2 popcorn was also a fun bonus, and a step back into yesteryear. 

The theater is small, and perhaps not so...ergonomically laid out as newer/larger arenas, but the service was topnotch and really friendly - as another Yelper said, from ticket window to concessions and everywhere in between, everyone was great - none of that bored, mumbling, GOD-I-can't-wait-to-leave attitude you get from some places.

Prior to stepping foot in this establishment, I always wondered how Kirei stayed open because it always looked dark and empty inside during dinner time! I must admit that the darkness in fact kept me away from trying them for a while... but I've gotten over my skepticism and dined there a few times since. Kirei might not be my top choice but I would not unfriend you if you suggested to go there. The self-confessed sushi snob in me of course frowns because they are not authentic Japanese, but hey, I've finally started to accept that I live in Toronto and not Vancouver or Japan! This is adaptation at work, guys, check it.

They have a daily special consisting of some kind of drink/roll/sushi. I can't give you the whole range because it so happens that everytime I go in it is a drink + salmon sushi/sashimi for $6. Not bad! Servers are friendly and attentive. Food comes up at a decent pace. I don't think it's an especially inexpensive place to dine but I think that comes with the territory of edging the financial district and St Lawrence Market.

And yes, sometimes we get so lazy that we do order takeout from them as well (party tray take out date night for two... whaaaattt!!! don't judge). Fish quality is alright, the assortment is nice, price is fair, and they are quick. I would recommend that the next time one of you folks dropped the ball on your turn to cook and want to not be in the dog house ;)

He thoroughly went through the appetizers and we had the stuffed peppers, zucchini planks and eggplant parm. All were tasty!

For my meal I went with the margarita pizza. It was thin crust and crisp. It was good, not the best I have had but good. Two of my friends had pasta dishes and they were amazing!! So jealous I did not get pasta. One had the gnocchi which had banana peppers and sausage in the sauce. It was the perfect spice. The other had a penne in vodka sauce. I honestly do not even love vodka sauce but this one had such a good strong flavor, I loved it.

First the good: friendly staff, great service, clean dining room, great broth, tender meats. Now for the only negative: the actual Ramen/noodles were on the generic side. Their noodles are worlds better than dry, instant Ramen, but only as good as a Hawaiian Saimin from a Takeout Joint not known for Ramen or Saimin. I wish they had better, fresher Noodles, because their broth & the rest of their ingredients are actually very good. I grew up in Hawaii, eating all kinds of Ramen & Saimin & Spent 5 weeks on vacation in Tokyo, Japan..... where everything is so expensive...... Everything that is, except Ramen! I ate so much Ramen in Tokyo & life was so good! Most bowls coming in at around $5 USD. For the record, I had a Takeout bowl of Beef Stew Ramen & maybe, I should have Microwaved the Broth & Noodles to get the whole bowl, steaming HOT. Takeout is never as good as Eat In. Next time I have to try their Miso Ramen. I normally make my own, using the Refrigerated Miso Ramen packs I get from the 99 Ranch Store in Chinatown & adding extra Miso Paste..... a Takeout box of Char Siu, that I slice thin & layer on top of the soup, makes it a real meal.

(note to those not familiar with dim sum - go with a medium sized group, about 4-6 people).  the dim sum is decent and not shockingly, a bit greasy. 

recommended dishes: ha gao (shrimp dumpling), siu mai (pork/shrimp dumpling), steamed cha siu bao (a bbq pork bun), cha siu or shrimp cheung fun (bbq pork or shrimp wrapped in steamed wide, flat rice noodles), gai lan (chinese dark green vegetable), don tot (egg custard tart), lo-bak-go (pan friend turnip cake), and the steamed black bean spare ribs. the calamari is pretty good here, and they have pan friend shrimp/chive dumplings, which are my fave.

Arrival and check in were relatively easy. The taxi/Uber drop off point is fairly close to check-in. That is not always the case in Las Vegas so it is a nice plus. The line at check-in moved fairly well and the process moved at a decent pace too.

There are plenty of elevators which helps. The appearance once you are off the elevator is lacking though. It feels like you are in a parking garage. The hallway leading to our room were in ok shape, but there was some miscellaneous garbage like a beer can scattered about. Not a crazy amount, but enough to notice. Especially since the beer can was still there the next time we went to our room.

The sleeping area of the room looks ok in passing. The decor has been updated in the last few years I would assume. I do appreciate there is no carpet, as the general lack of cleanliness in other areas would lead me to believe carpet would have been filthy. There is a good amount of space and a lot of windows. We had a decent view of the High Roller. One of the lamps was not working and the outlets were not conveniently located.

The bathroom was a different story. It looks as though it has not been updated since the casino was built. On top of that it looked and felt a little dirty. Everything was in working order at least.

We did not eat at any of the restaurants, so I cannot speak to them. That being said, none of them sounded like anything we wanted to try either. The casino area is ok. There are plenty of tables, including plenty of low minimum tables.

This casino is in a good location on the strip. It is near the center so you can access most of the other casinos fairly easily. It tends to have a decent price so that can be tempting. If budget is your concern I would look elsewhere.",2017-02-12 00:37:49

I was struck by the beauty of the place...everything is so modern and swanky yet industrial.  I just loved the design.  I think it's really awesome that they have free slushies and water for folks who are waiting.  How accommodating!   I also really liked their decor...like their retro Korean movie posters and advertisements.  They had a cool vintage TV in the men's room I just had to check out and I noticed they have free toothbrushes and mouthwash.  Yeah I went into the men's room.  I'm a rebel like that.  

The five of us were seated at a small, round table and we had utensils and banchan all ready for us.   Our host for the evening  wasn't the friendliest and there was a severe language barrier.  One person in our party was accidentally seated in front of the grill controls and she nudged him out of the way.  I thought that was kinda rude...she should have asked him to move.  She wasn't able to answer most questions about the banchan and outright ignored some questions.  She needs a massage or a vacation or something...relax a little bit, lady! 

We got the hobak beef combo for $89.99.  The menu says it feeds 3-4 people and we chose brisket, ribeye, and short ribs, and it also included bean stew, steamed egg, veggies, cheddar cheese, and ice cream for dessert. We were never offered anything to drink besides water.  I realized later that they never brought us the potato pancake that was supposed to come with the meal...no biggie tho.  

I give the food five stars...hands down the BEST Korean food I've ever had. My favorite thing was the brisket with sushi rice and the salad made from bean sprouts.

I do not consider myself a learned connoisseur of Indian food, despite one of my best friend's mother's spoiling me with amazing home-made dishes throughout my College years, but I will say that this place was amazing!

It's a nicely situated space, right on Brilliant Avenue in Aspinwall. Street parking isn't difficult, and it's free after 5, I believe - make sure to check the meters because you don't want a ticket! If it's nice out, sit on the deck; ignore the trains that pass by as they are the price of your enjoyment and to be honest, aren't very frequent. We only had one go by, right in the beginning. The deck is nice, and it's fun to people-watch. Seriously, sit outside and enjoy quaint Aspinwall.

The menu is intimidating has hell, but I bet that folks who know their Indian dishes would feel very comfortable with it. It's like 500 pages long. I still found bliss in it, though. Can't go wrong with some samosas, naan, and chicken tikka masala if you're not yet facile with the huge selection.

Now, your waiters will probably tell you that their portions are reasonable. Don't believe them!! They are lying - the portions are Pittsburgh-sized and will bust your gut! Don't worry if you over-order like we did, though. We took home 3 boxes of that deliciousness! (All kidding aside, they don't try and upsell you or push you into things - they are super nice, and will definitely help you with your selections.)

They do like their spice, so unless you are very experienced, don't go hot! I found everything to be super tasty at the mildest level of heat, but more sensitive eaters might want to have a taste of someone's food before committing. My kids did perfectly well at spice level 1.

Their rice is great, as were all of our dishes - tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, aloo mattar, and chana paneer were awesome. The Samosas are enormous - there's no way a normal human could eat the two that come in one order. Well, maybe Kayser Soze could, but I'm pretty sure they said that Chuck Norris gave up after eating 1.5 because he was so stuffed. Don't eat both - you won't eat your dinner. Trust me.

The naan was delicious - as one might expect. It had a nice mix of char and buttery flavor to it, and was wonderful to use in consuming the delicious choices as we made our way through the meal.

Overall, a flavorful, fun, and good value for a nice night out in Aspinwall. We shall definitely be back - it was great. Oh, and try their mango beverages, too. Delicious! I hear their lunch buffet is insanely good - hmm... will definitely be back for that!!",2017-10-07 18:46:45

Howler's is one of the few places in the East End that consistently host bands to play for a relatively diverse group of people that frequent there. I've been to Howler's quite a few times, and I've never been really impressed with the quality of the bands that play- although I did see a great blue grass band a couple of years ago on New Year's Eve.

Bouchon is what I imagine a typical French bistro to look and feel like. Simple items on the menu, done right. Steak with fries, pan roasted trout, blood sausage, etc. Everything delicious. 

Excellent staff, very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant itself is simple in design, however not so simple in workmanship. The details are just right, coming together and creating an incredible atmosphere and ambiance.

Yelp suggested four new places in my neighborhood and this was one of them.  A pho and banh mi  fix in Ballantyne?  Really, are you sure?  Yes, it's true.  After a trip to the movies, we hustled to the car and headed over to check it out.  I longed to not be disappointed because since moving here from the DC area, I've been longing for more diversity in the food choices and here we are.  I ordered an original banh mi sandwich ($7.00), some spicy beef noodle soup($11.00) and some fried egg rolls($5.00) which were more crispy spring rolls.  Prices do seem to be a bit higher than I'm used to but the banh mi is easily shareable, and the size of the pho along with the amount of meat is good.  Plus, you have to consider that their rent is a bit higher because of the location.
     My two teens didn't order anything but I told them they could try my stuff and decide.  They have jobs, they can pay for their own food. LOL!  The rolls came out right away with the accompanying dipping sauce, followed shortly by the banh mi and boy was it good. Not soon after my steaming bowl of soup came out and mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmm, good!!!  The broth was no nice!  I put my accoutrements in after getting extra mint and jalapeños and dove right in.  Both daughters got up and placed their own orders.  One got the mignon pho and an original banh mi and the other got the crispy egg rolls and the mignon pho.  Very enjoyable and my only complaint is that the jalapeños in my banh mi all seemed to be quite mild and I love the kick of spicy in my sandwich so next time I'll ask that they put extra in with seeds and all.  I have zero complaints about the soup.  I actually ran out of noodles before running out of the tender meat that was swimming in the rich broth.  That has never happened to me before.  I've been eating pho before it was a thing. Twenty plus years ago, I had a Vietnamese roomie and she introduced me to pho and banh mi when they were hard to find and not too many Americans even knew what they were.  I've even made it myself but the beef bone broth is an arduous and long event that entails skill and exacting spice knowledge.  I decided it was easier to just buy it even though mine was quite delicious.  

This is the second place i've had pho since moving to Charlotte just over a year ago and it certainly is my go to spot now for banh mi and pho.  And it's in my hood!! Woohoo!  I really hope this place succeeds and I hope to see more authentic places like this opening up around town.  Charlotte needs some diversity in her food scene.  Check this place out and lets keep it busy.  I hope that they never compromise the quality of the food that they are putting out now.  Oftentimes you see over time, that the quality diminishes along with the portion sizes and then it's no longer the place you fell in love with. Let's hope this doesn't happen with this place.  

Oh, and the service was great. Very friendly, very efficient and we were even given a complimentary grilled chicken banh mi to try.  We left stuffed with our leftovers in hand to enjoy just a few hours later. Yes, I took my broth home because who in their right mind would throw that stuff away?  Add some noodles to it and enjoy another round and if you don't have pho noodles in your cabinet just heat it up and enjoy some tasty hot broth and a sandwich.  Now get in your car and give it a try.

I don't know what they season their potatoes with but my friend and I agreed that they were delicious!  There's some sort of after taste that makes them so yummy.  My only slight complaint were the mimosas.  They say they use fresh squeezed orange juice and it looked freshly squeezed, but maybe they weren't ripe at all??

Many of the products are not in stock and while some of the lines may be due to the company itself (for example Becca x Jaclyn Hill is limited) even the Ulta line is terrible at quantity availability.

3iax1rrbh5PS2UaMN3d1cQ,qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,3,1,0,0,"Finally got around to eating here when I had a friend in town that was curious about the place. As a die-hard rock and roll fan I had been curious about this place for quite some time.

Vince Neil is quite the businessman away from the music world as well, having run bars, strip clubs, concert venues, marketed his own alcohol, and now this restaurant in Circus Circus. I have noticed a lot of negative reviews, and while I would not go out of my way to dine here again, if I ever found myself in Circus Circus, I would definitely return.

I am a rock and roll fan and an author of concert and album reviews, plus self published books of classic rock/hard rock bands, so the decor on the walls of this place instantly won me over. Posters of album covers, guitars, vintage stage outfits, vintage Mark Weiss photographs; the decor and photos alike make this place a rock fan's dream come true. I had to get out of my seat twice just to walk around and take it all in!

When I first arrived there was no host(ess) at the booth, but a man dressed in a suit and tie (presumably a manager) seated us within two minutes of arriving at the door. This guy treated us well, checked up on us often, and definitely deserves credit for his efforts. Sadly, the restaurant was short staffed and we did not see many other employees around for most of the dining experience. The few people we dealt with treated us well, but even when it was time to get the bill I had to get up and actually ask someone to bring it.

The biggest issue I had with dining here was that, upon being given the menu, the server told us ""the entrees are not available at lunch."" So in other words, the good majority of the ""major"" menu items, including several I wanted to try, were not available. Not only would having more of these items available have made for a better dining experience; they also would have gotten more money from me! But seriously, how hard would it be to make a separate lunch menu that at least has SOME of the entree choices?

Music was playing on the speakers/televisions throughout the meal, and not just the hard rock you would expect; there were vintage pop songs as well (Beatles, Michael Jackson, etc.) The manager guy said that the heavier stuff plays later in the evening, and that is understandable enough. There was also a live stage set up, though no live entertainment was playing at the time of our visit.

Contrary to what other reviews have stated, I had no problem with the food whatsoever. I got an order of chicken fingers and fries. The fingers were meaty and crispy, and had no tough meat whatsoever. The fries were very crispy and cooked well. Everything I ate in here was delicious, though I would liked to have been able to taste one of the entrees that are supposedly only available come dinner time.

Overall, my visit to Vince Neil's restaurant was a good one, just not a great one. I am not going to park in the parking garage at Circus Circus and fight my way through the casino again for the purpose of eating here, but if I am in the casino again for any reason, I would be willing to dine their again. If you are visiting Circus Circus or the area anyway, I recommend dining here, just keep your expectations in check. Overall I can give Tatuado a modest recommendation.",2015-04-06 23:12:14

I do want to preface that I've been an Apple user for a while now... switch from the Android platform to a 4S and it was a lifechanger.  Been with apple ever since - I usually drive my phones into the ground so I've only had the ""even"" models... 4S, 6, and now the X.

I digress, long story short... the Apple Store location in SouthPark Mall is being renovated, so I had to make the trek to this location in Northlake.  Due to the other location being renovated, this store has taken the brunt of all the services for the Charlotte area.... hopefully the other location will open soon.

Both locations you couldn't make an appointment, but I would keep trying... I'm sure their appointment system might go back to normal once the other location re-opens.  

I ended up just doing a walk-in.  There was about an estimated 2hr wait just to speak to a genius.  I put my name in the queue and then walked around the mall until I got a text to come back.

My issue wasn't with my phone, but with my airpods... one of them just had trouble connecting (intermittently).  Luckily it was covered under the warranty, and they just swapped it out.  The entire session with my Genius, Steve, was about 20min and he was very enthusiastic and helpful.  Also apologetic, but I'm sure he's run into his fair share of customers that are frustrated with their products.  

I tried to be prepared and wrote my airpods Serial Number on a sticky note ahead of time so that definitely sped up my process.  After a series of questions... I think they collect data so they can improve their next iteration of products and also try to figure out what works... maybe try to avoid some functional issues in the future.

The store location itself, is a good size.  There are store associates up front to ""triage"" the customers coming in to either browse, have service issues, or whatever else needs attention.  They have a pretty good system, I think... yes- the wait time is long, but considering this is the only location in the Charlotte Area now... they are still doing the best they can.

That day I visited, there seemed to be a tech competition happening in the front of the store with some small robots that students built.

I really like the whole idea of the apple store, but I don't really want to hang out in it for longer than I need to- probably me just getting old.  I'm curious to see what the new Southpark location is going to look like and function.",2018-05-01 13:42:40

They also brought over a bread basket but I did not partake.

The service was a little on the over kill side.  They were VERY helpful and asked constantly if there was anything we needed (even if I was mid sentence) but my glass was never empty and the dirty plated were cleared promptly. So to complain about too much service, seems silly.

Staff: This is where I had to knock a star down.

- There wasn't anyone coming in to bus the tables after the drinks were consumed. (luckily the Karaoke crowd was polite and everyone kept the place clean and brought back their glasses and plates to the bar.)

Personal experience:
The bar and restaurant was pretty quiet at the time. I ordered 3 drinks at the bar and proceeded to turn around with my arms full to walk to back into the Karaoke room, during that time my wings showed up as well. Obviously seeing I need help I was told to just drop down the drinks at my table and come back to the bar to pick up the wings. NOTE: (While some folks of the staff was sitting at the bar enjoying red wine. They could have been on break, but I'm not sure if enjoying red wine during work hours is normal.)

I'm not sure what was happening with the lack of service. Maybe the servers were restricted to the restaurant only, maybe they didn't see thesmall Karaoke crowd as profitable, or maybe the red wine at the bar was that good.

The taco tasted great but I was actually expecting two tacos because at the bottom it said that it came with two corn tortillas. Well, they just double wrap them. At $2.59 a pop, they aren't exactly a bargain because they are pretty small. The black and gold burrito was just okay. It looked good in the picture, but it's catered to American hicks apparently because the gold part is not 'melted cheese' but synthetic cheese whiz. It was also a little on the dry side. However, they use -grilled chicken- instead of shredded chicken which automatically makes it a little higher quality and tastier. It was a little smaller than I thought it was going to be though.

Service was essentially non-existent because my server didn't come back until she had the bill because the place was pretty busy. She was nice though and kept calling me hun (the classic waitress tip booster).

The store front is pretty small, so you may miss it if you aren't paying attention. The interior decor is reasonable. Overall, I think this is a decent place and will eat here again in the future.

I am not here for the girls and I know it is just a little awkward for them to wear that ""uniform"" for work that makes Moxie's waitress uniform looks conservative. But the draft beer selection is the best in the area.

I don't mind being surrounded by monitors of all sizes and I do enjoy watching sport games with a beer or 2 with friends.

Suggestion: They really need written down list of what beers they have on draft on a chalkboard or whatever. This is just not professional when the wait staff does not even know what they have?!

We went for The Hangover 2 premier Wednesday night at midnight (5/26). We showed up trying to get seats for 4 people 40 minutes prior to the showtime, and being the premier for this particular movie, seats were hard to come by. We sat in the handicap row, (come on, it was midnight, if anybody showed up asking for the seats we would have obliged and moved) and with all that leg room we were happy we didn't show up 30 minutes ahead of time and have to sit way up front.

The theaters I have been in have all been pretty clean, the sound is very good, the seats are comfortable, it's close to home, and the price is better than any other theater I've been to in town. What more can I ask for?
I also love that I can get a big brown bag of candy and sweets, have it weighed at the cashier and pay way less than the pre-packaged stuff. I love reese's pieces and I usually get about $6-7 worth and snack on the bag for about 10 days :)

One day, I realized that if you ask for ""everything"" on your sub, it means only about half of what they have and you have to ask for everything you want individually. 

At this location, I asked for ""all freebies except sprouts and cucumbers"" which includes lettuce, tomato, onion, and something else. ""all sauce"" which includes mayo, mustard, and oil and vinegar. I then asked to add hot peppers.

When I got my sandwich, it had sprouts on it, no hot peppers, and no sauce. hmmmm

The second trip in, I just said I want everything they have except cucumbers and sprouts and it still wasn't right.

After taking your sub back to the counter and telling them they made it wrong, it ends up tasting REALLY GOOD, however I ordered delivery one time and it came wrong when it showed up at my house, this was especially annoying. It must just be a Jimmy John thing because Blimpie and Subway I have no trouble getting the sub the way I want it.

I decided to bring him here for Father's Day brunch since he loves their country fare. Boy, what a day to bring him on a special day ... 

Service: We had a reservation so were sat fairly quickly. However, we never had a server come to the table to get us drinks. It was 115 out today and we were hankering for water! So I had to ask someone bussing tables to see who was handling our area. Then, three people came to get our drink order out of confusion. We finally got in our water order, but juice was brought instead of mimosas we'd ordered since there were ""too many cooks in the kitchen."" Three times someone else came with food not meant for our table. We put in an order for my mom and myself to share the chicken and waffles and no share plate was brought. So, we asked the person who brought our food for one and he never came back. Again, I had to get up and ask the bartender to help with our drink order and for another plate (not his job.) 

Food: here is where we had no issues. We enjoyed our food we ordered. The portions were huge and there was plenty to share. Luckily hubby loved his chicken pot pie and had plenty to spare.

Environment: it was a nice casual day full of dads enjoying their special day on Father's Day. Many servers told them happy Father's Day ... but my husband was not one of them. It was obvious too since our daughter was between us in a high chair and he was taking time with her throughout.

I'm not sure we will be back. Of all days, this is a day we should see great service to someone like my husband celebrating Father's Day and it seemed like the restaurant was overflowing with people and mega busy when indeed it wasn't. The food is good, but I would rather wait longer at a smaller restaurant who takes more time to care about their customers.",2017-06-19 03:12:30

I live in the neighborhood and we can walk to this restaurant.  But yet I find myself first looking to go elsewhere before strolling just in for a meal.

Certainly there's lots to love here in the atmosphere set:  very modern interior with bright green splashes of color on the walls and a semi-open kitchen where the salads are crafted.  During warmer times, the patio, with its bright green umbrellas, is also a big draw even if busy 7th Street is just a few steps away.  

Certainly the salads and sandwiches are all looking and sounding full of freshness and there's lots to love with the customization options for dressing or veggie substitutions.  Love the fact there's usually a (bottled) beer special and a small selection of wine available.  Me, I'm partial to the fresh brewed iced tea and lemonade.  Even better: mix the two for an Arnold Palmer that screams summertime thirst quencher.  

But perhaps it's the fast food concept with sit-down restaurant prices that puts me off.  With an average price of $8.50 for a salad or sandwich (that's a singular ""a"" there folks), I just don't think I should have to stand in line and then watch most of my meal made before me in less than a minute.  I could do that at Subway, Jersey Mike's, or Substation for about $5.00.  Now, yes, there are some ingredients here you won't find at the chains, but if I'm dropping a 10-spot on lunch, I don't want to watch you swirl it all together in a stainless steel bowl with a pair of tongs in 60 seconds or less.  For that kind of informality, I feel like the prices should be equally relaxed.  Sigh... 

That said, it is an occasional stop for the wife and I when we want a light lunch close to home.  It is tasty and it always feels exceptionally clean, but those items come at an obvious premium since you still order at a counter and drink refills are on you.",2011-05-05 21:37:48

I remember coming to this restaurant when I was young and from what I remember it was good. There are a few locations around Toronto and this is a pretty well-known chain. It definitely did not disappoint as I came with my family who came from Edmonton and they loved the food! 
We ordered siu lung bao (steamed soup dumpling), tea smoked duck, stir fried garlic snow pea leaf, seafood soup casserole and shanghai fried noodles. I have to say that the seafood soup casserole did not look like the picture in the menu; however, it was quite tasty with a variety of seafood, meat and vegetables. It was definitely a really good chinese ""comfort"" dish and the soup was not too salty- it didn't feel like they put MSG in it, which is awesome!
The tea smoked duck was very tasty. The texture of the shanghai noodles were perfect, not too soft and just the right amount of chewiness.

One of my co workers was sick and to clear congestion i typically go straight to a spicy Korean soup of sorts to get me breathing normal again. My trustee Yelp app told me Jun's was close and they had Jjampong (spicy seafood stew) on the menu so i made my way over to pick some up. Walking in the place was clean, and i liked the way they had the Banchan displayed at the counter like a Chipotle or something. The pricing was typical of Korean grub and after a little over $10 i was out the door with my soup. 

Arriving at the office i was hyped to share my tasty goodness with my co worker who has never had it. My drive was only 2 minutes so the food didnt sit long at all. The noodles (separate) were super mushy and dough like as if they were cooked too long. But the real disappointment was the broth because it simply was not spicy one bit and quite embarrassing to serve it to people to try to help make them feel better. The flavor was lacking, and we actually had to add hot sauce to it to try to help it (ugh).

There was nothing special about the entree selections. Eventually, I opted for coffee (black like always) and the Veggie Omelette with a side of pancakes, wifey had the German Pancake and niece had the Eggs Benedict.

Here's the breakdown:

Coffee : tasted burnt. I admitted to the wife and niece yesterday's Keurig cup was way better than this, I'm probably gonna have heartburn from it after a couple cups, but today is moving day and I need my caffeine!

My omelette : was just as I expected - average. I've had a tastier omelette at Denny's at 3am. 

Pancakes : I'm a huge pancake fan and so I had to try theirs. On the outside, they had the golden color that says, ""cooked to perfection"", however, the inside was a different story. The flavor was good, but it was one of those types that felt grainy and dry on the inside. 2 Forks down.  

German Pancake : was bland with a hint of what we could only deem as egg noggy. On the upside, the chicken sausage that came with the meal was yummy. 

Eggs Benedict : I didn't actually try them but according to niece she said they were good - but nothing special. 

Service : I've had better service in the men's bathroom at any given club in Old Town - wait, that doesn't sound right, but seriously folks, I was excited to try this place out, unfortunately, it's not a place I'd recommend or return to.",2016-08-27 20:09:26

We were doing the Queen West thing on the weekend and just happened to be in front of Carmen's when it opened for the day. We were the first in for the day.

We started by ordering the Paella with the Confit Rabbit and Sous Vide Snails as the menu and our waitress warned that the Paella took app 40-45 mins for preparation. We had some wine and ordered a couple of the Tapas starters. The Sardinas were quite nice and served in a little tin can like store sardines. And then...

#1 - a lady showed up, sitting a few tables away from us, waiting for friends and ordered the chicken and seafood paella but asked for no chicken in the paella (why I noticed/paid attention to this I have no idea). Her 2 friends showed up shortly thereafter.

#2 - our second tapas app, the breaded green tomatoes with feta, peppers and corn chutney arrived. My wife split the 4 pieces between us and we dug in, they were excellent, I scarfed mine down and then...my wife found a hair in her portion. It appeared to be a beard hair, kind of short and wirey. We informed the waitress who apologized and took her plate away. She shortly returned and said they took it off the bill and the chef said if wasnt a beard hair but was in fact corn silk and that no one in the kitchen had a beard. We thanked her for that but noted that when you have an open concept kitchen and 3 of the 5 guys on the kitchen brigade have beardy faces you shouldn't make such claims.

We waited for the paella while drinking our wine when.....(remember #1?)....a waitress brought the 3 ladies their paella. My wife asked why they were getting theirs when we ordered our 10-15 mins earlier. I said maybe it had to do with the fact that they didn't have the chicken that theirs was ready earlier. And then....

#3 - one of the ladies had spooned the paella onto her plate and was cutting into the meat and asked the waitress if they had ordered no chicken in their paella and that waitress informed her that it was rabbit. The waitress took their plates and paella back to the kitchen. Several of the kitchen and wait staff stood in the open kitchen and glanced in our direction. A waitress then took the proper seafood paella out to the ladies.

#4 - a few minutes later our waitress brought the original order of paella over to our table. We told her that we had seen everything and won't take the paella and would just take the bill for what we had consumed. 

She was a very sweet girl and apologized for the mix up as another waitress had delivered our paella to the ladies. We paid our bill and insisted on tipping her but she said she would not accept a tip. 

As I mentioned, the restaurant and menu looked really nice, the reviews were good and the food we had was very good. We would love to return and try again but we will have to wait until the time is right.

Wanting to try it out, my husband and I ate dinner there this weekend since we were out and about on Mill Avenue. Along with Caffe Boa and La Bocca, the addition of Regions is making Mill Avenue more grown up and giving those of us that live in Tempe real dinner options.

The decor is very simple with half the space having tables dressed in white linens and then other half of the space housing the bar which is half indoors and half outdoors. There are also some tables on the patio facing Sixth Street. Our waitress described the food as ""American comfort food"", so almost all of the items on the menu are familar, but some have an interesting twist to take them to the next level.

My husband and I tried the mac and cheese with crabmeat, the scallops, and the garlic and parmesan fries. By far the fries were our favorite part of the meal - loved the gorgonzola and bacon that came on the fries (the cheese and bacon stuck well to our fries) and the blue cheese that came to dip the fries was great. The mac and cheese was good but in most bites you didn't get any crabmeat. It turned out the crabmeat was buried at the bottom and on one side. Definitely mix it up when you get it to better distribute the crabmeat. Also, the crabmeat didn't add much to the dish, so to me, it wasn't worth the extra $5. The scallops...wow. The only word to describe them: salty. I'm pretty sure my face puckered when I put the first bite in my mouth. Even though the scallops were cooked well, the abundance of salt was the only thing we could concentrate on. We did tell the manager who was walking around getting feedback on the food about the over-saltiness of the scallops; additionally we also told our waitress Hopefully that constructive criticism will help them adjust that dish.

Our waitress was super sweet and was really good. I asked a lot of questions about the drink menu because their cocktail menu doesn't really describe what is in each drink. It was frustrating on my part, but our waitress was great about answering questions and describing the drinks. I ended up with a ""Southside"" which is really just a mojito. Our bill for a beer, cocktail, 2 entrees, and the side of fries, came to $62.

They've renamed the ""top"" venue the Nile Theater. Good luck finding it on Google, in Yelp or any other normal search effort. Had an opportunity to see Black Veil Brides on 01/05/13 for $18 and jumped last second. I should have known when I heard it was an all-ages show... 

Cool:
-considered by many an ""intimate venue""... yes, it's smaller than your big-name venues like Cricket or Dodge or whatever they're calling them these days, but only slightly smaller than Marquee.
-free parking on the street
-affordable tickets ($18 for all-ages show for a big-name band)
-dodgy rock'n'roll atmosphere which I like

Totally Not Cool:
I hate all-ages events. It really has nothing to do with the kids themselves (for the most part) but the restrictions and legislature that comes along with it.
-NO BAR, DRY VENUE. I cannot stress this enough. When I go to a concert, I like to get a li'l drunk and have a good time. Let's just say I wasn't a happy camper when I realized what I'd gotten myself into.
-you have to pay $2 for a ""bracelet"" that allows you to go outside and come back in. What is this, a punishment for smokers? My thinking is, why can't we have a bar and give the bracelets to those who are 21+ and allow people to go in and out freely??
(I'm beginning to sound like an old fart right now)
-I'm tired of kids with iPhones, and Blackberry phones videotaping and taking pictures of the whole damn show. YOU ARE MISSING THE ACTUAL CONCERT. And I can't see through your arm, hand or cell phone. When you multiply this by 30, it's difficult to see the stage AT ALL. I think that the venue should implement a new policy on this. If staff sees you filming the whole effing set, your phone gets confiscated or you get kicked out. I have an iPhone and GUESS WHAT I didn't take one single picture or video. I enjoy my concerts first-hand.
-Ma and Pop, please stay at home and let the ""kids"" have a little fun. If you're a Mom or Dad who likes this kind of music, leave the kids at home (there was a little girl no more than 6 at this show). 
-the ""bars"" that are ""nearby"" that are ""recommended"" are jokes. Notice how many quotes I used. They are hotel bars. They aren't bars you'd bring a friend, a date, or yourself to.

I'll keep an eye on the Underground and the Nile Theater for upcoming shows, but I can almost guarantee that the all-ages shows will be on my shit list.

We broke away from our usual braised beef tortellini for the new wine braised beef gnocchi.

iL2SYmZA2NKPMGn7neIb8Q,yG00-Dcv5iFS2SaezGu-Kw,vchjO0Vs5FwW2tpFnCimqg,4,4,0,0,"probably my favorite place that i have stayed at in vegas so far (i have stayed at the signature at MGM, Riviera, Venetian, and MGM Grand).  The rooms are pretty big, we got the 2 bedroom suite which was just the king studio suite attached to a 1 bedroom suite by the doors that you can open to connect the rooms.  i feel if we would have gotten a corner room it would have been different and better, but this room still worked out perfectly fine.  we had 8 people, so there was enough sleeping room for everyone easy with their being the 2 king beds and the 2 queen pullouts.  I will say though, the sofa itself seemed a lot more comfortable than the queen pullouts, and 2 of my friends who were in the room agreed to it also.  

the smaller room (king studio) is smaller with just the king, a queen pullout, and then a typical hotel bathroom, a small kitchen with dishwasher, mini fridge, and microwave and then floor to ceiling windows and a TV.  

the living room of the 1 bedroom suite was very nice with the full kitchen (however you do not get pans to cook stuff unless you own the room?  wtf?!  i feel sorry for the guy downstairs cause i gave him an earful when they told us that when we wanted to cook bacon).  it has a very nice granite/marble table that is perfect for beer pong, however that table is really hard to move cause it weighs a ton.  then there is the huge L shaped sofa which has a queen pullout, 2 TV's, and the projector that goes against the shades when they are down.  I will say though, the ice maker in the freezer of the room is very slow.

the main king bedroom is attached to it's own bathroom and then to the living room.  that bedroom has a king bed, and some weird recliner thing that i was extremely comfortable along with its own TV and then the jacuzzi tub right next to the bed.  then you go into the bathroom which has toilet, shower, sinks.

overall, the 1 bedroom suite part is very roomy, the king studio is a little cramped, but the rooms were really nice, layout was good, amenities were nice.  the projector made it really nice for watching football since it was a little too cold for the pool

parking was not a problem at all, we just parked in the general parking.  go to level 3 of the structure because then you can walk right into the lobby of the westgate towers without having to go through the miracle mile shops and it makes it easy

check in is not supposed to be until 4pm, but we ended up getting in at 3:30am on friday and were not supposed to check in until later.  we went to the front desk to see if we could check in early but they said not at the moment but to check back at 6am and they would see.  we came back at 6am and they said we could get our reserved 2 bedroom suite if we wanted which we did, but they also gave us the option of waiting until 11am at the earliest to upgrade to a higher floor for $11 a night, or a penthouse for $100 a night, but some people in our group were dead tired so we just took our normal room.  i will probably take advantage of those options next trip though.  Valet was not there to have bell hops take our bags up at that time in the morning though which was a bummer because we had a ton of booze and other bags to take up, but it took us maybe 3 trips so it wasn't too bad


overall, i would absolutely stay here again in the future as the rooms were huge, prices weren't bad, staff was nice, location on the strip is pretty good too.  only things i didn't like were the supposed cooking utensils only for owners, and having to show your key everytime you want to go to your room. but i guess that is becoming the new thing as many hotels in vegas do that",2011-11-10 00:19:46

This is a really authentic Japanese restaurant that serves Izakaya and sashimi. 

I've been here twice. I remember the first time, I was really impressed with the freshness of the sashimi and the kingyo izakaya set (only makes 10 sets a day). Perhaps it's what we ordered this time around, but the food was underwhelming for me. We ordered the pork Kakuni and sashimi bowl with rice. The pork was a bit dry, but the sides were really good. I especially enjoyed the tofu. The sashimi was really fresh, but they added some cooked salmon in the bowl, which was a it dry. I wish they added uni in it! 

They have beer for $3 at lunch. I enjoyed the frozen grapes as a dessert. For $45 for lunch, I feel it wasn't worth it. You pay for quality here, but I didn't find the food prepared well this time around.",2017-10-08 00:32:50

Nice vibe (albeit smoky at times), a ton of maize & blue regalia and decor including a custom linoleum M lower floor and a wall-to-wall Go Blue shrine. The bartenders play the cowbell intermittently just like in the Big House. Found out that one of the veteran bartenders was singlehandedly responsible for transforming this Inn Zone location into a Michigan hang. The main projection screen could've been a bit brighter, but it didn't matter as we chose to sit at the bar where there were HD flat screens. 

One cannot choose the bar that their elder fellow alumni decide to hang out at. It doesn't work that way. Traditions are established, and fortunately the Inn Zone is suitably cool with the right amount of dive-y attitude. The place is windowless, but it's clean and the drinks are reasonably priced (Jameson on the rocks for $4) and the bartenders are super friendly. The corner cutout pickup window to the kitchen (which serves finger food and burgers - cash only) reminds me of a cross between two Ann Arbor classics: Backroom Pizza and Blimpy Burger. 

For the Yelp record: the state universities in Michigan are not created equal. 2.5-3.0GPA students go to Western Michigan, Central Michigan and Michigan State. You need at least a 3.4 to get into the University Of Michigan as long as your SATs are in the 90th percentile. 36% of U of M students come from out-of-state, compared to a measly 9% out-of-state enrollment at Michigan State. No one truly aspires to go to Michigan State, which explains why many Michigan State alumni have a chip on their shoulder. Michigan State has one of the highest acceptance rates of any state university in the country. Not to mention their campus is pretty ugly in a government-building kind of way. Poor Spartans.

I'm normally not a fan of going to an ayce Asian food, unless it's sushi, but this place has changed my mind only b/c of one of their 1 buffet station.

You have you're usual buffet stations, Canadian Chinese, soup, sushi/sashimi, dessert, drink station with bottled water and juices, Mongolain grill, or my favourite the made to order grill. 

The food in the Canadian Chinese and soup station is anything you would get at Mandarin, wonton soup, chicken balls, noodles, fried rice etc. The sushi/sashimi station was very good, the fish tasted very fresh however there was too much rice on the maki rolls. My favourite station was the made to order grill. The choices for the grill were steak, kalbi, chicken, shrimp, salmon, mussels and another type of fish. This station alone won me over and is the only reason I want to keep coming back for more. That tender taste of the meat and the garlic teriyaki sauce that they put on the food is to die for.

- grilled shrimp
- steak
- grilled mussels

Deliciously tender with streaks of melt in your mouth fatty goodness throughout.  It's paired with mashed potatoes and cabbage, and topped with slices of fried carrots.  The cabbage is cooked soft but not mushy.  The carrot slices give the dish a crunch.  It's their best dish, in my opinion, and I've certainly turned a couple of people who were previously meh to corned beef to realizing it's the best thing ever once they tried Brocach's version.  

The other thing I love about Brocach is the way they make my drink.  I often order a whiskey highball with ginger beer, splash of bitters, and lots of lemon.  Because I'm not particularly specific when I order this drink, it's different at every bar.  But no matter where I go, Brocach makes the best version of this drink.

I am writing this review based on the Men's Wear department. Absolutely amazing. 

Recently, I started a new job, and it was time to get a new wardrobe. I came into some cash, so I figured why not splurge a little.

I bought a suit, some slacks, and a bunch of dress shirts in this round of shopping. The remarkable note here is that the staff is VERY friendly and HELPFUL.

They aren't just cashiers. They know how to properly measure you for your clothing, make recommendations on what looks good, and give you suggestions on what is properly fitted and what isn't.

I nearly bought a jacket that was two sizes too big because it felt ""comfortable"" and it was my old size (thank God I've been working out"". The new jacket size actually is WAY more flattering and I look like a G in it.

Helpful tip: If the sizings work for you, buy as many of the DKNY and Calvin Klein dress shirts as you can because these designers tend to keep changing their cuts.

I wish I got everyone's name because they were all so nice and beyond amazing! Brandon got me an amazing deal for my trade in and my new purchase and even got a lower payment than I had on my previous SUV. I recommend anyone and everyone to go here for their car shopping needs.

All were passable but not great. It's not a place where I would crave their burgers or fries. At least not like I do an In 'n Out burger!  I found the burger to be on the smallish side. The meat was flavorful and cooked to perfection. It wasn't a big fat two-fisted burger like I thought it might be. The fries were decent; crispy and a good sized portion.  

When our order for 14 people came up, two servers delivered them to our table and went around asking who ordered what. Nice!  I was dreading picking up tray after tray and trying to figure out who ordered what. Thank you for being on the ball staff!  Way to be on top of things.

The balsalmic was so overly proportioned that I actually felt my stomach pH drop another 2 points.  I didn't complain because as I look behind the counter, there was no chef  nor sou chef therefore absolutely zero quality control.

To start, I've ordered the flautas (chicken or potato), which are served with queso fresco, red onions, radishes and lettuce as garnish. It's two per order and they are crunchy perfection!

Their speciality is the torta (a Mexican-style sandwich). I've tried the chicken, the steak and the vegetarian tortas. Surprisingly, my favourite is the ""Malinche"" vegetarian torta becauce the smoked mozzarella cheese pairs perfectly with the chipotle mayo, avocado, tomato slices and watercress. YUM. Each sandwich costs $10.95 before taxes. It's not cheap but I really enjoy it and find it very filling.

Do not overlook that jar placed on every picnic table. It's filled with homemade, pickled jalapeños, which are a delicious addition to the tortas or quesadillas and bursting with flavour.

I've also visited for breakfast on a Saturday - I thoroughly enjoyed it! Packed with flavour, my vegetarian breakfast quesadilla was delicious. Guacamole, pico de gallo, eggs and smoked cheese - what a winning combination! Their coffee is also amazing.

A MASSIVE chunk of dough was slowly being snipped and the bits formed into bagels and set into a boiling bath. Once removed from the water, they were slung on a long plank, dusted with sesame seeds or seasonings and put into the oven. 

""Excuse me, can I have some all dressed."" ""yes one minute..."" ""How long til the All dressed come out of the oven?"" ""Madame, it will be two minutes.""

2 min later, me.. giggling with three dozen hot fresh bagels to eat on the five hour drive back to Toronto.

Tonnes of flavours available! We particularity enjoyed sesame and all dressed. Western cream cheese. They sell three varieties and smoked salmon! Plus the car smelled like bagels for days and my coworkers were all thrilled when I arrived bearing gifts.

The food was okay. The eggs in my omelet didn't feel like eggs honestly, but perhaps that stuff that is poured out from a container, but I have no proof of that so I feel maybe its better to not speculate. 

Price wise, not too bad. Normal breakfast prices, and the Mimosas were actually very competitively priced at only $3, although I did not have one as it was too early (even for me).

The best part of our visit was wondering around the bar/restaurant; outside they have a really large cozy patio (one half is self serve, the other is sit down).

My first plate was a small plate with one large samosa, palak paneer, and some chana masala.  The palak paneer and chana masala had a nice zing to them but it wasn't too spicy that someone would not enjoy them.  The samosa was filled with potato and some peas.

I first visited NC about a month ago after noticing it a few times passing by. I was curious to try the food based on how nice the place looked from the outside. 

When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who showed us to our seat. The restaurant has a warm, cozy feel to it, with the delicious smell of pizza, roasting garlic, and lasagna....just writing about it makes me hungry!

We decided to share a bottle of wine and the eggplant parmigiana to start. The eggplant was sooooo good!! Thin, perfectly roasted slices of eggplant were separated by a rich blend of cheese, tomato sauce, garlic, and herbs. I seriously wish I ate the whole thing myself! 

We then tried their special, which was a meat lasagna, and a vegetarian pizza. Though I don't eat meat, I heard nothing but rave reviews about it. And my pizza - what a pizza! The crust was perfectly thin, fluffy, and just all sorts of goodness. The sauce was amazing and the toppings were superb. 

What I liked most about this place was how friendly the staff was and how authentic the food tasted. I've been to a number of pizza places in the city and would definitely consider myself a pizza lover-bordering-snob. What can I say, I appreciate a good 'za. And this place definitely hits the spot! 

We returned again this past week and this time I tried a calzone (made deliciously vegetarian just for me!) and a pizza with sausage. Again, the service was wonderful and the food was amazing. 

I am so happy that Napoli Centrale has moved into our neighbourhood and cannot wait to make it part of my regular 'za rotation!

Bonus points: NC has this delicious homemade chili hot sauce that is soooo tasty to dip your pizza crust into. I want to take home a whole jar of this stuff! They also serve up delicious bread and assorted olives to start. Seriously, what's not to love!?",2014-04-07 22:04:31

uxJKGbOERfTnbaBVr3rgMQ,ds-C9AXGATTmvsCEWCqmZg,-fiUXzkxRfbHY9TKWwuptw,4,1,0,0,"It was our last few days on campus and one of my roommates wanted to grab a nicer dinner before we left for the summer.

Craft beer and unique burgers are probably our go-to cuisine when dining out. I suggested we try Destihl after having a pretty good experience there with my family last time. 

This visit was equally as good!

We opted to sit at the bar and watch the Bulls game due to the dining room wait being around 35 minutes which was much too long for two very hungry college kids.

We started with a few 4oz beer samples which are very convenient and not too expensive, I dislike having to commit to a roughly $5 16oz beer not knowing much beforehand. I particularly enjoyed the oatmeal nitro but didn't much care for the Champaign blonde.

The beer-battered bacon was a must-try for us since I didn't get it last time and it gets a lot of attention here on Yelp. We also opted for the cheese curds, both of these appetizers were so artery-cloggingly delicious.

The Bulls started to seriously disappoint us and when our food arrived we were glad to have something else to focus on, rather than the demise of Chicago basketball this season. 

I ordered the meatloaf and my roommate got the rancher burger. He said his was really tasty, right up there with the burger we had at Farren's a few weaks earlier. I went with the meatloaf to try something different and when it came out I was initially a little taken aback, but after trying it that all changed. This was not your grandmother's meatloaf! It was rolled up and wrapped in prosciutto sitting on a mountain of mashed potatoes adorned with some thinly sliced vegetables all inside a cast iron skillet. The meatloaf itself was well seasoned and actually had a little spice to it. What really made this dish though was the prosciutto, it added that nice smoky pork flavor to the meatloaf. I highly recommend this dish!

The service was a little different because we were at the bar. The bar staff was extremely busy due to having a packed dining room and fairly full bar as well. There were about two people taking care of us and they made sure we always had beer and were quick to clear our plates as well as check in frequently. Service: great!

Overall, another great experience at Destihl. Though, like I mentioned last time, it comes a bit of a steeper price than some other potential options nearby. Either way, we really liked our food.",2015-05-17 20:11:10

I used to love this place, but the quality has gone so far down hill, in all aspects. I don't recommend you waste your time here.
--------
By far my absolute favorite restaurant in Arizona!!!
It was by luck I found this little gem, I was actually headed down 7th Street with my boyfriend to try out a new taco shop we had heard about... long story short we passed a sign that read ""Rice Paper- Modern Vietnamese""... a girl like Mr couldn't resist. I whipped the car around and the rest is history.

Enviorment- let me just say this restaurant is located in the cutest most cozy part of Phoenix I would say just about 5 minutes away from downtown Phoenix. I loved how laid back it was, what I was wearing was felt irrelevant but I would suggest leaving your sweats at home. In terms of decor this restaurant hit the spot!  I love that the actual building was very old and they kept  the character of that building by leaving the exposed brick walls as is.

Service- Awesome! We had a great server who was knowledgeable about the menu as well as very attentive.

Food- FLAVOR HEAVEN!!!
 Do not live in Arizona or visit Arizona without trying these wings! They give you a choice of two flavors: fish sauce and butter garlic my boyfriend and I couldn't decide which one we preferred so we had them split 50/50....and let me tell you both the fish sauce although it may sound weird and the butter garlic were out of this world! And to top it off these wings were perfectly crispy and I can't say that about any other wings I've had.
We also had crispy pork rolls, which were just as amazing. 
For entrees my boyfriend had mignon pho which we both loved and I had the braised pork sandwich. I'll speak on the sandwich more so because I only had a bite of my boyfriend pho.  My sandwich was the gift that kept on giving, every single time I took a bite, I bit into a new flavor; from the freshly baked bread to the moist pork to the carrots, the jalapenos, the homemade mayonnaise....everything on this sandwich was absolutely perfect I still crave it till this day!

Price-  appx. $42.00 before tip
Overall- I highly recommend Rice Paper!!!",2015-01-21 05:08:48

It worked out for us because there was a cool toy store right below that we played around in and in no time we were texted to come back up. When we got back up to the restaurant the hostess did not address us first, but addressed the couple behind us and seated them. This kind of set me off because we were literally standing in front of her and had been told to come back up. After seating them the hostess finally asked us how many was in our party and we told her 3 but also told her we were here prior and received a text to let us know to come back up. We were seated and got the usual all you can drink specials that many brunch spots have. My husband got the mimosa and I chose to get the Bellini which was super sweet for me. My husband got the steak and eggs tacos which he really enjoyed and I got the shrimp and grits which I enjoyed.

If you buy a bottle, the cost of the tasting is waived.  The attendant was good at explaining their wines, the process, the grapes, etc.  There were small portions of crackers and thinly sliced cheese between 1 oz servings.  I had the sangria, which was a nice balance of sweet and fruity, served chilled with ice.   It was a basic experience, and we had fun chatting and joking around with the man serving us.

Located across from CPCC in an unassuming strip mall with a tiny parking lot, this little gem is just waiting to make your date more interesting, your mouth do a little dance and your wallet skip a beat!

I always go for lunch here because it's $5.99-$6.99 for the same size portions as dinner (dinner is around $10-$12). I always get the spicy chicken dish and await the fun. 

To those who don't know (I didn't before I went here!), Ethiopian food doesn't come with utensils, instead it's plated on this spongy bread which you break off and use to pick up the food. It's amazing and like I mentioned above, a great place to take a date. Most people have probably never been to a place like this and it's an experience AND a meal which I like.

The meal comes on a large plate with the spongy bread and on top of it is a garden salad with a light Italian dressing, a pureed dish of some sort that's amazing, and the protein you've chosen with onions, spices and a sauce. Sometimes you'll get veggies and potatoes too, depending on what you order. I like it spicy and I always think they give a perfect amount of heat. Simple food that really speaks for itself is what you'll get here, but the portions are great so you'll never walk out hungry!

I've never tried dessert here, but I'd be willing to it if I ever had enough room left over! They do have soda in cans and beers in bottles.

We went on a Sunday around 1pm and they were not busy at all.  Maybe 4 or 5 tables of people.  They offer their lunch specials...even on weekends, which was great.  All you can eat soup and salad bar comes with the lunch specials too!  I ordered the pad see ew with tofu, medium spicy, and the bf got the fried rice with tofu, hot.  Then we headed to the soup and salad bar.  The salad was not your typical iceberg lettuce, but a great mix of kale and cabbage, and maybe some lettuce too.  There were cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, red onion and green onions to add to your liking and a peanut dressing that was super yummy!  The soup was a vegetable soup that was broth with diced veggies in it.  I was barely 2 bites into my salad when our entrees arrived!  I snuck a taste of my noodles, before finishing my salad and soup, and then devoured my pad see ew.  It was just wonderful!  Perfect heat level for me, not oily and super flavorful!

Had to get a goody from the pastry case. OMG! Got a red and white cookie (same as black and white but obviously red instead of black in honor of the AZ Cardinals) and got a brownie to take home for later. Yum, yum, yum!

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was very put off by management's lack of humane treatment toward the handicapped. After expected the handicapped to endure long lines STANDING outside in the hot sun, you would think management would at least offer a chair when asked if there was anything they could do for the handicapped. And not being 20 years old anymore, you would think they'd accommodate the aging category with a foot long hot dog that ISN'T loaded with the chili and cheese on it. (You can ask for it, but they charge you $10.99 for a hot dog, the same as the fully loaded one.)  And the outside dining area, which really brings in the farmhouse feel, isn't really wheelchair friendly, with several inch drops off the sidewalk to the picnic tables.

My friends and I decided to try the ""famous pizza"" joint after the Elite event...and with all the booze in our system, nothing could be better than delish, cheesy, goodness.

I was so looking forward to Piola and in fact, was a bookmark of places to eat. The food DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The service was utterly atrocious. So, the 4 stars rating is just for the food.

Food. Piola is bright and airy inside and there is even a small outdoor patio in front! My girlfriends and I were quickly seated and brought menu's. Our mouths started to water. We decided to share two pizza's: Burrata and the Sparta. Both were absolutely divine. Both pizza's were nice and thin...so much that you could fold it. But it still had a lot of oomph and character and I was actually NOT FULL after eating 3 slices. I can still taste the Buratta cheese melting in my mouth. The Sparta is one of Piola's cheese-less pizza's and you can never go wrong with a combo of cherry tomatoes, olives, and peppery arugula. YUM! Add to that some good vino rosso and the night is made.

Service. I think we had an off night with our server. Reading other reviews of great service, it seemed almost out of character with Piola. Our waiter was very rushed and impatient. He knocked my friend's bag off her chair twice. Towards the beginning of our meal, I told our waiter we couldn't wait to try the pizza's (and were hungry) and we were ready to order. He said for me to hold on and he would be right back. Would it have been so difficult to remember two pizza orders? And, 15 minutes later...

My girlfriend (probably slightly tipsy from all the Martini's at the Gladstone) wanted Pellegrino water and was asking about the sizes. Our waiter, quite exasperated I might add, answered we have either bottle or can. Can you explain? We have either bottle or can. So...what is the size? Bottle or can.

In any event, Piola is a really great pizza place. I am so sad that it is so far from me. If I am ever in the area, I would SO GO BACK and I think I might venture to have a pizza myself. Although with all the choices on the menu, going with a group ensures you get to taste everything heavenly.",2012-06-13 17:25:06

I like the build your own burger approach - it makes it real easy to customize and get just what you want. I also like that they use ABF and hormone free Canadian beef, a real plus. The burger itself is disappointingly lacking in flavour, however. It's definitely a step up from McD's and the rest of the fast food junk, that much is for sure.
While I'm on the gluten free soap box, the biggest disappointment is that the burger is the only solid food here that is gluten free. All the sides, including their frozen fries and rings are processed with wheat fillers so they are off limits. For a chain trying to capture part of the upscale market, using real potatoes might be a good place to start improving their menu.

Pros: 
1. Lots of parking. 
2. Clean jungle gym. Yes, there is only one jungle gym for all ages, but it's nothing too crazy. Extra points for the little cars, which my son enjoyed riding.

You walk in and your not greeted you are ignored by an obviously  untrained wait staff who appear to have better shit to deal with then customers who pay their salaries. We sat at the bar while the bartender talked endlessly to her friends and texted. Looking around the dining room you see junk everywhere. You have things on shelves that have no purpose nor appear to have been used or cleaned in years. The place is just dirty. You have wait staff bussing to the bar right were we are sitting. Putting dirty dishes next to where I'm eating is gross and unprofessional. Also get rid of the televisions if your not going to have something worth looking at on.

I ordered the beef brisket called Ropa Vieja, which was very tough and like eating strands of rope.  I could see where it got it's name ""ropa"", because it is like cooked strands of rope. There was plenty of meat, but the flavor was all boiled and leached out of the meat.  It was served to me like a stew , but the beans and rice side and the ropa was swimming in a plateful of water almost to the edge of the plate.  The ropa stew had no flavor, like it was boiled in a big potful of plain water that kept getting changed.  I had to add a lot of salt., shake more and more and more salt on it.   It was very ICK to me.   I wish I ordered the cerviche instead.  I didn't think the ropa was worth it even with the Groupon discount, I would not want that dish even if it were free, unless I was starving.  I told the waitress it was very bland and asked her if it was normal to have all that water in the plate.   She said it was ""juicey"", but to me, juice implies flavor, but I guess ""juice"" for water is a waitress being positive and politically correct on her job.   My jaws were tired trying to chew the strands of ""rope"".  She did not offer to bring me something else.  She said that was the way it was.

For dessert, I ordered the coconut mini flan with mango sauce, and that was really good!   I'd give it an A and the size was larger than the word mini implies.  

Sorry for such  negative review about the ropa, but I tell it like it is, and if I thought it was terrific, I'd surely say so.

Maybe you will find something else on the menu to your liking, or maybe you are less discriminating than I am about tough and flavorless Ropa meat swimming in a plateful of water  (Yes, I know the difference between juice, sauce, soup, and water.).   I consider myself a great cook and I eat out a lot.

Chips and salsa - bland at best. Really tastes like tomato paste with salt and pepper in it. Sea bass tacos were mediocre and COLD. And for $14 for three street tacos (which is all you get) it's too steep for the quality you receive. The service was lackluster and I had to ask for my water to be refilled three times while there. 

Upon asking for the check, I waited for 20 minutes for the waiter to bring it. They also forgot (completely) the chile verde tacos to go. So I waited an additional 30 minutes for them to make the tacos - again, 2 VERY SMALL street tacos for approximately $10.

People like to complain about the service, or the lack thereof, in Chinese restaurants, but one thing they typically do well is being efficient. Kwan is the opposite - or at least it was on a Saturday morning I attended. 

While we were seated quickly, we waited around until we had to ask for tea and the menu on separate occasions - oddly, the waiter seemed irritated by our request. After our first round of dim sum arrived relatively quickly, we ordered a second round. This, however, took forever, and when we eventually followed up on it, it was brought out almost immediately suggestive that it had been sitting around in the back ignored.

It's too bad because I really did enjoy the dim sum here. The decor is modern and the place is clean. At these prices, however, I think I would rather go to Crown Princess, Pearl Harbourfront, or Lai Wah Heen.",2015-12-09 22:20:48

Cons:
- The girl who was working (1 girl, 1 guy) was just plain rude. Rolling her eyes when I remind her about a missing order of fries.. Standing there like we are an inconvenience while we are ordering.
- The sweet potato fries were inedible, absolutely disgusting (and I rarely say that about any food) they were like hunks of mushy sweet potato that had been floating in cold grease. They were promptly thrown away.

So when you choose to eat here your options are pretty simple. You can choose whatever house specialty pizza at different prices they have or you can choose your own unlimited toppings for 8.95. Mind you that they only have one size and I would say that it's a little bit smaller than a medium pizza hut pizza.

So here's your steps for your custom built pizza.

1. Choose your Dough. (Wheat, Gluten Free, or Traditional)
2. Choose your Sauce. (Crushed Tomato, Spicy Diavola, Creamy Alfredo, or Pistachio Pesto)
3. Choose your Cheese. (Mozzarella, Jack, Gorgonzola, or Asiago)
4. Choose your Meats. (too many to mention)
5. Choose your Veggies. (too many to mention)

When you hear of this place and find out you can put whatever toppings you want for 8.95 of course it sounds like a good bargain. So naturally I was thinking for the toppings why not EVERYTHING?

Here's where the problem lies. When I was there that day, I told the guy I wanted all the toppings on there. He said, you can do that BUT not all of it will get cooked properly and not only will it not look right, but most of the toppings will fall off when you take your first bite. 

Now I dont know if he said that so that he wouldnt lose money since you would have all the toppings he offers on there, so I ended up only going with about 8 toppings total on mine. I ordered another with just extra cheese and extra pepperoni because that's all my 8 year old likes to eat.

So overall, I was kind of disappointed. Dont get me wrong, everything tasted good but the fact that I can eat one pizza by myself, that can get expensive, especially with a family of 4.

If you do choose to come here, do not and I repeat DO NOT expect it to be like The Keg or other modern steak restaurants out there.

The property itself is a pretty big house that you can see off the main road. Those who's been around the North York area have probably passed by many times. Once turning down and into the property, you'll see a relatively large parking lot so parking shouldnt be a problem. Once you make your way into the restaurant, almost immediately you'll be greeted by some friendly staff members, which is nice to have someone acknowledge you upon your arrival. The decor is somewhat dimlit but it adds to the ambience. Right in the middle of the ceiling on the upper floor is a huge piece of stained glass that really gives the place a feeling like you're back in the old days - the restaurant is wood throughout and lots of carvings everywhere; very detailed. Many years ago when I first went, the place was way more strict and upscale, like you have to dress up super fancy and put together to go in, but seems like nowadays theyre a bit more laid back (with the dress code at least). As if the main and upper floor isnt big enough already, they also have a basement - you really need to walk around and look at all the details and decor.

Alright, onto the food. Prices are only a bit higher than most other fine dining restaurants out there, or the same. Their lobster tail is not only nicely presented (with half a lemon placed inside a small gauze baggie tied with a ribbon so your fingers dont get sticky or have the seeds falling out) but it was also very generous in portion size and cooked almost perfectly (just a tad overcooked for my liking). Same goes for their steak, which wasnt dry at all and once you cut into it, the colour was beautiful. A fave of mine is the french onion soup - lots of ingredients in there which could be a meal in itself. It was full of flavour (and cheese) and not salt. If you're a fan of escargots (yes, snails) like I am, they also offer that here. For that though I wouldve liked it on a bed of mashed potatoes but thats just my preference. Also, one of the few places that offer table side cooking, which has a nice little entertainment aspect. 

As this was a surprise birthday dinner, at the end of my meal, the staff brought out a piece of cheesecake with a lit candle (no singing involved thank you very much). The cheesecake is on their dessert menu; dont remember if it was made in house or not but it was very creamy and light. 

All in all, this is a restaurant with lots of history and one that they like to stick by, which is nice to find in this part of town. Expect prices to be comparable to other fine dining places, with generous portion sizes. Staff are experienced and friendly.

Got 2 different dinner plates consisting of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, with sides of Mac n cheese, potato salad, coleslaw, toast and mashed potatoes... for a total of $30!! The portions are very small (each side was about 1/4 of a cup.) Then they only gave me about a 1/4 rack of ribs and maybe a half pound of brisket and pulled pork combined. The toast was also not buttered but instead coated in oil and served soggy. There are much better places in Phoenix for good BBQ so skip this joint!",2018-06-30 03:01:39

We were here Easter Sunday, about 3pm, there was only two other tables in there.  I had a pretty big party- 4 adults & 8 kids, since their tables are kinda small, we had to split up and take two tables.

We were there early but were told they don't offer the lunch AYCE price ($14.95) on the weekends, they only offer the dinner AYCE prices ( $19.95).  Well, with 8 kids ranging from 14 to 4yrs old, it was not worth the $20 bucks a person since it was a first time for Korean food for most of the kids and we didn't know if they would like it. So, we opted for the $99 combo which came with almost all the meats available.

All the meats were good but because we split the combo for both tables, we got some things the kids didn't and they got things we didn't.  Overall, the pork belly and bulgolgi was great, the steak was melt in your mouth good, and everything else was just okay.  The salad, I've had better at Mother's and the banchan was a disappointment.  We really only got two banchans and the kim chee was put on the grill...hmm okay..

The poor waitress was the only one working and she actually helps you grill but since she was the only one, she had to bounce around quite a bit since there was now more tables in the place.

Since we had the kids at their own table, they ordered rice and drinks, while the adults waited and wondered if we were going to get rice..only to have the waitress make us fried rice at the end...hmm, I kinda wanted rice with my meat??

Anyhow, our combo came with a soup that was just okay...usually I like my kimchee jigae.  I also asked for a japchae that never came so I don't even know if we were charged for it.  I know we were charged for ALL the kids rices!!

Overall, it was still a bargain to feed all of us for about $120, but I think I'm going to have to continue my search for that place that serves up 30 banchans!!  Okay I can dream can't I??",2011-04-28 04:12:58

The waiter brings out a variety of teas at the beginning to allow you to sniff them and decide on which one you want.  They have a pretty good selection and it is hard to choose just one.  In the end I opted for something traditional like Earl Gray which hit the spot.

Foodwise they bring out a variety of traditional tea foods like finger sandwiches, scones and pastries.  The cucumber watercress sandwich was quite good and the scones were divine.

It's two-steps up from an East Side Mario's but two steps down from a Ferro.  We've been a few times and it's ok but has never lived up to our expectations.  That may be their fault, that may be ours.  I'm not sure.

I had a great fungi but a very boyardee spaghetti and meatballs.  Penne with a basic bolognese was initially good but in the end so salty that I needed a beer.  The taglatelle with peas, prosciutto and shrimp was excellent in flavour but the pasta was so dente that you had to remind yourself to chew it.

Avoid the fusion dishes.  Expect a portion slightly smaller than you'd like and for the food to be not hot enough.

The Big Ragu at Lansdowne and St Clair doesn't have as hip a vibe but the food is better.  Choose Prop if the atmosphere is more important than the food, although lately it's been feeling a little tired.  The guys smoking out on the patio pre-supper isn't a particular attraction either.  That's the last thing the St. Clair Strip needs, another patio with sketchy smoking men.

If you are getting here early, the Breakfast Kitchen Bar offers an optimal experience for either breakfast or lunch and showcases a beautiful patio to enjoy when the weather when it is nice. Should you choose to come later, Dominick's Steakhouse is an upscale destination for your finer dining and cocktails.

While eyeing the menu, I decided on the rolled tacos.  In addition, I noticed they had not carne asada fries (they do serve them) but onion rings!  The picture of them looked spectacular!  They came in a small and large plate which my buddy agreed to share small order with me.

When it came time to place my order, I told the cashier I wanted the rolled tacos and the small order of carne onion rings.  She then told me the rings came in one size, large.  I congratulated her on up selling me and said let's do it.  I then ordered up a carne asade burrito with sour cream and cheese for my boss back at the office.  She told me (which I already knew) they were extra.  I told her that's fine.

We then took a seat and waited for our order.  I should have known something was up when another customer was arguing with the cashier about his order.  It created an awkward vibe.

When my order number was called out, I went to retrieve my lunch.  I then noticed instead of onion rings, I got fries plus there was no burrito.  The fries looked really good and I decided not to push the issue other than the location of the missing burrito.  

The cashier was smug thinking I had not ordered it even though the time lapse was only about eight to ten minutes.  She smirked at me and said ""where is your receipt?""  I told her I would be right back.  I brought it back and she took it to one of the cooks.  They stared at it before grabbing some wrapped up burrito of the counter.  The cook then unfolded and added the items I had previously paid for.

I can't lie...the food was good.  But the messed up service ruined the experience for me.

I really enjoyed my first visit here and, though I was overwhelmed, I felt like this place was the most organized shop of its kind that I've ever been to. It didn't feel dirty, cluttery or scary. Some things felt a little pricey for what they are, but it's vintage and I have no idea how things should be priced, I'm just cheap and have a love for vintage. 

There were some moments when I felt like I had wandered a little far into grandma's storage closet and peeked into the wrong corner. In other words, the sheets and curtains are in some tiny cubby holes that feel like I could end up in a weird Narnia. 

I fell in love with pretty much all of the furniture and ridiculously wonderful kitchen decor and appliances. I have a serious thing for canisters with green and yellow flowers on them...or brown and green...or orange...you get the picture. (I already have a seriously stunning set that I can barely find uses for, and I want more. Sigh. Practicality keeps whispering in my ear not to keep buying things I don't have room for in my apartment). There were plenty of temptations here for me and luckily I had just spent some money on drinks and dinner, so I wasn't in the mood to spend more, or else my kitchen would have gotten an entirely unnecessary makeover.",2011-09-05 21:38:19

The food quality and quantity is a little worse off than the other Asian Legend restaurants uptown (Richmond Hill, Markham, etc.). E.g. the xiao lung bao (small soup dumplings) have skin that's thicker and the Shanghai noodles are smaller, the chive ""cake"" has a thicker skin and is less tasty overall. Otherwise, the food has the same price and menu options as their other stores uptown.

The waiter/waitresses here are generally polite but seem to struggle with their English, and primarily communicate in Mandarin. The customer base here also seem very comfortable with communicating solely in Mandarin too. Note that the store itself is fairly small and a long rectangle with the washroom on the lower level down a very dark narrow hallway (which is mildly creepy seeming). Otherwise, if you're craving some Shanghai food, this is a decent option in the area.",2017-03-11 02:51:49

Later on it be like ""Damn, I need insulin!""

For those that aren't diabetic and plan on walking up and down the street all day or night, I guess a bag full of candy should help you with lots of extra energy with that unavoidable sugar rush.

This place is huge compared to some others on the strip. Your options here are pretty much endless and if you have way too much energy as a result of excessive sugar intake, well what do you know, there just happens to be Tao Nightclub across the way so maybe you can dance that extra energy away.

I can mention a few things here and there in regards to what they carry but I can pretty much guarantee you that they will have what you are looking for. You can go for the pick whatever you want and put it in a bag technique, which is charged by weight. Or you can just buy what ever is already pre packaged in boxes. 

In the end, you don't necessarily have to get anything if you are just checking the place out. If you must have to get something, I recommend getting the chocolate covered gummy bears. They are so good they literally melt in your mouth. Cue 50 Cent: ""I'll take you to the candy shop. I'll let you lick the lollipop. Whoa!""

Atmosphere: modern-casual meets elegant. 
Cleanliness: tables and chairs/benches are kept clean. disposable chopsticks! 
Constructive criticism: The Wakami salad should be a larger portion, and the Salmon Sashimi should be cut larger too. I wish there was steamed egg on the menu. Their Bulgogi dish should have more beef. Their Sweet & Sour sauce is very sour and is definitely not the typical sauce you see at other Asian restaurants.
Cuisine: Japanese.
Facilities: I did not use their facilities. 
Food: All You Can Eat (AYCE) - Dinner Menu! I ordered 10pcs of Salmon Sashimi (good), 1 dish of Bulgogi (good flavor), 1 dish of Sweet & Sour chicken (dressing was too sour - rancid, but chicken was good), 2 pcs of Cheese Wonton (excellent), 1 Red Dragon Roll (great).
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Will return, but not frequently due to distance from home. Will recommend to others because their food is tasty although is small portioned.
Parking: Private. 
Portion Sizes: small to fair. 
Price: fair to ok. I paid $28 with tip for one person dinner menu (because of the sashimi). Lunch for Adult $13.95 - Lunch for Senior $12.95, Lunch for Kids ages 7-10 $9.95, Lunch for Child ages 3-6 $5.95,  Dinner for adult $21.95, Dinner for Senior $19.95, Dinner for Kids ages 7-10 $14.95, Dinner for Child ages (3-6) $7.95.  Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays: Dinner (Adult) $22.95, Dinner (Senior) $20.95, dinner price for Kids and Children will remain the same
Service: I was immediately greeted when I walked in. I sat myself after given the option to select any open seat. Service is prompt, friendly. Not so knowledgeable of their own items available. Having to ask other servers what is inside their rolls.

Sprinkle it in dew
Cover it in chocolate 
and a miracle or two?

Smeeks!

Let me get this out of the way. There are two things that Smeeks is missing: A bike rack and Sammy Davis Jr.  The first should really be unforgiveable, especially for a hipster, indie, shopping mecca such as this corner is, but I will distribute blame to all of the shops and take in to consideration that they let me park my bike inside for a recent writing workshop I attended there and let it slide this once. As for item number two...well since he died of throat cancer in 1990 we will let that one go as well.

I went for a writing workshop after hours, last night. The workshop was based on writing about memories and they had a table loaded with chocolates, gummies, malt balls, candy cigarettes, button candy, any kind of treat to spur sweet memories so I had a chance to sample a wide variety of goods.

I have also been in to Smeeks several times on my own so this review is by no means based solely on a candy catered, one-night, sugar-rush.

Smeeks is adorable, it's charming, it's old-school but not geriatric. If personified it would be that fun yet classy older lady who you are surprised to find yourself fantasizing about.

My sweet tooth took over last night; it became Hyde to my dieting Jekyll, but ""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man."" so I gave in to temptation. I let my fingers gently grip ball after ball of smooth, thick chocolate covering the light crunch of malt. I tongued the candy cigarettes and let one dangle from my mouth doing my best James Dean pout. I sucked the chocolate from chocolate covered marshmallows followed by the sensation of the sugary delight disolving in my mouth. I was a kid in a candy store.

Smeeks is full of the hard to find. Each member of the group last night and each person i have ever entered the store with has found a candy that made them light up with recognition as they  rattled on about whatever childhood memory it had spurred, despite the fact I have never heard of most of them.

Let us not forget the novelties. Small toys, trinkets and a wall of bacon products. Not flavored, more of a wall for the worshipers of bacon. i wallet made to look like it is made from bacon, bacon magnets, notepads, bacon everything.

Based on early reviews it sounds like Smeeks got a rough start, but as Yelpers we have to love a place that does it right; a place that takes the issues of the people and listens then in turn improving until they are the 5 star establishment that they are today.",2010-01-29 17:41:43
0_i-wSnupSClOFYtuwMWSA,Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,XwmJBX-BMUq47zYaUeYjug,4,1,0,0,"51's baseball at Cashman Field is your chance to watch baseball in a more intimate setting and to watch some future talent. Noah Syndergaard was dominating here, got the call, and made his MLB debut on Tuesday. If you see Steven Matz as the listed pitcher, get your tickets to see him because he's dominating as well (7 2/3, 9 Ks last outing) and he's an injury or trade away from being the next to get the call.

Always look for promotions (kids carnival, jersey, and cap) before you buy your tickets. Firework nights are especially good. Sit on the first base line and you'll have a great view. We've actually been to Cashman for Fourth of July twice and they put on a decent 15 minute show. If you enter at the Washington entrance on the west side of the Cashman Center, you'll have less than a 5 minute walk to and from the park.

When you're in the park, expect a high scoring Pacific Coast League game. Also, expect to see and hear things that you won't from the upper deck or outfield bleachers of a major league park. The popping of gloves, the cracks of bats, the base coaches making ""back"" calls to base runners, umpires calling balls and strikes, and seeing the speed and breaks of pitches are all things that are bonuses of watching minor league ball in a smaller venue.

Because it's minor league ball expect minor league ticket prices, play (some of the errors really make you cringe), food, amenities, and entertainment. For me, all I need is a cold beer, a regular vendor that can replenish said beer frequently, a seat with a back, a cup holder, a dog, and a bag of peanuts. Just being able to watch professional baseball in Vegas makes me a fan and makes any other negative factor about Cashman quite tolerable.",2015-05-17 17:20:57

Since Levetto had really good reviews (which are well deserved) and an interesting take on Peking duck, I decided to come try this place out.

Since there was only two of us, we shared the Peking duck pizza and a salad. The salad was huge. There was nothing particularly special about it other than its size, but there's no complaints coming from me about more food.
While the Peking duck pizza was clever and tasty, I thought there was an excessive amount of scallions on it. It really took away flavour from the rest of the pizza, so I ended up scraping most of the scallions off. Otherwise, great new take on a cultural food!

I finally gave in and signed up online for one of those 7 day passes. The process from there was simple the website stated I would be contacted in the next couple of days by a trainer to set up a time to come in. Exactly that however it came as a text message initially and then a call. I ended up catching them on one of the deals where it was only $1 dollar to enroll and they would be waiving the normal set up fee. Okay I am a business man so I know all about marketing strategies and how to create attractive offers to get people in. I immediately asked Brian( he's awesome)  the trainer what was the ""fine print"" on this whole dollar deal because I'm no fool. He kept it real and explained everything to me in detail. I think the only thing I didn't really like was the fact that they ask for your payments to be ACH. They have it this way obviously because it's so much easier for people to change their card numbers rather than bank account numbers. The other thing about this non-contract membership is that it requires for you to provide them a 30 day notice to cancel? As if it's an apartment complex? Bases on the reviews they also charge you $15 to cancel your membership? During enrollment you know they make sure they don't mention that part though lol. But when I think about how much cheaper $15 is compared to the hundreds of dollars LVAC would charge to cancel your membership prematurely it's not that bad. Weird I don't know it's starting to feel like Spirit Airlines you know it's cheap until you really start to add stuff up.. I went with the middle level package because I don't like enough people to want to bring them on the gym pass unlimited. The fact that this gym is only going to run me $19.99 a month and it's close to home has the basic essentials of what I need I'll keep them...For now lol.

The place was also ""abuzz"" with the staff chomping and popping their gum, and singing and yowling their conversations across the salon.

The manicure was not the best and not the worst I've ever had.  The tech asked me a lot of nosy questions, like if I have a boyfriend.

We went on a Sunday evening; it wasn't crowded, but there were a few filled tables here and there.  The dining room isn't very impressive.  It's just one big room, and we felt they could really do more with the atmosphere.  Even throwing up Asian freestanding screens to section off the tables would be an improvement.  And perhaps taking a wet sponge to some of the walls.

We ordered two cups of soup to start, followed by five small items off their dim sum menu to share.  Their regular menu of Chinese dishes looks pretty extensive compared to their relatively small dim sum menu.  We weren't sure what all of the dim sum dishes were, but we knew enough to steer clear of anything with the word ""feet"" in its title.  

After ordering on the slow Sunday night, we waited for what seemed a bit too long.  Finally, the first dim sum item came out and we guessed the soups would follow later.  We were just glad to have some food finally.  The first item was a dish of shrimp and pork stuffed dumplings.  They tasted fantastic and were so full of meat.  Next came some sesame seed balls/buns, stuffed pepper, steaming hot spring rolls, and stuffed bean curd (tofu).   All were good, but I'd single out the dumplings and sesame seed balls/buns and definitely would order these again.  

Still no soup, though.  We waited a long time for our server to return after we'd eaten everything and when she finally did, she brought the check.  We figured we weren't getting any soup, which was fine at this point.  That is until it appeared on the bill.   I mentioned it to the server and she apologized and brought out the soup.  I still wanted to taste their hot and sour soup.  It was good and better than most, but I still have to say that my favorite is at Jo Jo's China Bistro, even though that's not technically an ""authentic"" Chinese restaurant.  

I'd give Dim Sum a second chance, but I'd probably just order off their regular menu or get take-out.  It looks like they have some pretty good inexpensive lunch items, too.",2011-11-08 14:27:14

The restaurant is located on the side of the building. When we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by the host who directed us to our table. We were the first ones to arrive in the restaurant. The restaurant itself had dimmed lighting with opera playing in the baxkground, so the atmosphere was more fit for a romantic dinner. They have a very good selection of food on the menu, ranging from cheese board (choose three for $18), appetizer, entree and main course. They also have a very large selection of wine, 6 menu pages worth. Each item had a small description at the bottom helping diners understand exactly what it is that they're ordering. The menu had the current date stamped on it. The waitress explained to us that the menu changes almost everyday as the head chef wants to serve the freshest ingredients that the market has to offer each day. 

We ordered the pizza with spicy pork sausage, gnocchi, and sauteed new brunswick scallops. The waitress informed us that it will come in the order of pizza, gnocchi, and lastly, the seared scallops. The pizza was served on a neat little cutting board, with a pair of scissors for cutting the pizza. Now note that this is not your typical Americanized pizza. This pizza was longer and thinner. The crust was paper thin, topped with tomato, basil, and the in house spicy pork sausage. It was light, and each bite was packed with incredible flavour. Next came the gnocchi. The serving size of the gnocchi was much smaller than expected, we received a total of 5 pieces of gnocchi. However, each was filled with pesto sauce inside. When you bite into it, the pesto sauce bursts in your mouth. The gnocchi had a good bite to it, with a hint of cheese. Lastly, we received the scallop dish. The plating of these scallops was impeccable. Everything on the plate from the sauce to the scallops were aligned perfectly. The combination of the scallop sauce + scallop created this perfect harmony. I had requested for the sorbet trio to be served at the end of our meal as the ""birthday dessert"". They brought out the chocolate, basil, vanilla sorbet with a lighted candle. The sorbets were incredible ! They were all so so light and refreshing. 


As we waited for our bill to come, the manager came over to our table with a box with the date stamped on it. It was given to us as a birthday gift. Inside the box, there was fresh pasta, pasta sauce and cheeses to go with it. We made it for dinner the following night, it was such a wonderful and sweet little gift.

So the service started out good, lady was nice when you walked in but if you are not Korean you dont' get any service, no steamed egg, no soup (don't think I want the soup either, saw a waitress taste one with the spoon and put the spoon back in then brought it another table). We got three sides and the kimchee smelled fishy, I have eaten a lot of kimchee and this is the first that smelled like that, they didn't even give us the soy sauce dip till we asked for it. 

Service at all asian places suck but this is below bad, what if you have never tried korean BBQ before, do you not get the banchan? 

As for the meat selection, it's a joke for AYCE, 
-One order of short ribs allowed, it was not good
-One order of sirloin and it was chewy
-Bugolgi was way too sweet and really fatty
-Brisket,  only thing edible 
Did not try the rest, just stuck with the brisket since the rest was so bad.

I've been dying for Pork Belly Tacos and they were delicious, but I kinda feel like the taco part goes to waste, because all I ate was the pork belly and watermelon. Tender, juicy little nice size bites of sweet, unctuous pork with a piece of cool, sweet watermelon. Yum fuckin O!! We also had the Cheese platter with apricot preserves and toast points. Nice portions of Blue, Goat, Manchego, and Boucheron.  So good. Had to ask for more toast points, we ran out. We also ordered a sushi called the Dragon Roll. It was some kind of fish, tempura shrimp, cream cheese. and the fish was fresh, flavor was on point, so FN good!!!. My dessert was the Chocolate Brioche with Vanilla Ice cream swimming in what tasted like the best chocolate milk you ever had. I couldnt finish it, but I will next time.

Parking: easy enough. Plenty of metered street parking that becomes free at 8. Pay lot across the street for $5. Also very close to the light rail stop. B+.

Food: Decent. Priced right. Had the barbacoa burrito and it was pretty tasty--better than Chipotle's, anyway. Good chips/salsa too. Wouldn't go out of our way to eat here, but if you're there and you're hungry, eat up. B.

Bathrooms: There is a one-seater in the lounge (sucks for the people just hanging out in the lounge--the line can get long) and a large, extremely clean one in the music venue area. Never had to wait in line or hold my breath. A.

Drinks: We were there the night they were sort of creating the Honey Badger and were lucky enough to be given a free sample. Hooked. They do cocktails right there. A.

Beer selection: Meh. Probably the only thing I'm going to find to complain about is the beer selection. Two bars--one in the lounge and one in the venue--and they have slightly different beers on tap. So you can get a Hoegarten in the venue but not in the lounge. They have a Sierra Nevada on tap along with a couple of Four Peaks beers and Stella (I think) and that's it for the taps. A few more crappy domestic canned selections rounds it out. I think they could do a lot better here.  You're using local chefs that use local ingredients to create menus here--why not take advantage of the local beer scene? Four Peaks is overused and overrated as far as I'm concerned, but people like it (I get it). How about some Sonoran? Prescott brewing? Nimbus?  C.

The good:
1. They have an excellent value-priced lunch combo here for $10.  For that ten dollars, you get your choice of soup or salad and your choice of a small (which is HUGE) personal pizza, a calzone or a pasta dish.  That is AWESOME value.  
2. They have good draught beers (which are not that cheap)
3. Their patio looks really cool but I haven't enjoyed any beverages out there yet.
4. Staff was good

The bad:
1. I didn't like my food.  I am torn between 2 or 3 stars here... because the lunch combo for $10 is SO good on paper.
2. I had a salad, which was mostly dandelion leaves.  It SAID dandelion in the menu, but I thought that that meant there would be a FEW yellow flowers in the salad, but really, it was a BIG plate (did I mention they have very generous portions?) of dandelion LEAVES, with olive oil and sea salt.  Sondra had soup instead of salad, and it looked REALLY good, and I should have had that.
3. Pizza - the pizza does not come cut into slices.  This was a huge WTF to me and it really pissed me off.  They had el-cheapo steak knives at the table which we all struggled to use to cut our pizzas.  My pizza was also pretty weak.  It was skimpy on the toppings and the prosciutto was in huge, whole piece slabs, that further frustrated my attempts at slicing the dang thing up.  Again, Sondra had gnocci and it looked stellar so maybe I just got the wrong thing.

Overall, I would go here on a sunny day and check out the patio for beers, but I probably wouldn't get food (even though at lunch it's very affordable).",2009-06-23 20:40:29

I haven't posted a review in a while and thought this was definitely my opportunity so why not!  I'm a huge believer in the Downtown revitalization and support new and existing businesses.  This place is fairly new and has had some good reviews, so I was excited.

When you walk in you notice the clean ""D Grill"" logo, which I liked.  Turn the corner inside and you'll see a huge focal point: Charlie Brown zigzag pattern lining the walls, accompanied with forks and spoons lining the actual pattern. There's a black and orange color scheme. The colors on the ground are black, white and tan brown. The middle booths have high backs to break up the room.  The tables are a 50's themed brown and metal.  To me, it's a modern twist to a diner-grill.  Pretty cool, liked it a lot.  Our server, Susana, was really nice and accommodating.  I told her up front that we wanted our checks split at the end and she was more than willing to do so!  

For dinner, I got the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut for $18.95.  At first, I thought it was a little steep in price for a downtown grill, however, I was willing to try it out.  It came with a basket of rolls.  They reminded me of a less dense version of a garlic knot.  The flavor was good, however, the roll itself seemed a little old and stale.  With my dinner, I had the choice of soup of salad.  I chose the side salad with balsamic vinaigrette on the side.  The salad was just iceberg and spring mix with one wedge of tomato. The balsamic vinaigrette didn't seem fresh, just your ordinary manufactured dressing.  Then came the main course.  Btw, it came super fast so I was happy about that.  At first, I was a little turned off by the plate presentation.  Very ordinary and didn't seem like a $20 plate.  Looks are definitely deceiving.  This place came with halibut, rice and veggies. The veggies were mixed veggies (broccoli and carrots).  They were steamed and then sautéed with garlic and butter.  In the middle of the plate was a scoop of white rice with a chive garnish.  Then there's the fish accompanied with an orange ginger sauce.  The veggies were cooked very nicely and really complimented the dish.  Wasn't too much of a fan of the rice.  I preferred more of a stickier white rice, this one was a little dry.  The fish was definitely the star of the show.  Perfectly cooked, lightly crusted and delicious.  The orange ginger sauce really took the fish to a whole new level.  I was impressed.  

All in all, I really liked my first visit here.  Definitely worth going back.  I'm excited to try other things like the burger or other salads.  If you're on Fremont, come check them out!  It's a great surprise :)",2013-07-01 03:18:08

I think I would have appreciated it if there were some sort of live music somewhere, and Frank Marino himself performed something.  He's pretty much just the MC for this show and does comedy routines, all while literally doing a costume change in between each act, and there were many of them.  He looked pretty good but I would have liked to see him dress up as something other than Joan Rivers.

My husband, however, acted as if he found out that Santa Claus wasn't real when he said to me, ""I think they are lip syncing.""  When I told him that's what they do at these drag queen shows, he was so disappointed and didn't enjoy himself at all.  Earlier this year, we had seen the Edwards Twins downtown, who not only dress up and look like the celebrities they perform, but they actually sing and were extremely talented.  The Divas show didn't hold a candle to the Edwards Twins, even though they only played in an Irish pub on Fremont Street.  So he went in to this show thinking it would be the same thing on a grander scale.  You can see why he was so disappointed.

The performers did an ok job looking like the celebrity ""divas"" they were impersonating but none of them except one really tried to look like they weren't lip syncing.  It was annoying.  The Britney Spears performer creeped us out the most because he looked dead on like her.  And then when he stripped off his jacket and was running around in a bikini like outfit, yikes.

Anyway, I'm not a huge fan of pop music and the phenomenon of the diva performers such as Beyonce, Lady Ga Ga, Britney, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, etc.  I love hard rock.

THE FOOD:  Perhaps I'm spoiled for guacamole, having had a bona fide Texan as a college roomate, but the guac here is merely good, not mindblowing.  The tomatillo sauce was very, very tasty, but not as hot as we had been warned.  I liked the idea of the taquitos-- smaller, fajita style dishes.  After the inevitable flight of guac, there is not room for much else.  The pork chop with mole was very good, as were the accompanying tamale hush puppies.

The margueritas were fantastic.  I had a cactus flower and a blood orange.  I can't decide which was better.  Both had bright flavors that were not hidden by excessive sour mix.   Mon cher chou's cucumber  margurita was really tasty-- that was unexpected.  La famille du chou loved the traditional gold margueritas.

THE SERVICE:  Fabulous.  The waiter was knowledgeable and the staff, gracious.  They did tend to overestimate the heat factor of the dishes.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  Reminiscent of a Los Straightjackets concert-- in the best possible way.",2008-12-30 00:38:28

The drink menu is pretty standard and not in a bad way. I got the Mexi-Mocha when I stopped in. Sadly I couldn't stick around too long tho I would've liked to.

Food- 
A complementary seafood salad amuse-bouche started the meal off on a highpoint. It was light, fresh, and extremely tasty. Next we moved on to some  french bread which I found to be disappointingly dry though the olive oil and balsamic were high quality.  

The Ravioles de Veau au Beurre de Truffe (homemade veal ravioli with cream sauce) was outstanding! By far some of the best homemade pasta I have ever eaten, the flavors were both delicate and complex. I may purchase two of these as my meal next time! 

Our main course was the filet and  it  wasn't as memorable unfortunately. The filet had a reduction with cherries in it ( though it didn't mention this on the menu) but the flavor was too sweet for my taste. I opted for garlic mashed potatoes which were very creamy but lacked salt (coming from someone who is a known under-salter this says a lot). 

The dessert was the main reason for a non-five star review (since the ravioli absolutely earned 5 stars) we had salted caramel ice cream with puffed pastry and apples. It sounds mouthwatering but honestly the caramel was either burned or their was a liquor that wasn't cooked off...I couldn't even eat it though I will say my boyfriend did. 

Service was excellent - friendly and knowledgeable. 

 Wine list - only bottle prices are listed, if you drink by the glass you have no idea what you're going to end up with...which was my case. 

Atmosphere- As others have said it was a bit stark. They need to dim the lights, play some soft music (they were playing something you might find at Azteca) and perhaps make it a little more cozy. 

I will return for the ravioli because it was THAT good!",2012-06-04 12:36:17

We haven't had French food for awhile, so I picked Simple Bistro, which I've read good reviews on yelp.

The complimentary bread was super dense, so we didn't enjoy it very much.  Even the delicious butter couldn't save it.

My mom loves oysters, so we ordered the feature of the day- Beau Soleil Oysters ($9 for 3). I can't recall what's in the mignonette, but I remember that the oysters were sweet and fresh.

Grilled Ontario Harvest sweetbread with roasted St. David's red pepper marmalade ($14). We loved the red pepper marmalade. The sweetbread was fine, but I prefer the deep-fried version. 

Everspring Farms duck terrine with Bumper Crop asparagus, pickled rhubarb, Kozlik's mustard, toast ($11). The duck was quite pleasant, but the mustard was really intense- one little dab of it overwhelmed everything!

Wild Atlantic diver scallops on barley and nettle risotto, samphire, double-smoked bacon crumble ($26). This was my favourite course of the evening. The texture of the barley was perfectly for a risotto, and I loved that delicious green sauce. The scallops were cooked nicely and the bacon crumble provided a nice crunch. 

Pudding Chômeur- Warm nutmeg cake, Calvados maple cream, brown butter ice cream (normally $9, but if you order an appetizer and main course, they'll take $5 off your dessert!) I can never resist ordering a pudding chômeur because of my love for warm gooey desserts. This one was a lot better than my experience at The Drake Hotel last time, but it didn't blow my mind away either. I guess I'm still on the search for the perfect pudding chômeur!

I went here for breakfast with my normal group of ""Dining Friends"".  We go to restaurants all over the valley just to try something new.  The service can best be described as untrained monkeys aimlessly running around.  There was no organization, no method to the madness.  Our orders were messed up not once, not twice, but 3 times!! As a matter of fact, I am the only person that received the correct meal.  

Tim received the wrong thing.  He ordered oatmeal and got a parfait.  Then when his oatmeal came out, it was piled high with parfait items that he didn't want or order.  We got this fixed.  

Jessica's meal was super spicy.  Nothing abnormal here except she specifically asked if it was spicy because she has issues with too much heat in a meal and was told no.  At this point she ate part of my meal because we were so disgusted by this time, no one wanted to order anything else.  

James's meal came out wrong.  He ordered the meat version and got the veggie.  Not the biggest deal, but with strike 3 we asked for the manager.  Here comes the best part....Our waitress is the ""Head Waitress"" and the one in charge.  No other managers.  So we explain to her all of the issues and she walks away to get James his meal. She comes right back to explain that it wasn't her fault, the runner grabbed the wrong meal.  She spent SEVERAL minutes blaming everyone except the cable repair man for everything that went wrong.

Now again, mistakes happens and can be forgiven.  What can NOT be forgiven is the way we were treated.  The waitress went through great lengths to blame shift all of the issues on other people.  Never once did she apologize or try to really make the situation better.  It was all about her being in the right.  I guess I feel a little better knowing we were not the only ones treated that way based on one of our neighbors hearing our plight, striking up a conversation with us about a similar experience.  We could also hear random conversations from other tables.  NOT a happy day.  Perhaps a dedicated front of house manager could solve some of these issues.

I have made several jokes since then about trying this place again. I just find it hard to believe that EVERYTHING could go so bad in one sitting.  However, I refuse to spend my money at a place that obviously does not respect the people who show patronage.",2015-10-12 22:24:30

I haven't had showmars in a couple years and decided to rejuvenate my taste buds since I was craving mediterranean food. My review will be based on my experience at this location:

Cons:
1. Don't expect to find a parking spot at this location, especially during busy lunch hours. 
2. Drive through line is so long it wraps around the entire store, so you may as well just park your car across the street at the CVS and walk over to dine inside.
3. There will not be enough indoor seating, so expect to have to sit on the outside patio. This may be less tempting in the hot Charlotte summers. 
4. I ordered the gyro platter, it was a mistake! I've never been to a mediterranean place that served my gyro in separate pieces, meaning the pita was separate from my meat. Did I mention there was no veggie for my pita, the picture on there menu looks nothing like the food I got. All I got was a piece of pita by itself and a cup of beef strips. 

Neutral:
1. Wait time, I waited about 10-15 minute for my order...which could be a tad faster seeing it's a fast food chain

Pros:
1. Great dining booths and interior decoration for a fast food joint. seriously, the inside looked like a sit down restaurant, great that they also have patio seating option. 
2. Sanitation score is not bad, 96.5
3. Their daily specials
4. Milkshakes are only $2.75 (Did not taste test to see if any good so I cannot comment on quality)

Tip:
-Check the board for their daily specials!! I cannot emphasize this enough. I wish I had just gotten the chicken gyro with fries which was a special going on for the day for just $5.69...The chicken gyro itself is worth $.5.29 already on the regular menu so this is a great deal. They have more than just gyros on special, they also have soup, salad etc.
-If you want yummy authentic greek food, try greco fresh grille on Rea Rd, 10x better! Oh, need I mention that the price is just as competitive as showmars?",2013-05-17 18:46:23

The food was okay, but not fabulous (it's no Komol).  My seafood curry had a good amount of seafood bits in it, but it was WAY too much liquid.  It was like soup.  My husband got the roast duck pad thai, and that was pretty good.  Big portion.

The show featured 4 comedians: Chuck Bortel, Gary Cannon, Craig Gass, & Jay Mohr, who's been my fave since the 90's, making his start in small clubs & eventually, Saturday Night Live.

This particular event, I had upgraded seats to the 2nd row & a VIP All-Access pass to hang out with the aforementioned Jay Mohr. I got to be one of many to drink Holmberg Bound, Holmberg's IPA beer, which the proceeds from it went to the AZ Humane Society.  

I found this theater to be very accessible & easy for me to get around in, although the one negative was the minimal leg room & crappy fall-down cupholders that even with the bar underneath secured, it still doesn't guarantee you won't spill or lose your drink at some point while enjoying the entertainment.
I got to watch the show from the main walkway, & afterward? Hung out with Jay Mohr in his dressing room, which is a very nice, immaculate room that was stocked with Jay's favorites: Coca Cola in cans, bottled water, Orange Gatorade, & bananas.

A fun night with a great guy (Jay Mohr), & a bunch of amazing radio peeps (the KUPD gang) made for an AMAZING experience for yours truly! Thank you John Holmberg & KUPD!",2018-01-17 01:41:49

Cityscape is a great thought. There are some gems.

Arrived at the self parking structure via the entrance off Flamingo. The walk from the parking structure to the lobby is a relatively short jaunt by Vegas hotel standards. *note* there is a lot of construction going on due to the Linq project, so be mindful of the signs when approaching the hotel. 

The regular check-in line was a little long so we opted for the new self check-in kiosks. The automated system allows you to choose what room you'd like, but doesn't offer any helpful tidbits like what elevators you should take, or how far the room would be from the elevator, etc. Overall, nice option if you are in a rush, but I'd still prefer some human interaction at check-in. 

We stayed in a recently renovated Fab room, which was a modest renovation of their old room product. The room was functional and clean. I think it is the first Vegas room that I've ever stayed in that didn't have carpeted floors in the bedroom. The bathroom didn't appear to be renovated, but was clean. Opt for the nicer Go room product if you want to splurge a little bit. If you are a lighTrt sleeper, be sure to request rooms far away from the Linq construction (jackhammers and the like continuing well into the wee hours of the morning). 

Overall, the hotel is in a great location (mid-strip), has a classic Vegas vibe (meaning its not new and super lux, but a little gritty and flashy), and is relatively inexpensive when compared to some of its neighbors. It's not a bad option, but certainly not the best. When comparing with other hotels in this price range, look to the Tropicana or Monte Carlo outside of the Caesars fold (Ballys, and Harrahs within).",2013-01-11 19:48:35

As a consumer there are pros and cons to Sephora

Con:
The sales staff can have an elitist ""attitude"" and are not always very friendly. This can vary so look for the sweet girl who is smiling and willing to help.

The goal is to sell sell sell and make sales goals so they want you to buy the most expensive items. This too can vary because the staff consider themselves pros and may direct you to what they use. The trick is to sit down and take the time to try before you buy. Have them apply your new makeup choices, wear it around for awhile then see how you like it. They can also write down everything used so you can buy some now and return for the rest. They don't always WANT to do this but just ask outright. It's the job. 

Tip going on a quiet day will ensure much better service and detailed explanations.

Pros: They are well trained on all the make up/skincare, and can usually answer any question you may have. These days consumers are looking for organic products, paraben free, sensitive hypoallergenic and they will know what lines to direct you to. 

They are makeup artists with extensive training so they will know what shades work with your face shape, and skin tones! Watch what they are doing or ask them to explain the application process. 

Lastly I also work at a Medspa and work with many skin conditions melasma, sun damage, rosacea, mild to severe acne, and others. Makeup sits on top of the skin so don't cover up the problems treat them before they get out of hand. Over the counter brands may be cheaper and you can get buy with cheap eye shadow or lip gloss but don't skimp on your face products( foundations, powders, cleansers, moisturizers) because you may be making the problems worse.

Take it from me I get a lot of free products but when I find what works I have to go out and spend that money, and no I don't always get a discount.",2011-03-31 15:54:39

Pho Bo Broth is the most bland I've ever tasted.

The drinks are good but what sets this place apart is the spacious, clean atmosphere and decor. It's a great place to get work done, chill, go on a date, etc - there aren't many cafes like this in Markham.

One thing I would like to see added to the menu are savoury snacks. I ordered the Taro Milk Tea and was looking for something savoury to snack on, but there wasn't anything offered. I had to settle with an oatmeal raisin cookie and almost got diabetes. 

I know this isn't Green Grotto, but if they could add popcorn/popcorn chicken that would be bomb. You can't be offering Taiwanese drinks without the snacks - that's like giving someone a bottle of beer without the bottle opener. Or perhaps they could add something healthy-I asked the barista which of their offerings was the healthiest and was met with silence.

Another bonus is that they have a good playlist, so kudos to their playlist-maker.",2017-07-14 02:03:28

""You have to check this place out,"" she said.

I arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation, and got to meet one of the managers, Gary White.

""If you have a few minutes, let me show you around.""

""Lead the way,"" I replied.

Gary took me downstairs to a VIP room.  Inside was a long table covered with white cloth; probably big enough for 20 to 30 people.  Also inside the room were a state of the art sound system, and a huge plasma TV.  Mr. White explained to me how he could personalize any party, from the music to the cuisine.

""You can also have your own personal wait-staff; we assure total privacy in this room.""

I'm sure there had been many VIP's, as well as famous personalities in this room, but Mr. White wouldn't spill the beans. 

Outside the VIP room was a large glass cabinet filled with VSOP Cognac, and other top-shelf liquors.  If you're looking for specialized spirits or imported champagne, they have it in their liquor inventory at Savoy.

The third floor had another private room, as well as a second bar (the first one located on the main floor where the dining room was).  Hard wood floors adorned this area; all the materials including the DJ's sound system, and bathroom fixtures were top-shelf.  Large glass doors lead to a patio area that becomes busy during the warm summer months.

Ambiance

Savoy is an extravagant space.  The décor is tasteful and modern.  The dining room has several tables as well as booth seating.  The oversized booths are covered in supple, white leather.  The sides of the booths rise several feet above the surrounding tables, assuring total and complete privacy.  Indirect lighting covered the soft white tablecloths with warm, magnificent colors. 
 
Food

Prior to placing our food order, a large basket of bread was placed on our table with herb-infused olive oil- a nice start as we looked over our menus.

To start, I chose a Caesar salad ($10.00), and we also asked for the Trio Appetizer Plate ($14.00) consisting of a Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, Arugula Salad and Warm Vegetable Strudel.

The salad had great tasting traditional Caesar dressing, and the romaine leaves were fresh and sweet.  Large homemade croutons lay atop the salad and were a nice crunchy contrast.

The Appetizer Trio was next.

The lump crab cake was deliciously fresh and loaded with large chunks of sweet crab meat.  Spicy arugula was dressed with a honeyed dressing, and perfectly balanced.  The vegetable strudel had a crunchy crust, and was filled with a tasty medley of lightly cooked and well-seasoned vegetables.

Executive Chef Kevin Watson made his way to our table, and made a few entree suggestions.

Even with the Chef's recommendations, we had a tough time picking entrées. We chose the Stuffed Salmon ($35.00) filled with Jumbo Lump Crab Meat and Shrimp, served with a Lemon Dill Beurre Blanc sauce, and Yukon Whipped Potatoes.  Our second entrée was Butter Poached Lobster & Scallop Pasta ($36.00) in Fresh Basil Cream Sauce served over Pappardelle Pasta.

The salmon was cooked a flawless medium-rare, and was topped with a hefty portion of lump crab meat.  Atop the salmon was a luscious and fragrant dill buerre blanc sauce- delicious.  Buttery Yukon mashed potatoes, and a purple orchid completed the dish. 

The butter poached lobster came in a large white bowl.  A colossal scallop caught my attention...  Large portions of lobster and the remaining scallops were coated in a rich, but composed cream sauce with fresh basil.  The lobster was succulent (it was cooked in butter after all) and tasted salty like the ocean.  Equally enjoyable were the seared scallops.  Large flat noodles were mixed throughout the dish, picking up the remaining flavors in the food.  Although it was a rich dish, the freshness of the seafood offset any possible heaviness.

After all this rich food, we almost passed up dessert.  Luckily we re-considered, and ordered a digestif; a sweet ice wine to go with our Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding ($10.00).

The bread pudding was eggy and rich; served with fresh apples and a quenelle of homemade ice cream.  The small glass of chilled wine paired well with the yeasty dessert.

Conclusion

Savoy is a sophisticated and elegant restaurant.  Besides being an eatery, Savoy has exclusive accommodations for private engagements.  

The managers at Savoy are client-driven.  The personalized attention and ambiance offered there is rivaled only by clubs and lounges in large cities such as New York, Chicago or Los Angeles. 

If you're looking for a restaurant with delicious food in a sophisticated setting, make your way to Savoy in the Strip.

We had chocolate, vanilla, lemon and even red velvet. The kids thought the cupcakes were yummy and my wife and I agreed that they are much better than Sprinkles - where they use a very heavy batter.

As a family owned and run shop, the service was very friendly and we talked about how many new businesses are going in at the intersection of Bethany and 16th Street. With new bars, restaurants, shops, a gym and even a kids gymnastic business, it's really becoming one of the gems of North Central Phoenix. Having a delicious cupcake shop is just an added benefit!

Plus, they don't just do cupcakes, they can do full cakes for weddings, birthday parties, anniversaries and they'll even do character cupcakes.

I could always count on excellent taste and service at the Luchita's on W. 117th in Cleveland (and a now-closed operation in Mentor). The menu went past the usual AmeriMex to include more authentic choices.

Went to the Hudson Luchita's on a Thursday evening. With the restaurant half-full, I was led past many empty tables to a spot right next to the (cold-leaking) window. Service was brusque. Menu was more limited than the others, which wasn't promising.

The cheese-and-poblano tamales were odd. Two tamales, one covered with red sauce and one with green, but slopped together so the sauces mostly blended. The red-sauced tamale had a very thin vein of filling, perhaps shoelace-sized, with a few shreds of poblano and threads of cheese. I had to go through 80% of the length of the other one before I finally found two shreds of pepper and a small glob of cheese; most of it was just cornmeal all the way through. Dry cornmeal.

My main course was the tinga de pollo, which was one of my faves from Mentor. But when I lifted a forkful of this tinga, I revealed a deep pool of watery liquid. The chicken itself was extremely salty, masking other flavors.

A minor point, but the waitress did that annoying thing where, when you agree to a water refill, she whisks away your half-full glass and you have to wait for her to putter around the other tables before you finally get it back. And then she stuck it at the far end of the table from me -- literally up to the edge.",2014-02-09 22:21:54

Often when a great little places branches out and goes in to the pseudo chain food business some flavor is lost, but not in this case.

For the launch party we had a special menu with limited options which meant i was forced to try something other than my usual favorites. 

We started with the cheesey bread. Garlic bread covered in cheese, what is not to love with a side of marinara. If it were up to me this would get a bit of browning time under the salamander.

For my main I split a deep dish with mushrooms. It was pretty good very different than the usual thin crust I get. But be warned a deep dish takes 40 min plus to cook.

We also had a salad with fried onions on top, it had a sweet and spicy dressing that was very interesting, the hot fried onions on top did heat up the lettuce a bit so a chilled plate would be a good idea next time.

What does look great about this spot is over the original one is the ample parking and patio full of fire pits and places.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the Dim-Sum here, and let's put that statement in perspective--I have lived in San Francisco (home of world's best dim sum) and I'm from New York--a close second contender. I am not some burger-chomping novice---though I do love a good burger.

We ordered the chinese broccoli, the shrimp with chives dumplings (way better than the plain shrimp ones which we also ordered) the stuffed eggplant, the bean curd skin roll, the shrimp rice roll and the fried sesame balls. My only real complaint is the price--which was more than 20 dollars per person. However, we left feeling stuffed and elated. The people next to us ordered crab rangoon though, just to give you an idea of the uphill battle for good food in Pittsburgh.

I get why they have to do that but just expected more gelato focus for a place with gelato in the name, but definitely worth visiting regardless.

Parking can be a bit of a challenge in this area so it may be best to find a spot along Marine Parade Dr then walk up through the courtyard between the condos near the Firkin and Eden.

Sure enough, within minutes, he and his team cleared off a neighboring table and pushed it together with one of ours so we could all sit together and enjoy our delicious food and drinks.

It was mid-week at about 6:30ish at night.  The place was not busy at all.  We were greeted right away by the hostess who seated us quickly at the table of our choice.

To start I shared the soft pretzel bread which comes with mustard but the waiter suggested we also get the melted brie to dip it in.  We decided what the heck because we didn't know at the time that it was an $8 bowl of cheese.  Anyway, the pretzel break was ok at best as you could clearly tell that it had been previously frozen and recently thawed out upon our order of it.

For an entree I ordered the burger (bun-less of course because I had the pretzel bread) with cheese, sauteed onions and mushrooms.  Our orders took a while to arrive which I guess was good because it could have meant that our meals were prepared fresh.

My burger was excellent.  It was cooked properly, was juicy and had plenty of onions and mushrooms on top.  The most interesting part was that it was a rectangular burger.  I don't know if that is good or bad or if it made it taste any better, but it is unique nonetheless. 

I was a bit surprised at the bill when we were charged for the cheese for the pretzel bread which we were led to believe was included.  It also seemed like we were charged an over-the-top amount for each burger topping and for subbing out the fries for a side salad.

So here we are at Ruth Chris an ancient Restaurant when it comes to elite Steak Restuarant's in Pittsburgh! I'm thinking they have been here over 25 years Downtown! So how do they stack up against the New Steak Restaurants like the Capital Grill, Eddie Merlot's, Morton's, Eddie V's etc. Their Steak ""The reason why you came"" is a 3.4/4 Star - it was juicy, lean, flavorful with Character and priced within reason! Their sides were the weakness! So much attention to the Steak the supporting cast was slightly less than stellar! The decor was bright with enough room between seating that a conversation could take place without disturbing the next table! The Service with staff was Great although a stench of cigarette smoke could be noticed from a Gentleman clearing our table! Our Drinks were OK but nothing refreshing or talking about!

I have been here several times and never had to wait for a table -- the restaurant is huge. 

I typically order the tableside guacamole which is hands down THE BEST guacamole  . It is expensive but they make a lot of it and it's absolutely delicious. Last night I ordered the queso with ground beef -- sooo yummy. My boyfriend and I ordered another round of chips just to finish it -- and we didn't even get close. It was so filling that by the time my entree came I was pretty full.

I always get the same thing here -- beef fajitas with no beans, extra rice, and a side of shredded jack cheese. The beef here tastes like pretty good quality and is flavored perfectly. They give you a lot of food. I usually have one fajita and take the rest home.

When I'm in the mood to drink I love their mojitos -- they are all amazingly good. A bit pricey but you get a huge, tall drink. 

The only downside to Cantina Laredo is their dessert selection. I'm not a fan of any desserts they offer. However, my boyfriend loves the flan. He is from Argentina and says it's very well-done.",2012-07-23 01:01:08

They do have a good food, good service and good atmosphere. 
I like they way they have plenty space on their dinning place, it's not to crowded with tables and chairs so it's easy to walk arround. 
They have a place in the middle with a small band, I think they have a live music but I don't know when. When I was there, They put a nice soft music, it's not to loud so we still can talk normal without screaming.
All the server had a good attitude..So nice,their smile, polite, kept refill our water. 

Their spiciness level from 1 (not spicy) - 10 ( spicy). I love spicy food so I ordered spicy #8, even thou I can feel the heat but I add their thai chili vinegar + dry chili + chili sauce. I ordered beef pad see(z) ew ($ 10.99)..Flat noodle stir with soy sauce + scramble eggs + chinese broccoli + beef. 
My co workers had chicken drunken noodle ( $ 10.99), beef pad thai ($10.99), chicken yellow curry ( $ 10.99), fried rice ( $ 10.99) also we shared crispy spring roll (egg roll $ 9.99), Garlic shrimp ( $17.99). For me their fried rice to much black pepper but my coworker like it like that.
Their garlic shrimp had a good flavour but I wish the shells have more crunch so easy to eat, a little bit to hard.

Consequently, I am here on a regular basis.

I have stopped by at all times of the day - lunch, happy hour, and dinner.

What I have eaten - burgers, pizza, appetizers - all have been good, but not outstanding.  However, the portions are large and filling.

What stands out are their beers.  Beside my two favorites, the IPA's are solid, and their specialty beers are outstanding.  

Although it can get rushed at times, I have always had great service.  My only criticism is that sometimes they do not schedule correctly, and the poor servers are running to keep up.  They do a wonderful job, but you can tell that they have to many tables to serve.

It was a Sunday night so that means it was time for a our family trip for chain Italian food. 

We started the meal with a pizza as an app, The wild mushroom pizza $12.99. A bit steep for an app, but their app selection is quite limited. The pizza seemed a bit soggy by time it arrived with our meals, the mushrooms were good, but the cheese had congealed..

For my main I stayed on the mushroom kick and got the mushroom ravioli with red sauce an vein attempt to be healthy. $11.99. It was good enough with copious amounts of Parmesan cheese and red pepper. nothing special.

I ordered the Baba Ghanough, Fatouche salad, Lamb skewers and an order of ""the best Falafels in Toronto"". 

While the flavours were authentic for the most part: the baba Ghanough was bland, the Falafels were dry and seemed re-heated and not fresh. The lamb flavour was so strong you could tell it had no marinade of any sort (but maybe that's what they're going for -- also the skewer portions were incredibly small, my sister couldn't help but laugh to herself when it came to the table). The highlight of the entire meal was the salad which was refreshing and helped balance the strong musky flavour of the lamb. To be fair, we had a wonderful experience non-food-wise as the service was as everyone had reported: friendly and attentive. As I've mentioned, I really wanted to like this place more.

A family-owned donut shop, and very good, when you are there at the right time! Working swing-shift for 11 years, and living in the general area, i'd get donuts from here weekly. I live on the other side of town, the past few years, so I get them quite infrequently now. But,  while they are 24/7, they make the goodies in the middle of the night and that's IT. If you get there at 12 midnite, you'll get a possibility of some fresh made...But you might get a few no-so-fresh ones. Consider it the Vegas gamble, ya know?

If you get there after 4am, your selection will be glorious! A treat they make daily are French crullers, with either chocolate, vanilla or maple glazes.

The service gets 0 stars.  Twice in one week, both of the times we ordered to-go, the airhead waitresses forgot our sides (a salad one time, and veggies another time).  When I called, they suggested I go all the way back and pick it up!  Since I was at home, they told me they'd give me a $2 credit!   After these 3 horrible experiences (not to mention the bad food on prior occassions that I just ignored), I finally spoke to a manager, Eric, who offered me a dessert to cover it all!

My DC and I came on a Sunday ~2pm, so most of the brunch rush was actually over and there were lots of empty tables. Still, it was nearly 45 mins. before our food finally arrived! Service was okay, but it would have been nice if someone popped by to reassure us that the food would be coming eventually. At one point, we got worried they forgot our order, as the table next to us (another table of 2) had sat down after us, yet got their food, ate, and paid their bill all before we had our first bites! 

/rant

Otherwise, Bestellen would be a winner for brunch. Lots of seating, atmospheric (gotta love the meat-inspired art work on the back wall and the large fridge with meat on display across from the bar), interesting menu and killer brunch cocktails. I had the homemade biscuit smothered in sausage gravy and served with fluffy scrambled eggs and collard greens. The gravy was amazing... Total comfort food. The collard greens were just a tad too salty, but I tend to like things less salty than the average person. Portions were huge and I couldn't finish my plate, even with my DC helping out! I also had the Red Rooster - a mix of gin, strawberry, basil, and ginger. Delicious!! DC had the corned beef, which he scarfed down. Their ketchup is homemade and has a nice kick to it. They also have great hot sauce - kinda sweet. I'm not sure what kind it is or if they make it in house. They brought it out in a tiny dish. 

I would give Bestellen another chance and come back to try their dinner options. It also looks like a nice place for drinks. There is a pretty long list of bourbons and whiskey's on the wall, as well as lots of wine. 

Other than improving their timing/efficiency, my only other advice to Bestellen would be to switch up their music selection. Rustic interior, hearty comfort food, and... ""Baby Boy"" by Beyonce ft. Sean Paul? Something doesn't match...!",2012-09-18 02:48:07

Not since my tour of Texas have I had brisket this good. We tried most of the barbecue offerings (weekends only for everything) and were pretty surprised with how great everything was! Aside from the incredible melt-in-your-mouth perfectly smoked Texas style brisket (served with Texas style sause!), the chicken was moist and tender with a subtle smokiness, the ribs were good and the freshly smoked sausage is something dangerous.

It's the small things; served with sliced pickles, (pickled) onions, and pickled jalapeños and white bread slices on the side, plus a variety of table side sauces make Aft a must try for anyone who even remotely likes the idea of cooked food. I can't wait to try the sous-vide steak and smoked chicken wings...

Disclaimer: I know the Pitmaster, but that's what makes this even more surprising - I've known him in his other career (the film business) so I had no idea he was capable of such truly great barbecue.

I ordered the jerk chicken wrap (regular size) with a side of grilled veggies. You can get the wrap on a white or wholewheat pita and you can get the grilled veggies mild or spicy. Naturally I got mine spicy. You get a free beverage when you order a wrap and side. Good deal!

The jerk chicken wrap was a tidy little bundle of chicken, finely diced veggies, sauce, and seasonings. The veggies were grilled onions, peppers, and zucchini, They had great char and the Shombo spices were fantastic! It was all so good. 

When I first felt the weight of the bag, I thought, ""There's no way this is going to fill me up,"" but that's because I have a man-sized appetite. I finished my wrap first and I was pretty satisfied, but not satiated. The very delicious veggies brought me all the way and more to satiation. That is a good sized meal. If you just want a wrap without a side, I would recommend the large size rather than the regular. 

The spice on the jerk chicken wrap was more warming than hot on the tongue. If you're a spicehead, you'd probably put the spice level at about a 3 out of 10. If you're a spicewimp, it's probably more like a 5 out of 10. The spice on the veggies is probably about a 4.5 for spiceheads and 7.5 for spicewimps.

We actually waited for almost 20 minutes to be seated.  Our service was okay.  Greeted by the server offering us a taste of chardonnay that we passed on.  We ordered stuffed mushrooms.  I think they were alright.  They came out hot and although they were salty and nothing special, they were not bad.  All you can eat salad came with mine and the bread sticks of course.  Salad was hideous and full of vinegar.  Just a bunch of light green lettuce with just alright stuff thrown in.  Bread sticks were warm and alright.  Jerome ordered a Caesar salad and the guy said it'd be ""like a dollar more"" for substitution.  It was the same as the all you can eat salad but with mayo instead of the vinegar.  YUCK again.  Boxed croutons and fake cheese.  

I ordered shrimp Caresse.  Jerome ordered braised ribs.  ILK!  Both of them were so yuck.  The ribs were fatty and not flavorful.  They were tasteless and awful.  The sauce was not reduced and it tasted like beef bouillon and cheap red wine.  The rice was alright but again, that beef bouillon salty flavor.  There were some green beans on top that I ate.  They were fine.

The shrimp on my plate were undercooked.  The angel hair pasta was fine.  But as I ate, I was reminded of Ra men Noodles.  Instead of beef bouillon they gave me chicken.  The tomatoes in mine were fine.

We got our check and it was $49.something!  I can't believe it!  We eat out a lot and usually, it comes to 50 or 60 bucks at places like that.  What a rip.  I kept thinking that it was alright that the food sucked because it is cheap.  It wasn't even cheap.

It would be alright if you were looking for a cheap fast food burger, but the price implies it's much more.  The bacon cheeseburger is $6, fries are $5, drinks over $2.  The burger is over-cooked and a bit on the dry side.  They use some kind of runny goo they call ""cheese"" but is pretty nasty both in flavor and consistency.  I do have to say the ingredients like tomato, lettuce, and onions were fresh.  The bread is fresh but ultra-generic grocery store quality.  Low on flavor and just boring.

The fries are excellent, but for $5 they better be.  They are the thick soft style, so if you don't like that style, you won't like these.  I do like them and they were good, just not quite $5 good.  The burger disappointment really took the enjoyment out of the fries.

I've been to this location many times for both lunch and dinner. Their regular menu is huge but the lunch buffet has limited options. I'm giving them 3 stars for my whole experience over the course of several visits. 
The food here is mediocre. It's not the freshest seafood but it's better than what you get from standard Chinese buffet lines. The lunch buffet food quality is also better but still what you'd expect from a buffet. There are various rolls piled high, several of them are fried. But you're not always sure what you're getting - you can see raw tuna, raw salmon, cream cheese, imitation crab and avocado. Everything else is pretty mysterious. Grab tongs, take one of each and roll the dice! The second part of the buffet is hot and cold foods - miso soup with no tofu, scallions or seaweed to be found. Fried calamari that's tough and oily. The salad is 99% iceberg lettuce but the ginger dressing makes up for It. The other items aren't really worth mentioning. 
The dinner time is usually packed. I think the appeal is that they have so many cheap sushi options. You get your fill for a fraction of what It would cost elsewhere. For a cheap date to satisfy a sushi craving, this place hits the spot. But if you're wanting great fresh sushi - go elsewhere.",2018-07-11 18:30:29

I came here for Winterlicious this past Thursday and this place was packed! With only one server for the night. I remember I came in and there was no one to greet us so we just stood there awkwardly waiting for someone to come to us. The server saw us and I told him I had made a reservation for winterlicious. And he just looked at me like I was foreign or something. Anyways, we were seated to our table which btw the tables are quite close to each other so you may or may not eavesdrop ;).

For our dinner, I ordered the fried catfish as an appetizer to start followed by the jerk BBQ chicken and the the fried plantain to finish. The fried catfish was good and I believe it's the same flouring for the fried okra as well. The jerk BBQ chicken was really good but a tad spicy for me and the fried plantain wasn't exactly fried and goes well with the vanilla ice cream. That dessert seemed to be the most popular choice. 

All in all, service was a bit weird and non existent because at first I didn't know who exactly was the server. And when I wanted to order I waved someone over who turned out to be a busser. Not sure if I'll go out of my way to visit Harlem again though.",2017-02-13 03:23:54

You cannot use the yelp discount on the lunch promotion. This is totally fair, since it's so inexpensive, but I just wanted to put it out there.

If you want rolls and rolls of sushi, do the ACYE option! I do feel like the menu is quite limited - lots of ""plain"" rolls. You can upgrade to fancier rolls, but we didn't. When you go for all you can eat, I don't want to upgrade, I just want what they have to offer. 

Like I mentioned, the rolls are very plain. They're all in a standard California roll set up - just with different meat/fish/veg inside. No fish on top, not really too much sauce on top. But, if that's what you're looking for, then this is great! I do think the fish quality was very nice, especially for the price.

The other items on the ACYE menu were different types of noodles, fried rice, egg rolls, gyoza, etc. The standard Asian appetizers. 

I enjoyed the lunch, I think it's a freakin' steal for the amount of food you can order... but I do wish they would expand their AYCE menu into something with more pizazz. Some other appetizers, a fancier type of roll or two...",2017-09-25 15:40:10

Since moving to Scottsdale 2 months ago, I have yet to find a good place to eat breakfast.

So 3PM cafe is a new Taiwanese tea house furnished heavily by Ikea items with snacks and minimal entrees. Teas are based off either black or green and then flavored accordingly and come in a fairly sized glass jar. Toppings include the usual such as boba and jelly, although at the moment they do not have jelly in stock. Everything is under $10 and you get a 10% discount with your UNLV ID. There is also free wifi, and I believe they're opened until 1AM?

Now the bad... The service definitely need works. Walking in my group went up to the registers to place an order, but was told to go to the table  to sit down and get our orders taken, although other people weren't turn down at the counter when ordering. Service was really awkward, and took multiple awkward looks with the wait staff to get our orders placed. Two egg and spam instant noodles($4.95) and a minced pork ($7.25) over rice took about 25 minutes to come out. Had to ask for silverware, kind of hard to eat instant noodles with a soup spoon haha. Food... needs to be revised. The two slices of spam were not even cut straight and the mince pork over rice.. well... was probably 90% rice and 10% minced pork, a bit pricey at $7.25. A third spam and egg instant noodle also came out for my friend who came late and never ordered one. 

Drinks came out at the same time even though they were ordered 10 minutes apart and came with the thick straws without plastic wrap, would not be a huge issue if it wasn't for two of the workers coughing in their hands, at least cough in your elbow. The guy making the drinks was also drinking the leftover from the drink mixer... I don't mind if you want the leftovers... but at least pour it into a cup? 

Overall organization is definitely needed for improvement, a POS system, and... sorry to say, but a review on the districts health card movie.

**EDIT**

I was contacted by someone who works there and they claim to of washed their hands after they coughed and only drink the leftovers to check on the taste, I didn't see, but its best to give them the benefit of the doubt.",2012-03-13 10:44:13

The food choices are wider than most Lebanese restaurants, offering more than the traditional menu offered everywhere. The quality is good and close to authentic, but since my previous visit, I had to change my opinion a little: 
First, after a long wait, I received my order first; I thought the other two are on the way. As a courtesy, I decided to wait for my friend's food to arrive. By the time it arrived (20 mns later!), my food was cold and I could not enjoy it. Not only that, but I ordered the Beef Shawarma, and to my shock, I see what looked like thin slices of steak, instead of shredded beef as it is traditionally (and the ONLY way) served. When I tried it, it did not even taste like shawarma; the spices were not even close to the real thing. I have to say I was very disappointed, especially that I had a good experience on my previous visit, and the owner/chef is Lebanese so there is no excuse for not knowing the proper way to serve shawarma as it is one of our iconic dishes. My friend who also ordered and loved the Soujouk last time ordered it again but this time it was not the same...I did not want to give a bad review because I know they will fix this, and the place, being new probably is still tweaking everything like any new business, Hopefully they will work on how to serve the shawarma properly if they want to claim to have authentic Lebanese cuisine. It would have been the right thing also to offer not to charge my order since both waitresses were aware that I could not enjoy my food being cold; I did not want to make a big deal of it, but any respectable restaurant would offer at least that or some alternative...
Also I read from another review that they take too long to bring the bread and the owner's answer was that it is because it is served fresh to order. In my opinion, the bread's freshness should not affect the service or quality of the food, so unless they can maintain the same quality and handle the pressure of traffic (which I hope they will have), then you can serve regular pre-made bread until then. Most restaurants do that and nobody complains, because it it the food quality and service that counts at the end; the fresh baked bread should only be an added bonus, but not at the expense of important things, because people will not go just for the bread but the overall experience, in my humble opinion.
One last thing:  food should NEVER be served that far apart; most people will not start eating unless everyone is ready, so this is more of an etiquette issue than quality of food. I personally would have preferred to wait the extra 20 mns and enjoy my food WITH my friends than to stare at it then eat it cold...
Despite everything, I still love the place and wish the owner all the luck; like every new business, it takes time to make everything perfect. that's why there are good and bad reviews, because this is how you improve. The servers are very friendly and I know the food is too in general, so I will definitely go back there and hope that this was a one-time experience and look forward for my next visit. (But PLEASE do not serve the shawarma like slices of steak; it is the whole point of shawarma! :) ). 
Sorry for the long review, I did not want to present a negative one without giving the place the credit it deserves in other areas, I cannot wait to go again soon and give a much better rating!!",2016-11-27 07:10:14

Usually I get the same server that just disappears, but during my most recent visit we went from patiently allowing our server to assume we didn't have anywhere to be on a Saturday to figuring out she had just pushed us aside to cater to others, because after my empty water glass sat on the edge of the table (long enough I had to stop eating because I was so thirsty) my wallet did too, and after ten minutes I pulled my credit card out and set that on top, and still waited as she checked on every other table but ours. I honestly don't care if she thought she was going to get a crap tip after the way we were treated (which I wouldn't do), the last thing a table wants is to be completely abandoned, especially in such a small space where you know she can see you!

When she did make it over with the check, even though something told me to look over it, in my rush I just handed her my card. Luckily, she had only charged us an extra dollar for the fries as making it to work on time was more important than getting the dollar taken off.

I think this is the closest Latino market I have in the Southwest. It's a 15 minute drive from my home so I normally take a long detour here when I'm driving home from work. 

Two great things about La Bonita, cheap produce and meat! 

I'm always able to score 3lbs of conventional bananas for $1, 2lbs of conventional apples for $1, etc. Two weeks ago I was able to get chicken drumsticks for $0.79 a pound, can't beat that, they have everything, from pork, chicken, beef, some marinated already. You can also find weird meat here such as cow tongue and chicken feet, yuck! The downside, you have to consume your produce fast. Quality is not as great as Von's which is my go to grocery store. My boys devour everything within a day or two so that's not a problem for us. 

They have a panaderia that makes tortillas there at the store, $1.99 for a big packet which is not bad, so I always pick up the tortillas here. The bolillo is cheap as well, normally 3 pieces for $1. The price of the sweet bread has gone up over the years, now you only get 2 pieces for $1. 

They have a small deli counter where you could pick up cheese, sour cream, and sandwich meats for a really decent price. Why buy the tub of Knudson sour cream when you can buy the tub that La Bonita just packaged for $1 less? They also have a dessert counter? Well, I'll call it that since you can buy flans, yogurt, and other goodies for your sweet tooth there. 

They have an eatery within the store but I've never eaten there, it doesn't really appeal to me. If you'd like anything else here such as household items like detergent, or food items like pasta, I wouldn't buy it here. Too overpriced. The only pasta that is cheap is the fideo which is normally 4 packets for $1.  

The cashiers are a little bit on the slow side but always very friendly, their customers, not so much. I always get the stinky eye when I'm here. Parking can be a bit of a hassle sometimes and the store seems more packed on weekends than late nights. Other than that, this store is A-Okay for me.",2015-01-08 21:52:19

Using everything from clusters of little tea light candle holders to an upturned wicker basket with a candle inside it, the lighting and atmosphere is warm and inviting. Booths and tables of all sizes are divided with wooden dividers and Japanese curtains for maximum intimacy. 

The chirashi, ($14.95) served with an appetizing little rice wine vinegar dressed green salad and fresh tofu miso soup, was the most unique and creative I've had...well, ever. Besides the usual sashimi slices of salmon, tuna, and tai, there were also warm saucy unagi slices and mini nigiri of spicy tuna mixed with crunchy tempura bits all laid out scrumptiously on a bed of sweet and vinegary warm rice. There was even a complimentary scoop of suspiciously fluorescent, yet satisfyingly mangoey ice cream at the end of the meal. 

The service was impeccable. Lengthy conversations with a steady stream of regulars coming by to pick up take away as well as directions for me were conducted in broken, but sincere English. I was able to devour my courses hurriedly with the aid of my most helpful server, but would highly suggest that you visit Samjung Sushi for a nice intimate dinner instead.",2009-06-24 19:33:51

Beware, put your name on the list because there's gonna be a wait. This joint is crazy popular and for good reason. It's a sizable place but they fill up fast; when we drove by, there were a ton of people waiting outside to be seated. Luckily our friend had our name on the list so we only had about a 15 minute wait by the time we arrived.

They're pretty accommodating of young families, there were a few people with babies and strollers and there's a bit of a stroller parking lot at the front. Took us a bit of finagling to figure out how we were gonna get the stroller parked so it wasn't in the way but we managed. For me, the tables here are a bit too crammed together, especially since its always full. We arrived in time for a 2:30PM lunch and it didn't quiet down by the time we left an hour later.

We all ended up going for the taco stand tacos, you get to pick any two on the menu. I went with one of the daily specials, the pork belly, and the tavarua tuna tacos (""Blackened lemon rubbed tuna in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, stuffed with avocado, mixed greens, tomato, cheese, & topped w/ honey wasabi sauce""). We got nachos and corn salsa to snack on while we waited for our tacos. Honestly, not a fan of the corn salsa, not sure what the hype is about but I wasn't a big fan and would pass next time. The chips aren't anything special - we're used to Lone Star (Canadian mexican chain) and they give you fresh fried chips which really really make the difference.

I couldn't believe how fast the tacos came out after we ordered! My hubby got pork belly and the steak and really enjoyed his, he said the steak was almost better outside of the taco, well seasoned and properly cooked. Mine were both good, but the tavarua tacos were a bit on the spicy side for me so I wouldn't get them again. The pork belly was TO DIE FOR. So delicious, some kind of sweet honey sauce on them, I could have eaten five of those. I regretted not trying any of the deep fried tacos, if we go back I'll make a point of trying those.

My main issue with this place is that the whole experience felt really rushed. It's a busy place and its popular for a reason. But I really felt like I didn't get to truly enjoy my food because it was so hustle bustle. With the tables being as close together as they were and people passing us by in the aisles and rubbing up against my chair and that kind of thing, it really interfered with my enjoyment of the experience.

Overall, a really good spot to stop in and try if you're in Charlotte or passing through. The neighbourhood is cute, so even if you end up with a wait, you can wander around the neighbourhood and check out the shops and whatnot. We'll be back the next time we're in the state and see what else they've got to offer.",2017-04-01 23:46:03

The taco tasted like the shell was stale and the borracho beans tasted like they were cooked pinto beans on which someone had poured beer and served. The fried potatoes were really mushy & oily and salty.

First, they replaced the long menu board near the entrance to a smaller and easier to read electronic menu screen. Some menu items such as the combos have been removed and some new items have been added, mostly appetizers and salads. Simply choose your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, or tofu), size (small or large entree),  then your sauce, and then type of rice or noodle (white, brown, fried, etc). I don't come here much and I always forget what I got last time, so I just choose what sounds good. I've had all different entrees here and seem to usually go with Pei Wei spicy, orange peel, sesame or spicy Korean. This time around I decided to try sweet and sour chicken with a cup of Thai wonton soup. The wonton soup is nice and light, and the sweet and sour chicken was good but they tend to oversauce their entrees so if you're sensitive to that, be sure to tell them when ordering. The small entree size was perfect and I typically have a hard time finishing a large size, but it's only 2 bucks more.

They also removed the old skool soda fountain and installed a Coca Cola Freestyle machine on one side of the self service counter and a water/ice machine on the other side. The seating is all the same and if you're dining in, you simply grab your seat after grabbing your drinks and they'll bring your order out to you when it's ready, which isn't very long and they'll pick up your empty plates when you're done. Silverware, boxes, drinks, sauces and fortune cookies are all self service here.

I ordered my typical BBH (Bun Bo Hue). Certainly not the best I've had, but by the time I reached the bottom of the bowl, I concluded that I really enjoyed it. The broth had a definite fish sauce aroma at first. Fortunately, that didn't translate into being too salty. The one thing I usually don't enjoy about BBH is that the noodles are larger and more slippery. Pho 88's BBH noodles were easy to pick up and slurp.

So my quick review is that if you enjoyed Pho Annie, you'll enjoy Pho 88. The advantage is that this location is much bigger and more open. (Annie used to get pretty full).",2017-12-06 17:01:01

It goes a little something like this: Chinese food has Indian influences, Thai food has Muslim influences, Indian food has Chinese influences and somewhere in that hodgepodge is a little Indonesian and something like that. 

To the novice, this might seem like just another Asian food joint. To the veteran eater, it's so much more. Now the food might look similar, but I can assure you, it tastes completely different.

Today I got to take a baseball bat to the temple twice in one day!
I had to spend quality time with my accountant and more of the same with my health insurance agent...just one of those mornings.
I needed to treat myself, although after a visit with my business friends, I somehow felt it needed to be an inexpensive treat.
My insurance agent is just north of Lucky Boy and that's where I went for my late lunch. I needed a scotch, and a Lucky Boy burger may not be the next best thing, but it's pretty damn good.
I had not been here since last fall, but it really never changes (at least not since I came to AZ). 
They just make a good, simple burger. There aren't any tricks (no butter flavored whatever on the buns). The fries are crunchy outside and fluffy inside. The buns are soft, but hold together well and the meat is charred, but not crusty and overdone.
Are there better burgers in the Phoenix area?...I'd have to say yes. Are there better drive-thru burgers in Phoenix?...I don't think so.

Where to begin, where to begin...

First:   Name -   SPICY PICKLE -  A W E S O M E  S A U C E.

All you ass hats that don't like the name, don't fucking eat here.  Hey, I'm not a pickle fan either, but that doesn't stop me deep throating their sammiches. (insert gay joke here).  They could'a called the place ""Red Hot Fermented Cucumber"".  Yeah, that's nice...

FYI,  They also have a table that resembles a pickle;  not just shaped like pickle, but RESEMBLES a god damn, translucent green Mother effin' pickle. Gigity.    

Second:    Food    -    The first time I ate here, I had a turkey samich with some corn on it and some mildly spicey salsa.  It didn't create the euphoric mexican high I had hoped for, but I remember thinking ""damn that is one freshly made sammy""  Fresh...  F - R - E - S - H.   No, none of that ""Subway, eat fresh"" crapola, I mean fresh like they may have a veggie garden in the back and or a little chicken coop on the roof.  The bad larry did manage to give my tummy a workout later, if you catch my drift, but I'd still eat here again (and again (and again)), it's not like it was Chipotle's carnitas burrito...

I've also thad the pleasure of masticating their italian sammy;  chalk full o' meaty, cheesy goodness.   mmmmm, meat and cheese, on warm, grilled bread.. Wait, didn't I I read someone elses SP review about the bread being too hard to chew? WTF is that about?  I here-by offer my services as  ""step in chewer"" to any sally who can't handle the SP's pannini bread.   

Conclusion:  - This place is bitchen.  The service has always been excellent, and the food has consistently been the same, delish,satisfying fair that keeps a fat, white mo-fo like me comming back for more, and the restaurant itself is a pleasure to eat in.

The pizzas are just the way they should be, nice flavorful crust, good quality cheese and sauce, and premium toppings.

This isn't fancy pizza, it's just good solid pizza done right. 

Coming from Philly I like my pizza a certain way and this place always delivers. 

The wings are great! I love the texture, and the sauce ranges from a nice mild to a pretty darn hot! No veggies with the wings, but that's cool. I've also had the Pepperoni Roll & Calzones, and they are delicious! The dough is hand tossed, everything is cooked to order, and everything tastes great!

It's a beautiful restaurant, with a quaint 1950's glamor and style to it.  There is a complimentary valet parking, and there's a waiting room was plush with beautiful and immaculate furniture.  The host was very nice, and we were seating almost immediately.  

The table was just the right size for our party of 6.  The waitress was a mature lady, dressed nicely, and was to be addressed as Mrs. Tremble, as she informed us.  She was very explanatory in all the aspects of their unique restaurant, and kindly offered us our drinks after a brief pause, giving us just enough time to consider what to order.  

The service was very prompt, and the drinks were served nicely in beautiful glassware.  At some restaurants, the service sort of deteriorates if we don't order such things as appetizers, but Mrs. Tremble was gracious in everything we ordered and everything we didn't.  

They started first with their famous spinning salad.  It was nothing short of stunning, and it was worth coming for just that.  Next they served the prime rib, sliced fresh at the table.  My cut was served perfectly at medium rare, and I had an order of the creamed spinach, which in my opinion wasn't quite as creamed as I'd have liked, but still really good.   The mashed potatoes were delicious, but not the best I've ever had.  The centerpiece here is clearly the prime rib, and here it did not disappoint.  

The occasion was my brother's graduation from high school, and when the reservation was made, they asked immediately what the occasion was.  And after the meal was over, my brother was given a complimentary dessert, with ""Congratulations"" on the plate.  

I'd highly recommend Lawry's for any special occasion, though it might be a little bit pricey to go without an occasion.  Give it a shot, but expect to pay a little under $50 a person.",2008-06-14 08:01:08

I don't live particularly close to this location. EOS has a new location opening on Russell and Pecos, which is closer to me, so I pre-enrolled there. The customer service at the enrollment center for the Pecos gym was sub par and instructions were confusing considering that they are not even opening for a couple more months.

That's where EOS Centennial saves the day! I went down this morning and was assisted by Preston who had reached out to me about starting my own membership. I took it as a sign and went down there. Preston provided 10x better service than the Pecos location and got me set up quickly. He was personable and interested in my goals. I got an even better deal on my membership than I did at Pecos and instructions were clearer. I was very happy about that and the staff made a good first impression.

I have been a member at every other major gym in town, you name it: 24 hour, LVAC, and Planet Fitness. I was never satisfied before, but EOS provides me with what I've been searching for for so long and for a very affordable price: lots of cardio equipment, a diverse variety of weights, pool, sauna, classes, a cinema room, and with my Gold Plus membership, I get to bring a guest to motivate me!

It's a cool place.  If you don't know what to get, ask the dude working at the register what you're into and you'll leave the store with an obscure comic you've never heard of but in the end are glad you finally learned about it.

I bought two comics... one, a comedic, indie masterpiece called The Fart Party, which I thought was the FRAT Party until I got home.  I'm glad it's fart because I don't like frats much, but farting is normal, human and appeals to my inner immaturity.  The second comic I bought was called Dogs & Water which is a surreal journey into I don't even know what the fuck.  It was awesome, though.

It's great to browse, too.

Started with the cheese plate which is four cheeses selected by the chef for the day, meaning the plate could always change offering something new. The app came with sliced apples, bread, pear jam, grapes and walnuts to pair your cheeses with. All quite tasty! I ordered the steak flatbread which was actually sirloin cooked mid rare (upon my request) and topped with blue cheese crumbles and a vinegarette reduction. The flavors mixed absolutely perfectly and the flatbread was topped with plenty of steak, no skimping here. The boy ordered a burger, noted to be a blend of porterhouse and brisket - also a winner! Tasted amazing and we were both highly pleased. 

We topped off our night with two flights of beer - for $5 you pick 4 - 4 ounce samples. Works for me! The atmosphere was also highly noted! They have several lounge areas where red couches could fit in 6 to 9 people and have TVs around it, perfect for a girls' night out and a chill evening with friends. Harry's has one area more secluded - best for a date night or a dinner with family. And they also have an area separated by a half wall, closer to the bar, if you are looking for more of a lively, bar type night.

Bobby Q is the love child of Sin City Wings and Ben's BBQ (which is actually now owned by the same Sin City crew). It is a beautiful baby!

We stopped in during their soft open phase, so there were still some minor kinks to be worked out, but the passion behind Bobby Q will definitely make everything right. We sampled some wings (the same fine creations featured at Sin City Wings). The size of the wings are what you pray for, and the execution isn't heavily breaded, but still has a satisfactory crunch. Plus, they have a wide selection of creative sauces. 

The sauce is kind of the boss here because Bobby loves whipping up creations to go with just about everything, so always ask for a side of something!

I had the pulled pork sandwich, and although my personal preference would be for a smaller, softer bun (even if that means having meat overflowing onto the plate) and a helping of pickles, the meat was definitely tender and full of smoke. 

As for the key lime pie in a jar, it does make it a bit of a challenge to get the perfect bite of key lime and crust, but the overall flavor is what key lime dreams are made of. It had my husband asking, ""Are they from Florida?"" In his mind, all great key lime pies are born there.

It literally came with burnt chorizo and peppers on top. The forgot to add the salsa, the sour cream, and the grilled pepper on the side. It looked nothing like the omelettes i've ordered in the post or the picture on the menu. 

I tired to flag down the waiter but was ignored. I got up to grab my own menu to compare the thing on my plate with the item I ordered. I finally got the waiters attention and pointed the picture out to him. He assured me that it was what I ordered. I pointed out that the salsa and sour cream where not present along with the grilled pepper (which I wouldnt have eaten anyway). He tried to claim that the salsa was absorbed into the omelette. And that they just forgot the sour cream and pepper. I had to argue with him before he went to the kitchen to get me ""more"" salsa. 

A bit later I asked for more napkins which he never brought.

Kudos for being open until 4am everyday and having a reverse happy hour! That's probably the best thing this place has going for it.

Everything about this establishment was just average, or slightly below. The atmosphere is nice, certainly interesting. The main dining area resembles a grotto with some Wayland looking murals here and there and a starry roof that could entertain you for quite a while if you're easily amused.. as I am.

Service was friendly and the waiter kept my iced green tea full, but I was being checked on by two different waiters and eventually it was the busser who brought my check. Good team work?

The sushi was not very good. I had several varieties of nigiri which were all average with the exception of the albacore (mushy, grainy) and the ono which was waterlogged. Their spicy tuna roll is of the chunky variety, whereas I prefer the pate style. It was barely spicy enough and left a funk in my mouth for a while afterwards.

As excited as I was to find a sushi place near me that was open until 4am.. it didn't satisfy the craving in the least, and unfortunately I won't be back here. I'd rather make the drive across town to go to another sushi place where the last seating for AYCE is 2am.. I think you know who I speak of.",2011-07-09 10:59:32

1. The patio set is falling apart and aside from the bench that they had installed, isn't very enjoyable. Underneath the metal tops is a wooden material that is decaying and crumbling because of the rain. The tables are also very wobbly.

2. The wifi can be annoying and there have been stretches of weeks without reliable wifi. I don't plan on working out of Crema for hours, but the times I do work I would like the wifi to either but  on or off, not activated with me unable to connect.

3. The music can be too loud and energetic. I'm fine with some music playing in the background, but some days I go in and it's as loud as a club that also happens to sell coffee.

Don't get me wrong the food is good - but with so many options for truly excellent Italian food, pizza, pasta -  you have to have something else that draws you in to Mark Rich's. I love Ellen and Kristin! They are truly funny, witty, and service oriented. Plus it's close to home. This is just a fun place to enjoy your food when you don't feel like going too far.

My favorite item is the eggplant parmesan with a side salad. I am not elated by the pasta. It is often overcooked or undercooked. The ""Works"" pizza is good. On Tuesday, you can enjoy a free medium cheese pizza when you order a large pizza. Tuesday's used to be my standard time to visit Ellen - but she moved to Wednesday's and now I don't come in as frequently. Kristin only works weekends - and that is usually when I hit the town in search of new restaurants I have bookmarked on my Yelp page.

Yes....this course can be frustrating if you are not a straight hitter off the tee.  Thankfully, I hit it straight 90% of the time so I can see my ball on the fairway or find it on the 1st cut.

It is immaculately cared for.

#12 is my favorite.  Probably because (for some odd reason) I either par or birdie that hole...

I don't know how this place would fit into my social life. I've never seen it a full house, so its not good for people-watching. Its alright for an overpriced cocktail, but its too far away from home to be my corner bar. I paid $14 for two Tanqueray and tonics. Its a nice low key place to have a drink if you're in the neighborhood. 

I think they had happy hour from 10p to 1a. We ordered our first round at 950p and later ordered two more rounds and an appetizer. We didn't get any discount. 

They have a small menu with dumplings ($7-8) and fried rice and a lot of Portugese-influenced dishes, like Carne de Porco with Green Beans ($13), as Macau was colonized by the Portugese. 

I think the bartender was saying something about the joint being built right around the time the whole no smoking in establishments that serve food law was being passed, so they came up with an agreement to outsource food from the ""Korean restaurant next door"" (I believe he was referring to Dae Jang Keum or DJK). Its convenient for them because they don't have to worry about kitchen health codes and pay for all of the equipment and worry about taking up precious bar stool space with a kitchen. But it took longer then it should've for my friend to get her steamed pork dumplings. And the bartender didn't seem that knowledgeable about the foods. ""Everything that I've tried is good.""

m7L_OfOgsoplpgHWhfv5eQ,bfCyqpNNOL0tO5TmlHOxAQ,UT9KnZ288uwsz4pxzUVzIQ,3,2,0,1,"I first visited this mall, opened on August 24, 1961 to the public hailed as the first air-conditioned mall in Phoenix as Chris-Town Mall, back in the late 1970s when my mother moved us here.  My Nana used to take me shopping and buy me an ice cream cone ;)   The original developer purchased some land owned by local farmer Chris Harri in the late 1950s.  Anchor stores were JC Penney, Korrick's, Woolworth, and Montgomery Wards.  Not only was this a shopping mall, it was also a social mall where it used to have Friday night dances in the 1960s to having visiting vendors setting up booths promoting whatever they were promoting- notably the ROSOSO (Reach Out Speak Out Sign Out) where I had a booth (2x's in the mid-90s) under that banner promoting Hearing Ear Assistance Dogs for the hearing-impaired with my Shih Tzu dog, Beau, sitting at my booth ;)  Such a fun memory.  Along the way, there were sand castles, the ""man with the monkey"" who used to take coins from your hand and tapped it as a thank-you, and also the ""handicapped man"" (who probably had advanced scoliosis) who used to sit by Miracle Mile (daily??) with his coffee mug situated next to him.  Finally, what about the birds swooping in the main entrance?  They were likely attracted to the indoor themed Courtyards (that had names: Court of Fountains (by JC Penney), Court of Flowers (Korrick's), and Court of Birds (Wards)).  All the social events, sand castles, and original Mall stables are now GONE.  Around the turn of the new century, the Mall languished for years until a new developer took over and (unfortunately though) mangled the original design for a more sterilized look, thus attracting the less-desirable patrons and shoppers.  The Mall is now called Christown Spectrum (used to be Spectrum Mall but adjusted to avoid confusion or even resentment from loyalists) with Walmart, Costco, and JCPenney as anchors, along with some junky kiosks and ghetto-like stores dotting the Mall.  Cobblestone floor is now clinic-tiled and what was a Janitor's Closet (bar) downstairs is now paved over.  Even the strip mall south of the mall that housed Tower Records and ABCO were completely demolished to make way for a Metro Rail parking lot.  I even mentioned that the vacant / open spot that used to house UA Cinemas, Farrell's, and eventual food court should convert into an indoor pet park(!)  And, I hope they bring back the trees and that the birds make a comeback and Pizza d'amore and ummm...and, IF the birds came back, I'll forgive the current Mall...
I SO MISS the original Chris-Town ""Mall"" and the olden days!!  I wonder what Mr. Harri is thinking from his grave.  I only stop by when necessary if I needed to get something from JC Penney or Target.  It's now a place to GET something, NOT shop/browse/hang with your family, friends, or even to entertain your out-of-town folks(no way, Jose)...
I am kindly giving this 3 stars, mainly for the memories and good times the Mall had provided and well, there is a JC Penney and Target and (something) that helped the neighborhood from further decline.  Therefore, 2 stars would be too harsh, right?
The Mall will be celebrating its 55th birthday on September 24, 2016 in 1960s kitsch from 12-3 PM http://www.co-opweb.com/emails/christown/newsletters/july-2016/consumer-index.html.  I have my Yelp Events page about it.  Come and attend and lend support.  I  may be there ;)  See you!  (And, if I did make it, I'll update on Yelp ;) )

Update on Chris Harri, a little-known fact for those who have been curious about him, from Christown's official website: ""Christown Spectrum was named after Chris Harri, a Swiss farmer who moved to the valley in 1904. Harri, a local legend who died in 1971, owned and farmed 360 acres in what is now north central Phoenix, including the site where the mall now sits.""",2016-08-06 19:01:17

They were very accommodating.  I got there early before everyone else in my group got there just so I can make sure everything was on point.  I was looking at their great selection of wines then Rhonda took me to our table.  The view of the lake was just too gorgeous and that was the start of a great dinner.

Our server last night was Jim and he did a fantastic job.  He made good food and wine recommendations.  He told us that they were celebrating their 5th anniversary under their current management and they gave us complimentary champagne.

I had a strong craving for beef the whole day yesterday and so I got the steak frites eventhough I really wanted to try the parsley and lobster roe tagliatelle - there's always a next time.  The steak frites was good.  The rest of the group had the charcuterie plate, crab cake and risotto...yum!  For dessert we had the coffee and doughnuts (beignets lightly dusted with powdered sugar with chicory dipping sauce) - they're nice and warm bite-size pieces that taste similar to Cafe du Monde's beignets minus the thick coating of powdered sugar.  We also had creme brulee, chocolate mousse trio and bread pudding with rum sauce.  Delightful!

We were there for 3 hours.  The timing of when each course was served was just right.  It allowed us to talk and laugh (a lot), rest and digest.  I believe that a nice dinner is meant to be enjoyed and not rushed.  If you're in a hurry, you could always go somewhere else.  But if you're surrounded by people you like and want a nice meal then, Marche Bacchus is the place for you.",2012-10-16 16:27:25

The total bill came to about $10 less than their original quote, and the price seemed reasonable given my past experience with other shops. The shop was pretty clean and the service was professional and straightforward.  I can't really fault these folks for anything, though there shop is relatively small with limited capacity of just a couple bays. In spite of the fact that I arrived to drop off my vehicle within a few minutes of them opening, I still had to park down the street and walk, as the small number of parking spaces in front of the shop were already full. They called about 2:45 to say my car was done and ready for pickup, which was earlier than I expected, so they appear to be handling their brisk volume of business pretty well.  I'll definitely call these guys again when my car needs work.",2015-05-31 00:23:39

1) They have a sizable dance floor and as a country music fan I often quite enjoy their music.
2) Since their dance floor is already big enough they often leave the high top tables in the bar area. During a night out in the Epicentre it is great to find somewhere you can dance and take a break to sit down (without shelling out ridiculous amounts of money for a VIP table). 
3) Great outdoor space with tables where you can sit and people watch the lower levels of the Epicentre.
4) They have a bull! Now that Bar Charlotte has closed I believe they are the only location in Uptown with a bull to ride. Most of the time it is free to ride. I love to mix up a night out with something different.
5) Efficiency - they've been the check in spot for several events I have attended in the city. They always make the process as quick as possible. The same for the bar staff - even though it gets overwhelmingly busy the bartenders are always able to send out drinks at a great pace.

I am not much for clubbing or going out in the city any more but when I do this is a location I like to include.",2016-11-02 18:55:05

Whether I'm in Markham or in Aurora, I always seem to gravitate toward Panera. The dessert lunches are delicious but the bagels are even better. On Tuesdays, they do Baker's Dozen and you can get 13 bagels for the price of 12. While it's not a huge special promo, an extra bagel is always a good idea. They're cream cheese is also very good. 

My lunch go-to is usually the pick 2! You can choose two items on the menu for a cheaper price. The Mac & Cheese and a soup are my usuals but I'm really loving the summer corn chowder right now. In the winter, I'm about the broccoli  and cheese soup! Also the steak sandwich is another great choice! 

Whether you're eating in or taking it to go, this is a great spot to grab a delicious and healthy lunch, dinner or breakfast! It's pricier than Tim's or McD but sometimes you just gotta treat yo self!",2018-06-12 21:46:38

Our server and the food ,although not my style, was also good. 

The only negative part of my experience was the way I saw an employee get treated by a manager. We saw a manager yelling at this waitress more than once near our table for no reason. All of the employees seemed to have a general fear of this woman, and it was very awkward and noticeable. My friends and I have all worked for restaurants and we were appalled. I will not be coming back to El Paso. Mainly because I don't enjoy BBQ, but also because our eating experience was ruined by a manager. How Ironic.",2007-07-20 06:20:20
